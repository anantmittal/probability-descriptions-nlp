Keep on reading to learn all about the probability of extraterrestrial life.    By  Jason Marshall, PhD,     The Math Dude        December 16, 2016                       Episode #295   Page 1 of 3 In 1967, a graduate student named Jocelyn Bell discovered something strange emanating from a region of the sky known as the Summer Triangle: pulses of radio waves repeating every 1.3373 seconds over and over again like a clock ticking slightly-slowly. It’s not every day that you find a nearly perfect clock ticking at you from the sky, so Bell and her colleagues half-jokingly called the source of the signal “LGM1”—the “LGM” being short for “Little Green Men.” We now know that this signal wasn’t from little green anythings, but was instead from a previously undiscovered type of object known as a pulsar. This was exciting, although perhaps not quite as exciting as finding aliens. A decade later, an even stranger signal fell upon a different radio telescope. This signal was unusual in many ways: it was very strong, it didn’t look like any known naturally occurring radio signal, and it seemed to be coming from “out there” (and not here on Earth). The signal was so striking that its discoverer famously wrote the word “Wow!” on the margin of a printout of the data. After ruling out obvious Earthly origins, most astronomers are convinced that the signal came from somewhere beyond Earth. The question—which still remains unanswered—is where? And from what or whom? Was the signal produced by a natural phenomena? Or might it have been broadcast by some alien intelligence? The answer to the last question is: Probably not; but maybe. Although whether or not the “Wow!” signal was alien in origin, many scientists do think that alien life is likely to be out there. And they kind of have some math to back them up. Why only kind of ? Because as we’re about to find out, at this point questions about extraterrestrial life lead to back-of-the-envelope calculations and a hefty dose of probabilities—and those probabilities are anything but certain. Stellar Statistics  So what exactly does math say about the odds that we share the universe with other intelligent life? Let’s begin with the statistics of stars and planets. All life on Earth originated on a planet, and scientists think that most other independent origins of life (if they exist) probably did the same. For various reasons, I’ll let Everyday Einstein explain someday, scientists think that life usually gets going on planets orbiting not-too-big-and-not-too-small stars similar to the Sun.        Astronomers estimate that there are roughly 100 billion of these Sun-like Goldilocks stars in our galaxy. Something like half of these live their lives orbiting one or more other stars, which makes it far less likely that they’ll have planets around them (since those planets get flung out of the system by the stars). This cuts the number of hospitable stars in half, but this is still roughly 50 billion potential life-hosting stars in our galaxy!

Credit: Albert Ziganshin / Shutterstock.com     Many other planets throughout the universe probably hosted intelligent life long before Earth did, a new study suggests.  The probability of a civilization developing on a potentially habitable alien planet would have to be less than one in 10 billion trillion — or one part in 10 to the 22nd power — for humanity to be the first technologically advanced species the cosmos has ever known, according to the study.  "To me, this implies that other intelligent, technology-producing species very likely have evolved before us," said lead author Adam Frank, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Rochester in New York. [ 13 Ways to Hunt Intelligent Alien Life ]      Do you believe alien life exists elsewhere in the universe?       Yes - We may not have found them yet, but they're out there.         No - Aliens are just part of science fiction.         I'm not sure         Get Results  Share This    "Think of it this way: Before our result, you’d be considered a pessimist if you imagined the probability of evolving a civilization on a habitable planet was, say, one in a trillion," Frank said in a statement . "But even that guess — one chance in a trillion — implies that what has happened here on Earth with humanity has in fact happened about 10 billion other times over cosmic history."  In 1961, astronomer Frank Drake devised a formula to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations that may exist today in the Milky Way.  Adam Frank and co-author Woodruff Sullivan of the University of Washington were interested in the odds that intelligent aliens have ever existed anywhere in the universe. So they tweaked the famous Drake equation , coming up with an "archaeological version" that doesn't take into account how long alien civilizations may last.  Frank and Sullivan also incorporated observations from NASA's Kepler space telescope and other instruments, which suggest that about 20 percent of all stars host planets in the life-friendly, "habitable zone," where liquid water could exist on a world's surface.     The researchers then calculated the probability that Earth was the universe's first-ever abode for intelligent life, after taking into account the number of stars in the observable universe (about 20 billion trillion, according to a recent estimate).  "From a fundamental perspective, the question is, 'Has it ever happened anywhere before?'" Frank said. "Our result is the first time anyone has been able to set any empirical answer for that question, and it is astonishingly likely that we are not the only time and place that an advanced civilization has evolved."  But this doesn't mean that there are lots of intelligent aliens out there, just waiting to be contacted, the researchers stressed.  "The universe is more than 13 billion years old," Sullivan said in the same statement. "That means that even if there have been 1,000 civilizations in our own galaxy, if they live only as long as we have been around — roughly 10,000 years — then all of them are likely already extinct. And others won’t evolve until we are long gone. For us to have much chance of success in finding another 'contemporary' active technological civilization, on average they must last much longer than our present lifetime."  (The 10,000-year figure cited by Sullivan refers to humanity's development of agriculture and other "rudimentary" technologies; mankind has been capable of sending radio waves and other electromagnetic signals out into the cosmos for just a century or so.)

Note that there may be incorrect spellings, punctuation and/or grammar in this document. This is to allow correct pronunciation and timing by a speech synthesiser.   In this talk, I would like to speculate a little, on the development of life in the universe, and in particular, the development of intelligent life. I shall take this to include the human race, even though much of its behaviour through out history, has been pretty stupid, and not calculated to aid the survival of the species. Two questions I shall discuss are, 'What is the probability of life existing else where in the universe?' and, 'How may life develop in the future?' It is a matter of common experience, that things get more disordered and chaotic with time. This observation can be elevated to the status of a law, the so-called Second Law of Thermodynamics. This says that the total amount of disorder, or entropy, in the universe, always increases with time. However, the Law refers only to the total amount of disorder. The order in one body can increase, provided that the amount of disorder in its surroundings increases by a greater amount. This is what happens in a living being. One can define Life to be an ordered system that can sustain itself against the tendency to disorder, and can reproduce itself. That is, it can make similar, but independent, ordered systems. To do these things, the system must convert energy in some ordered form, like food, sunlight, or electric power, into disordered energy, in the form of heat. In this way, the system can satisfy the requirement that the total amount of disorder increases, while, at the same time, increasing the order in itself and its offspring. A living being usually has two elements: a set of instructions that tell the system how to sustain and reproduce itself, and a mechanism to carry out the instructions. In biology, these two parts are called genes and metabolism. But it is worth emphasising that there need be nothing biological about them. For example, a computer virus is a program that will make copies of itself in the memory of a computer, and will transfer itself to other computers. Thus it fits the definition of a living system, that I have given. Like a biological virus, it is a rather degenerate form, because it contains only instructions or genes, and doesn't have any metabolism of its own. Instead, it reprograms the metabolism of the host computer, or cell. Some people have questioned whether viruses should count as life, because they are parasites, and can not exist independently of their hosts. But then most forms of life, ourselves included, are parasites, in that they feed off and depend for their survival on other forms of life. I think computer viruses should count as life. Maybe it says something about human nature, that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. Talk about creating life in our own image. I shall return to electronic forms of life later on. What we normally think of as 'life' is based on chains of carbon atoms, with a few other atoms, such as nitrogen or phosphorous. One can speculate that one might have life with some other chemical basis, such as silicon, but carbon seems the most favourable case, because it has the richest chemistry. That carbon atoms should exist at all, with the properties that they have, requires a fine adjustment of physical constants, such as the QCD scale, the electric charge, and even the dimension of space-time. If these constants had significantly different values, either the nucleus of the carbon atom would not be stable, or the electrons would collapse in on the nucleus. At first sight, it seems remarkable that the universe is so finely tuned. Maybe this is evidence, that the universe was specially designed to produce the human race. However, one has to be careful about such arguments, because of what is known as the Anthropic Principle. This is based on the self-evident truth, that if the universe had not been suitable for life, we wouldn't be asking why it is so finely adjusted. One can apply the Anthropic Principle, in either its Strong, or Weak, versions. For the Strong Anthropic Principle, one supposes that there are many different universes, each with different values of the physical constants. In a small number, the values will allow the existence of objects like carbon atoms, which can act as the building blocks of living systems. Since we must live in one of these universes, we should not be surprised that the physical constants are finely tuned. If they weren't, we wouldn't be here. The strong form of the Anthropic Principle is not very satisfactory. What operational meaning can one give to the existence of all those other universes? And if they are separate from our own universe, how can what happens in them, affect our universe. Instead, I shall adopt what is known as the Weak Anthropic Principle. That is, I shall take the values of the physical constants, as given. But I shall see what conclusions can be drawn, from the fact that life exists on this planet, at this stage in the history of the universe. There was no carbon, when the universe began in the Big Bang, about 15 billion years ago. It was so hot, that all the matter would have been in the form of particles, called protons and neutrons. There would initially have been equal numbers of protons and neutrons. However, as the universe expanded, it would have cooled. About a minute after the Big Bang, the temperature would have fallen to about a billion degrees, about a hundred times the temperature in the Sun. At this temperature, the neutrons will start to decay into more protons. If this had been all that happened, all the matter in the universe would have ended up as the simplest element, hydrogen, whose nucleus consists of a single proton. However, some of the neutrons collided with protons, and stuck together to form the next simplest element, helium, whose nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons. But no heavier elements, like carbon or oxygen, would have been formed in the early universe. It is difficult to imagine that one could build a living system, out of just hydrogen and helium, and anyway the early universe was still far too hot for atoms to combine into molecules. The universe would have continued to expand, and cool. But some regions would have had slightly higher densities than others. The gravitational attraction of the extra matter in those regions, would slow down their expansion, and eventually stop it. Instead, they would collapse to form galaxies and stars, starting from about two billion years after the Big Bang. Some of the early stars would have been more massive than our Sun. They would have been hotter than the Sun, and would have burnt the original hydrogen and helium, into heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and iron. This could have taken only a few hundred million years. After that, some of the stars would have exploded as supernovas, and scattered the heavy elements back into space, to form the raw material for later generations of stars. Other stars are too far away, for us to be able to see directly, if they have planets going round them. But certain stars, called pulsars, give off regular pulses of radio waves. We observe a slight variation in the rate of some pulsars, and this is interpreted as indicating that they are being disturbed, by having Earth sized planets going round them. Planets going round pulsars are unlikely to have life, because any living beings would have been killed, in the supernova explosion that led to the star becoming a pulsar. But, the fact that several pulsars are observed to have planets suggests that a reasonable fraction of the hundred billion stars in our galaxy may also have planets. The necessary planetary conditions for our form of life may therefore have existed from about four billion years after the Big Bang. Our solar system was formed about four and a half billion years ago, or about ten billion years after the Big Bang, from gas contaminated with the remains of earlier stars. The Earth was formed largely out of the heavier elements, including carbon and oxygen. Somehow, some of these atoms came to be arranged in the form of molecules of DNA. This has the famous double helix form, discovered by Crick and Watson, in a hut on the New Museum site in Cambridge. Linking the two chains in the helix, are pairs of nucleic acids. There are four types of nucleic acid, adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thiamine. I'm afraid my speech synthesiser is not very good, at pronouncing their names. Obviously, it was not designed for molecular biologists. An adenine on one chain is always matched with a thiamine on the other chain, and a guanine with a cytosine. Thus the sequence of nucleic acids on one chain defines a unique, complementary sequence, on the other chain. The two chains can then separate and each act as templates to build further chains. Thus DNA molecules can reproduce the genetic information, coded in their sequences of nucleic acids. Sections of the sequence can also be used to make proteins and other chemicals, which can carry out the instructions, coded in the sequence, and assemble the raw material for DNA to reproduce itself. We do not know how DNA molecules first appeared. The chances against a DNA molecule arising by random fluctuations are very small. Some people have therefore suggested that life came to Earth from elsewhere, and that there are seeds of life floating round in the galaxy. However, it seems unlikely that DNA could survive for long in the radiation in space. And even if it could, it would not really help explain the origin of life, because the time available since the formation of carbon is only just over double the age of the Earth. One possibility is that the formation of something like DNA, which could reproduce itself, is extremely unlikely. However, in a universe with a very large, or infinite, number of stars, one would expect it to occur in a few stellar systems, but they would be very widely separated. The fact that life happened to occur on Earth, is not however surprising or unlikely. It is just an application of the Weak Anthropic Principle: if life had appeared instead on another planet, we would be asking why it had occurred there. If the appearance of life on a given planet was very unlikely, one might have expected it to take a long time. More precisely, one might have expected life to appear just in time for the subsequent evolution to intelligent beings, like us, to have occurred before the cut off, provided by the life time of the Sun. This is about ten billion years, after which the Sun will swell up and engulf the Earth. An intelligent form of life, might have mastered space travel, and be able to escape to another star. But otherwise, life on Earth would be doomed. There is fossil evidence, that there was some form of life on Earth, about three and a half billion years ago. This may have been only 500 million years after the Earth became stable and cool enough, for life to develop. But life could have taken 7 billion years to develop, and still have left time to evolve to beings like us, who could ask about the origin of life. If the probability of life developing on a given planet, is very small, why did it happen on Earth, in about one 14th of the time available. The early appearance of life on Earth suggests that there's a good chance of the spontaneous generation of life, in suitable conditions. Maybe there was some simpler form of organisation, which built up DNA. Once DNA appeared, it would have been so successful, that it might have completely replaced the earlier forms. We don't know what these earlier forms would have been. One possibility is RNA. This is like DNA, but rather simpler, and without the double helix structure. Short lengths of RNA, could reproduce themselves like DNA, and might eventually build up to DNA. One can not make nucleic acids in the laboratory, from non-living material, let alone RNA. But given 500 million years, and oceans covering most of the Earth, there might be a reasonable probability of RNA, being made by chance. As DNA reproduced itself, there would have been random errors. Many of these errors would have been harmful, and would have died out. Some would have been neutral. That is they would not have affected the function of the gene. Such errors would contribute to a gradual genetic drift, which seems to occur in all populations. And a few errors would have been favourable to the survival of the species. These would have been chosen by Darwinian natural selection. The process of biological evolution was very slow at first. It took two and a half billion years, to evolve from the earliest cells to multi-cell animals, and another billion years to evolve through fish and reptiles, to mammals. But then evolution seemed to have speeded up. It only took about a hundred million years, to develop from the early mammals to us. The reason is, fish contain most of the important human organs, and mammals, essentially all of them. All that was required to evolve from early mammals, like lemurs, to humans, was a bit of fine-tuning. But with the human race, evolution reached a critical stage, comparable in importance with the development of DNA. This was the development of language, and particularly written language. It meant that information can be passed on, from generation to generation, other than genetically, through DNA. There has been no detectable change in human DNA, brought about by biological evolution, in the ten thousand years of recorded history. But the amount of knowledge handed on from generation to generation has grown enormously. The DNA in human beings contains about three billion nucleic acids. However, much of the information coded in this sequence, is redundant, or is inactive. So the total amount of useful information in our genes, is probably something like a hundred million bits. One bit of information is the answer to a yes no question. By contrast, a paper back novel might contain two million bits of information. So a human is equivalent to 50 Mills and Boon romances. A major national library can contain about five million books, or about ten trillion bits. So the amount of information handed down in books, is a hundred thousand times as much as in DNA. Even more important, is the fact that the information in books, can be changed, and updated, much more rapidly. It has taken us several million years to evolve from the apes. During that time, the useful information in our DNA, has probably changed by only a few million bits. So the rate of biological evolution in humans, is about a bit a year. By contrast, there are about 50,000 new books published in the English language each year, containing of the order of a hundred billion bits of information. Of course, the great majority of this information is garbage, and no use to any form of life. But, even so, the rate at which useful information can be added is millions, if not billions, higher than with DNA. This has meant that we have entered a new phase of evolution. At first, evolution proceeded by natural selection, from random mutations. This Darwinian phase, lasted about three and a half billion years, and produced us, beings who developed language, to exchange information. But in the last ten thousand years or so, we have been in what might be called, an external transmission phase. In this, the internal record of information, handed down to succeeding generations in DNA, has not changed significantly. But the external record, in books, and other long lasting forms of storage, has grown enormously. Some people would use the term, evolution, only for the internally transmitted genetic material, and would object to it being applied to information handed down externally. But I think that is too narrow a view. We are more than just our genes. We may be no stronger, or inherently more intelligent, than our cave man ancestors. But what distinguishes us from them, is the knowledge that we have accumulated over the last ten thousand years, and particularly, over the last three hundred. I think it is legitimate to take a broader view, and include externally transmitted information, as well as DNA, in the evolution of the human race. The time scale for evolution, in the external transmission period, is the time scale for accumulation of information. This used to be hundreds, or even thousands, of years. But now this time scale has shrunk to about 50 years, or less. On the other hand, the brains with which we process this information have evolved only on the Darwinian time scale, of hundreds of thousands of years. This is beginning to cause problems. In the 18th century, there was said to be a man who had read every book written. But nowadays, if you read one book a day, it would take you about 15,000 years to read through the books in a national Library. By which time, many more books would have been written. This has meant that no one person can be the master of more than a small corner of human knowledge. People have to specialise, in narrower and narrower fields. This is likely to be a major limitation in the future. We certainly can not continue, for long, with the exponential rate of growth of knowledge that we have had in the last three hundred years. An even greater limitation and danger for future generations, is that we still have the instincts, and in particular, the aggressive impulses, that we had in cave man days. Aggression, in the form of subjugating or killing other men, and taking their women and food, has had definite survival advantage, up to the present time. But now it could destroy the entire human race, and much of the rest of life on Earth. A nuclear war, is still the most immediate danger, but there are others, such as the release of a genetically engineered virus. Or the green house effect becoming unstable. There is no time, to wait for Darwinian evolution, to make us more intelligent, and better natured. But we are now entering a new phase, of what might be called, self designed evolution, in which we will be able to change and improve our DNA. There is a project now on, to map the entire sequence of human DNA. It will cost a few billion dollars, but that is chicken feed, for a project of this importance. Once we have read the book of life, we will start writing in corrections. At first, these changes will be confined to the repair of genetic defects, like cystic fibrosis, and muscular dystrophy. These are controlled by single genes, and so are fairly easy to identify, and correct. Other qualities, such as intelligence, are probably controlled by a large number of genes. It will be much more difficult to find them, and work out the relations between them. Nevertheless, I am sure that during the next century, people will discover how to modify both intelligence, and instincts like aggression. Laws will be passed, against genetic engineering with humans. But some people won't be able to resist the temptation, to improve human characteristics, such as size of memory, resistance to disease, and length of life. Once such super humans appear, there are going to be major political problems, with the unimproved humans, who won't be able to compete. Presumably, they will die out, or become unimportant. Instead, there will be a race of self-designing beings, who are improving themselves at an ever-increasing rate. If this race manages to redesign itself, to reduce or eliminate the risk of self-destruction, it will probably spread out, and colonise other planets and stars. However, long distance space travel, will be difficult for chemically based life forms, like DNA. The natural lifetime for such beings is short, compared to the travel time. According to the theory of relativity, nothing can travel faster than light. So the round trip to the nearest star would take at least 8 years, and to the centre of the galaxy, about a hundred thousand years. In science fiction, they overcome this difficulty, by space warps, or travel through extra dimensions. But I don't think these will ever be possible, no matter how intelligent life becomes. In the theory of relativity, if one can travel faster than light, one can also travel back in time. This would lead to problems with people going back, and changing the past. One would also expect to have seen large numbers of tourists from the future, curious to look at our quaint, old-fashioned ways. It might be possible to use genetic engineering, to make DNA based life survive indefinitely, or at least for a hundred thousand years. But an easier way, which is almost within our capabilities already, would be to send machines. These could be designed to last long enough for interstellar travel. When they arrived at a new star, they could land on a suitable planet, and mine material to produce more machines, which could be sent on to yet more stars. These machines would be a new form of life, based on mechanical and electronic components, rather than macromolecules. They could eventually replace DNA based life, just as DNA may have replaced an earlier form of life. This mechanical life could also be self-designing. Thus it seems that the external transmission period of evolution, will have been just a very short interlude, between the Darwinian phase, and a biological, or mechanical, self design phase. This is shown on this next diagram, which is not to scale, because there's no way one can show a period of ten thousand years, on the same scale as billions of years. How long the self-design phase will last is open to question. It may be unstable, and life may destroy itself, or get into a dead end. If it does not, it should be able to survive the death of the Sun, in about 5 billion years, by moving to planets around other stars. Most stars will have burnt out in another 15 billion years or so, and the universe will be approaching a state of complete disorder, according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. But Freeman Dyson has shown that, despite this, life could adapt to the ever-decreasing supply of ordered energy, and therefore could, in principle, continue forever. What are the chances that we will encounter some alien form of life, as we explore the galaxy. If the argument about the time scale for the appearance of life on Earth is correct, there ought to be many other stars, whose planets have life on them. Some of these stellar systems could have formed 5 billion years before the Earth. So why is the galaxy not crawling with self designing mechanical or biological life forms? Why hasn't the Earth been visited, and even colonised. I discount suggestions that UFO's contain beings from outer space. I think any visits by aliens, would be much more obvious, and probably also, much more unpleasant. What is the explanation of why we have not been visited? One possibility is that the argument, about the appearance of life on Earth, is wrong. Maybe the probability of life spontaneously appearing is so low, that Earth is the only planet in the galaxy, or in the observable universe, in which it happened. Another possibility is that there was a reasonable probability of forming self reproducing systems, like cells, but that most of these forms of life did not evolve intelligence. We are used to thinking of intelligent life, as an inevitable consequence of evolution. But the Anthropic Principle should warn us to be wary of such arguments. It is more likely that evolution is a random process, with intelligence as only one of a large number of possible outcomes. It is not clear that intelligence has any long-term survival value. Bacteria, and other single cell organisms, will live on, if all other life on Earth is wiped out by our actions. There is support for the view that intelligence, was an unlikely development for life on Earth, from the chronology of evolution. It took a very long time, two and a half billion years, to go from single cells to multi-cell beings, which are a necessary precursor to intelligence. This is a good fraction of the total time available, before the Sun blows up. So it would be consistent with the hypothesis, that the probability for life to develop intelligence, is low. In this case, we might expect to find many other life forms in the galaxy, but we are unlikely to find intelligent life. Another way, in which life could fail to develop to an intelligent stage, would be if an asteroid or comet were to collide with the planet. We have just observed the collision of a comet, Schumacher-Levi, with Jupiter. It produced a series of enormous fireballs. It is thought the collision of a rather smaller body with the Earth, about 70 million years ago, was responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs. A few small early mammals survived, but anything as large as a human, would have almost certainly been wiped out. It is difficult to say how often such collisions occur, but a reasonable guess might be every twenty million years, on average. If this figure is correct, it would mean that intelligent life on Earth has developed only because of the lucky chance that there have been no major collisions in the last 70 million years. Other planets in the galaxy, on which life has developed, may not have had a long enough collision free period to evolve intelligent beings. A third possibility is that there is a reasonable probability for life to form, and to evolve to intelligent beings, in the external transmission phase. But at that point, the system becomes unstable, and the intelligent life destroys itself. This would be a very pessimistic conclusion. I very much hope it isn't true. I prefer a fourth possibility: there are other forms of intelligent life out there, but that we have been overlooked. There used to be a project called SETI, the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. It involved scanning the radio frequencies, to see if we could pick up signals from alien civilisations. I thought this project was worth supporting, though it was cancelled due to a lack of funds. But we should have been wary of answering back, until we have develop a bit further. Meeting a more advanced civilisation, at our present stage, might be a bit like the original inhabitants of America meeting Columbus. I don't think they were better off for it. That is all I have to say.

Where are they? (ESO/José Francisco Salgado (josefrancisco.org))    By Dirk Schulze-Makuch    airspacemag.com   May 3, 2016         For decades the famous Drake Equation has been used to estimate the number of technologically advanced species in the universe. Now Adam Frank from the University of Rochester and Woody Sullivan from the University of Washington take a slightly different approach to the problem and suggest a modification of the Drake Equation . Instead of estimating how many civilizations are out there to communicate with today, they estimate how many civilizations have been out there since the beginning of the Universe.     At first glance this seems to be only a slight semantic difference, but it is not. A big unknown in the original Drake Equation is the average lifetime of a civilization during which they might be available to communicate with us. This window might be very short, especially if technological species are typically replaced by machines . Or it could be very long.   Reframing the question makes longevity a moot point. Frank and Sullivan ask: What is the chance that we are the only technological species and always have been ? If we put the question this way, the Drake Equation boils down to A = N ast * f bt , where A is the number of technological species that have ever formed over the history of the observable universe, N ast are all the astronomical unknowns (which we now have a much better handle on than we did in 1961), and f bt are the biological unknowns, which are still many—including the fraction of suitable planets on which life actually appears, the fraction of those planets on which intelligent life emerges, and the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space.   Based on recent exoplanet discoveries , Frank and Sullivan assume that one-fifth of all stars have habitable planets in orbit around them. This leads them to conclude that there should be other advanced technological civilization out there, unless the chance for developing such a civilization on a habitable planet in the observable universe is less than 1 in 10 24 (a 1 with 24 zeros!). For our own Milky Way galaxy, the odds of being the only technologically advanced civilization are 1 in 60 billion. Thus, it’s very likely that other intelligent, technologically advanced species evolved before us. Even if only one in every million stars hosts a technologically advanced species today, that would still yield a total of about 300,000 such civilizations in the whole galaxy.   The Archilles’ heel of these statistical estimates is of course the biological uncertainties; Earth is still the only planet where we know life exists. The appearance of life may be extremely unlikely, and so might the evolution of technology. After all, there are many intelligent species on our planet, including dolphins, octopi, apes, parrots, and elephants, but only once in 4.6 billion years has a technologically advanced species evolved. And life cannot have appeared in the very early Universe until heavier elements produced by the explosions of many supernovas became abundant.   Still, Frank and Sullivan think their 1 in 10 24 estimate constitutes a “pessimism line”—a lower bound on the probability that one or more technological species has evolved over time. And that’s good news for SETI, even if it doesn’t help us know where to look.     Like this article?

A graphical representation of the Arecibo message , humanity's first attempt to use radio waves to actively communicate its existence to alien civilizations    The Fermi paradox , or Fermi's paradox , named after physicist Enrico Fermi , is the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence and high probability estimates [1] for the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations. [2] The basic points of the argument, made by physicists  Enrico Fermi (1901–1954) and Michael H. Hart (born 1932), are:   There are billions of stars in the galaxy that are similar to the Sun , [3] [4] and many of these stars are billions of years older than the Solar system . [5] [6]  With high probability, some of these stars have Earth -like planets, [7] [8] and if the Earth is typical, some may have developed intelligent life.  Some of these civilizations may have developed interstellar travel , a step the Earth is investigating now.  Even at the slow pace of currently envisioned interstellar travel, the Milky Way galaxy could be completely traversed in a few million years. [9]   According to this line of reasoning, the Earth should have already been visited by extraterrestrial aliens. In an informal conversation, Fermi noted no convincing evidence of this, leading him to ask, "Where is everybody?" [10] [11] There have been many attempts to explain the Fermi paradox, [12] [13] primarily either suggesting that intelligent extraterrestrial life is extremely rare or proposing reasons that such civilizations have not contacted or visited Earth.

The first aspect of the Fermi paradox is a function of the scale or the large numbers involved: there are an estimated 200–400 billion stars in the Milky Way [14] (2–4 × 10 11 ) and 70 sextillion (7×10 22 ) in the observable universe . [15] Even if intelligent life occurs on only a minuscule percentage of planets around these stars, there might still be a great number of extant civilizations, and if the percentage were high enough it would produce a significant number of extant civilizations in the Milky Way. This assumes the mediocrity principle , by which the Earth is a typical planet .  The second aspect of the Fermi paradox is the argument of probability: given intelligent life's ability to overcome scarcity, and its tendency to colonize new habitats , it seems possible that at least some civilizations would be technologically advanced, seek out new resources in space, and colonize their own star system and, subsequently, surrounding star systems. Since there is no significant evidence on Earth, or elsewhere in the known universe, of other intelligent life after 13.8 billion years of the universe's history, there is a conflict requiring a resolution. Some examples of possible resolutions are that intelligent life is rarer than we think, that our assumptions about the general development or behavior of intelligent species are flawed, or, more radically, that our current scientific understanding of the nature of the universe itself is quite incomplete.  The Fermi paradox can be asked in two ways. [16] The first is, "Why are no aliens or their artifacts found here on Earth, or in the Solar System?" If interstellar travel is possible, even the "slow" kind nearly within the reach of Earth technology, then it would only take from 5 million to 50 million years to colonize the galaxy. [17] This is relatively brief on a geological scale , let alone a cosmological one . Since there are many stars older than the Sun, and since intelligent life might have evolved earlier elsewhere, the question then becomes why the galaxy has not been colonized already. Even if colonization is impractical or undesirable to all alien civilizations, large-scale exploration of the galaxy could be possible by probes . These might leave detectable artifacts in the Solar System, such as old probes or evidence of mining activity, but none of these have been observed.  The second form of the question is "Why do we see no signs of intelligence elsewhere in the universe?" This version does not assume interstellar travel, but includes other galaxies as well. For distant galaxies, travel times may well explain the lack of alien visits to Earth, but a sufficiently advanced civilization could potentially be observable over a significant fraction of the size of the observable universe . [18] Even if such civilizations are rare, the scale argument indicates they should exist somewhere at some point during the history of the universe, and since they could be detected from far away over a considerable period of time, many more potential sites for their origin are within range of our observation. It is unknown whether the paradox is stronger for our galaxy or for the universe as a whole. [19]  Criticism of logical basis  The Fermi paradox has been criticized as being based on an inappropriate use of propositional logic . According to a 1985 paper by Robert Freitas , when recast as a statement in modal logic , the paradox no longer exists, and carries no probative value. [20]  History and name     Los Alamos National Laboratory    In 1950, while working at Los Alamos National Laboratory , Fermi had a casual conversation while walking to lunch with colleagues Emil Konopinski , Edward Teller and Herbert York . [21] The men discussed a recent spate of UFO reports and an Alan Dunn cartoon [22] facetiously blaming the disappearance of municipal trashcans on marauding aliens. The conversation shifted to other subjects, until during lunch Fermi suddenly exclaimed, "Where are they?" (alternatively, "Where is everybody?"). Teller remembers, "The result of his question was general laughter because of the strange fact that in spite of Fermi's question coming from the clear blue, everybody around the table seemed to understand at once that he was talking about extraterrestrial life." [23] Herbert York recalls that Fermi followed up on his comment with a series of calculations on the probability of Earth-like planets, the probability of life, the likely rise and duration of high technology, etc., and concluded that we ought to have been visited long ago and many times over.  Although Fermi's name is most commonly associated with the paradox, he was not the first to ask the question. An earlier implicit mention was by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in an unpublished manuscript from 1933. [24] He noted "people deny the presence of intelligent beings on the planets of the universe" because "(i) if such beings exist they would have visited Earth, and (ii) if such civilizations existed then they would have given us some sign of their existence." This was not a paradox for others, who took this to imply the absence of ETs, but it was for him, since he himself was a strong believer in extraterrestrial life and the possibility of space travel. Therefore, he proposed what is now known as the zoo hypothesis and speculated that mankind is not yet ready for higher beings to contact us. [25] That Tsiolkovsky himself may not have been the first to discover the paradox is suggested by his above-mentioned reference to other people's reasons for denying the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations.  Michael H. Hart published in 1975 a detailed examination of the paradox, [9] which has since become a theoretical reference point for much of the research into what is now sometimes known as the Fermi–Hart paradox . [26]  Geoffrey A. Landis prefers that name on the grounds that "while Fermi is credited with first asking the question, Hart was the first to do a rigorous analysis showing that the problem is not trivial, and also the first to publish his results". [27]  Robert H. Gray argues that the term Fermi paradox is a misnomer, since in his view it is neither a paradox nor due to Fermi; he instead prefers the name Hart–Tipler argument , acknowledging Michael Hart as its originator, but also the substantial contribution of Frank J. Tipler in extending Hart's arguments. [28]  Other names closely related to Fermi's question ("Where are they?") include the Great Silence , [29] [30] [31] [32] and silentium universi [32] (Latin for "silence of the universe"), though these only refer to one portion of the Fermi Paradox, that we see no evidence of other civilizations.  Drake equation  Main article: Drake equation  The theories and principles in the Drake equation are closely related to the Fermi paradox. [33] The equation was formulated by Frank Drake in 1961 in an attempt to find a systematic means to evaluate the numerous probabilities involved in the existence of alien life. The speculative equation considers the rate of star formation in the galaxy; the fraction of stars with planets and the number per star that are habitable ; the fraction of those planets that develop life; the fraction that develop intelligent life; the fraction that have detectable, technological intelligent life; and finally the length of time such communicable civilizations are detectable. The fundamental problem is that the last four terms are completely unknown, rendering statistical estimates impossible.  The Drake equation has been used by both optimists and pessimists, with wildly differing results. The original meeting, including Frank Drake and Carl Sagan , speculated that the number of civilizations was roughly equal to the lifetime in years, and there were probably between 1000 and 100,000,000 civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. [34] Conversely, Frank Tipler and John D. Barrow used pessimistic numbers and speculated that the average number of civilizations in a galaxy is much less than one. [35]  Empirical projects  There are two parts of the Fermi paradox that rely on empirical evidence—that there are many potential habitable planets , and that we see no evidence of life. The first point, that many suitable planets exist, was an assumption in Fermi's time that is gaining ground with the discovery of many exoplanets , and models predicting billions of habitable worlds in our galaxy. [36]  The second part of the paradox, that we see no evidence of extraterrestrial life, is also an active field of scientific research. This includes both efforts to find any indication of life, [37] and efforts specifically directed to finding intelligent life. These searches have been made since 1960, and several are ongoing. [38]  Mainstream astronomy and SETI     An artist's depiction of the "little green man" described in the novel Martians, Go Home    Although astronomers do not usually search for extraterrestrials, they have observed phenomena that they could not immediately explain without positing an intelligent civilization as the source. For example, pulsars , when first discovered in 1967, were called little green men (LGM) because of the precise repetition of their pulses. [39] In all cases, explanations with no need for intelligent life have been found for such observations, [40] but the possibility of discovery remains. [41] Proposed examples include asteroid mining that would change the appearance of debris disks around stars, [42] or spectral lines from nuclear waste disposal in stars. [43] An ongoing example is the unusual transit light curves of star KIC 8462852 , where natural interpretations are not fully convincing. [44] Although most likely a natural explanation will emerge, some scientists are investigating the remote possibility that it could be a sign of alien technology, such as a Dyson swarm . [45] [46] [47]  Electromagnetic emissions  Further information: SETI , Project Ozma , Project Cyclops , Project Phoenix (SETI) , SERENDIP , and Allen Telescope Array      Radio telescopes are often used by SETI projects    Radio technology and the ability to construct a radio telescope are presumed to be a natural advance for technological species, [48] theoretically creating effects that might be detected over interstellar distances. The careful searching for non-natural radio emissions from space may lead to the detection of alien civilizations. Sensitive alien observers of the Solar System , for example, would note unusually intense radio waves for a G2 star due to Earth's television and telecommunication broadcasts. In the absence of an apparent natural cause, alien observers might infer the existence of a terrestrial civilization. It should be noted however that the most sensitive radio telescopes currently available on Earth would not be able to detect non-directional radio signals even at a fraction of a light-year , so it is questionable whether any such signals could be detected by an extraterrestrial civilization. Such signals could be either "accidental" by-products of a civilization, or deliberate attempts to communicate, such as the Arecibo message . A number of astronomers and observatories have attempted and are attempting to detect such evidence, mostly through the SETI organization. Several decades of SETI analysis have not revealed any unusually bright or meaningfully repetitive radio emissions.  Direct planetary observation     A composite picture of Earth at night, created with data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS). Large-scale artificial lighting produced by the human civilization is detectable from space.    Exoplanet detection and classification is a very active sub-discipline in astronomy, and the first possibly terrestrial planet discovered within a star's habitable zone was found in 2007. [49] New refinements in exoplanet detection methods , and use of existing methods from space (such as the Kepler Mission , launched in 2009) are starting to detect and characterize Earth-size planets, and determine if they are within the habitable zones of their stars. Such observational refinements may allow us to better gauge how common potentially habitable worlds are. [50]  Conjectures about interstellar probes  Further information: Von Neumann probe and Bracewell probe  Self-replicating probes could exhaustively explore a galaxy the size of the Milky Way in as little as a million years. [9] If even a single civilization in the Milky Way attempted this, such probes could spread throughout the entire galaxy. Another speculation for contact with an alien probe—one that would be trying to find human beings—is an alien Bracewell probe . Such a hypothetical device would be an autonomous space probe whose purpose is to seek out and communicate with alien civilizations (as opposed to Von Neumann probes, which are usually described as purely exploratory). These were proposed as an alternative to carrying a slow speed-of-light dialogue between vastly distant neighbors. Rather than contending with the long delays a radio dialogue would suffer, a probe housing an artificial intelligence would seek out an alien civilization to carry on a close-range communication with the discovered civilization. The findings of such a probe would still have to be transmitted to the home civilization at light speed, but an information-gathering dialogue could be conducted in real time. [51]  Attempts to find alien probes  Direct exploration of the Solar System has yielded no evidence indicating a visit by aliens or their probes. Detailed exploration of areas of the Solar System where resources would be plentiful may yet produce evidence of alien exploration, [52] [53] though the entirety of the Solar System is vast and difficult to investigate. Attempts to signal, attract, or activate hypothetical Bracewell probes in Earth's vicinity have not succeeded. [54]  Conjectures about stellar-scale artifacts  Further information: Dyson sphere , Kardashev scale , Alderson disk , Matrioshka brain , and Stellar engine     A variant of the speculative Dyson sphere . Such large scale artifacts would drastically alter the spectrum of a star.    In 1959, Freeman Dyson observed that every developing human civilization constantly increases its energy consumption, and, he conjectured, a civilization might try to harness a large part of the energy produced by a star. He proposed that a Dyson sphere could be a possible means: a shell or cloud of objects enclosing a star to absorb and utilize as much radiant energy as possible. Such a feat of astroengineering would drastically alter the observed spectrum of the star involved, changing it at least partly from the normal emission lines of a natural stellar atmosphere to those of black body radiation , probably with a peak in the infrared . Dyson speculated that advanced alien civilizations might be detected by examining the spectra of stars and searching for such an altered spectrum. [55] [56] [57]  There have been some attempts to find evidence of the existence of Dyson spheres that would alter the spectra of their core stars. [58] Direct observation of thousands of galaxies has shown no explicit evidence of artificial construction or modifications. [56] [57] [59] [60] In October 2015, there was some speculation that a pattern of light from star KIC 8462852 , observed by the Kepler Space Telescope , could have been a result of Dyson sphere construction. [61] [62]  Hypothetical explanations for the paradox  Extraterrestrial life is rare or non-existent  Main article: Rare Earth hypothesis  Those who think that intelligent extraterrestrial life is (nearly) impossible argue that the conditions needed for the evolution of life—or at least the evolution of biological complexity —are rare or even unique to Earth. Under this assumption, called the rare Earth hypothesis , a rejection of the mediocrity principle , complex multicellular life is regarded as exceedingly unusual. [63]  The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the evolution of biological complexity requires a host of fortuitous circumstances, such as a galactic habitable zone , a central star and planetary system having the requisite character, the circumstellar habitable zone , a right sized terrestrial planet, the advantage of a giant guardian like Jupiter and a large natural satellite , conditions needed to ensure the planet has a magnetosphere and plate tectonics , the chemistry of the lithosphere , atmosphere , and oceans, the role of "evolutionary pumps" such as massive glaciation and rare bolide impacts, and whatever led to the appearance of the eukaryote  cell , sexual reproduction and the Cambrian explosion .  No other intelligent species have arisen  It is possible that even if complex life is common, intelligence (and consequently civilizations) is not. [64] While there are remote sensing techniques that could perhaps detect life-bearing planets without relying on the signs of technology, [65] [66] none of them has any ability to tell if any detected life is intelligent. This is sometimes referred to as the "algae vs. alumnae" problem. [67]  Intelligent alien species lack advanced technology  It may be that while alien species with intelligence exist, they are primitive or have not reached the level of technological advancement necessary to communicate. Along with non-intelligent life, such civilizations would be also very difficult for us to detect, [67] short of a visit by a probe, a trip that would take hundreds of thousands of years with current technology. [68] To skeptics, the fact that in the history of life on the Earth only one species has developed a civilization to the point of being capable of spaceflight and radio technology, lends more credence to the idea that technologically advanced civilizations are rare in the universe. [69]  It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself  See also: Great Filter     A 23-kiloton tower shot called BADGER , fired as part of the Operation Upshot–Knothole  nuclear test series .    This is the argument that technological civilizations may usually or invariably destroy themselves before or shortly after developing radio or spaceflight technology. Possible means of annihilation are many, [70] including war, accidental environmental contamination or damage, resource depletion, climate change , [71] or poorly designed artificial intelligence . This general theme is explored both in fiction and in scientific hypothesizing. [72] In 1966, Sagan and Shklovskii speculated that technological civilizations will either tend to destroy themselves within a century of developing interstellar communicative capability or master their self-destructive tendencies and survive for billion-year timescales. [73] Self-annihilation may also be viewed in terms of thermodynamics: insofar as life is an ordered system that can sustain itself against the tendency to disorder, the "external transmission" or interstellar communicative phase may be the point at which the system becomes unstable and self-destructs. [74]  It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others  See also: Technological singularity and Von Neumann probe  Another hypothesis is that an intelligent species beyond a certain point of technological capability will destroy other intelligent species as they appear. The idea that something , or someone, might be destroying intelligent life in the universe has been explored in the scientific literature. [29] A species might undertake such extermination out of expansionist motives, paranoia, or aggression. In 1981, cosmologist Edward Harrison argued that such behavior would be an act of prudence: an intelligent species that has overcome its own self-destructive tendencies might view any other species bent on galactic expansion as a threat. [75] It has also been suggested that a successful alien species would be a superpredator , as are humans. [76] [77]  Periodic extinction by natural events  New life might commonly die out due to runaway heating or cooling on their fledgling planets. [78] On Earth, there have been numerous major extinction events that destroyed the majority of complex species alive at the time; the extinction of the dinosaurs is the best known example. These are thought to have been caused by events such as impact from a large meteorite, massive volcanic eruptions, or astronomical events such as gamma-ray bursts . [79] It may be the case that such extinction events are common throughout the universe and periodically destroy intelligent life, or at least its civilizations, before the species is able to develop the technology to communicate with other species. [80]  Inflation hypothesis and the youngness argument  Cosmologist Alan Guth proposed a multi-verse solution to the Fermi paradox. This hypothesis uses the synchronous gauge probability distribution, with the result that young universes exceedingly outnumber older ones (by a factor of e 10 37 for every second of age). Therefore, averaged over all universes, universes with civilizations will almost always have just one, the first to develop. However, Guth notes "Perhaps this argument explains why SETI has not found any signals from alien civilizations, but I find it more plausible that it is merely a symptom that the synchronous gauge probability distribution is not the right one." [81]  Intelligent civilizations are too far apart in space or time      NASA 's conception of the Terrestrial Planet Finder    It may be that non-colonizing technologically capable alien civilizations exist, but that they are simply too far apart for meaningful two-way communication. [82] If two civilizations are separated by several thousand light-years, it is possible that one or both cultures may become extinct before meaningful dialogue can be established. Human searches may be able to detect their existence, but communication will remain impossible because of distance. It has been suggested that this problem might be ameliorated somewhat if contact/communication is made through a Bracewell probe . In this case at least one partner in the exchange may obtain meaningful information. Alternatively, a civilization may simply broadcast its knowledge, and leave it to the receiver to make what they may of it. This is similar to the transmission of information from ancient civilizations to the present, [83] and humanity has undertaken similar activities like the Arecibo message , which could transfer information about Earth's intelligent species, even if it never yields a response or does not yield a response in time for humanity to receive it. It is also possible that archaeological evidence of past civilizations may be detected through deep space observations. [84]  A related speculation by Sagan and Newman suggests that if other civilizations exist, and are transmitting and exploring, their signals and probes simply have not arrived yet. [85] However, critics have noted that this is unlikely, since it requires that humanity's advancement has occurred at a very special point in time, while the Milky Way is in transition from empty to full. This is a tiny fraction of the lifespan of a galaxy under ordinary assumptions and calculations resulting from them, so the likelihood that we are in the midst of this transition is considered low in the paradox. [86]  Lack of resources to spread physically throughout the galaxy  See also: Project Daedalus , Project Orion (nuclear propulsion) , and Project Longshot  Many speculations about the ability of an alien culture to colonize other star systems are based on the idea that interstellar travel is technologically feasible. While the current understanding of physics rules out the possibility of faster-than-light travel, it appears that there are no major theoretical barriers to the construction of "slow" interstellar ships, even though the engineering required is considerably beyond our present capabilities. This idea underlies the concept of the Von Neumann probe and the Bracewell probe as a potential evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence.  It is possible, however, that present scientific knowledge cannot properly gauge the feasibility and costs of such interstellar colonization. Theoretical barriers may not yet be understood, and the resources needed may be so great as to make it unlikely that any civilization could afford to attempt it. Even if interstellar travel and colonization are possible, they may be difficult, leading to a colonization model based on percolation theory . [87] Colonization efforts may not occur as an unstoppable rush, but rather as an uneven tendency to "percolate" outwards, within an eventual slowing and termination of the effort given the enormous costs involved and the expectation that colonies will inevitably develop a culture and civilization of their own. Colonization may thus occur in "clusters," with large areas remaining uncolonized at any one time. [87]  If exploration, or backup from a home system disaster, is the primary motive for expansion, then it is possible that mind uploading and similar technologies may reduce the desire to colonize by replacing physical travel with much less-expensive communication. [88] Therefore, the first civilization may have physically explored or colonized the galaxy, but subsequent civilizations find it cheaper, faster, and easier to travel by contacting existing civilizations rather than physically exploring or traveling themselves. This leads to little or no physical travel at the current epoch, and only directed communications, which are hard to see except to the intended receiver.  Human beings have not existed long enough  Humanity's ability to detect intelligent extraterrestrial life has existed for only a very brief period—from 1937 onwards, if the invention of the radio telescope is taken as the dividing line—and Homo sapiens is a geologically recent species. The whole period of modern human existence to date is a very brief period on a cosmological scale, and radio transmissions have only been propagated since 1895. Thus, it remains possible that human beings have neither existed long enough nor made themselves sufficiently detectable to be found by extraterrestrial intelligence. [89]  We are not listening properly  There are some assumptions that underlie the SETI programs that may cause searchers to miss signals that are present. Extraterrestrials might, for example, transmit signals that have a very high or low data rate, or employ unconventional (in our terms) frequencies , which would make them hard to distinguish from background noise. Signals might be sent from non- main sequence star systems that we search with lower priority; current programs assume that most alien life will be orbiting Sun-like stars . [90]  The greatest challenge is the sheer size of the radio search needed to look for signals (effectively spanning the entire visible universe), the limited amount of resources committed to SETI, and the sensitivity of modern instruments. SETI estimates, for instance, that with a radio telescope as sensitive as the Arecibo Observatory , Earth's television and radio broadcasts would only be detectable at distances up to 0.3 light-years, less than 1/10 the distance to the nearest star. A signal is much easier to detect if the signal energy is limited to either a narrow range of frequencies, or directed at a specific part of the sky. Such signals could be detected at ranges of hundreds to tens of thousands of light-years distance. [91] However, this means that detectors must be listening to an appropriate range of frequencies, and be in that region of space to which the beam is being sent. Many SETI searches assume that extraterrestrial civilizations will be broadcasting a deliberate signal, like the Arecibo message, in order to be found.  Thus to detect alien civilizations through their radio emissions, Earth observers either need more sensitive instruments or must hope for fortunate circumstances: that the broadband radio emissions of alien radio technology are much stronger than our own; that one of SETI's programs is listening to the correct frequencies from the right regions of space; or that aliens are deliberately sending focused transmissions in our general direction.  Civilizations broadcast detectable radio signals only for a brief period of time  It may be that alien civilizations are detectable through their radio emissions for only a short time, reducing the likelihood of spotting them. The usual assumption is that civilizations outgrow radio through technological advancement. [92] However, even if radio is not used for communication, it may be used for other purposes such as power transmission from solar power satellites. Such uses may remain visible even after broadcast emission are replaced by less observable technology. [93]  More hypothetically, advanced alien civilizations may evolve beyond broadcasting at all in the electromagnetic spectrum and communicate by technologies not developed or used by mankind. Some scientists have hypothesized that advanced civilizations may send neutrino signals. [94] If such signals exist, they could be detectable by neutrino detectors that are now under construction for other goals. [95]  They tend to isolate themselves  It has been suggested that some advanced beings may divest themselves of physical form, create massive artificial virtual environments , transfer themselves into these environments through mind uploading , and exist totally within virtual worlds, ignoring the external physical universe. [96]  It may also be that intelligent alien life develops an "increasing disinterest" in their outside world. [97] Possibly any sufficiently advanced society will develop highly engaging media and entertainment well before the capacity for advanced space travel, and that the rate of appeal of these social contrivances is destined, because of their inherent reduced complexity, to overtake any desire for complex, expensive endeavors such as space exploration and communication. Once any sufficiently advanced civilization becomes able to master its environment, and most of its physical needs are met through technology, various "social and entertainment technologies", including virtual reality, are postulated to become the primary drivers and motivations of that civilization. [98]  They are too alien     Microwave window as seen by a ground-based system. From NASA report SP-419: SETI – the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence    Another possibility is that human theoreticians have underestimated how much alien life might differ from that on Earth. Aliens may be psychologically unwilling to attempt to communicate with human beings. Perhaps human mathematics is parochial to Earth and not shared by other life, [99] though others argue this can only apply to abstract math since the math associated with physics must be similar (in results, if not in methods). [100]  Physiology might also cause a communication barrier. Carl Sagan speculated that an alien species might have a thought process orders of magnitude slower (or faster) than ours. [ citation needed ] A message broadcast by that species might well seem like random background noise to us, and therefore go undetected.  Another thought is that technological civilizations invariably experience a technological singularity and attain a post-biological character. [101] Hypothetical civilizations of this sort may have advanced drastically enough to render communication impossible. [102] [103]  Everyone is listening, no one is transmitting  Alien civilizations might be technically capable of contacting Earth, but are only listening instead of transmitting. [104] If all, or even most, civilizations act the same way, the galaxy could be full of civilizations eager for contact, but everyone is listening and no one is transmitting. This is the so-called SETI Paradox . [105]  The only civilization we know, our own, does not explicitly transmit , except for a few small efforts. [104] Even these efforts, and certainly any attempt to expand them, are controversial. [106] It is not even clear we would respond to a detected signal—the official policy within the SETI community [107] is that "[no] response to a signal or other evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence should be sent until appropriate international consultations have taken place." However, given the possible impact of any reply [108] it may be very difficult to obtain any consensus on "Who speaks for Earth?" and "What should we say?"  Earth is deliberately not contacted  Main article: Zoo hypothesis     Schematic representation of a planetarium simulating the universe to humans. The " real " universe is outside the black sphere, the simulated one projected on/filtered through it.    The zoo hypothesis states that intelligent extraterrestrial life exists and does not contact life on Earth to allow for its natural evolution and development. [109] This hypothesis may break down under the uniformity of motive flaw: all it takes is a single culture or civilization to decide to act contrary to the imperative within our range of detection for it to be abrogated, and the probability of such a violation increases with the number of civilizations. [17]  Analysis of the inter-arrival times between civilizations in the galaxy based on common astrobiological assumptions suggests that the initial civilization would have a commanding lead over the later arrivals. As such, it may have established what we call the zoo hypothesis through force or as a galactic/universal norm and the resultant "paradox" by a cultural founder effect with or without the continued activity of the founder. [110]  Earth is purposely isolated (planetarium hypothesis)  Main article: Planetarium hypothesis  A related idea to the zoo hypothesis is that, beyond a certain distance, the perceived universe is a simulated reality . The planetarium hypothesis [111] speculates that beings may have created this simulation so that the universe appears to be empty of other life.  It is dangerous to communicate  An alien civilization might feel it is too dangerous to communicate, either for us or for them. After all, when very different civilizations have met on Earth, the results have often been disastrous for one side or the other, and the same may well apply to interstellar contact. Even contact at a safe distance could lead to infection by computer code [112] or even ideas themselves. [113] Perhaps prudent civilizations actively hide not only from Earth but from everyone, out of fear of other civilizations . [114]  Perhaps the Fermi paradox itself—or the alien equivalent of it—is the reason for any civilization to avoid contact with other civilizations, even if no other obstacles existed. From any one civilization's point of view, it would be unlikely for them to be the first ones to make first contact. Therefore, according to this reasoning, it is likely that previous civilizations faced fatal problems with first contact and doing so should be avoided. So perhaps every civilization keeps quiet because of the possibility that there is a real reason for others to do so. [29]  Liu Cixin 's novel The Dark Forest talks about such a situation.  The simulation theory  Main article: Simulated reality  Similar to the Planetarium hypothesis, it is theorized that our perceived reality is a simulation created by more intelligent beings. The creators of this hypothetical simulation may have purposely excluded life other than what has been found on Earth, or have simply not introduced it to humans in the simulation yet. It is also possible that they themselves are more intelligent humans, who also have not come in contact with alien lifeforms.  They are here undetected  It is possible that a civilization advanced enough to travel between the stars could visit or observe our world while remaining undetected or unrecognized. [115]  They are here unacknowledged  Main article: UFO conspiracy theory  A significant fraction of the population believes that at least some UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) are spacecraft piloted by aliens. [116] [117] While most of these are unrecognized or mistaken interpretations of mundane phenomena, there are those that remain puzzling even after investigation. The consensus scientific view is that although they may be unexplained, they do not rise to the level of convincing evidence. [118]  Similarly, it is theoretically possible that SETI groups are not reporting positive detections, or governments have been blocking signals or suppressing publication. This response might be attributed to security or economic interests from the potential use of advanced extraterrestrial technology. It has been suggested that the detection of an extraterrestrial radio signal or technology could well be the most highly secret information that exists. [119] Claims that this has already happened are common in the popular press, [120] [121] but the scientists involved report the opposite experience—the press becomes informed and interested in a potential detection even before a signal can be confirmed.

Six Of The Top Theories  by Victor Tangermann  on December 1, 2017  32612     NASA              We have accomplished a lot in our (relatively) short time on Earth. We’ve sent hum ans to the Moon and to live in space, developed massive and sophisticated telescopes to see the farthest reaches of the cosmos, and even rocketed rovers to Mars and probes to the edge of our solar system. However, a number of organizations have taken humanity’s voyage into the final frontier a step farther. NASA, the European Space Agency, and the research collective behind the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) have been working tirelessly to find out if we are alone, once and for all.  Already, a number of projects exist that scan the stars for signs of intelligent life. And despite the fact that many of them have been looking to the skies for decades, we have yet to make contact. And that’s a bit of a problem.  The Paradox That Started It All  To put it mildly, our solar system is very old. In fact, scientists are still figuring out just how old — clues gathered from meteorites suggest it is almost 5 billion years old , and surrounding star systems are likely billions of years older . While interstellar travel still seems to be a distant dream , new technology is born every year that allows us to scan the skies for signals from civilizations in the most distant corners of the cosmos. The number of known alien worlds and star systems discovered through these technologies continues to rise , but our creative methods of listening to space have not yet revealed anything that resembles extraterrestrial communications or civilizations.  Given the size and age of our universe, it seems like we should have made contact. We, of course, have not.  In the early 20th century, physicist Enrico Fermi asked himself a now-famous question: Given the scope of our universe, why haven’t we found intelligent extraterrestrial life yet (or why haven’t they found us)? This is sometimes called the Fermi Paradox or the Great Silence. Scientists have floated many possible answers in the century since Fermi first asked this question. Here are some of the most plausible  reasons why he haven’t made first contact.  Image Credit: NASA  #GreatFilter  Basic probability asserts that alien life must exist. Since we haven’t made contact yet, one theory goes, there must be something barring life from interstellar travel or, at least, barring it from communicating with other alien species. This barrier is known as the “Great Filter,” and it is a force or event that stops a civilization from getting to the aforementioned point of interstellar travel or communication.  If the theory holds true, there are two primary reasons that we haven’t made contact: Because societies kill themselves off before they reach a state advanced enough to explore the stars or interstellar travel is simply not possible on a technological scale. Neither option is particularly pleasing.  And according to the experts behind the work, the filter event is of equal or greater probability than the existence of alien life itself. This is the point argued by Robin Hanson, a research associate at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, in his discussion of the topic .  No alien civilizations have substantially colonized our solar system or systems nearby. Thus among the billion trillion stars in our past universe, none has reached the level of technology and growth that we may soon reach. This one data point implies that a Great Filter stands between ordinary dead matter and advanced exploding lasting life.  Since we have not been able to detect alien life (or leave the solar system much, for that matter), how far are we from being caught up in some event that would bar us from ever finding aliens? “The easier it was for life to evolve to our stage, the bleaker our future chances probably are,” Hanson writes. In other words, the more life there is in the cosmos, the greater the likeliness that we are about to reach a cataclysmic, life-ending event or reach the cosmic limits of technological advancement.  Do Not Disturb the Aliens  Another hypothesis asserts that alien civilizations certainly exist, but they’re simply inactive. That’s the “aestivation hypothesis” (aestivation refers to an organism’s state of prolonged inactivity, similar to a bear hibernating or a frog that buries itself in sand during hot weather), which was put forth by researchers from Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute and the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade.  The theory, published in a paper in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society in 2017, states that aliens may be “hibernating” until the environmental conditions are just right to become active and build their super society. The researchers argue that the laws of thermodynamics directly limit computation, as computing technologies need to be cooled in order to function. This makes it exceedingly difficult to create advanced technologies, as keeping them cool at scale quickly becomes prohibitively difficult. So the aliens are falling into a dormant until, to be blunt, the universe cools.  But distilling the development of a civilization to the kinds of conditions that our current, and somewhat imperfect, models can predict could be reductive. What if intelligent extraterrestrial life has found a way around the thermodynamic conditions that limit its ability to compute? “What if there are other forms of value that can be generated?” the study authors write. If they’re wrong about the relationship between thermodynamics and technology, the aestivation hypothesis would be moot. In this case, perhaps one of the other ideas here holds true.  A “Gaian”-tic Bottleneck  Image Credit: Creative Commons  According to the “Gaian Bottleneck” hypothesis, life needs particular environmental conditions to develop, and they’re not so common. Astrobiologists at the Australian National University penned their explanation to the Fermi Paradox in 2016.  Extinction is “the cosmic default for most life that has ever emerged on the surfaces of wet rocky planets in the Universe,” the researchers wrote. That’s because a planet has to be actually inhabited for it to be habitable, because organisms change the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. A Catch-22 emerges: no life without habitability, no habitability without life.  For alien life to persist, the researchers write, it must hang on: “like trying to ride a wild bull. Most life falls off.” Life can only take place with the presence of an unlikely feedback loop. In this case, Earth is the exception to the rule.  Trapped in Deep Oceans  In 2015, after nearly a decade in transit, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft became the first to do a close flyby of Pluto. It offered humanity its first look at its icy surface and raised questions about the possibility of subsurface oceans of water, and lots of methane and nitrogen. These questions put Pluto on a short but growing list of worlds with buried oceans trapped under a thick crust of ice and rock (some of the other worlds are Saturn’s moons Enceladus and Titan, as well as Jupiter’s moons Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede).  Those oceans figure prominently into another theory of where life might be lurking, one that Alan Stern, the principal investigator for New Horizons, touches on. Since buried oceans form a much more stable ecosystem than flowing surface streams, changes such as altering tides and dissipation  take place over a longer time period. A hard outer shell protects hypothetical life in the oceans from a harsh climate and a lethal mix of gases on the surface. “Impacts and solar flares, and nearby supernovae, and what orbit you’re in, and whether you have a magnetosphere, and whether there’s a poisonous atmosphere — none of those things matter,” Stern told Space.com .  Any intelligent alien life that forms in these deep oceans would have to overcome a big hurdle to reach inhabitants of other worlds: drilling through that thick, protective crust. All that work would only get them to the surface — sending signals to other planets become even more unlikely.  Missed Signals  The Allen Telescope Array, Image Credit: National Science Foundation  For the past eighty years or so, we’ve been listening for signs of extraterrestrial life with  radio technology. The Allen Telescope Array , situated 470 km (290 miles) northeast of San Francisco, is one of the biggest — s ince 2007, 42 dishes have stood at the ready to scan the skies regularly in the hope of receiving radio signals from extraterrestrial life.  But what if extraterrestrial life doesn’t operate on those frequencies? Attempts at contact could simply be passing us by simply because we don’t comprehend the right wavelengths.  Instead of using telescope arrays and scanning the skies for radio signals, Duncan Forgan at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland suggests creating a galactic communications network . The same way we blink our high beams to send a signal to other drivers, we could use the shadow that Earth creates when it passes in front of the Sun to send a message to our fellow inhabitants of the universe. Forgan suggests that we build powerful lasers that contain those encoded messages, which are sent out as we pass in front of the Sun.  “If you want to communicate with someone on the other side of the galactic centre, there’s lots of stuff in the way – dust, stars, a big black hole – so you can take the long way around using the network,” Forgan tells New Scientist . Rather than letting intergalactic messages get lost in the vastness of space, civilizations in different galaxies could agree to use this “galactic communications network” to ensure their messages get to their intended recipients – a unified system to cut through the chatter.  We are Being Impatient  We’ve only been actively reaching out for alien life for about a century — a mere blip in the long history of the solar system and of the universe overall. Evan Solomonides, an astrophysics and mathematics undergrad and researcher  at Cornell University, suggests that it could take a while — about 1,500 years from now, to be precise — before we hear from any extraterrestrials.  In a paper submitted to the American Astronomical Society , Solomonides examines the probability of finding life. “We predict that under 1 percent of the galaxy has been reached at all thus far, and we do not anticipate to be reached until approximately half of the stars/planets have been reached.” Solomonides believes that we will have explore around half of the Milky Way galaxy before we hear anything, which will take a while since we’ve barely explored our own galactic neighborhood.  Solomonides is careful to note that the 1,500 years is not a deadline. “This is not to say that we must be reached by then or else we are, in fact, alone. We simply claim that it is somewhat unlikely that we will not hear anything before that time.”  Editor’s Note: This article was updated to correct the names of Saturn and Jupiter’s moons.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Extraterrestrial Intelligence  Extraterrestrial Life What are the chances of alien life being biologically compatible with us? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 11 Answers   Gordon Hogenson , Seeking the truth about extraterrestrial life for 20 years. Answered Jul 5, 2017 · Author has 265 answers and 93.8k answer views It’s not a question of chance, it is a fact that the extraterrestrial life forms that have been visiting here in recent times, in ancient times, and throughout the development of life on the planet, are biologically compatible with us. The life on our planet has been seeded here and influenced by extraterrestrial visitations throughout history. Some of the initial life that started here might have arrived on its own, from dust or comet debris, as Fred Hoyle proposed, and as Brig Klyce now convincingly argues [1]. This initial spreading of life would have brought bacteria, with the same genetic code and basic DNA patterns that we observe today. Many who have studied the bacterial genome and biosphere have seen that has such richness and depth that they’ve concluded that it must be of cosmic order. Second, so-called “ancient alien” theory, the subject of countless books by independent researchers, and scorned by established academics, is much closer to the truth than conventional archeology. One could go on for hours about all the reasons to believe this, from the enormous hundred-ton stones placed with precision in the most ancient of monuments, to the mysterious materials found at some sites, such as mercury and mica at Tenochtitlan, the evidence is simply too much to continue to be ignored. So, extraterrestrial visitation in ancient times must eventually be accepted as truth. Finally, modern extraterrestrial visitation accounts must be taken seriously. There are too many good sightings, sufficient good accounts from contactees, sufficient accounts from government whistleblowers - see for example the Disclosure Project press conference in 2001. There are peer-reviewed studies in the Journal of Scientific Exploration, if you need peer-reviewed studies. Examination of the phenomenon reveals some important facts relevant to this question of biological compatibility. First, as Stephen Greer says, “They aren’t traveling here in Granddad’s Oldsmobile.” Our science hasn’t yet (at least publicly) solved the faster-than-light puzzle, but our science is in its infancy compared to the advanced science that these visiting beings apparently have. Whether it is wormholes, hyperspace, or all of the above, the argument that “you can’t get here from there” is just not the case and can’t be used to refute all possible extraterrestrial visitations. Second, the beings are not that different from us. Most we encounter are bipedal and some are relatively human-like. Think about this for a minute - all our assumptions about life on different planets having to evolve separately assume that faster-than-light travel (or technology that cheats the light barrier in some clever way) doesn’t exist and isn’t a factor. If it is a factor and if it has been possible for visitors to travel between planets for thousands of years, perhaps millions or billions of years, then during that time, seeds of life of all kinds would have been moving throughout the galaxy, perhaps even the universe of galaxies, for a long, long, time. Life based not only on our own DNA, RNA, genetic code, sugars, proteins, and so forth, but also co-evolved with us via our own tree of life, with animals, plants, fungi, including all the various families of animal life - invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, and all the various forms of plant life - algae, lichens, mosses, ferns, conifers, flowering plants, trees. Any of these could have been brought here intentionally or accidentally at any time in prehistory and proliferated as invasive species do today when brought to a new continent or island. An interesting suggestion is that the ancient form of life that predated the Cambrian explosion, called Ediacaran life [2], might be the Earth’s native life, before Cambrian life arrived and took over, wiping out most of the Ediacaran life forms. If that is the case, Cambrian life is not of Earthly origin and we might expect “alien” life forms that arrive to be derived from the same roots as Cambrian life. That said, life adapts to its environments, just as on Earth, “alien” life although based on the same genetics (and therefore not so “alien” after all), would be adapted to the conditions on a world perhaps quite different than our own. However, our type of life does have limits to its ability to thrive, so the other world can’t be that different in some of the key physical parameters. Certain fundamental conditions are required. There must be liquid water in some way, so that limits the temperature range. There must be oxygen, carbon dioxide, and so on, but those gases could be present in a range of amounts. The pressure could perhaps vary from our own, with adaptations to very low or very high atmospheric pressure, just as fish in the deep ocean are adapted to the higher pressure there. Gravity could be higher or lower and organisms would be constructed differently. On planets with higher gravity, they might be short, squat, and muscular, or primarily aquatic, since water provides support. On planets with lower gravity, they might be taller and more adapted to jumping or flying. That all said, there might also be extraterrestrial beings from very different but still carbon-based life. We don’t have many sightings or contactees who have reported such beings, so either they don’t exist, or they don’t visit often, or don’t have as much interest in beings like us that are so different from them. Or, perhaps the type of life that we and our visiting beings dominates the scene in our part of space. In any case, we obviously have much to learn about the denizens of the universe.

Answered Nov 29, 2016 · Featured on Forbes · Author has 4.1k answers and 43.2m answer views Capable of growing in the same soil - nearly 100% Safe for us to eat - nearly 100%* Every nutrient that autotrophs need are achiral - they aren’t “handed”. Things like ammonia, water, carbon dioxide, etc. These chemicals would be the building blocks of life on many worlds, and they are the same everywhere. If an alien world had plants, chances are they’d do fine in our dirt. Our atmosphere might not have the correct ratio of gases, and our sun might not spit out the correct spectrum of light for optimal growth, but chances are there would be some creatures that could survive here. Now, could we eat them? Sure! But remember, we can also eat sand. That doesn’t make it nutritive. The odds that we would be able to extract nutritional value from the food is far closer to 0% than 100%. There’s a nearly infinite array of molecules that alien beings might use to store energy, build body structures, etc. Nearly all of those would be completely indigestible by humans. So, could you eat an alien plant? Sure. Would you starve to death anyway? Probably. Might it make you sick? Possibly. Could it grow here? Probably. The same is true in reverse, by the way - alien animals would almost certainly be incapable of digesting Earth plants and animals. 8.7k Views · View Upvoters   Bob Myers , Human bean Answered Nov 28, 2016 · Author has 3.7k answers and 1.5m answer views With the disclaimer right up front that I’m no sort of biologist, let alone an exo- or xenobiologist…I think the odds are fairly good that alien life would share the most basic chemistry with Earth life in that it would almost certainly be carbon-based and require liquid water. Having said that, though, the very things that make these basic components a good choice for being the basis of life - their nearly infinite ability to form all sorts of complex compounds - makes it very UNlikely that alien life would be truly compatible with terrestrial life. Even if alien life through some coincidence was based on DNA, etc., what are the chances that we’d use the exact same proteins, require the same trace elements, or (most farfetched at all) use anything like compatible genetics? One simple example: a LOT of the organic chemistry of Earth life is based on molecules which can exist in two forms, one of which is the mirror image of the other (these are called “optical isomers”); in other words, they’re like your hands: the structure is basically identical, but each one is backwards relative to the other. They’re chemically identical, but for many of these your body can use one but not the other. Which version life uses came about through random chance - so there’s even odds that an alien lifeform could be absolutely identical to us in every way, but couldn’t eat our food! (And of course, the chances of that lifeform being identical to us in every other way is already infinitesimal.) 211 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by BetterHelp Are you struggling emotionally?

One planet outside our solar system is entirely an ocean all through it. That water may support life. One planet also outside(exo planet) that's most likely to support life has one side facing its star, a red giant in place of a sun is very very hot and one side permanently facing away from the sun is too cold to support life. But there's a strip of land in the middle that is about the right temp where life could thrive. A lot of Eco systems thriving depend on the correct temperatures to thrive. The earth is made of the stuff of stars as is everything in our universe. It is impossible to quantify for all life in the universe ( im sure were not alone)as to what would be poisonous to one which would be safe to anothers consumption as in food.

This allows for a standard template technology that can be used to support colonies on a variety of exo-planets. People live under air-tight domes and explore their new homes in bio-filter suits until the planets can be sterilized and Earth-like life forms can be established, parcel by parcel. As land is cleared for more domes, the organic matter isn’t burned, it is eaten. In this way, bio-compatibility isn’t necessary. 71 Views Quora User , studied at George Brown College Answered Nov 29, 2016 · Author has 68 answers and 74.9k answer views I would say no.

Can we digest proteins, sugars, etc. from that world? Many say that the variety of life would be unlimited, so we’re very unlikely to find such compatibility. But I wonder. Perhaps on earthlike worlds—the only kind we’d be interested in—there are only a limited number of viable options for basic life patterns. Four? Ten? Fifty? Suppose after we develop our star jump capability and visit some of these worlds, we study and catalog the viable types. (Of course most likely this would have been done eons ago by predecessor races.) We would find out that we are Type 3. Therefore we would be able to survive on the worlds that had Type 3 life. Type 5 might be just marginally digestible for us, and Type 8 worlds might be deadly poison like amanita mushrooms. This is as plausible as assuming that all alien life would be poison to consume. 131 Views · View Upvoters   Douglas Drummond , BA English & Latin, University of South Florida Answered Sep 7, 2017 I think, very small.

By Brian Koberlein in Science Wire | Space  |  February 3, 2016     The star KIC 8462852 continues to display strange behavior, baffling astronomers and prompting speculation – and these musings – about advanced aliens.       Our sun is located about two-thirds of the way out from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. There are 100 billion suns in our Milky Way. Illustration via Caltech.  Recently the star KIC 8462852 (aka Tabby’s Star) has made news again because of its strange behavior. Possible explanations for its varying brightness (such as comets) don’t seem to fit the observational data, which has some speculating that the star’s behavior could be explained by the presence of an alien civilization. While many astronomers admit that is a possibility, they don’t think aliens are the likely cause. For one, mysterious behavior is not enough to conclude the cause is aliens . For another, the likelihood that an alien civilization actually exists is still a matter of some debate.  The odds of an alien civilization coexisting with humans is often calculated by the Drake equation . It was first proposed by Frank Drake in 1961. Simply take the rate at which stars form in our galaxy and multiply it by the fraction of stars with planets, the average number of planets per star that could support life, the fraction of those that actually develop life, the fraction of life bearing planets that develop civilization, the fraction of civilizations that have detectible signals, and finally the length of time a civilization might last. Crunch the numbers and you have the number of civilizations in our galaxy capable of communicating with us.  When Drake first proposed the equation, the values for each term were largely unknown, but we now have good estimates for many of them. We know that most stars have planets, and the odds of a potentially habitable planet is actually quite high, possibly as high as 100 billion in our galaxy alone.  Unfortunately the really important factors of the Drake equation are still completely unknown. On how many potentially habitable planets does life actually arise? How many of those give rise to civilizations? How long does a typical civilization last? No idea. Depending on the answer to those questions the number of civilizations in our galaxy could range from hundreds of thousands to only one.  The equation was never intended to give an absolute number, though it is often used that way. There are also alternatives such as the Sara Seager’s equation , which focuses on our ability to detect civilizations indirectly rather than requiring active communication. Just because an alien civilization is quiet, that doesn’t mean we can’t see evidence for them. Seager’s approach is to focus on stable red dwarf stars with known potentially habitable worlds. Since red dwarf stars are by far the most common, the odds that we’d find alien life near such a star is higher. She then focuses on planets that transit their home star from our vantage point and are near enough that we have a chance of observing the effects of the planet’s atmosphere on the star’s light. She estimates that there might be two inhabited worlds might be detectable in the next ten years.  Of course this presumes that life forms readily on a habitable planet and survives billions of years, which might not be the case .  The famous Drake equation, formulated by Frank Drake in the 1960s. It brings together key factors to consider when estimating the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in our Milky Way galaxy.  What make’s Tabby’s Star particularly interesting is that it hints at being evidence of an artificial structure the size of a solar system, such as a Dyson sphere, which is something only highly advanced civilizations could create. Of course the big underlying assumption here is that the more advanced a civilization is, the more likely it will build such a structure. The idea was first presented by Nikolai Kardashev in 1964 , who proposed a classification of civilizations based upon their energy use. Type I civilizations harness the resources of their home planet, such as humans today. Type II harness almost the full energy of their home star, possibly through technology such as Dyson spheres. Species within the Star Trek universe would typically be Type II. Type III are civilizations that can harness the energy of an entire galaxy, such as the Asgard of the Stargate universe.  Carl Sagan later generalized the Kardashev scale to a logarithmic function of energy use, and estimated that we were at about 0.7.  The Kardashev scale presumes that more advanced civilizations will necessarily demand more energy. Humans have so far lent credence to this idea, since our modern global civilization consumes much more energy than earlier agrarian civilizations. If our human population and demands for technological convenience grows, we will likely expand out into the solar system with a continued rise in energy consumption.  But such a future is not guaranteed. It’s also possible that we will instead reach a stable and sustainable population level, and combined with increasing energy efficiency our energy consumption may flatten. Technological civilizations may stabilize at type I rather than continuing up the scale.  That’s the real challenge with calculating the odds.  Everything we’ve pinned down so far point to a good chance that life forms on planets across the universe … but there’s still too many unknowns.  Even NASA has toyed with the idea of large space habitats. This is a painting of what one might look like on the inside, by space artist Don Davis.  Bottom line: The star KIC 8462852 continues to display strange behavior, baffling astronomers and causing speculation about advanced aliens. However, now – as in 1961, when Frank Drake formulated his famous Drake equation – the fact is that there are many unknowns, and we don’t know if our galaxy has numerous advanced civilizations … or one.

Are we alone in the universe? If so, why? If not, where is everybody? Thankfully, math can help us with these astronomically profound questions. Keep on reading to learn all about the probability of extraterrestrial life.    By  Jason Marshall, PhD,     The Math Dude        December 16, 2016                       Episode #295   Page 1 of 3 In 1967, a graduate student named Jocelyn Bell discovered something strange emanating from a region of the sky known as the Summer Triangle: pulses of radio waves repeating every 1.3373 seconds over and over again like a clock ticking slightly-slowly. It’s not every day that you find a nearly perfect clock ticking at you from the sky, so Bell and her colleagues half-jokingly called the source of the signal “LGM1”—the “LGM” being short for “Little Green Men.” We now know that this signal wasn’t from little green anythings, but was instead from a previously undiscovered type of object known as a pulsar. This was exciting, although perhaps not quite as exciting as finding aliens. A decade later, an even stranger signal fell upon a different radio telescope. This signal was unusual in many ways: it was very strong, it didn’t look like any known naturally occurring radio signal, and it seemed to be coming from “out there” (and not here on Earth). The signal was so striking that its discoverer famously wrote the word “Wow!” on the margin of a printout of the data. After ruling out obvious Earthly origins, most astronomers are convinced that the signal came from somewhere beyond Earth. The question—which still remains unanswered—is where? And from what or whom? Was the signal produced by a natural phenomena? Or might it have been broadcast by some alien intelligence? The answer to the last question is: Probably not; but maybe. Although whether or not the “Wow!” signal was alien in origin, many scientists do think that alien life is likely to be out there. And they kind of have some math to back them up. Why only kind of ? Because as we’re about to find out, at this point questions about extraterrestrial life lead to back-of-the-envelope calculations and a hefty dose of probabilities—and those probabilities are anything but certain. Stellar Statistics  So what exactly does math say about the odds that we share the universe with other intelligent life? Let’s begin with the statistics of stars and planets. All life on Earth originated on a planet, and scientists think that most other independent origins of life (if they exist) probably did the same. For various reasons, I’ll let Everyday Einstein explain someday, scientists think that life usually gets going on planets orbiting not-too-big-and-not-too-small stars similar to the Sun.        Astronomers estimate that there are roughly 100 billion of these Sun-like Goldilocks stars in our galaxy. Something like half of these live their lives orbiting one or more other stars, which makes it far less likely that they’ll have planets around them (since those planets get flung out of the system by the stars). This cuts the number of hospitable stars in half, but this is still roughly 50 billion potential life-hosting stars in our galaxy!

Credit: Albert Ziganshin / Shutterstock.com     Many other planets throughout the universe probably hosted intelligent life long before Earth did, a new study suggests.  The probability of a civilization developing on a potentially habitable alien planet would have to be less than one in 10 billion trillion — or one part in 10 to the 22nd power — for humanity to be the first technologically advanced species the cosmos has ever known, according to the study.  "To me, this implies that other intelligent, technology-producing species very likely have evolved before us," said lead author Adam Frank, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Rochester in New York. [ 13 Ways to Hunt Intelligent Alien Life ]      Do you believe alien life exists elsewhere in the universe?       Yes - We may not have found them yet, but they're out there.         No - Aliens are just part of science fiction.         I'm not sure         Get Results  Share This    "Think of it this way: Before our result, you’d be considered a pessimist if you imagined the probability of evolving a civilization on a habitable planet was, say, one in a trillion," Frank said in a statement . "But even that guess — one chance in a trillion — implies that what has happened here on Earth with humanity has in fact happened about 10 billion other times over cosmic history."  In 1961, astronomer Frank Drake devised a formula to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations that may exist today in the Milky Way.  Adam Frank and co-author Woodruff Sullivan of the University of Washington were interested in the odds that intelligent aliens have ever existed anywhere in the universe. So they tweaked the famous Drake equation , coming up with an "archaeological version" that doesn't take into account how long alien civilizations may last.  Frank and Sullivan also incorporated observations from NASA's Kepler space telescope and other instruments, which suggest that about 20 percent of all stars host planets in the life-friendly, "habitable zone," where liquid water could exist on a world's surface.     The researchers then calculated the probability that Earth was the universe's first-ever abode for intelligent life, after taking into account the number of stars in the observable universe (about 20 billion trillion, according to a recent estimate).  "From a fundamental perspective, the question is, 'Has it ever happened anywhere before?'" Frank said. "Our result is the first time anyone has been able to set any empirical answer for that question, and it is astonishingly likely that we are not the only time and place that an advanced civilization has evolved."  But this doesn't mean that there are lots of intelligent aliens out there, just waiting to be contacted, the researchers stressed.  "The universe is more than 13 billion years old," Sullivan said in the same statement. "That means that even if there have been 1,000 civilizations in our own galaxy, if they live only as long as we have been around — roughly 10,000 years — then all of them are likely already extinct. And others won’t evolve until we are long gone. For us to have much chance of success in finding another 'contemporary' active technological civilization, on average they must last much longer than our present lifetime."  (The 10,000-year figure cited by Sullivan refers to humanity's development of agriculture and other "rudimentary" technologies; mankind has been capable of sending radio waves and other electromagnetic signals out into the cosmos for just a century or so.)

In this talk, I would like to speculate a little, on the development of life in the universe, and in particular, the development of intelligent life. I shall take this to include the human race, even though much of its behaviour through out history, has been pretty stupid, and not calculated to aid the survival of the species. Two questions I shall discuss are, 'What is the probability of life existing else where in the universe?' and, 'How may life develop in the future?' It is a matter of common experience, that things get more disordered and chaotic with time. This observation can be elevated to the status of a law, the so-called Second Law of Thermodynamics. This says that the total amount of disorder, or entropy, in the universe, always increases with time. However, the Law refers only to the total amount of disorder. The order in one body can increase, provided that the amount of disorder in its surroundings increases by a greater amount. This is what happens in a living being. One can define Life to be an ordered system that can sustain itself against the tendency to disorder, and can reproduce itself. That is, it can make similar, but independent, ordered systems. To do these things, the system must convert energy in some ordered form, like food, sunlight, or electric power, into disordered energy, in the form of heat. In this way, the system can satisfy the requirement that the total amount of disorder increases, while, at the same time, increasing the order in itself and its offspring. A living being usually has two elements: a set of instructions that tell the system how to sustain and reproduce itself, and a mechanism to carry out the instructions. In biology, these two parts are called genes and metabolism. But it is worth emphasising that there need be nothing biological about them. For example, a computer virus is a program that will make copies of itself in the memory of a computer, and will transfer itself to other computers. Thus it fits the definition of a living system, that I have given. Like a biological virus, it is a rather degenerate form, because it contains only instructions or genes, and doesn't have any metabolism of its own. Instead, it reprograms the metabolism of the host computer, or cell. Some people have questioned whether viruses should count as life, because they are parasites, and can not exist independently of their hosts. But then most forms of life, ourselves included, are parasites, in that they feed off and depend for their survival on other forms of life. I think computer viruses should count as life. Maybe it says something about human nature, that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. Talk about creating life in our own image. I shall return to electronic forms of life later on. What we normally think of as 'life' is based on chains of carbon atoms, with a few other atoms, such as nitrogen or phosphorous. One can speculate that one might have life with some other chemical basis, such as silicon, but carbon seems the most favourable case, because it has the richest chemistry. That carbon atoms should exist at all, with the properties that they have, requires a fine adjustment of physical constants, such as the QCD scale, the electric charge, and even the dimension of space-time. If these constants had significantly different values, either the nucleus of the carbon atom would not be stable, or the electrons would collapse in on the nucleus. At first sight, it seems remarkable that the universe is so finely tuned. Maybe this is evidence, that the universe was specially designed to produce the human race. However, one has to be careful about such arguments, because of what is known as the Anthropic Principle. This is based on the self-evident truth, that if the universe had not been suitable for life, we wouldn't be asking why it is so finely adjusted. One can apply the Anthropic Principle, in either its Strong, or Weak, versions. For the Strong Anthropic Principle, one supposes that there are many different universes, each with different values of the physical constants. In a small number, the values will allow the existence of objects like carbon atoms, which can act as the building blocks of living systems. Since we must live in one of these universes, we should not be surprised that the physical constants are finely tuned. If they weren't, we wouldn't be here. The strong form of the Anthropic Principle is not very satisfactory. What operational meaning can one give to the existence of all those other universes? And if they are separate from our own universe, how can what happens in them, affect our universe. Instead, I shall adopt what is known as the Weak Anthropic Principle. That is, I shall take the values of the physical constants, as given. But I shall see what conclusions can be drawn, from the fact that life exists on this planet, at this stage in the history of the universe. There was no carbon, when the universe began in the Big Bang, about 15 billion years ago. It was so hot, that all the matter would have been in the form of particles, called protons and neutrons. There would initially have been equal numbers of protons and neutrons. However, as the universe expanded, it would have cooled. About a minute after the Big Bang, the temperature would have fallen to about a billion degrees, about a hundred times the temperature in the Sun. At this temperature, the neutrons will start to decay into more protons. If this had been all that happened, all the matter in the universe would have ended up as the simplest element, hydrogen, whose nucleus consists of a single proton. However, some of the neutrons collided with protons, and stuck together to form the next simplest element, helium, whose nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons. But no heavier elements, like carbon or oxygen, would have been formed in the early universe. It is difficult to imagine that one could build a living system, out of just hydrogen and helium, and anyway the early universe was still far too hot for atoms to combine into molecules. The universe would have continued to expand, and cool. But some regions would have had slightly higher densities than others. The gravitational attraction of the extra matter in those regions, would slow down their expansion, and eventually stop it. Instead, they would collapse to form galaxies and stars, starting from about two billion years after the Big Bang. Some of the early stars would have been more massive than our Sun. They would have been hotter than the Sun, and would have burnt the original hydrogen and helium, into heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and iron. This could have taken only a few hundred million years. After that, some of the stars would have exploded as supernovas, and scattered the heavy elements back into space, to form the raw material for later generations of stars. Other stars are too far away, for us to be able to see directly, if they have planets going round them. But certain stars, called pulsars, give off regular pulses of radio waves. We observe a slight variation in the rate of some pulsars, and this is interpreted as indicating that they are being disturbed, by having Earth sized planets going round them. Planets going round pulsars are unlikely to have life, because any living beings would have been killed, in the supernova explosion that led to the star becoming a pulsar. But, the fact that several pulsars are observed to have planets suggests that a reasonable fraction of the hundred billion stars in our galaxy may also have planets. The necessary planetary conditions for our form of life may therefore have existed from about four billion years after the Big Bang. Our solar system was formed about four and a half billion years ago, or about ten billion years after the Big Bang, from gas contaminated with the remains of earlier stars. The Earth was formed largely out of the heavier elements, including carbon and oxygen. Somehow, some of these atoms came to be arranged in the form of molecules of DNA. This has the famous double helix form, discovered by Crick and Watson, in a hut on the New Museum site in Cambridge. Linking the two chains in the helix, are pairs of nucleic acids. There are four types of nucleic acid, adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thiamine. I'm afraid my speech synthesiser is not very good, at pronouncing their names. Obviously, it was not designed for molecular biologists. An adenine on one chain is always matched with a thiamine on the other chain, and a guanine with a cytosine. Thus the sequence of nucleic acids on one chain defines a unique, complementary sequence, on the other chain. The two chains can then separate and each act as templates to build further chains. Thus DNA molecules can reproduce the genetic information, coded in their sequences of nucleic acids. Sections of the sequence can also be used to make proteins and other chemicals, which can carry out the instructions, coded in the sequence, and assemble the raw material for DNA to reproduce itself. We do not know how DNA molecules first appeared. The chances against a DNA molecule arising by random fluctuations are very small. Some people have therefore suggested that life came to Earth from elsewhere, and that there are seeds of life floating round in the galaxy. However, it seems unlikely that DNA could survive for long in the radiation in space. And even if it could, it would not really help explain the origin of life, because the time available since the formation of carbon is only just over double the age of the Earth. One possibility is that the formation of something like DNA, which could reproduce itself, is extremely unlikely. However, in a universe with a very large, or infinite, number of stars, one would expect it to occur in a few stellar systems, but they would be very widely separated. The fact that life happened to occur on Earth, is not however surprising or unlikely. It is just an application of the Weak Anthropic Principle: if life had appeared instead on another planet, we would be asking why it had occurred there. If the appearance of life on a given planet was very unlikely, one might have expected it to take a long time. More precisely, one might have expected life to appear just in time for the subsequent evolution to intelligent beings, like us, to have occurred before the cut off, provided by the life time of the Sun. This is about ten billion years, after which the Sun will swell up and engulf the Earth. An intelligent form of life, might have mastered space travel, and be able to escape to another star. But otherwise, life on Earth would be doomed. There is fossil evidence, that there was some form of life on Earth, about three and a half billion years ago. This may have been only 500 million years after the Earth became stable and cool enough, for life to develop. But life could have taken 7 billion years to develop, and still have left time to evolve to beings like us, who could ask about the origin of life. If the probability of life developing on a given planet, is very small, why did it happen on Earth, in about one 14th of the time available. The early appearance of life on Earth suggests that there's a good chance of the spontaneous generation of life, in suitable conditions. Maybe there was some simpler form of organisation, which built up DNA. Once DNA appeared, it would have been so successful, that it might have completely replaced the earlier forms. We don't know what these earlier forms would have been. One possibility is RNA. This is like DNA, but rather simpler, and without the double helix structure. Short lengths of RNA, could reproduce themselves like DNA, and might eventually build up to DNA. One can not make nucleic acids in the laboratory, from non-living material, let alone RNA. But given 500 million years, and oceans covering most of the Earth, there might be a reasonable probability of RNA, being made by chance. As DNA reproduced itself, there would have been random errors. Many of these errors would have been harmful, and would have died out. Some would have been neutral. That is they would not have affected the function of the gene. Such errors would contribute to a gradual genetic drift, which seems to occur in all populations. And a few errors would have been favourable to the survival of the species. These would have been chosen by Darwinian natural selection. The process of biological evolution was very slow at first. It took two and a half billion years, to evolve from the earliest cells to multi-cell animals, and another billion years to evolve through fish and reptiles, to mammals. But then evolution seemed to have speeded up. It only took about a hundred million years, to develop from the early mammals to us. The reason is, fish contain most of the important human organs, and mammals, essentially all of them. All that was required to evolve from early mammals, like lemurs, to humans, was a bit of fine-tuning. But with the human race, evolution reached a critical stage, comparable in importance with the development of DNA. This was the development of language, and particularly written language. It meant that information can be passed on, from generation to generation, other than genetically, through DNA. There has been no detectable change in human DNA, brought about by biological evolution, in the ten thousand years of recorded history. But the amount of knowledge handed on from generation to generation has grown enormously. The DNA in human beings contains about three billion nucleic acids. However, much of the information coded in this sequence, is redundant, or is inactive. So the total amount of useful information in our genes, is probably something like a hundred million bits. One bit of information is the answer to a yes no question. By contrast, a paper back novel might contain two million bits of information. So a human is equivalent to 50 Mills and Boon romances. A major national library can contain about five million books, or about ten trillion bits. So the amount of information handed down in books, is a hundred thousand times as much as in DNA. Even more important, is the fact that the information in books, can be changed, and updated, much more rapidly. It has taken us several million years to evolve from the apes. During that time, the useful information in our DNA, has probably changed by only a few million bits. So the rate of biological evolution in humans, is about a bit a year. By contrast, there are about 50,000 new books published in the English language each year, containing of the order of a hundred billion bits of information. Of course, the great majority of this information is garbage, and no use to any form of life. But, even so, the rate at which useful information can be added is millions, if not billions, higher than with DNA. This has meant that we have entered a new phase of evolution. At first, evolution proceeded by natural selection, from random mutations. This Darwinian phase, lasted about three and a half billion years, and produced us, beings who developed language, to exchange information. But in the last ten thousand years or so, we have been in what might be called, an external transmission phase. In this, the internal record of information, handed down to succeeding generations in DNA, has not changed significantly. But the external record, in books, and other long lasting forms of storage, has grown enormously. Some people would use the term, evolution, only for the internally transmitted genetic material, and would object to it being applied to information handed down externally. But I think that is too narrow a view. We are more than just our genes. We may be no stronger, or inherently more intelligent, than our cave man ancestors. But what distinguishes us from them, is the knowledge that we have accumulated over the last ten thousand years, and particularly, over the last three hundred. I think it is legitimate to take a broader view, and include externally transmitted information, as well as DNA, in the evolution of the human race. The time scale for evolution, in the external transmission period, is the time scale for accumulation of information. This used to be hundreds, or even thousands, of years. But now this time scale has shrunk to about 50 years, or less. On the other hand, the brains with which we process this information have evolved only on the Darwinian time scale, of hundreds of thousands of years. This is beginning to cause problems. In the 18th century, there was said to be a man who had read every book written. But nowadays, if you read one book a day, it would take you about 15,000 years to read through the books in a national Library. By which time, many more books would have been written. This has meant that no one person can be the master of more than a small corner of human knowledge. People have to specialise, in narrower and narrower fields. This is likely to be a major limitation in the future. We certainly can not continue, for long, with the exponential rate of growth of knowledge that we have had in the last three hundred years. An even greater limitation and danger for future generations, is that we still have the instincts, and in particular, the aggressive impulses, that we had in cave man days. Aggression, in the form of subjugating or killing other men, and taking their women and food, has had definite survival advantage, up to the present time. But now it could destroy the entire human race, and much of the rest of life on Earth. A nuclear war, is still the most immediate danger, but there are others, such as the release of a genetically engineered virus. Or the green house effect becoming unstable. There is no time, to wait for Darwinian evolution, to make us more intelligent, and better natured. But we are now entering a new phase, of what might be called, self designed evolution, in which we will be able to change and improve our DNA. There is a project now on, to map the entire sequence of human DNA. It will cost a few billion dollars, but that is chicken feed, for a project of this importance. Once we have read the book of life, we will start writing in corrections. At first, these changes will be confined to the repair of genetic defects, like cystic fibrosis, and muscular dystrophy. These are controlled by single genes, and so are fairly easy to identify, and correct. Other qualities, such as intelligence, are probably controlled by a large number of genes. It will be much more difficult to find them, and work out the relations between them. Nevertheless, I am sure that during the next century, people will discover how to modify both intelligence, and instincts like aggression. Laws will be passed, against genetic engineering with humans. But some people won't be able to resist the temptation, to improve human characteristics, such as size of memory, resistance to disease, and length of life. Once such super humans appear, there are going to be major political problems, with the unimproved humans, who won't be able to compete. Presumably, they will die out, or become unimportant. Instead, there will be a race of self-designing beings, who are improving themselves at an ever-increasing rate. If this race manages to redesign itself, to reduce or eliminate the risk of self-destruction, it will probably spread out, and colonise other planets and stars. However, long distance space travel, will be difficult for chemically based life forms, like DNA. The natural lifetime for such beings is short, compared to the travel time. According to the theory of relativity, nothing can travel faster than light. So the round trip to the nearest star would take at least 8 years, and to the centre of the galaxy, about a hundred thousand years. In science fiction, they overcome this difficulty, by space warps, or travel through extra dimensions. But I don't think these will ever be possible, no matter how intelligent life becomes. In the theory of relativity, if one can travel faster than light, one can also travel back in time. This would lead to problems with people going back, and changing the past. One would also expect to have seen large numbers of tourists from the future, curious to look at our quaint, old-fashioned ways. It might be possible to use genetic engineering, to make DNA based life survive indefinitely, or at least for a hundred thousand years. But an easier way, which is almost within our capabilities already, would be to send machines. These could be designed to last long enough for interstellar travel. When they arrived at a new star, they could land on a suitable planet, and mine material to produce more machines, which could be sent on to yet more stars. These machines would be a new form of life, based on mechanical and electronic components, rather than macromolecules. They could eventually replace DNA based life, just as DNA may have replaced an earlier form of life. This mechanical life could also be self-designing. Thus it seems that the external transmission period of evolution, will have been just a very short interlude, between the Darwinian phase, and a biological, or mechanical, self design phase. This is shown on this next diagram, which is not to scale, because there's no way one can show a period of ten thousand years, on the same scale as billions of years. How long the self-design phase will last is open to question. It may be unstable, and life may destroy itself, or get into a dead end. If it does not, it should be able to survive the death of the Sun, in about 5 billion years, by moving to planets around other stars. Most stars will have burnt out in another 15 billion years or so, and the universe will be approaching a state of complete disorder, according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. But Freeman Dyson has shown that, despite this, life could adapt to the ever-decreasing supply of ordered energy, and therefore could, in principle, continue forever. What are the chances that we will encounter some alien form of life, as we explore the galaxy. If the argument about the time scale for the appearance of life on Earth is correct, there ought to be many other stars, whose planets have life on them. Some of these stellar systems could have formed 5 billion years before the Earth. So why is the galaxy not crawling with self designing mechanical or biological life forms? Why hasn't the Earth been visited, and even colonised. I discount suggestions that UFO's contain beings from outer space. I think any visits by aliens, would be much more obvious, and probably also, much more unpleasant. What is the explanation of why we have not been visited? One possibility is that the argument, about the appearance of life on Earth, is wrong. Maybe the probability of life spontaneously appearing is so low, that Earth is the only planet in the galaxy, or in the observable universe, in which it happened. Another possibility is that there was a reasonable probability of forming self reproducing systems, like cells, but that most of these forms of life did not evolve intelligence. We are used to thinking of intelligent life, as an inevitable consequence of evolution. But the Anthropic Principle should warn us to be wary of such arguments. It is more likely that evolution is a random process, with intelligence as only one of a large number of possible outcomes. It is not clear that intelligence has any long-term survival value. Bacteria, and other single cell organisms, will live on, if all other life on Earth is wiped out by our actions. There is support for the view that intelligence, was an unlikely development for life on Earth, from the chronology of evolution. It took a very long time, two and a half billion years, to go from single cells to multi-cell beings, which are a necessary precursor to intelligence. This is a good fraction of the total time available, before the Sun blows up. So it would be consistent with the hypothesis, that the probability for life to develop intelligence, is low. In this case, we might expect to find many other life forms in the galaxy, but we are unlikely to find intelligent life. Another way, in which life could fail to develop to an intelligent stage, would be if an asteroid or comet were to collide with the planet. We have just observed the collision of a comet, Schumacher-Levi, with Jupiter. It produced a series of enormous fireballs. It is thought the collision of a rather smaller body with the Earth, about 70 million years ago, was responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs. A few small early mammals survived, but anything as large as a human, would have almost certainly been wiped out. It is difficult to say how often such collisions occur, but a reasonable guess might be every twenty million years, on average. If this figure is correct, it would mean that intelligent life on Earth has developed only because of the lucky chance that there have been no major collisions in the last 70 million years. Other planets in the galaxy, on which life has developed, may not have had a long enough collision free period to evolve intelligent beings. A third possibility is that there is a reasonable probability for life to form, and to evolve to intelligent beings, in the external transmission phase. But at that point, the system becomes unstable, and the intelligent life destroys itself. This would be a very pessimistic conclusion. I very much hope it isn't true. I prefer a fourth possibility: there are other forms of intelligent life out there, but that we have been overlooked. There used to be a project called SETI, the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. It involved scanning the radio frequencies, to see if we could pick up signals from alien civilisations. I thought this project was worth supporting, though it was cancelled due to a lack of funds. But we should have been wary of answering back, until we have develop a bit further. Meeting a more advanced civilisation, at our present stage, might be a bit like the original inhabitants of America meeting Columbus. I don't think they were better off for it.

Where are they? (ESO/José Francisco Salgado (josefrancisco.org))    By Dirk Schulze-Makuch    airspacemag.com   May 3, 2016         For decades the famous Drake Equation has been used to estimate the number of technologically advanced species in the universe. Now Adam Frank from the University of Rochester and Woody Sullivan from the University of Washington take a slightly different approach to the problem and suggest a modification of the Drake Equation . Instead of estimating how many civilizations are out there to communicate with today, they estimate how many civilizations have been out there since the beginning of the Universe.     At first glance this seems to be only a slight semantic difference, but it is not. A big unknown in the original Drake Equation is the average lifetime of a civilization during which they might be available to communicate with us. This window might be very short, especially if technological species are typically replaced by machines . Or it could be very long.   Reframing the question makes longevity a moot point. Frank and Sullivan ask: What is the chance that we are the only technological species and always have been ? If we put the question this way, the Drake Equation boils down to A = N ast * f bt , where A is the number of technological species that have ever formed over the history of the observable universe, N ast are all the astronomical unknowns (which we now have a much better handle on than we did in 1961), and f bt are the biological unknowns, which are still many—including the fraction of suitable planets on which life actually appears, the fraction of those planets on which intelligent life emerges, and the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space.   Based on recent exoplanet discoveries , Frank and Sullivan assume that one-fifth of all stars have habitable planets in orbit around them. This leads them to conclude that there should be other advanced technological civilization out there, unless the chance for developing such a civilization on a habitable planet in the observable universe is less than 1 in 10 24 (a 1 with 24 zeros!). For our own Milky Way galaxy, the odds of being the only technologically advanced civilization are 1 in 60 billion. Thus, it’s very likely that other intelligent, technologically advanced species evolved before us. Even if only one in every million stars hosts a technologically advanced species today, that would still yield a total of about 300,000 such civilizations in the whole galaxy.   The Archilles’ heel of these statistical estimates is of course the biological uncertainties; Earth is still the only planet where we know life exists. The appearance of life may be extremely unlikely, and so might the evolution of technology. After all, there are many intelligent species on our planet, including dolphins, octopi, apes, parrots, and elephants, but only once in 4.6 billion years has a technologically advanced species evolved. And life cannot have appeared in the very early Universe until heavier elements produced by the explosions of many supernovas became abundant.   Still, Frank and Sullivan think their 1 in 10 24 estimate constitutes a “pessimism line”—a lower bound on the probability that one or more technological species has evolved over time. And that’s good news for SETI, even if it doesn’t help us know where to look.     Like this article?

A graphical representation of the Arecibo message , humanity's first attempt to use radio waves to actively communicate its existence to alien civilizations    The Fermi paradox , or Fermi's paradox , named after physicist Enrico Fermi , is the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence and high probability estimates [1] for the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations. [2] The basic points of the argument, made by physicists  Enrico Fermi (1901–1954) and Michael H. Hart (born 1932), are:   There are billions of stars in the galaxy that are similar to the Sun , [3] [4] and many of these stars are billions of years older than the Solar system . [5] [6]  With high probability, some of these stars have Earth -like planets, [7] [8] and if the Earth is typical, some may have developed intelligent life.  Some of these civilizations may have developed interstellar travel , a step the Earth is investigating now.  Even at the slow pace of currently envisioned interstellar travel, the Milky Way galaxy could be completely traversed in a few million years. [9]   According to this line of reasoning, the Earth should have already been visited by extraterrestrial aliens. In an informal conversation, Fermi noted no convincing evidence of this, leading him to ask, "Where is everybody?" [10] [11] There have been many attempts to explain the Fermi paradox, [12] [13] primarily either suggesting that intelligent extraterrestrial life is extremely rare or proposing reasons that such civilizations have not contacted or visited Earth.

The first aspect of the Fermi paradox is a function of the scale or the large numbers involved: there are an estimated 200–400 billion stars in the Milky Way [14] (2–4 × 10 11 ) and 70 sextillion (7×10 22 ) in the observable universe . [15] Even if intelligent life occurs on only a minuscule percentage of planets around these stars, there might still be a great number of extant civilizations, and if the percentage were high enough it would produce a significant number of extant civilizations in the Milky Way. This assumes the mediocrity principle , by which the Earth is a typical planet .  The second aspect of the Fermi paradox is the argument of probability: given intelligent life's ability to overcome scarcity, and its tendency to colonize new habitats , it seems possible that at least some civilizations would be technologically advanced, seek out new resources in space, and colonize their own star system and, subsequently, surrounding star systems. Since there is no significant evidence on Earth, or elsewhere in the known universe, of other intelligent life after 13.8 billion years of the universe's history, there is a conflict requiring a resolution. Some examples of possible resolutions are that intelligent life is rarer than we think, that our assumptions about the general development or behavior of intelligent species are flawed, or, more radically, that our current scientific understanding of the nature of the universe itself is quite incomplete.  The Fermi paradox can be asked in two ways. [16] The first is, "Why are no aliens or their artifacts found here on Earth, or in the Solar System?" If interstellar travel is possible, even the "slow" kind nearly within the reach of Earth technology, then it would only take from 5 million to 50 million years to colonize the galaxy. [17] This is relatively brief on a geological scale , let alone a cosmological one . Since there are many stars older than the Sun, and since intelligent life might have evolved earlier elsewhere, the question then becomes why the galaxy has not been colonized already. Even if colonization is impractical or undesirable to all alien civilizations, large-scale exploration of the galaxy could be possible by probes . These might leave detectable artifacts in the Solar System, such as old probes or evidence of mining activity, but none of these have been observed.  The second form of the question is "Why do we see no signs of intelligence elsewhere in the universe?" This version does not assume interstellar travel, but includes other galaxies as well. For distant galaxies, travel times may well explain the lack of alien visits to Earth, but a sufficiently advanced civilization could potentially be observable over a significant fraction of the size of the observable universe . [18] Even if such civilizations are rare, the scale argument indicates they should exist somewhere at some point during the history of the universe, and since they could be detected from far away over a considerable period of time, many more potential sites for their origin are within range of our observation. It is unknown whether the paradox is stronger for our galaxy or for the universe as a whole. [19]  Criticism of logical basis  The Fermi paradox has been criticized as being based on an inappropriate use of propositional logic . According to a 1985 paper by Robert Freitas , when recast as a statement in modal logic , the paradox no longer exists, and carries no probative value. [20]  History and name     Los Alamos National Laboratory    In 1950, while working at Los Alamos National Laboratory , Fermi had a casual conversation while walking to lunch with colleagues Emil Konopinski , Edward Teller and Herbert York . [21] The men discussed a recent spate of UFO reports and an Alan Dunn cartoon [22] facetiously blaming the disappearance of municipal trashcans on marauding aliens. The conversation shifted to other subjects, until during lunch Fermi suddenly exclaimed, "Where are they?" (alternatively, "Where is everybody?"). Teller remembers, "The result of his question was general laughter because of the strange fact that in spite of Fermi's question coming from the clear blue, everybody around the table seemed to understand at once that he was talking about extraterrestrial life." [23] Herbert York recalls that Fermi followed up on his comment with a series of calculations on the probability of Earth-like planets, the probability of life, the likely rise and duration of high technology, etc., and concluded that we ought to have been visited long ago and many times over.  Although Fermi's name is most commonly associated with the paradox, he was not the first to ask the question. An earlier implicit mention was by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in an unpublished manuscript from 1933. [24] He noted "people deny the presence of intelligent beings on the planets of the universe" because "(i) if such beings exist they would have visited Earth, and (ii) if such civilizations existed then they would have given us some sign of their existence." This was not a paradox for others, who took this to imply the absence of ETs, but it was for him, since he himself was a strong believer in extraterrestrial life and the possibility of space travel. Therefore, he proposed what is now known as the zoo hypothesis and speculated that mankind is not yet ready for higher beings to contact us. [25] That Tsiolkovsky himself may not have been the first to discover the paradox is suggested by his above-mentioned reference to other people's reasons for denying the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations.  Michael H. Hart published in 1975 a detailed examination of the paradox, [9] which has since become a theoretical reference point for much of the research into what is now sometimes known as the Fermi–Hart paradox . [26]  Geoffrey A. Landis prefers that name on the grounds that "while Fermi is credited with first asking the question, Hart was the first to do a rigorous analysis showing that the problem is not trivial, and also the first to publish his results". [27]  Robert H. Gray argues that the term Fermi paradox is a misnomer, since in his view it is neither a paradox nor due to Fermi; he instead prefers the name Hart–Tipler argument , acknowledging Michael Hart as its originator, but also the substantial contribution of Frank J. Tipler in extending Hart's arguments. [28]  Other names closely related to Fermi's question ("Where are they?") include the Great Silence , [29] [30] [31] [32] and silentium universi [32] (Latin for "silence of the universe"), though these only refer to one portion of the Fermi Paradox, that we see no evidence of other civilizations.  Drake equation  Main article: Drake equation  The theories and principles in the Drake equation are closely related to the Fermi paradox. [33] The equation was formulated by Frank Drake in 1961 in an attempt to find a systematic means to evaluate the numerous probabilities involved in the existence of alien life. The speculative equation considers the rate of star formation in the galaxy; the fraction of stars with planets and the number per star that are habitable ; the fraction of those planets that develop life; the fraction that develop intelligent life; the fraction that have detectable, technological intelligent life; and finally the length of time such communicable civilizations are detectable. The fundamental problem is that the last four terms are completely unknown, rendering statistical estimates impossible.  The Drake equation has been used by both optimists and pessimists, with wildly differing results. The original meeting, including Frank Drake and Carl Sagan , speculated that the number of civilizations was roughly equal to the lifetime in years, and there were probably between 1000 and 100,000,000 civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. [34] Conversely, Frank Tipler and John D. Barrow used pessimistic numbers and speculated that the average number of civilizations in a galaxy is much less than one. [35]  Empirical projects  There are two parts of the Fermi paradox that rely on empirical evidence—that there are many potential habitable planets , and that we see no evidence of life. The first point, that many suitable planets exist, was an assumption in Fermi's time that is gaining ground with the discovery of many exoplanets , and models predicting billions of habitable worlds in our galaxy. [36]  The second part of the paradox, that we see no evidence of extraterrestrial life, is also an active field of scientific research. This includes both efforts to find any indication of life, [37] and efforts specifically directed to finding intelligent life. These searches have been made since 1960, and several are ongoing. [38]  Mainstream astronomy and SETI     An artist's depiction of the "little green man" described in the novel Martians, Go Home    Although astronomers do not usually search for extraterrestrials, they have observed phenomena that they could not immediately explain without positing an intelligent civilization as the source. For example, pulsars , when first discovered in 1967, were called little green men (LGM) because of the precise repetition of their pulses. [39] In all cases, explanations with no need for intelligent life have been found for such observations, [40] but the possibility of discovery remains. [41] Proposed examples include asteroid mining that would change the appearance of debris disks around stars, [42] or spectral lines from nuclear waste disposal in stars. [43] An ongoing example is the unusual transit light curves of star KIC 8462852 , where natural interpretations are not fully convincing. [44] Although most likely a natural explanation will emerge, some scientists are investigating the remote possibility that it could be a sign of alien technology, such as a Dyson swarm . [45] [46] [47]  Electromagnetic emissions  Further information: SETI , Project Ozma , Project Cyclops , Project Phoenix (SETI) , SERENDIP , and Allen Telescope Array      Radio telescopes are often used by SETI projects    Radio technology and the ability to construct a radio telescope are presumed to be a natural advance for technological species, [48] theoretically creating effects that might be detected over interstellar distances. The careful searching for non-natural radio emissions from space may lead to the detection of alien civilizations. Sensitive alien observers of the Solar System , for example, would note unusually intense radio waves for a G2 star due to Earth's television and telecommunication broadcasts. In the absence of an apparent natural cause, alien observers might infer the existence of a terrestrial civilization. It should be noted however that the most sensitive radio telescopes currently available on Earth would not be able to detect non-directional radio signals even at a fraction of a light-year , so it is questionable whether any such signals could be detected by an extraterrestrial civilization. Such signals could be either "accidental" by-products of a civilization, or deliberate attempts to communicate, such as the Arecibo message . A number of astronomers and observatories have attempted and are attempting to detect such evidence, mostly through the SETI organization. Several decades of SETI analysis have not revealed any unusually bright or meaningfully repetitive radio emissions.  Direct planetary observation     A composite picture of Earth at night, created with data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS). Large-scale artificial lighting produced by the human civilization is detectable from space.    Exoplanet detection and classification is a very active sub-discipline in astronomy, and the first possibly terrestrial planet discovered within a star's habitable zone was found in 2007. [49] New refinements in exoplanet detection methods , and use of existing methods from space (such as the Kepler Mission , launched in 2009) are starting to detect and characterize Earth-size planets, and determine if they are within the habitable zones of their stars. Such observational refinements may allow us to better gauge how common potentially habitable worlds are. [50]  Conjectures about interstellar probes  Further information: Von Neumann probe and Bracewell probe  Self-replicating probes could exhaustively explore a galaxy the size of the Milky Way in as little as a million years. [9] If even a single civilization in the Milky Way attempted this, such probes could spread throughout the entire galaxy. Another speculation for contact with an alien probe—one that would be trying to find human beings—is an alien Bracewell probe . Such a hypothetical device would be an autonomous space probe whose purpose is to seek out and communicate with alien civilizations (as opposed to Von Neumann probes, which are usually described as purely exploratory). These were proposed as an alternative to carrying a slow speed-of-light dialogue between vastly distant neighbors. Rather than contending with the long delays a radio dialogue would suffer, a probe housing an artificial intelligence would seek out an alien civilization to carry on a close-range communication with the discovered civilization. The findings of such a probe would still have to be transmitted to the home civilization at light speed, but an information-gathering dialogue could be conducted in real time. [51]  Attempts to find alien probes  Direct exploration of the Solar System has yielded no evidence indicating a visit by aliens or their probes. Detailed exploration of areas of the Solar System where resources would be plentiful may yet produce evidence of alien exploration, [52] [53] though the entirety of the Solar System is vast and difficult to investigate. Attempts to signal, attract, or activate hypothetical Bracewell probes in Earth's vicinity have not succeeded. [54]  Conjectures about stellar-scale artifacts  Further information: Dyson sphere , Kardashev scale , Alderson disk , Matrioshka brain , and Stellar engine     A variant of the speculative Dyson sphere . Such large scale artifacts would drastically alter the spectrum of a star.    In 1959, Freeman Dyson observed that every developing human civilization constantly increases its energy consumption, and, he conjectured, a civilization might try to harness a large part of the energy produced by a star. He proposed that a Dyson sphere could be a possible means: a shell or cloud of objects enclosing a star to absorb and utilize as much radiant energy as possible. Such a feat of astroengineering would drastically alter the observed spectrum of the star involved, changing it at least partly from the normal emission lines of a natural stellar atmosphere to those of black body radiation , probably with a peak in the infrared . Dyson speculated that advanced alien civilizations might be detected by examining the spectra of stars and searching for such an altered spectrum. [55] [56] [57]  There have been some attempts to find evidence of the existence of Dyson spheres that would alter the spectra of their core stars. [58] Direct observation of thousands of galaxies has shown no explicit evidence of artificial construction or modifications. [56] [57] [59] [60] In October 2015, there was some speculation that a pattern of light from star KIC 8462852 , observed by the Kepler Space Telescope , could have been a result of Dyson sphere construction. [61] [62]  Hypothetical explanations for the paradox  Extraterrestrial life is rare or non-existent  Main article: Rare Earth hypothesis  Those who think that intelligent extraterrestrial life is (nearly) impossible argue that the conditions needed for the evolution of life—or at least the evolution of biological complexity —are rare or even unique to Earth. Under this assumption, called the rare Earth hypothesis , a rejection of the mediocrity principle , complex multicellular life is regarded as exceedingly unusual. [63]  The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the evolution of biological complexity requires a host of fortuitous circumstances, such as a galactic habitable zone , a central star and planetary system having the requisite character, the circumstellar habitable zone , a right sized terrestrial planet, the advantage of a giant guardian like Jupiter and a large natural satellite , conditions needed to ensure the planet has a magnetosphere and plate tectonics , the chemistry of the lithosphere , atmosphere , and oceans, the role of "evolutionary pumps" such as massive glaciation and rare bolide impacts, and whatever led to the appearance of the eukaryote  cell , sexual reproduction and the Cambrian explosion .  No other intelligent species have arisen  It is possible that even if complex life is common, intelligence (and consequently civilizations) is not. [64] While there are remote sensing techniques that could perhaps detect life-bearing planets without relying on the signs of technology, [65] [66] none of them has any ability to tell if any detected life is intelligent. This is sometimes referred to as the "algae vs. alumnae" problem. [67]  Intelligent alien species lack advanced technology  It may be that while alien species with intelligence exist, they are primitive or have not reached the level of technological advancement necessary to communicate. Along with non-intelligent life, such civilizations would be also very difficult for us to detect, [67] short of a visit by a probe, a trip that would take hundreds of thousands of years with current technology. [68] To skeptics, the fact that in the history of life on the Earth only one species has developed a civilization to the point of being capable of spaceflight and radio technology, lends more credence to the idea that technologically advanced civilizations are rare in the universe. [69]  It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself  See also: Great Filter     A 23-kiloton tower shot called BADGER , fired as part of the Operation Upshot–Knothole  nuclear test series .    This is the argument that technological civilizations may usually or invariably destroy themselves before or shortly after developing radio or spaceflight technology. Possible means of annihilation are many, [70] including war, accidental environmental contamination or damage, resource depletion, climate change , [71] or poorly designed artificial intelligence . This general theme is explored both in fiction and in scientific hypothesizing. [72] In 1966, Sagan and Shklovskii speculated that technological civilizations will either tend to destroy themselves within a century of developing interstellar communicative capability or master their self-destructive tendencies and survive for billion-year timescales. [73] Self-annihilation may also be viewed in terms of thermodynamics: insofar as life is an ordered system that can sustain itself against the tendency to disorder, the "external transmission" or interstellar communicative phase may be the point at which the system becomes unstable and self-destructs. [74]  It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others  See also: Technological singularity and Von Neumann probe  Another hypothesis is that an intelligent species beyond a certain point of technological capability will destroy other intelligent species as they appear. The idea that something , or someone, might be destroying intelligent life in the universe has been explored in the scientific literature. [29] A species might undertake such extermination out of expansionist motives, paranoia, or aggression. In 1981, cosmologist Edward Harrison argued that such behavior would be an act of prudence: an intelligent species that has overcome its own self-destructive tendencies might view any other species bent on galactic expansion as a threat. [75] It has also been suggested that a successful alien species would be a superpredator , as are humans. [76] [77]  Periodic extinction by natural events  New life might commonly die out due to runaway heating or cooling on their fledgling planets. [78] On Earth, there have been numerous major extinction events that destroyed the majority of complex species alive at the time; the extinction of the dinosaurs is the best known example. These are thought to have been caused by events such as impact from a large meteorite, massive volcanic eruptions, or astronomical events such as gamma-ray bursts . [79] It may be the case that such extinction events are common throughout the universe and periodically destroy intelligent life, or at least its civilizations, before the species is able to develop the technology to communicate with other species. [80]  Inflation hypothesis and the youngness argument  Cosmologist Alan Guth proposed a multi-verse solution to the Fermi paradox. This hypothesis uses the synchronous gauge probability distribution, with the result that young universes exceedingly outnumber older ones (by a factor of e 10 37 for every second of age). Therefore, averaged over all universes, universes with civilizations will almost always have just one, the first to develop. However, Guth notes "Perhaps this argument explains why SETI has not found any signals from alien civilizations, but I find it more plausible that it is merely a symptom that the synchronous gauge probability distribution is not the right one." [81]  Intelligent civilizations are too far apart in space or time      NASA 's conception of the Terrestrial Planet Finder    It may be that non-colonizing technologically capable alien civilizations exist, but that they are simply too far apart for meaningful two-way communication. [82] If two civilizations are separated by several thousand light-years, it is possible that one or both cultures may become extinct before meaningful dialogue can be established. Human searches may be able to detect their existence, but communication will remain impossible because of distance. It has been suggested that this problem might be ameliorated somewhat if contact/communication is made through a Bracewell probe . In this case at least one partner in the exchange may obtain meaningful information. Alternatively, a civilization may simply broadcast its knowledge, and leave it to the receiver to make what they may of it. This is similar to the transmission of information from ancient civilizations to the present, [83] and humanity has undertaken similar activities like the Arecibo message , which could transfer information about Earth's intelligent species, even if it never yields a response or does not yield a response in time for humanity to receive it. It is also possible that archaeological evidence of past civilizations may be detected through deep space observations. [84]  A related speculation by Sagan and Newman suggests that if other civilizations exist, and are transmitting and exploring, their signals and probes simply have not arrived yet. [85] However, critics have noted that this is unlikely, since it requires that humanity's advancement has occurred at a very special point in time, while the Milky Way is in transition from empty to full. This is a tiny fraction of the lifespan of a galaxy under ordinary assumptions and calculations resulting from them, so the likelihood that we are in the midst of this transition is considered low in the paradox. [86]  Lack of resources to spread physically throughout the galaxy  See also: Project Daedalus , Project Orion (nuclear propulsion) , and Project Longshot  Many speculations about the ability of an alien culture to colonize other star systems are based on the idea that interstellar travel is technologically feasible. While the current understanding of physics rules out the possibility of faster-than-light travel, it appears that there are no major theoretical barriers to the construction of "slow" interstellar ships, even though the engineering required is considerably beyond our present capabilities. This idea underlies the concept of the Von Neumann probe and the Bracewell probe as a potential evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence.  It is possible, however, that present scientific knowledge cannot properly gauge the feasibility and costs of such interstellar colonization. Theoretical barriers may not yet be understood, and the resources needed may be so great as to make it unlikely that any civilization could afford to attempt it. Even if interstellar travel and colonization are possible, they may be difficult, leading to a colonization model based on percolation theory . [87] Colonization efforts may not occur as an unstoppable rush, but rather as an uneven tendency to "percolate" outwards, within an eventual slowing and termination of the effort given the enormous costs involved and the expectation that colonies will inevitably develop a culture and civilization of their own. Colonization may thus occur in "clusters," with large areas remaining uncolonized at any one time. [87]  If exploration, or backup from a home system disaster, is the primary motive for expansion, then it is possible that mind uploading and similar technologies may reduce the desire to colonize by replacing physical travel with much less-expensive communication. [88] Therefore, the first civilization may have physically explored or colonized the galaxy, but subsequent civilizations find it cheaper, faster, and easier to travel by contacting existing civilizations rather than physically exploring or traveling themselves. This leads to little or no physical travel at the current epoch, and only directed communications, which are hard to see except to the intended receiver.  Human beings have not existed long enough  Humanity's ability to detect intelligent extraterrestrial life has existed for only a very brief period—from 1937 onwards, if the invention of the radio telescope is taken as the dividing line—and Homo sapiens is a geologically recent species. The whole period of modern human existence to date is a very brief period on a cosmological scale, and radio transmissions have only been propagated since 1895. Thus, it remains possible that human beings have neither existed long enough nor made themselves sufficiently detectable to be found by extraterrestrial intelligence. [89]  We are not listening properly  There are some assumptions that underlie the SETI programs that may cause searchers to miss signals that are present. Extraterrestrials might, for example, transmit signals that have a very high or low data rate, or employ unconventional (in our terms) frequencies , which would make them hard to distinguish from background noise. Signals might be sent from non- main sequence star systems that we search with lower priority; current programs assume that most alien life will be orbiting Sun-like stars . [90]  The greatest challenge is the sheer size of the radio search needed to look for signals (effectively spanning the entire visible universe), the limited amount of resources committed to SETI, and the sensitivity of modern instruments. SETI estimates, for instance, that with a radio telescope as sensitive as the Arecibo Observatory , Earth's television and radio broadcasts would only be detectable at distances up to 0.3 light-years, less than 1/10 the distance to the nearest star. A signal is much easier to detect if the signal energy is limited to either a narrow range of frequencies, or directed at a specific part of the sky. Such signals could be detected at ranges of hundreds to tens of thousands of light-years distance. [91] However, this means that detectors must be listening to an appropriate range of frequencies, and be in that region of space to which the beam is being sent. Many SETI searches assume that extraterrestrial civilizations will be broadcasting a deliberate signal, like the Arecibo message, in order to be found.  Thus to detect alien civilizations through their radio emissions, Earth observers either need more sensitive instruments or must hope for fortunate circumstances: that the broadband radio emissions of alien radio technology are much stronger than our own; that one of SETI's programs is listening to the correct frequencies from the right regions of space; or that aliens are deliberately sending focused transmissions in our general direction.  Civilizations broadcast detectable radio signals only for a brief period of time  It may be that alien civilizations are detectable through their radio emissions for only a short time, reducing the likelihood of spotting them. The usual assumption is that civilizations outgrow radio through technological advancement. [92] However, even if radio is not used for communication, it may be used for other purposes such as power transmission from solar power satellites. Such uses may remain visible even after broadcast emission are replaced by less observable technology. [93]  More hypothetically, advanced alien civilizations may evolve beyond broadcasting at all in the electromagnetic spectrum and communicate by technologies not developed or used by mankind. Some scientists have hypothesized that advanced civilizations may send neutrino signals. [94] If such signals exist, they could be detectable by neutrino detectors that are now under construction for other goals. [95]  They tend to isolate themselves  It has been suggested that some advanced beings may divest themselves of physical form, create massive artificial virtual environments , transfer themselves into these environments through mind uploading , and exist totally within virtual worlds, ignoring the external physical universe. [96]  It may also be that intelligent alien life develops an "increasing disinterest" in their outside world. [97] Possibly any sufficiently advanced society will develop highly engaging media and entertainment well before the capacity for advanced space travel, and that the rate of appeal of these social contrivances is destined, because of their inherent reduced complexity, to overtake any desire for complex, expensive endeavors such as space exploration and communication. Once any sufficiently advanced civilization becomes able to master its environment, and most of its physical needs are met through technology, various "social and entertainment technologies", including virtual reality, are postulated to become the primary drivers and motivations of that civilization. [98]  They are too alien     Microwave window as seen by a ground-based system. From NASA report SP-419: SETI – the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence    Another possibility is that human theoreticians have underestimated how much alien life might differ from that on Earth. Aliens may be psychologically unwilling to attempt to communicate with human beings. Perhaps human mathematics is parochial to Earth and not shared by other life, [99] though others argue this can only apply to abstract math since the math associated with physics must be similar (in results, if not in methods). [100]  Physiology might also cause a communication barrier. Carl Sagan speculated that an alien species might have a thought process orders of magnitude slower (or faster) than ours. [ citation needed ] A message broadcast by that species might well seem like random background noise to us, and therefore go undetected.  Another thought is that technological civilizations invariably experience a technological singularity and attain a post-biological character. [101] Hypothetical civilizations of this sort may have advanced drastically enough to render communication impossible. [102] [103]  Everyone is listening, no one is transmitting  Alien civilizations might be technically capable of contacting Earth, but are only listening instead of transmitting. [104] If all, or even most, civilizations act the same way, the galaxy could be full of civilizations eager for contact, but everyone is listening and no one is transmitting. This is the so-called SETI Paradox . [105]  The only civilization we know, our own, does not explicitly transmit , except for a few small efforts. [104] Even these efforts, and certainly any attempt to expand them, are controversial. [106] It is not even clear we would respond to a detected signal—the official policy within the SETI community [107] is that "[no] response to a signal or other evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence should be sent until appropriate international consultations have taken place." However, given the possible impact of any reply [108] it may be very difficult to obtain any consensus on "Who speaks for Earth?" and "What should we say?"  Earth is deliberately not contacted  Main article: Zoo hypothesis     Schematic representation of a planetarium simulating the universe to humans. The " real " universe is outside the black sphere, the simulated one projected on/filtered through it.    The zoo hypothesis states that intelligent extraterrestrial life exists and does not contact life on Earth to allow for its natural evolution and development. [109] This hypothesis may break down under the uniformity of motive flaw: all it takes is a single culture or civilization to decide to act contrary to the imperative within our range of detection for it to be abrogated, and the probability of such a violation increases with the number of civilizations. [17]  Analysis of the inter-arrival times between civilizations in the galaxy based on common astrobiological assumptions suggests that the initial civilization would have a commanding lead over the later arrivals. As such, it may have established what we call the zoo hypothesis through force or as a galactic/universal norm and the resultant "paradox" by a cultural founder effect with or without the continued activity of the founder. [110]  Earth is purposely isolated (planetarium hypothesis)  Main article: Planetarium hypothesis  A related idea to the zoo hypothesis is that, beyond a certain distance, the perceived universe is a simulated reality . The planetarium hypothesis [111] speculates that beings may have created this simulation so that the universe appears to be empty of other life.  It is dangerous to communicate  An alien civilization might feel it is too dangerous to communicate, either for us or for them. After all, when very different civilizations have met on Earth, the results have often been disastrous for one side or the other, and the same may well apply to interstellar contact. Even contact at a safe distance could lead to infection by computer code [112] or even ideas themselves. [113] Perhaps prudent civilizations actively hide not only from Earth but from everyone, out of fear of other civilizations . [114]  Perhaps the Fermi paradox itself—or the alien equivalent of it—is the reason for any civilization to avoid contact with other civilizations, even if no other obstacles existed. From any one civilization's point of view, it would be unlikely for them to be the first ones to make first contact. Therefore, according to this reasoning, it is likely that previous civilizations faced fatal problems with first contact and doing so should be avoided. So perhaps every civilization keeps quiet because of the possibility that there is a real reason for others to do so. [29]  Liu Cixin 's novel The Dark Forest talks about such a situation.  The simulation theory  Main article: Simulated reality  Similar to the Planetarium hypothesis, it is theorized that our perceived reality is a simulation created by more intelligent beings. The creators of this hypothetical simulation may have purposely excluded life other than what has been found on Earth, or have simply not introduced it to humans in the simulation yet. It is also possible that they themselves are more intelligent humans, who also have not come in contact with alien lifeforms.  They are here undetected  It is possible that a civilization advanced enough to travel between the stars could visit or observe our world while remaining undetected or unrecognized. [115]  They are here unacknowledged  Main article: UFO conspiracy theory  A significant fraction of the population believes that at least some UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) are spacecraft piloted by aliens. [116] [117] While most of these are unrecognized or mistaken interpretations of mundane phenomena, there are those that remain puzzling even after investigation. The consensus scientific view is that although they may be unexplained, they do not rise to the level of convincing evidence. [118]  Similarly, it is theoretically possible that SETI groups are not reporting positive detections, or governments have been blocking signals or suppressing publication. This response might be attributed to security or economic interests from the potential use of advanced extraterrestrial technology. It has been suggested that the detection of an extraterrestrial radio signal or technology could well be the most highly secret information that exists. [119] Claims that this has already happened are common in the popular press, [120] [121] but the scientists involved report the opposite experience—the press becomes informed and interested in a potential detection even before a signal can be confirmed.

Six Of The Top Theories  by Victor Tangermann  on December 1, 2017  32612     NASA              We have accomplished a lot in our (relatively) short time on Earth. We’ve sent hum ans to the Moon and to live in space, developed massive and sophisticated telescopes to see the farthest reaches of the cosmos, and even rocketed rovers to Mars and probes to the edge of our solar system. However, a number of organizations have taken humanity’s voyage into the final frontier a step farther. NASA, the European Space Agency, and the research collective behind the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) have been working tirelessly to find out if we are alone, once and for all.  Already, a number of projects exist that scan the stars for signs of intelligent life. And despite the fact that many of them have been looking to the skies for decades, we have yet to make contact. And that’s a bit of a problem.  The Paradox That Started It All  To put it mildly, our solar system is very old. In fact, scientists are still figuring out just how old — clues gathered from meteorites suggest it is almost 5 billion years old , and surrounding star systems are likely billions of years older . While interstellar travel still seems to be a distant dream , new technology is born every year that allows us to scan the skies for signals from civilizations in the most distant corners of the cosmos. The number of known alien worlds and star systems discovered through these technologies continues to rise , but our creative methods of listening to space have not yet revealed anything that resembles extraterrestrial communications or civilizations.  Given the size and age of our universe, it seems like we should have made contact. We, of course, have not.  In the early 20th century, physicist Enrico Fermi asked himself a now-famous question: Given the scope of our universe, why haven’t we found intelligent extraterrestrial life yet (or why haven’t they found us)? This is sometimes called the Fermi Paradox or the Great Silence. Scientists have floated many possible answers in the century since Fermi first asked this question. Here are some of the most plausible  reasons why he haven’t made first contact.  Image Credit: NASA  #GreatFilter  Basic probability asserts that alien life must exist. Since we haven’t made contact yet, one theory goes, there must be something barring life from interstellar travel or, at least, barring it from communicating with other alien species. This barrier is known as the “Great Filter,” and it is a force or event that stops a civilization from getting to the aforementioned point of interstellar travel or communication.  If the theory holds true, there are two primary reasons that we haven’t made contact: Because societies kill themselves off before they reach a state advanced enough to explore the stars or interstellar travel is simply not possible on a technological scale. Neither option is particularly pleasing.  And according to the experts behind the work, the filter event is of equal or greater probability than the existence of alien life itself. This is the point argued by Robin Hanson, a research associate at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, in his discussion of the topic .  No alien civilizations have substantially colonized our solar system or systems nearby. Thus among the billion trillion stars in our past universe, none has reached the level of technology and growth that we may soon reach. This one data point implies that a Great Filter stands between ordinary dead matter and advanced exploding lasting life.  Since we have not been able to detect alien life (or leave the solar system much, for that matter), how far are we from being caught up in some event that would bar us from ever finding aliens? “The easier it was for life to evolve to our stage, the bleaker our future chances probably are,” Hanson writes. In other words, the more life there is in the cosmos, the greater the likeliness that we are about to reach a cataclysmic, life-ending event or reach the cosmic limits of technological advancement.  Do Not Disturb the Aliens  Another hypothesis asserts that alien civilizations certainly exist, but they’re simply inactive. That’s the “aestivation hypothesis” (aestivation refers to an organism’s state of prolonged inactivity, similar to a bear hibernating or a frog that buries itself in sand during hot weather), which was put forth by researchers from Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute and the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade.  The theory, published in a paper in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society in 2017, states that aliens may be “hibernating” until the environmental conditions are just right to become active and build their super society. The researchers argue that the laws of thermodynamics directly limit computation, as computing technologies need to be cooled in order to function. This makes it exceedingly difficult to create advanced technologies, as keeping them cool at scale quickly becomes prohibitively difficult. So the aliens are falling into a dormant until, to be blunt, the universe cools.  But distilling the development of a civilization to the kinds of conditions that our current, and somewhat imperfect, models can predict could be reductive. What if intelligent extraterrestrial life has found a way around the thermodynamic conditions that limit its ability to compute? “What if there are other forms of value that can be generated?” the study authors write. If they’re wrong about the relationship between thermodynamics and technology, the aestivation hypothesis would be moot. In this case, perhaps one of the other ideas here holds true.  A “Gaian”-tic Bottleneck  Image Credit: Creative Commons  According to the “Gaian Bottleneck” hypothesis, life needs particular environmental conditions to develop, and they’re not so common. Astrobiologists at the Australian National University penned their explanation to the Fermi Paradox in 2016.  Extinction is “the cosmic default for most life that has ever emerged on the surfaces of wet rocky planets in the Universe,” the researchers wrote. That’s because a planet has to be actually inhabited for it to be habitable, because organisms change the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. A Catch-22 emerges: no life without habitability, no habitability without life.  For alien life to persist, the researchers write, it must hang on: “like trying to ride a wild bull. Most life falls off.” Life can only take place with the presence of an unlikely feedback loop. In this case, Earth is the exception to the rule.  Trapped in Deep Oceans  In 2015, after nearly a decade in transit, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft became the first to do a close flyby of Pluto. It offered humanity its first look at its icy surface and raised questions about the possibility of subsurface oceans of water, and lots of methane and nitrogen. These questions put Pluto on a short but growing list of worlds with buried oceans trapped under a thick crust of ice and rock (some of the other worlds are Saturn’s moons Enceladus and Titan, as well as Jupiter’s moons Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede).  Those oceans figure prominently into another theory of where life might be lurking, one that Alan Stern, the principal investigator for New Horizons, touches on. Since buried oceans form a much more stable ecosystem than flowing surface streams, changes such as altering tides and dissipation  take place over a longer time period. A hard outer shell protects hypothetical life in the oceans from a harsh climate and a lethal mix of gases on the surface. “Impacts and solar flares, and nearby supernovae, and what orbit you’re in, and whether you have a magnetosphere, and whether there’s a poisonous atmosphere — none of those things matter,” Stern told Space.com .  Any intelligent alien life that forms in these deep oceans would have to overcome a big hurdle to reach inhabitants of other worlds: drilling through that thick, protective crust. All that work would only get them to the surface — sending signals to other planets become even more unlikely.  Missed Signals  The Allen Telescope Array, Image Credit: National Science Foundation  For the past eighty years or so, we’ve been listening for signs of extraterrestrial life with  radio technology. The Allen Telescope Array , situated 470 km (290 miles) northeast of San Francisco, is one of the biggest — s ince 2007, 42 dishes have stood at the ready to scan the skies regularly in the hope of receiving radio signals from extraterrestrial life.  But what if extraterrestrial life doesn’t operate on those frequencies? Attempts at contact could simply be passing us by simply because we don’t comprehend the right wavelengths.  Instead of using telescope arrays and scanning the skies for radio signals, Duncan Forgan at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland suggests creating a galactic communications network . The same way we blink our high beams to send a signal to other drivers, we could use the shadow that Earth creates when it passes in front of the Sun to send a message to our fellow inhabitants of the universe. Forgan suggests that we build powerful lasers that contain those encoded messages, which are sent out as we pass in front of the Sun.  “If you want to communicate with someone on the other side of the galactic centre, there’s lots of stuff in the way – dust, stars, a big black hole – so you can take the long way around using the network,” Forgan tells New Scientist . Rather than letting intergalactic messages get lost in the vastness of space, civilizations in different galaxies could agree to use this “galactic communications network” to ensure their messages get to their intended recipients – a unified system to cut through the chatter.  We are Being Impatient  We’ve only been actively reaching out for alien life for about a century — a mere blip in the long history of the solar system and of the universe overall. Evan Solomonides, an astrophysics and mathematics undergrad and researcher  at Cornell University, suggests that it could take a while — about 1,500 years from now, to be precise — before we hear from any extraterrestrials.  In a paper submitted to the American Astronomical Society , Solomonides examines the probability of finding life. “We predict that under 1 percent of the galaxy has been reached at all thus far, and we do not anticipate to be reached until approximately half of the stars/planets have been reached.” Solomonides believes that we will have explore around half of the Milky Way galaxy before we hear anything, which will take a while since we’ve barely explored our own galactic neighborhood.  Solomonides is careful to note that the 1,500 years is not a deadline. “This is not to say that we must be reached by then or else we are, in fact, alone. We simply claim that it is somewhat unlikely that we will not hear anything before that time.”  Editor’s Note: This article was updated to correct the names of Saturn and Jupiter’s moons.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Extraterrestrial Intelligence  Extraterrestrial Life What are the chances of alien life being biologically compatible with us? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 11 Answers   Gordon Hogenson , Seeking the truth about extraterrestrial life for 20 years. Answered Jul 5, 2017 · Author has 265 answers and 93.8k answer views It’s not a question of chance, it is a fact that the extraterrestrial life forms that have been visiting here in recent times, in ancient times, and throughout the development of life on the planet, are biologically compatible with us. The life on our planet has been seeded here and influenced by extraterrestrial visitations throughout history. Some of the initial life that started here might have arrived on its own, from dust or comet debris, as Fred Hoyle proposed, and as Brig Klyce now convincingly argues [1]. This initial spreading of life would have brought bacteria, with the same genetic code and basic DNA patterns that we observe today. Many who have studied the bacterial genome and biosphere have seen that has such richness and depth that they’ve concluded that it must be of cosmic order. Second, so-called “ancient alien” theory, the subject of countless books by independent researchers, and scorned by established academics, is much closer to the truth than conventional archeology. One could go on for hours about all the reasons to believe this, from the enormous hundred-ton stones placed with precision in the most ancient of monuments, to the mysterious materials found at some sites, such as mercury and mica at Tenochtitlan, the evidence is simply too much to continue to be ignored. So, extraterrestrial visitation in ancient times must eventually be accepted as truth. Finally, modern extraterrestrial visitation accounts must be taken seriously. There are too many good sightings, sufficient good accounts from contactees, sufficient accounts from government whistleblowers - see for example the Disclosure Project press conference in 2001. There are peer-reviewed studies in the Journal of Scientific Exploration, if you need peer-reviewed studies. Examination of the phenomenon reveals some important facts relevant to this question of biological compatibility. First, as Stephen Greer says, “They aren’t traveling here in Granddad’s Oldsmobile.” Our science hasn’t yet (at least publicly) solved the faster-than-light puzzle, but our science is in its infancy compared to the advanced science that these visiting beings apparently have. Whether it is wormholes, hyperspace, or all of the above, the argument that “you can’t get here from there” is just not the case and can’t be used to refute all possible extraterrestrial visitations. Second, the beings are not that different from us. Most we encounter are bipedal and some are relatively human-like. Think about this for a minute - all our assumptions about life on different planets having to evolve separately assume that faster-than-light travel (or technology that cheats the light barrier in some clever way) doesn’t exist and isn’t a factor. If it is a factor and if it has been possible for visitors to travel between planets for thousands of years, perhaps millions or billions of years, then during that time, seeds of life of all kinds would have been moving throughout the galaxy, perhaps even the universe of galaxies, for a long, long, time. Life based not only on our own DNA, RNA, genetic code, sugars, proteins, and so forth, but also co-evolved with us via our own tree of life, with animals, plants, fungi, including all the various families of animal life - invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, and all the various forms of plant life - algae, lichens, mosses, ferns, conifers, flowering plants, trees. Any of these could have been brought here intentionally or accidentally at any time in prehistory and proliferated as invasive species do today when brought to a new continent or island. An interesting suggestion is that the ancient form of life that predated the Cambrian explosion, called Ediacaran life [2], might be the Earth’s native life, before Cambrian life arrived and took over, wiping out most of the Ediacaran life forms. If that is the case, Cambrian life is not of Earthly origin and we might expect “alien” life forms that arrive to be derived from the same roots as Cambrian life. That said, life adapts to its environments, just as on Earth, “alien” life although based on the same genetics (and therefore not so “alien” after all), would be adapted to the conditions on a world perhaps quite different than our own. However, our type of life does have limits to its ability to thrive, so the other world can’t be that different in some of the key physical parameters. Certain fundamental conditions are required. There must be liquid water in some way, so that limits the temperature range. There must be oxygen, carbon dioxide, and so on, but those gases could be present in a range of amounts. The pressure could perhaps vary from our own, with adaptations to very low or very high atmospheric pressure, just as fish in the deep ocean are adapted to the higher pressure there. Gravity could be higher or lower and organisms would be constructed differently. On planets with higher gravity, they might be short, squat, and muscular, or primarily aquatic, since water provides support. On planets with lower gravity, they might be taller and more adapted to jumping or flying. That all said, there might also be extraterrestrial beings from very different but still carbon-based life. We don’t have many sightings or contactees who have reported such beings, so either they don’t exist, or they don’t visit often, or don’t have as much interest in beings like us that are so different from them. Or, perhaps the type of life that we and our visiting beings dominates the scene in our part of space. In any case, we obviously have much to learn about the denizens of the universe.

Answered Nov 29, 2016 · Featured on Forbes · Author has 4.1k answers and 43.2m answer views Capable of growing in the same soil - nearly 100% Safe for us to eat - nearly 100%* Every nutrient that autotrophs need are achiral - they aren’t “handed”. Things like ammonia, water, carbon dioxide, etc. These chemicals would be the building blocks of life on many worlds, and they are the same everywhere. If an alien world had plants, chances are they’d do fine in our dirt. Our atmosphere might not have the correct ratio of gases, and our sun might not spit out the correct spectrum of light for optimal growth, but chances are there would be some creatures that could survive here. Now, could we eat them? Sure! But remember, we can also eat sand. That doesn’t make it nutritive. The odds that we would be able to extract nutritional value from the food is far closer to 0% than 100%. There’s a nearly infinite array of molecules that alien beings might use to store energy, build body structures, etc. Nearly all of those would be completely indigestible by humans. So, could you eat an alien plant? Sure. Would you starve to death anyway? Probably. Might it make you sick? Possibly. Could it grow here? Probably. The same is true in reverse, by the way - alien animals would almost certainly be incapable of digesting Earth plants and animals. 8.7k Views · View Upvoters   Bob Myers , Human bean Answered Nov 28, 2016 · Author has 3.7k answers and 1.5m answer views With the disclaimer right up front that I’m no sort of biologist, let alone an exo- or xenobiologist…I think the odds are fairly good that alien life would share the most basic chemistry with Earth life in that it would almost certainly be carbon-based and require liquid water. Having said that, though, the very things that make these basic components a good choice for being the basis of life - their nearly infinite ability to form all sorts of complex compounds - makes it very UNlikely that alien life would be truly compatible with terrestrial life. Even if alien life through some coincidence was based on DNA, etc., what are the chances that we’d use the exact same proteins, require the same trace elements, or (most farfetched at all) use anything like compatible genetics? One simple example: a LOT of the organic chemistry of Earth life is based on molecules which can exist in two forms, one of which is the mirror image of the other (these are called “optical isomers”); in other words, they’re like your hands: the structure is basically identical, but each one is backwards relative to the other. They’re chemically identical, but for many of these your body can use one but not the other. Which version life uses came about through random chance - so there’s even odds that an alien lifeform could be absolutely identical to us in every way, but couldn’t eat our food! (And of course, the chances of that lifeform being identical to us in every other way is already infinitesimal.) 211 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by BetterHelp Are you struggling emotionally?

One planet outside our solar system is entirely an ocean all through it. That water may support life. One planet also outside(exo planet) that's most likely to support life has one side facing its star, a red giant in place of a sun is very very hot and one side permanently facing away from the sun is too cold to support life. But there's a strip of land in the middle that is about the right temp where life could thrive. A lot of Eco systems thriving depend on the correct temperatures to thrive. The earth is made of the stuff of stars as is everything in our universe.

This allows for a standard template technology that can be used to support colonies on a variety of exo-planets. People live under air-tight domes and explore their new homes in bio-filter suits until the planets can be sterilized and Earth-like life forms can be established, parcel by parcel. As land is cleared for more domes, the organic matter isn’t burned, it is eaten. In this way, bio-compatibility isn’t necessary. 71 Views Quora User , studied at George Brown College Answered Nov 29, 2016 · Author has 68 answers and 74.9k answer views I would say no.

Can we digest proteins, sugars, etc. from that world? Many say that the variety of life would be unlimited, so we’re very unlikely to find such compatibility. But I wonder. Perhaps on earthlike worlds—the only kind we’d be interested in—there are only a limited number of viable options for basic life patterns. Four? Ten? Fifty? Suppose after we develop our star jump capability and visit some of these worlds, we study and catalog the viable types. (Of course most likely this would have been done eons ago by predecessor races.) We would find out that we are Type 3. Therefore we would be able to survive on the worlds that had Type 3 life. Type 5 might be just marginally digestible for us, and Type 8 worlds might be deadly poison like amanita mushrooms.

By Brian Koberlein in Science Wire | Space  |  February 3, 2016     The star KIC 8462852 continues to display strange behavior, baffling astronomers and prompting speculation – and these musings – about advanced aliens.       Our sun is located about two-thirds of the way out from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. There are 100 billion suns in our Milky Way. Illustration via Caltech.  Recently the star KIC 8462852 (aka Tabby’s Star) has made news again because of its strange behavior. Possible explanations for its varying brightness (such as comets) don’t seem to fit the observational data, which has some speculating that the star’s behavior could be explained by the presence of an alien civilization. While many astronomers admit that is a possibility, they don’t think aliens are the likely cause. For one, mysterious behavior is not enough to conclude the cause is aliens . For another, the likelihood that an alien civilization actually exists is still a matter of some debate.  The odds of an alien civilization coexisting with humans is often calculated by the Drake equation . It was first proposed by Frank Drake in 1961. Simply take the rate at which stars form in our galaxy and multiply it by the fraction of stars with planets, the average number of planets per star that could support life, the fraction of those that actually develop life, the fraction of life bearing planets that develop civilization, the fraction of civilizations that have detectible signals, and finally the length of time a civilization might last. Crunch the numbers and you have the number of civilizations in our galaxy capable of communicating with us.  When Drake first proposed the equation, the values for each term were largely unknown, but we now have good estimates for many of them. We know that most stars have planets, and the odds of a potentially habitable planet is actually quite high, possibly as high as 100 billion in our galaxy alone.  Unfortunately the really important factors of the Drake equation are still completely unknown. On how many potentially habitable planets does life actually arise? How many of those give rise to civilizations? How long does a typical civilization last? No idea. Depending on the answer to those questions the number of civilizations in our galaxy could range from hundreds of thousands to only one.  The equation was never intended to give an absolute number, though it is often used that way. There are also alternatives such as the Sara Seager’s equation , which focuses on our ability to detect civilizations indirectly rather than requiring active communication. Just because an alien civilization is quiet, that doesn’t mean we can’t see evidence for them. Seager’s approach is to focus on stable red dwarf stars with known potentially habitable worlds. Since red dwarf stars are by far the most common, the odds that we’d find alien life near such a star is higher. She then focuses on planets that transit their home star from our vantage point and are near enough that we have a chance of observing the effects of the planet’s atmosphere on the star’s light. She estimates that there might be two inhabited worlds might be detectable in the next ten years.  Of course this presumes that life forms readily on a habitable planet and survives billions of years, which might not be the case .  The famous Drake equation, formulated by Frank Drake in the 1960s. It brings together key factors to consider when estimating the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in our Milky Way galaxy.  What make’s Tabby’s Star particularly interesting is that it hints at being evidence of an artificial structure the size of a solar system, such as a Dyson sphere, which is something only highly advanced civilizations could create. Of course the big underlying assumption here is that the more advanced a civilization is, the more likely it will build such a structure. The idea was first presented by Nikolai Kardashev in 1964 , who proposed a classification of civilizations based upon their energy use. Type I civilizations harness the resources of their home planet, such as humans today. Type II harness almost the full energy of their home star, possibly through technology such as Dyson spheres. Species within the Star Trek universe would typically be Type II. Type III are civilizations that can harness the energy of an entire galaxy, such as the Asgard of the Stargate universe.  Carl Sagan later generalized the Kardashev scale to a logarithmic function of energy use, and estimated that we were at about 0.7.  The Kardashev scale presumes that more advanced civilizations will necessarily demand more energy. Humans have so far lent credence to this idea, since our modern global civilization consumes much more energy than earlier agrarian civilizations. If our human population and demands for technological convenience grows, we will likely expand out into the solar system with a continued rise in energy consumption.  But such a future is not guaranteed. It’s also possible that we will instead reach a stable and sustainable population level, and combined with increasing energy efficiency our energy consumption may flatten. Technological civilizations may stabilize at type I rather than continuing up the scale.  That’s the real challenge with calculating the odds.  Everything we’ve pinned down so far point to a good chance that life forms on planets across the universe … but there’s still too many unknowns.  Even NASA has toyed with the idea of large space habitats. This is a painting of what one might look like on the inside, by space artist Don Davis.  Bottom line: The star KIC 8462852 continues to display strange behavior, baffling astronomers and causing speculation about advanced aliens. However, now – as in 1961, when Frank Drake formulated his famous Drake equation – the fact is that there are many unknowns, and we don’t know if our galaxy has numerous advanced civilizations … or one.

Depending on the answer to those questions the number of civilizations in our galaxy could range from hundreds of thousands to only one.    The equation was never intended to give an absolute number, though it is often used that way. There are also alternatives such as the Sara Seager's equation , which focuses on our ability to detect civilizations indirectly rather than requiring active communication. Just because an alien civilization is quiet, that doesn't mean we can't see evidence for them. Seager's approach is to focus on stable red dwarf stars with known potentially habitable worlds. Since red dwarf stars are by far the most common, the odds that we'd find alien life near such a star is higher. She then focuses on planets that transit their home star from our vantage point and are near enough that we have a chance of observing the effects of the planet's atmosphere on the star's light. She estimates that there might be two inhabited worlds might be detectable in the next ten years. Of course this presumes that life forms readily on a habitable planet and survives billions of years, which might not be the case .         Even NASA has toyed with the idea of large space habitats.

What make's Tabby's Star particularly interesting is that it hints at being evidence of an artificial structure the size of a solar system, such as a Dyson sphere, which is something only highly advanced civilizations could create. Of course the big underlying assumption here is that the more advanced a civilization is, the more likely it will build such a structure. The idea was first presented by Nikolai Kardashev in 1964, who proposed a classification of civilizations based upon their energy use. Type I civilizations harness the resources of their home planet, such as humans today. Type II harness almost the full energy of their home star, possibly through technology such as Dyson spheres. Species within the Star Trek universe would typically be Type II. Type III are civilizations that can harness the energy of an entire galaxy, such as the Asgard of the Stargate universe. Carl Sagan later generalized the Kardashev scale to a logarithmic function of energy use, and estimated that we were at about 0.7.  The Kardashev scale presumes that more advanced civilizations will necessarily demand more energy. Humans have so far lent credence to this idea, since our modern global civilization consumes much more energy than earlier agrarian civilizations. If our human population and demands for technological convenience grows, we will likely expand out into the solar system with a continued rise in energy consumption. But such a future is not guaranteed. It's also possible that we will instead reach a stable and sustainable population level, and combined with increasing energy efficiency our energy consumption may flatten. Technological civilizations may stabilize at type I rather than continuing up the scale.  That's the real challenge with calculating the odds. Everything we've pinned down so far point to a good chance that life forms on planets across the Universe, but there's still too many unknowns.
