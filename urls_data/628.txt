Recent Surveys  A recent online survey of people who got married in between 2006 and 2007 found that a mere 14% of couples had met in school (including college). This figure was exactly equal to the percentage of married couples that met online.  High School Sweetheart Marriage  It’s hard to quantitate how many marriages in the US stemmed from high school romance, but one of the few figures available approximates that only about 2% of marriages are between high school sweethearts.  First-Time Bride One thing to consider when looking at high school sweethearts is the drastic change in median age of first-time brides over the years.  In 1960, the average age was 20 years old.  Between 1960 and 1990, that age only rose by 3-4 years.    A Sharp Rise However, between 1990 and 2010, the median age of first-time brides skyrocketed to 26.5, essentially doubling.  Liberal Marriage Recent statistics on high school sweethearts found that marriages tend to be happier amongst couples that identify as politically liberal.  Happy Divorces  Generally, high school sweethearts who get married have happier marriages than their counterparts who met later in life. Notably, they also have happier divorces.  According to research, high school sweethearts who divorced were more often than not on good terms with their exes, compared to divorced couples who met later in life.    High School Marriage High school sweethearts who got married as teenagers had a divorce rate of 46% after 10 years, which is pretty high compared to the 32% average divorce rate in the US.  Later Marriage High school sweethearts who waited until the age of 25 (or later) to marry had a 22% divorce rate, which is 10% lower than other couples.  General Divorce  In general, divorce rates in this country have actually declined over the past 30 years.  The statistics suggest that high school sweetheart marriages are more likely to last than others.    Spirituality  Evidence shows that marriages that have a spiritual component last longer. This stands even for marriages where the husband and wife are of different religions.  Mormons Mormons make an interesting profile for the study of high school sweethearts. They actually have the greatest divorce rate in the first three years of marriage amongst high school sweethearts, but they also are the most likely to stay married once their relationship lasts longer than 36 months.  Schooling  Don’t put on a ring on it just yet. When it comes to high school sweetheart statistics, there’s a lot of ups and down. For instance, only 19% of people who marry their high school sweethearts attend college. This is far lower than the near 70% of Americans who enrolled in college as of last October.    Concerns  Parents surveyed stated that their biggest concern regarding their child marrying a high school sweetheart was that their child would jump into parenthood too early. Perhaps this fear is founded if it relates to the low number of college attendees amongst this group.  Why Not  People who considered marrying their high school sweethearts and didn’t stated that their biggest reason for not doing so had nothing to do with love for another women or lack of love for their sweetheart, but rather a fear of losing freedom and a need to explore.    Reconnecting  People who didn’t marry their high school sweetheart are more likely to cheat on their partner with their high school sweetheart if they reconnect. More and more people are reconnecting because of social networks.  People who cheat on their partner with their high school sweetheart were also found to be more likely than average to have an alcoholic parent.  More Stats Research shows it doesn’t really matter who a person dates first—it's who they love first that can affect the staying power of a relationship.  While only 2% of marriages are between high school sweethearts, 25% of women say that they married their first love.

The Middle School definition of dating: Dating in Middle School (v.) – A title or label promoting the idea of romance that children are not yet capable of.  So why do it? You could probably ask a select circle of boys and girls in each grade, but as The Corner Editorial Board, we decided to think about this subject for this issue’s editorial.  We accept that, thanks to hormones, people have crushes, or romantic feelings directed to someone in particular. Somehow, the word “like” has been used so much in this sense that it now makes sense to say “Well I mean I like him, but not like, like.” Or “I like like her” which is somehow different then the “like” that you use to describe your teachers or your favorite books. The chances that the person you “like like” likes you in the same way are, let’s face it, kind of small. But on the off chance that the person who you “like” just happens to “like” you back, what would be the proper response?  That’s where “dating” comes in. Dating is a term mostly used by adults who are looking for someone to share their lives with. But as much as we write off, ignore, deny, or just plain oppose it, we are all children. So really what’s the point?  What even happens in a middle school relationship? We discussed that in our meeting and we have come up with a basic summary of the brief life of a middle school relationship. It goes something like this:  They dance. Admit grudgingly that they “like” each other. He asks her out (mostly), then that’s it for about a couple of agonizingly awkward days/weeks/months. There are some couples—to whom we would like to give props—who actually go out on a “real date” before classifying themselves as “dating,” so as not to give a false representation of the relationship. (By a real date we mean going to see a movie or out for ice cream).  Then they break up. And that’s it.  So why would anyone really bother?  The percentage of middle school relationships that last the three years until high school is less than ten percent, while eight percent of high school relationships work until marriage, and only five percent of the relationships that are started in high school lead to marriages that do not end in divorce. (We actually researched this online.)  So, to be clear, if you are in the ten percent that make it to high school with their relationship, then you have an eight percent chance of getting married, but a ninety-five percent chance of getting divorced. Not great odds if you ask us!  So, when you think about it, the chances that your middle school relationship or that couple that is “just so cute’s” relationship is going to work is extremely small. But, we do it anyway.  Think about it. When someone says to you “So what’s the latest gossip”, nine out of ten times they will be really hinting for you to say something like “Well, Andy just asked Emily out” and in all honesty, many of us in middle school secretly desire to be known. Using this logic, it makes sense for someone to want to be in a relationship. Maybe it’s that and the fact that every time someone says the name of the person you “like, like” to you, it makes your stomach fly. Maybe it’s that you want to claim that person for yourself.  Let’s say it again. We are children. We are not adults. We have our whole lives for romance, but only a couple more years of childhood. Savor it.  ~ The Corner Editorial Board 2012-13  ~ Illustration by Cassie C  Share this: Email Print More Facebook Google Twitter   Related      Post navigation   Previous Post Why I Hate “Les Mis” Next Post Mean Girls: The Judge, the Judged and everyone else       Check out the latest editorial from our editorial board  Does Middle School Matter in Life?

Marriages to second-loves are considerably more likely (36% of married people), and a further 25% of the married population have loved three or more people before their current partner.  A new YouGov study reveals that marriages untouched by prior love are stronger than more experienced partnerships in a number of respects.  As the first part of the study showed , unmarried relationships – more likely to be in their infancy – display a higher quality of love: 64% are definitely in love compared to 57% of the married population. Those who married their first love, however, are as sure of being in love as people in unmarried relationships (64%).     Only 19% of people in first-love marriages have considered leaving their partner; this compares to a third (34%) of married people who have loved before.  People who married their first love are also more likely (97%) to think they will be with their partner until their dying day than people who did not (88%).  Of course, this is partly a generational difference - older people are more likely to have married young (and therefore their first love), and some of the effect we are seeing may simply be down to generational differences on the view of marriage.  The study also finds some interesting differences in gender. Men are more likely to be sure they are in love with their partner (62% compared to 57% of women) and to find their partner sexually attractive (81% rather than 72% of women); likewise, 38% of women have thought about leaving their partner compared to 29% of men.

Although many high school sweethearts end up breaking up at some point in time, a surprising number of them end up marrying and establishing a new household at some point in life.  The average age of a first-time bride today is 26 years old.  High School Sweethearts Marriage  What is interesting about divorce rates amongst marriages is that those who tend to live in areas that would be defined as American liberal tend to have lower rates of divorce. Religion, age, and location all play roles, but one fact cannot be denied: those who marry their high school sweethearts tend to have happy marriages, even if they end up in divorce for some reason.   High school sweethearts that get married while still teenagers only have a 54% chance of having their marriage last 10 years.  High school sweethearts that wait until at least the age of 25 to get married have a 10 year success rate of 78%.  Only 19% of people who marry their high school sweethearts attend college.  14% of couples had met in school.   It’s the last fact right there that is most sobering. Only 1 out of 5 people who marry their high school sweethearts even get to college, no matter what their age happens to be when they get married. An even more staggering statistic is this: less than 2% of people who marry their high school sweethearts earn a degree from college. A lot has changed in 40 years in regards to the views of marriage and when to or when not to marry, but this simple fact remains: people don’t marry their high school sweetheart might be happier, but they are less competitive in the job market.  What Is It About Marrying Your First Love?   The biggest fear that parents have of their children marrying young, as a teen, is that they will become a parent too early.  Less than 2% of all marriages are actually to a high school sweetheart.  Many people end up not marrying their high school sweetheart because it isn’t a love for another person that they are feeling, but it is instead a love of freedom and exploration.  Relationships that have some sort of spiritual component to them are much more likely to succeed, even if there are contrasting religions or spiritual emphasis in the relationship.  In 1970, the average age of a first-time bridge was just 21 years of age.  All marriages have seen a decline in divorce rates over the past 30 years.  According to some research, couples who meet in school are less likely to divorce than couples who met in any other setting.   The real problem with looking at high school sweetheart relationships is that the data on these relationships is relatively limited. Even the data that does exist tends to be slanted in some way. For liberal magazines, using this as a specific example, the information is slanted to counter conservative claims about marriage. Data gathered by data websites is spun in such a way that using the website itself is promoted as a positive. What that means is that these statistics need to be taken with a grain of salt, but all of the data does suggest something: sometimes your first love really is your soul mate.   Are There Variations In The Data?   Mormons are more likely to divorce within the first 3 years of marriage than any other group of high school sweethearts, but this is likely because they tend to marry earlier than others as a demographic.  Mormons are also the most likely to stay married if a relationship lasts for more than 36 months.  According to a 2006 survey, only 14% of people actually met at school. Meeting through friends or meeting at work were more common ways that couples met and got married.  The most likely age demographic for someone to marry their high school sweetheart is in the 18-27 age group.  People who break up with their high school sweetheart and marry someone else are more likely to have an affair with the their sweetheart if they are able to reconnect.  The internet makes connecting or reconnecting with a high school sweetheart easier than ever before.  People who search out lost loves when they didn’t marry their high school sweetheart tend to come from homes where one parent was an alcoholic.   What we’re talking about here is the power of a first love. If two people fall in love together for the first time, it is an extremely powerful connection that doesn’t fade over the years. There are certainly times when busyness takes over a life and having a spouse and kids in a happy marriage makes life enjoyable, but not comparable to if that life was with a high school sweetheart. That’s why many try to reconnect and even people with deep religious beliefs can end up cheating on a spouse. The feeling of a love lost is a feeling the needs to be repaired, which is why a high school sweetheart relationship that takes a little time before marriage is one that can really last until death does them part.  Facts in Conclusion   25% of people are marrying their high school sweethearts today compared with those in the 1940’s.  According to some research, it doesn’t matter who you date first, but it does matter who you love first when it comes to building an enduring relationship.  Although only at most, 2% of marriages today are from a high school relationship, 25% of women say that they married their first love.   If you find someone that you genuinely love, then hold onto that person for life. Don’t waste your time on relationships where one person doesn’t love the other because that will lead to unhappiness.

Recent Surveys  A recent online survey of people who got married in between 2006 and 2007 found that a mere 14% of couples had met in school (including college). This figure was exactly equal to the percentage of married couples that met online.  High School Sweetheart Marriage  It’s hard to quantitate how many marriages in the US stemmed from high school romance, but one of the few figures available approximates that only about 2% of marriages are between high school sweethearts.  First-Time Bride One thing to consider when looking at high school sweethearts is the drastic change in median age of first-time brides over the years.  In 1960, the average age was 20 years old.  Between 1960 and 1990, that age only rose by 3-4 years.    A Sharp Rise However, between 1990 and 2010, the median age of first-time brides skyrocketed to 26.5, essentially doubling.  Liberal Marriage Recent statistics on high school sweethearts found that marriages tend to be happier amongst couples that identify as politically liberal.  Happy Divorces  Generally, high school sweethearts who get married have happier marriages than their counterparts who met later in life. Notably, they also have happier divorces.  According to research, high school sweethearts who divorced were more often than not on good terms with their exes, compared to divorced couples who met later in life.    High School Marriage High school sweethearts who got married as teenagers had a divorce rate of 46% after 10 years, which is pretty high compared to the 32% average divorce rate in the US.  Later Marriage High school sweethearts who waited until the age of 25 (or later) to marry had a 22% divorce rate, which is 10% lower than other couples.  General Divorce  In general, divorce rates in this country have actually declined over the past 30 years.  The statistics suggest that high school sweetheart marriages are more likely to last than others.    Spirituality  Evidence shows that marriages that have a spiritual component last longer. This stands even for marriages where the husband and wife are of different religions.  Mormons Mormons make an interesting profile for the study of high school sweethearts. They actually have the greatest divorce rate in the first three years of marriage amongst high school sweethearts, but they also are the most likely to stay married once their relationship lasts longer than 36 months.  Schooling  Don’t put on a ring on it just yet. When it comes to high school sweetheart statistics, there’s a lot of ups and down. For instance, only 19% of people who marry their high school sweethearts attend college. This is far lower than the near 70% of Americans who enrolled in college as of last October.    Concerns  Parents surveyed stated that their biggest concern regarding their child marrying a high school sweetheart was that their child would jump into parenthood too early. Perhaps this fear is founded if it relates to the low number of college attendees amongst this group.  Why Not  People who considered marrying their high school sweethearts and didn’t stated that their biggest reason for not doing so had nothing to do with love for another women or lack of love for their sweetheart, but rather a fear of losing freedom and a need to explore.    Reconnecting  People who didn’t marry their high school sweetheart are more likely to cheat on their partner with their high school sweetheart if they reconnect. More and more people are reconnecting because of social networks.  People who cheat on their partner with their high school sweetheart were also found to be more likely than average to have an alcoholic parent.  More Stats Research shows it doesn’t really matter who a person dates first—it's who they love first that can affect the staying power of a relationship.  While only 2% of marriages are between high school sweethearts, 25% of women say that they married their first love.

You started dating during your most awkward phases. You fell in love in the time of braces, heavy clownish makeup, and and douchey Abercrombie t-shirts. If you were attracted to each other even then, you’re set for life.  2. You’ve gotten to see how far each of you has come. You’ve seen each other graduate high school, head off to college, have no sense of direction for a couple years, kind of figure things out, graduate college, and cautiously step into adulthood. And now you can admire how much progress you’ve each made since you were teenagers.  3. You understand each other so well that sometimes words aren’t even necessary. You’ve known each other for a long time and know the things you have each experienced from adolescence into adulthood. So when one of you is having a hard time, you don’t even have to explain why. The other person just gets it.  4. There’s a solid foundation to fall back on. Every relationship has its ups and downs. And when you guys are in a low point together in which you’re stressed out or fighting a lot, it’s nice to know that you have such a firm basis.  5. That goes for fighting too. Fights and arguments are unavoidable in any relationship. But it’s nice having such a strong history and knowing that, like every other argument, you can work through this one.  6. You know each other’s quirks and “tells.” You know when they’re actually fine, and when they are upset. Because their behaviors and body language are now as familiar to you as breathing.  7. You have an endless amount of shared memories. So when you get to talk about some of the greatest joys you experienced as a ‘kid,’ they understand, because they were right there with you.  8. And the wonderful memories you’ve built together only get you more excited for what’s to come. Looking at your prom photos and reminiscing on how you used to anxiously await meeting up at your lockers just shows that there’s a lifetime of even more special moments ahead.  9. You understand that people change in relationships. You started dating as teenagers – you’re obviously totally different people now than you were then. Being high school sweethearts has taught you that you have to be adaptable in relationships, because people’s personalities and wants and needs will continuously change throughout life.  10. You’re basically Corey and Topanga. And nothing is stronger than that.  11. You’ve probably already made it through the hard parts of fighting to stay together. At some point all couples have to sit down and figure out what they want, where they want this to go, how committed they’re ready to get, etc. You already had to do all that when you went to college and when you entered the real world. So although there’s always going to be plenty to work through and talk through, you’ve already covered a lot of it.  12. ‘High school sweethearts’ is just one of many things you are to each other. You’re also soul mates, best friends, go-to persons for one another, cheerleaders, endless supporters, kindred spirits, partners, etc. These types of bonds don’t come around that often.  13. Your families are basically already family to each other. There’s no more polite exchanges of pleasantries. Your families have known each other for so long that they actually greet each other like old friends.  14. And your loved ones are usually super invested in your relationship. Sounds intense, but it’s actually just great. They’re always happy to support you and celebrate milestones and give you all the encouragement that you need. Because at this point, your significant other is just as much a part of your families’ lives as they are part of yours.  15. You’ve been in the habit, for years, of learning how to balance your relationship with the other parts of your life. You know that you can’t just spend all your time with that one person, so you’ve become an expert at balancing work, friends, and family in your life as well.  16. If you guys have ‘a song,’ it’s probably an awesome throwback. Like ‘Hey There Delilah.’ Or ‘Collide.’ Or something by Lifehouse.  17. They’ve been there for you since the beginning. So you have no trouble trusting that they’ll be there for you through everything else, too.  Want to laugh more easily in 2017? Follow ‘Humor Catalog’ on Facebook!

We were junior high sweethearts, meeting in 7th grade at the art table. We’ve been together ever since. This October, we will celebrate 6 years of marriage.    Many critics will probably highlight the negatives of marrying your high school sweetheart. Where’s the spontaneous chance to “play the field?” How can you be sure someone is your “one and only” if you haven’t explored very many possibilities if any?    I can understand this perspective, but I certainly don’t share in these views For me, sacrificing the relationship I had with Chad was never worth the opportunity to “explore other possibilities.” Life without him, even in exchange for “freedom” was never worth it.   How can you be sure someone is your “one and only” if you haven’t explored very many possibilities, if any?   However, I can agree there are negatives to marrying your high school sweetheart. Think of your most awkward stage in junior high or high school. You know, the messy hair, the mom jeans at 13, the fads you which you’d have passed on. Think of the worst school picture you have, the one you’ve tried to obliterate from all photo albums and memories.    Now imagine your spouse was there to witness those moments live.    I will never be able to obliterate from my husband’s mind my horrible, frizzy bowl-cut stage from 7th grade coupled with my love of tie-dye shirts, no matter how hard I try.    Overall, though, when thinking about my relationship and the fact we’ve been together so long, the benefits certainly outweigh the horrible photographs and awkward stages. All in all, I think there are many benefits to marrying your high school sweetheart.    1. Your relationship survived periods of great change.    Most relationships must weather periods of change and turmoil at some point. For some, these times come after marriage, when the stakes are even higher. For us, though, the periods of turmoil and change came before marriage.    Meeting your significant other before you’ve graduated means you’ve managed to maintain a bond through the most tumultuous period of life. You’ve both had to go through the period of discovering who you are, what you want in life, and how to deal with the slap in the face from the real world.    If you can survive as a couple through those late teen years when you’re wading through waters of uncertainty or even if you find each other again afterward, chances are you’ll be able to handle other life changes together. If at the end of this period of self-discovery you find you still want to fit together, you’ve probably created a solid foundation for marriage.    2. High school reunions aren’t so awkward.    This summer, we attended our 10-year high school reunion. While other spouses were left sipping sodas in the corner trying to laugh at jokes they didn’t understand, neither of us had to experience that. We both had people to see and stories to tell. Walking into your 10-year reunion with a fellow classmate beside you makes the whole process less intimidating.    3. Sharing a hometown means sharing common experiences.    For those high school sweethearts who actually attend the same high school, living in the same hometown can create common experiences and lead to similar values. We see the world in somewhat similar ways because we grew up in the same part of the world. No matter where you go in life, your roots are an essential thread in the fabric of who you are. We both have similar threads, leading to shared perspectives, values, and even a stronger bond.    4. Your connection has time to grow/mature before marriage.    When we said “I do,” we had a decade of being together under our belts. Certainly, marriage is always difficult and complex. It changes things.    Going to the altar, though, with years of memories, connections, and triumphs as a couple can harbor confidence in your vows. I knew when we said our vows we had a foundation to be successful in the next step of our life together.    5. You have adorable photographs for your mantle.    Minus the awkward ___th grade photo you hate, of course. Proms, graduations, dances―we have photos from all of the momentous occasions with both of us in them.   Having a single one-and-only for the majority of your adult life (or all of it) can be less devastating to the heart.   6. Going from friends to lovers strengthens your emotional connection.    For many high school sweethearts, friendship and the emotional bond is at the forefront of the early years. My husband and I found we had years in high school to work on our emotional connection and to get to know each other at a fundamental level.    Without the pressures of adult romance, such as when to move in together or dealing with career choices in addition to relationship choices, we had time to focus on getting to know each other before life got too complicated.    Even though most teenagers don’t believe this, life in high school is often simpler than adult life at the core. Stripping away some of the difficulties of the “real world” allows you to build a friendship as a basis for your relationship. This friendship has enhanced the core elements of our relationship, giving us a sturdy foundation to build our marriage upon.    7. We can share “do you remember when” laughs.    All of those laughable moments from high school, those gut-splitting stories of teenage craziness, are memories we share. We can reminisce together and share in the laughter of the past.    We still live in our hometown, so we sometimes see old peers when we’re out. No lengthy explanations are needed to explain who so-and-so was; we can both go all in with our memories. The connection that comes from a common past helps us share in more moments together.    8. Our hearts are relatively free of breaks and cracks.    Certainly, we had devastating moments as a couple. There were moments of tears, of anger, of regret, of guilt. There were fights that plagued us; there are still fights today. No love is perfect.    For some high school sweethearts, there might even be periods of separation, of throwing in the towel, of wandering away from the love before finding it again.    Still, our hearts remain relatively trauma-free. Having a single one-and-only for the majority of your adult life (or all of it) can be less devastating to the heart. I didn’t have to agonize over failed relationship after failed relationship to find “the elusive one.” I didn’t experience tons of heartbreak before finding a man who completed me.    Some would call this a detrimental consequence of marrying your high school sweetheart. Heartbreak is a human emotion that allows you to see love with eyes of truth.    To be honest, I don’t know if this is true or not. However, I do know having a relationship that isn’t tainted by past hurts can be a benefit, at least in my situation. I didn’t walk into this relationship with previous notions about love or trust issues. A break-free heart might not be the healthiest thing or even rational, but it’s helped me experience love without hesitation.    9. We are close with our in-laws.    Being together in high school means we spent a lot of time with our families. I knew my in-laws like my own family before we got married, and vice versa. Having time to build a relationship with your significant other’s family before saying “I do” leads to better relationships in marriage. It gives you time to sort out your place in the family, your connections, and even issues that may surface well in advance.    10. We have more years together.    At 28, I’ve already had 16 years with my husband. We’ve had 16 years of laughs, of memories, of hand holding, of fun. We’ve had 16 years of holidays, of trips, of simple moments in our hometown.    Marrying your high school sweetheart has the simple benefit of more years of memory-making, more years together, something any real love craves.    My experience may not be everyone’s experience. As I said, one can certainly find negative aspects to marrying someone you were with in high school. Looking back, though, I’m grateful for the time we’ve shared and our love story that isn’t unique in its beginnings but is unique in the way it works for us.    Not everyone can marry their high school sweetheart. For some, the time for this has already passed. Still, I think the benefits of marrying a high school sweetheart can teach lessons in love for any relationship. Really, the bottom line is this, no matter what stage of life you’re in: Marry the person you can’t stand to make memories without.    If this happens in high school, great. If it doesn’t, you can still find your own list of benefits as long as you find someone who understands you at the core, appreciates where you come from, and is willing to make a lifetime of memories with you. With some hard work and dedication, the rest will fall into place.

Of all college relationships, nearly 33 percent are long-distance, according to an iVillage survey .  But do they last? If you’re out of college, think about your Facebook friends: How many are still together with — or even married to — their high school sweethearts?    advertisement     “It’s definitely possible, but it’s rare, because the chances of you knowing who you want to be with at 40 when you’re 17 are kind of low,” said Tracey Steinberg, a dating coach. “But it happens, and love is rare. And it’s worth the wait if it’s real.”  Going the (long) distance is not easy: Challenges including overcoming communication barriers, resisting the temptation of a fun, new social life and scraping together the finances to visit each other at separate schools.

But the next time you grumble about a spotty Skype connection or a pricey plane ticket, think about Barbara Gee and Gordon Baranco.  The pair got together at age 16, despite the misgivings of their parents (Barbara is Chinese-American, and Gordon is African-American), who threatened to disown them.  They chose separate schools — she went to UC Berkeley, and he went to UC Davis. They broke up a bit, dated other people at the suggestion of their parents, but stayed in close touch.  “We were only about 100 miles apart, so we were able to see each other on weekends and over the summers, but what happened was because there was so much against us in the beginning, we did try to date other people, and split up," Gee said. "Our parents insisted that we make sure that we looked at other people, to make sure this relationship would be a strong one. But we always remained best friends.”  Fifty years after high school graduation and two children later, Gee is confident it was meant to be.  “We could always talk to each other, and laugh at each other’s jokes, laugh at each other’s idiosyncrasies. I could tell him anything, he could tell me anything. It was an unconditional acceptance.”         Play                 Facebook    Twitter    Embed      Chielo Isn't In a Rush to Date  0:49   autoplay  autoplay     Copy this code to your website or blog           advertisement     Stephanie and Jon Mandle went on their their first date at a McDonald’s right down the street from high school in Lexington, Massachusetts, where they met in 1996.  For them, “respect, trust and communication” are the keys that kept them together through separate schools and beyond. Today, they’re happily married, living in California, and their daughters are 6, 4 and 2.  “We didn’t do everything together,” said Stephanie. “We let each other have his or her own independence. It was really good for us to have our own separate lives for a few years.”  As with any relationship, it wasn’t all wine and roses (“we made some mistakes,” said Stephanie), but they made sure to talk it out. “My mom gave me some really good advice about letting go of the small stuff.”  These stories of perseverance and success aren’t the norm, say experts. More likely, one or both students will find the allure of new adventures in college too hard to pass up.  “If the fumes of high school life aren’t strong enough to keep you staying with your high school sweetheart, then it’s really easy to get distracted by all of the hot and sexy people in college, and the new experiences that are now available to you that weren’t available to you when you were living under your parents’ roof,” said Steinberg.  “You have no curfew, no one to answer to, and you can really explore who you want to be, and that’s what a lot of people do in college.”         Play                 Facebook    Twitter    Embed      Tyra Searcy Isn't Into Dating at the Moment  1:06   autoplay  autoplay     Copy this code to your website or blog         All that exploring can lead to the “turkey drop,” a phenomenon that, while unconfirmed by science, follows the conventional wisdom that high-school-to-college relationships are most likely to dissolve around Thanksgiving of the first year.  It may not be an urban legend. “The first semester is often very very stressful for students, and then by the time you roll in the holidays, that’s kind of the breaking point, because there’s also finals that they’re getting prepared for,” said Amy Lenhart, a college counselor and president of the American College Counseling Association. “And so, especially if they haven’t been good at communicating with that partner, it’s going to be even more difficult to stay together.”    advertisement     (Don’t breathe a sigh of relief, though, if you make it through Thanksgiving with your relationship intact — surveys have found that Christmas, New Year’s and Valentine’s Day can spell doom for couples, too).  The bottom line is, incoming freshmen hoping to stay tied to their high school mate should keep talking.

I never ever had to feel that I had to follow in his footsteps. We had our own paths, but they were parallel, and in the end they merged.  “Try to make sure that you fulfill your desires, your goals, what you want to do in life, but remain friends. And if it is really meant to be, you’ll come together. If you do break up and meet someone else, then probably it wasn’t strong enough.

Recent Surveys  A recent online survey of people who got married in between 2006 and 2007 found that a mere 14% of couples had met in school (including college). This figure was exactly equal to the percentage of married couples that met online.  High School Sweetheart Marriage  It’s hard to quantitate how many marriages in the US stemmed from high school romance, but one of the few figures available approximates that only about 2% of marriages are between high school sweethearts.  First-Time Bride One thing to consider when looking at high school sweethearts is the drastic change in median age of first-time brides over the years.  In 1960, the average age was 20 years old.  Between 1960 and 1990, that age only rose by 3-4 years.    A Sharp Rise However, between 1990 and 2010, the median age of first-time brides skyrocketed to 26.5, essentially doubling.  Liberal Marriage Recent statistics on high school sweethearts found that marriages tend to be happier amongst couples that identify as politically liberal.  Happy Divorces  Generally, high school sweethearts who get married have happier marriages than their counterparts who met later in life. Notably, they also have happier divorces.  According to research, high school sweethearts who divorced were more often than not on good terms with their exes, compared to divorced couples who met later in life.    High School Marriage High school sweethearts who got married as teenagers had a divorce rate of 46% after 10 years, which is pretty high compared to the 32% average divorce rate in the US.  Later Marriage High school sweethearts who waited until the age of 25 (or later) to marry had a 22% divorce rate, which is 10% lower than other couples.  General Divorce  In general, divorce rates in this country have actually declined over the past 30 years.  The statistics suggest that high school sweetheart marriages are more likely to last than others.    Spirituality  Evidence shows that marriages that have a spiritual component last longer. This stands even for marriages where the husband and wife are of different religions.  Mormons Mormons make an interesting profile for the study of high school sweethearts. They actually have the greatest divorce rate in the first three years of marriage amongst high school sweethearts, but they also are the most likely to stay married once their relationship lasts longer than 36 months.  Schooling  Don’t put on a ring on it just yet. When it comes to high school sweetheart statistics, there’s a lot of ups and down. For instance, only 19% of people who marry their high school sweethearts attend college. This is far lower than the near 70% of Americans who enrolled in college as of last October.    Concerns  Parents surveyed stated that their biggest concern regarding their child marrying a high school sweetheart was that their child would jump into parenthood too early. Perhaps this fear is founded if it relates to the low number of college attendees amongst this group.  Why Not  People who considered marrying their high school sweethearts and didn’t stated that their biggest reason for not doing so had nothing to do with love for another women or lack of love for their sweetheart, but rather a fear of losing freedom and a need to explore.    Reconnecting  People who didn’t marry their high school sweetheart are more likely to cheat on their partner with their high school sweetheart if they reconnect. More and more people are reconnecting because of social networks.  People who cheat on their partner with their high school sweetheart were also found to be more likely than average to have an alcoholic parent.  More Stats Research shows it doesn’t really matter who a person dates first—it's who they love first that can affect the staying power of a relationship.  While only 2% of marriages are between high school sweethearts, 25% of women say that they married their first love.

The Middle School definition of dating: Dating in Middle School (v.) – A title or label promoting the idea of romance that children are not yet capable of.  So why do it? You could probably ask a select circle of boys and girls in each grade, but as The Corner Editorial Board, we decided to think about this subject for this issue’s editorial.  We accept that, thanks to hormones, people have crushes, or romantic feelings directed to someone in particular. Somehow, the word “like” has been used so much in this sense that it now makes sense to say “Well I mean I like him, but not like, like.” Or “I like like her” which is somehow different then the “like” that you use to describe your teachers or your favorite books. The chances that the person you “like like” likes you in the same way are, let’s face it, kind of small. But on the off chance that the person who you “like” just happens to “like” you back, what would be the proper response?  That’s where “dating” comes in. Dating is a term mostly used by adults who are looking for someone to share their lives with. But as much as we write off, ignore, deny, or just plain oppose it, we are all children. So really what’s the point?  What even happens in a middle school relationship? We discussed that in our meeting and we have come up with a basic summary of the brief life of a middle school relationship. It goes something like this:  They dance. Admit grudgingly that they “like” each other. He asks her out (mostly), then that’s it for about a couple of agonizingly awkward days/weeks/months. There are some couples—to whom we would like to give props—who actually go out on a “real date” before classifying themselves as “dating,” so as not to give a false representation of the relationship. (By a real date we mean going to see a movie or out for ice cream).  Then they break up. And that’s it.  So why would anyone really bother?  The percentage of middle school relationships that last the three years until high school is less than ten percent, while eight percent of high school relationships work until marriage, and only five percent of the relationships that are started in high school lead to marriages that do not end in divorce. (We actually researched this online.)  So, to be clear, if you are in the ten percent that make it to high school with their relationship, then you have an eight percent chance of getting married, but a ninety-five percent chance of getting divorced. Not great odds if you ask us!  So, when you think about it, the chances that your middle school relationship or that couple that is “just so cute’s” relationship is going to work is extremely small. But, we do it anyway.  Think about it. When someone says to you “So what’s the latest gossip”, nine out of ten times they will be really hinting for you to say something like “Well, Andy just asked Emily out” and in all honesty, many of us in middle school secretly desire to be known. Using this logic, it makes sense for someone to want to be in a relationship. Maybe it’s that and the fact that every time someone says the name of the person you “like, like” to you, it makes your stomach fly. Maybe it’s that you want to claim that person for yourself.  Let’s say it again. We are children. We are not adults. We have our whole lives for romance, but only a couple more years of childhood. Savor it.  ~ The Corner Editorial Board 2012-13  ~ Illustration by Cassie C  Share this: Email Print More Facebook Google Twitter   Related      Post navigation   Previous Post Why I Hate “Les Mis” Next Post Mean Girls: The Judge, the Judged and everyone else       Check out the latest editorial from our editorial board  Does Middle School Matter in Life?

Marriages to second-loves are considerably more likely (36% of married people), and a further 25% of the married population have loved three or more people before their current partner.  A new YouGov study reveals that marriages untouched by prior love are stronger than more experienced partnerships in a number of respects.  As the first part of the study showed , unmarried relationships – more likely to be in their infancy – display a higher quality of love: 64% are definitely in love compared to 57% of the married population. Those who married their first love, however, are as sure of being in love as people in unmarried relationships (64%).     Only 19% of people in first-love marriages have considered leaving their partner; this compares to a third (34%) of married people who have loved before.  People who married their first love are also more likely (97%) to think they will be with their partner until their dying day than people who did not (88%).  Of course, this is partly a generational difference - older people are more likely to have married young (and therefore their first love), and some of the effect we are seeing may simply be down to generational differences on the view of marriage.  The study also finds some interesting differences in gender. Men are more likely to be sure they are in love with their partner (62% compared to 57% of women) and to find their partner sexually attractive (81% rather than 72% of women); likewise, 38% of women have thought about leaving their partner compared to 29% of men.

Although many high school sweethearts end up breaking up at some point in time, a surprising number of them end up marrying and establishing a new household at some point in life.  The average age of a first-time bride today is 26 years old.  High School Sweethearts Marriage  What is interesting about divorce rates amongst marriages is that those who tend to live in areas that would be defined as American liberal tend to have lower rates of divorce. Religion, age, and location all play roles, but one fact cannot be denied: those who marry their high school sweethearts tend to have happy marriages, even if they end up in divorce for some reason.   High school sweethearts that get married while still teenagers only have a 54% chance of having their marriage last 10 years.  High school sweethearts that wait until at least the age of 25 to get married have a 10 year success rate of 78%.  Only 19% of people who marry their high school sweethearts attend college.  14% of couples had met in school.   It’s the last fact right there that is most sobering. Only 1 out of 5 people who marry their high school sweethearts even get to college, no matter what their age happens to be when they get married. An even more staggering statistic is this: less than 2% of people who marry their high school sweethearts earn a degree from college. A lot has changed in 40 years in regards to the views of marriage and when to or when not to marry, but this simple fact remains: people don’t marry their high school sweetheart might be happier, but they are less competitive in the job market.  What Is It About Marrying Your First Love?   The biggest fear that parents have of their children marrying young, as a teen, is that they will become a parent too early.  Less than 2% of all marriages are actually to a high school sweetheart.  Many people end up not marrying their high school sweetheart because it isn’t a love for another person that they are feeling, but it is instead a love of freedom and exploration.  Relationships that have some sort of spiritual component to them are much more likely to succeed, even if there are contrasting religions or spiritual emphasis in the relationship.  In 1970, the average age of a first-time bridge was just 21 years of age.  All marriages have seen a decline in divorce rates over the past 30 years.  According to some research, couples who meet in school are less likely to divorce than couples who met in any other setting.   The real problem with looking at high school sweetheart relationships is that the data on these relationships is relatively limited. Even the data that does exist tends to be slanted in some way. For liberal magazines, using this as a specific example, the information is slanted to counter conservative claims about marriage. Data gathered by data websites is spun in such a way that using the website itself is promoted as a positive. What that means is that these statistics need to be taken with a grain of salt, but all of the data does suggest something: sometimes your first love really is your soul mate.   Are There Variations In The Data?   Mormons are more likely to divorce within the first 3 years of marriage than any other group of high school sweethearts, but this is likely because they tend to marry earlier than others as a demographic.  Mormons are also the most likely to stay married if a relationship lasts for more than 36 months.  According to a 2006 survey, only 14% of people actually met at school. Meeting through friends or meeting at work were more common ways that couples met and got married.  The most likely age demographic for someone to marry their high school sweetheart is in the 18-27 age group.  People who break up with their high school sweetheart and marry someone else are more likely to have an affair with the their sweetheart if they are able to reconnect.  The internet makes connecting or reconnecting with a high school sweetheart easier than ever before.  People who search out lost loves when they didn’t marry their high school sweetheart tend to come from homes where one parent was an alcoholic.   What we’re talking about here is the power of a first love. If two people fall in love together for the first time, it is an extremely powerful connection that doesn’t fade over the years. There are certainly times when busyness takes over a life and having a spouse and kids in a happy marriage makes life enjoyable, but not comparable to if that life was with a high school sweetheart. That’s why many try to reconnect and even people with deep religious beliefs can end up cheating on a spouse. The feeling of a love lost is a feeling the needs to be repaired, which is why a high school sweetheart relationship that takes a little time before marriage is one that can really last until death does them part.  Facts in Conclusion   25% of people are marrying their high school sweethearts today compared with those in the 1940’s.  According to some research, it doesn’t matter who you date first, but it does matter who you love first when it comes to building an enduring relationship.  Although only at most, 2% of marriages today are from a high school relationship, 25% of women say that they married their first love.   If you find someone that you genuinely love, then hold onto that person for life. Don’t waste your time on relationships where one person doesn’t love the other because that will lead to unhappiness.

Recent Surveys  A recent online survey of people who got married in between 2006 and 2007 found that a mere 14% of couples had met in school (including college). This figure was exactly equal to the percentage of married couples that met online.  High School Sweetheart Marriage  It’s hard to quantitate how many marriages in the US stemmed from high school romance, but one of the few figures available approximates that only about 2% of marriages are between high school sweethearts.  First-Time Bride One thing to consider when looking at high school sweethearts is the drastic change in median age of first-time brides over the years.  In 1960, the average age was 20 years old.  Between 1960 and 1990, that age only rose by 3-4 years.    A Sharp Rise However, between 1990 and 2010, the median age of first-time brides skyrocketed to 26.5, essentially doubling.  Liberal Marriage Recent statistics on high school sweethearts found that marriages tend to be happier amongst couples that identify as politically liberal.  Happy Divorces  Generally, high school sweethearts who get married have happier marriages than their counterparts who met later in life. Notably, they also have happier divorces.  According to research, high school sweethearts who divorced were more often than not on good terms with their exes, compared to divorced couples who met later in life.    High School Marriage High school sweethearts who got married as teenagers had a divorce rate of 46% after 10 years, which is pretty high compared to the 32% average divorce rate in the US.  Later Marriage High school sweethearts who waited until the age of 25 (or later) to marry had a 22% divorce rate, which is 10% lower than other couples.  General Divorce  In general, divorce rates in this country have actually declined over the past 30 years.  The statistics suggest that high school sweetheart marriages are more likely to last than others.    Spirituality  Evidence shows that marriages that have a spiritual component last longer. This stands even for marriages where the husband and wife are of different religions.  Mormons Mormons make an interesting profile for the study of high school sweethearts. They actually have the greatest divorce rate in the first three years of marriage amongst high school sweethearts, but they also are the most likely to stay married once their relationship lasts longer than 36 months.  Schooling  Don’t put on a ring on it just yet. When it comes to high school sweetheart statistics, there’s a lot of ups and down. For instance, only 19% of people who marry their high school sweethearts attend college. This is far lower than the near 70% of Americans who enrolled in college as of last October.    Concerns  Parents surveyed stated that their biggest concern regarding their child marrying a high school sweetheart was that their child would jump into parenthood too early. Perhaps this fear is founded if it relates to the low number of college attendees amongst this group.  Why Not  People who considered marrying their high school sweethearts and didn’t stated that their biggest reason for not doing so had nothing to do with love for another women or lack of love for their sweetheart, but rather a fear of losing freedom and a need to explore.    Reconnecting  People who didn’t marry their high school sweetheart are more likely to cheat on their partner with their high school sweetheart if they reconnect. More and more people are reconnecting because of social networks.  People who cheat on their partner with their high school sweetheart were also found to be more likely than average to have an alcoholic parent.  More Stats Research shows it doesn’t really matter who a person dates first—it's who they love first that can affect the staying power of a relationship.  While only 2% of marriages are between high school sweethearts, 25% of women say that they married their first love.

You started dating during your most awkward phases. You fell in love in the time of braces, heavy clownish makeup, and and douchey Abercrombie t-shirts. If you were attracted to each other even then, you’re set for life.  2. You’ve gotten to see how far each of you has come. You’ve seen each other graduate high school, head off to college, have no sense of direction for a couple years, kind of figure things out, graduate college, and cautiously step into adulthood. And now you can admire how much progress you’ve each made since you were teenagers.  3. You understand each other so well that sometimes words aren’t even necessary. You’ve known each other for a long time and know the things you have each experienced from adolescence into adulthood. So when one of you is having a hard time, you don’t even have to explain why. The other person just gets it.  4. There’s a solid foundation to fall back on. Every relationship has its ups and downs. And when you guys are in a low point together in which you’re stressed out or fighting a lot, it’s nice to know that you have such a firm basis.  5. That goes for fighting too. Fights and arguments are unavoidable in any relationship. But it’s nice having such a strong history and knowing that, like every other argument, you can work through this one.  6. You know each other’s quirks and “tells.” You know when they’re actually fine, and when they are upset. Because their behaviors and body language are now as familiar to you as breathing.  7. You have an endless amount of shared memories. So when you get to talk about some of the greatest joys you experienced as a ‘kid,’ they understand, because they were right there with you.  8. And the wonderful memories you’ve built together only get you more excited for what’s to come. Looking at your prom photos and reminiscing on how you used to anxiously await meeting up at your lockers just shows that there’s a lifetime of even more special moments ahead.  9. You understand that people change in relationships. You started dating as teenagers – you’re obviously totally different people now than you were then. Being high school sweethearts has taught you that you have to be adaptable in relationships, because people’s personalities and wants and needs will continuously change throughout life.  10. You’re basically Corey and Topanga. And nothing is stronger than that.  11. You’ve probably already made it through the hard parts of fighting to stay together. At some point all couples have to sit down and figure out what they want, where they want this to go, how committed they’re ready to get, etc. You already had to do all that when you went to college and when you entered the real world. So although there’s always going to be plenty to work through and talk through, you’ve already covered a lot of it.  12. ‘High school sweethearts’ is just one of many things you are to each other. You’re also soul mates, best friends, go-to persons for one another, cheerleaders, endless supporters, kindred spirits, partners, etc. These types of bonds don’t come around that often.  13. Your families are basically already family to each other. There’s no more polite exchanges of pleasantries. Your families have known each other for so long that they actually greet each other like old friends.  14. And your loved ones are usually super invested in your relationship. Sounds intense, but it’s actually just great. They’re always happy to support you and celebrate milestones and give you all the encouragement that you need. Because at this point, your significant other is just as much a part of your families’ lives as they are part of yours.  15. You’ve been in the habit, for years, of learning how to balance your relationship with the other parts of your life. You know that you can’t just spend all your time with that one person, so you’ve become an expert at balancing work, friends, and family in your life as well.  16. If you guys have ‘a song,’ it’s probably an awesome throwback. Like ‘Hey There Delilah.’ Or ‘Collide.’ Or something by Lifehouse.  17. They’ve been there for you since the beginning. So you have no trouble trusting that they’ll be there for you through everything else, too.  Want to laugh more easily in 2017? Follow ‘Humor Catalog’ on Facebook!

We were junior high sweethearts, meeting in 7th grade at the art table. We’ve been together ever since. This October, we will celebrate 6 years of marriage.    Many critics will probably highlight the negatives of marrying your high school sweetheart. Where’s the spontaneous chance to “play the field?” How can you be sure someone is your “one and only” if you haven’t explored very many possibilities if any?    I can understand this perspective, but I certainly don’t share in these views For me, sacrificing the relationship I had with Chad was never worth the opportunity to “explore other possibilities.” Life without him, even in exchange for “freedom” was never worth it.   How can you be sure someone is your “one and only” if you haven’t explored very many possibilities, if any?   However, I can agree there are negatives to marrying your high school sweetheart. Think of your most awkward stage in junior high or high school. You know, the messy hair, the mom jeans at 13, the fads you which you’d have passed on. Think of the worst school picture you have, the one you’ve tried to obliterate from all photo albums and memories.    Now imagine your spouse was there to witness those moments live.    I will never be able to obliterate from my husband’s mind my horrible, frizzy bowl-cut stage from 7th grade coupled with my love of tie-dye shirts, no matter how hard I try.    Overall, though, when thinking about my relationship and the fact we’ve been together so long, the benefits certainly outweigh the horrible photographs and awkward stages. All in all, I think there are many benefits to marrying your high school sweetheart.    1. Your relationship survived periods of great change.    Most relationships must weather periods of change and turmoil at some point. For some, these times come after marriage, when the stakes are even higher. For us, though, the periods of turmoil and change came before marriage.    Meeting your significant other before you’ve graduated means you’ve managed to maintain a bond through the most tumultuous period of life. You’ve both had to go through the period of discovering who you are, what you want in life, and how to deal with the slap in the face from the real world.    If you can survive as a couple through those late teen years when you’re wading through waters of uncertainty or even if you find each other again afterward, chances are you’ll be able to handle other life changes together. If at the end of this period of self-discovery you find you still want to fit together, you’ve probably created a solid foundation for marriage.    2. High school reunions aren’t so awkward.    This summer, we attended our 10-year high school reunion. While other spouses were left sipping sodas in the corner trying to laugh at jokes they didn’t understand, neither of us had to experience that. We both had people to see and stories to tell. Walking into your 10-year reunion with a fellow classmate beside you makes the whole process less intimidating.    3. Sharing a hometown means sharing common experiences.    For those high school sweethearts who actually attend the same high school, living in the same hometown can create common experiences and lead to similar values. We see the world in somewhat similar ways because we grew up in the same part of the world. No matter where you go in life, your roots are an essential thread in the fabric of who you are. We both have similar threads, leading to shared perspectives, values, and even a stronger bond.    4. Your connection has time to grow/mature before marriage.    When we said “I do,” we had a decade of being together under our belts. Certainly, marriage is always difficult and complex. It changes things.    Going to the altar, though, with years of memories, connections, and triumphs as a couple can harbor confidence in your vows. I knew when we said our vows we had a foundation to be successful in the next step of our life together.    5. You have adorable photographs for your mantle.    Minus the awkward ___th grade photo you hate, of course. Proms, graduations, dances―we have photos from all of the momentous occasions with both of us in them.   Having a single one-and-only for the majority of your adult life (or all of it) can be less devastating to the heart.   6. Going from friends to lovers strengthens your emotional connection.    For many high school sweethearts, friendship and the emotional bond is at the forefront of the early years. My husband and I found we had years in high school to work on our emotional connection and to get to know each other at a fundamental level.    Without the pressures of adult romance, such as when to move in together or dealing with career choices in addition to relationship choices, we had time to focus on getting to know each other before life got too complicated.    Even though most teenagers don’t believe this, life in high school is often simpler than adult life at the core. Stripping away some of the difficulties of the “real world” allows you to build a friendship as a basis for your relationship. This friendship has enhanced the core elements of our relationship, giving us a sturdy foundation to build our marriage upon.    7. We can share “do you remember when” laughs.    All of those laughable moments from high school, those gut-splitting stories of teenage craziness, are memories we share. We can reminisce together and share in the laughter of the past.    We still live in our hometown, so we sometimes see old peers when we’re out. No lengthy explanations are needed to explain who so-and-so was; we can both go all in with our memories. The connection that comes from a common past helps us share in more moments together.    8. Our hearts are relatively free of breaks and cracks.    Certainly, we had devastating moments as a couple. There were moments of tears, of anger, of regret, of guilt. There were fights that plagued us; there are still fights today. No love is perfect.    For some high school sweethearts, there might even be periods of separation, of throwing in the towel, of wandering away from the love before finding it again.    Still, our hearts remain relatively trauma-free. Having a single one-and-only for the majority of your adult life (or all of it) can be less devastating to the heart. I didn’t have to agonize over failed relationship after failed relationship to find “the elusive one.” I didn’t experience tons of heartbreak before finding a man who completed me.    Some would call this a detrimental consequence of marrying your high school sweetheart. Heartbreak is a human emotion that allows you to see love with eyes of truth.    To be honest, I don’t know if this is true or not. However, I do know having a relationship that isn’t tainted by past hurts can be a benefit, at least in my situation. I didn’t walk into this relationship with previous notions about love or trust issues. A break-free heart might not be the healthiest thing or even rational, but it’s helped me experience love without hesitation.    9. We are close with our in-laws.    Being together in high school means we spent a lot of time with our families. I knew my in-laws like my own family before we got married, and vice versa. Having time to build a relationship with your significant other’s family before saying “I do” leads to better relationships in marriage. It gives you time to sort out your place in the family, your connections, and even issues that may surface well in advance.    10. We have more years together.    At 28, I’ve already had 16 years with my husband. We’ve had 16 years of laughs, of memories, of hand holding, of fun. We’ve had 16 years of holidays, of trips, of simple moments in our hometown.    Marrying your high school sweetheart has the simple benefit of more years of memory-making, more years together, something any real love craves.    My experience may not be everyone’s experience. As I said, one can certainly find negative aspects to marrying someone you were with in high school. Looking back, though, I’m grateful for the time we’ve shared and our love story that isn’t unique in its beginnings but is unique in the way it works for us.    Not everyone can marry their high school sweetheart. For some, the time for this has already passed. Still, I think the benefits of marrying a high school sweetheart can teach lessons in love for any relationship. Really, the bottom line is this, no matter what stage of life you’re in: Marry the person you can’t stand to make memories without.    If this happens in high school, great. If it doesn’t, you can still find your own list of benefits as long as you find someone who understands you at the core, appreciates where you come from, and is willing to make a lifetime of memories with you. With some hard work and dedication, the rest will fall into place.

Of all college relationships, nearly 33 percent are long-distance, according to an iVillage survey .  But do they last? If you’re out of college, think about your Facebook friends: How many are still together with — or even married to — their high school sweethearts?    advertisement     “It’s definitely possible, but it’s rare, because the chances of you knowing who you want to be with at 40 when you’re 17 are kind of low,” said Tracey Steinberg, a dating coach. “But it happens, and love is rare. And it’s worth the wait if it’s real.”  Going the (long) distance is not easy: Challenges including overcoming communication barriers, resisting the temptation of a fun, new social life and scraping together the finances to visit each other at separate schools.

But the next time you grumble about a spotty Skype connection or a pricey plane ticket, think about Barbara Gee and Gordon Baranco.  The pair got together at age 16, despite the misgivings of their parents (Barbara is Chinese-American, and Gordon is African-American), who threatened to disown them.  They chose separate schools — she went to UC Berkeley, and he went to UC Davis. They broke up a bit, dated other people at the suggestion of their parents, but stayed in close touch.  “We were only about 100 miles apart, so we were able to see each other on weekends and over the summers, but what happened was because there was so much against us in the beginning, we did try to date other people, and split up," Gee said. "Our parents insisted that we make sure that we looked at other people, to make sure this relationship would be a strong one. But we always remained best friends.”  Fifty years after high school graduation and two children later, Gee is confident it was meant to be.  “We could always talk to each other, and laugh at each other’s jokes, laugh at each other’s idiosyncrasies. I could tell him anything, he could tell me anything. It was an unconditional acceptance.”         Play                 Facebook    Twitter    Embed      Chielo Isn't In a Rush to Date  0:49   autoplay  autoplay     Copy this code to your website or blog           advertisement     Stephanie and Jon Mandle went on their their first date at a McDonald’s right down the street from high school in Lexington, Massachusetts, where they met in 1996.  For them, “respect, trust and communication” are the keys that kept them together through separate schools and beyond. Today, they’re happily married, living in California, and their daughters are 6, 4 and 2.  “We didn’t do everything together,” said Stephanie. “We let each other have his or her own independence. It was really good for us to have our own separate lives for a few years.”  As with any relationship, it wasn’t all wine and roses (“we made some mistakes,” said Stephanie), but they made sure to talk it out. “My mom gave me some really good advice about letting go of the small stuff.”  These stories of perseverance and success aren’t the norm, say experts. More likely, one or both students will find the allure of new adventures in college too hard to pass up.  “If the fumes of high school life aren’t strong enough to keep you staying with your high school sweetheart, then it’s really easy to get distracted by all of the hot and sexy people in college, and the new experiences that are now available to you that weren’t available to you when you were living under your parents’ roof,” said Steinberg.  “You have no curfew, no one to answer to, and you can really explore who you want to be, and that’s what a lot of people do in college.”         Play                 Facebook    Twitter    Embed      Tyra Searcy Isn't Into Dating at the Moment  1:06   autoplay  autoplay     Copy this code to your website or blog         All that exploring can lead to the “turkey drop,” a phenomenon that, while unconfirmed by science, follows the conventional wisdom that high-school-to-college relationships are most likely to dissolve around Thanksgiving of the first year.  It may not be an urban legend. “The first semester is often very very stressful for students, and then by the time you roll in the holidays, that’s kind of the breaking point, because there’s also finals that they’re getting prepared for,” said Amy Lenhart, a college counselor and president of the American College Counseling Association. “And so, especially if they haven’t been good at communicating with that partner, it’s going to be even more difficult to stay together.”    advertisement     (Don’t breathe a sigh of relief, though, if you make it through Thanksgiving with your relationship intact — surveys have found that Christmas, New Year’s and Valentine’s Day can spell doom for couples, too).  The bottom line is, incoming freshmen hoping to stay tied to their high school mate should keep talking.

I never ever had to feel that I had to follow in his footsteps. We had our own paths, but they were parallel, and in the end they merged.  “Try to make sure that you fulfill your desires, your goals, what you want to do in life, but remain friends. And if it is really meant to be, you’ll come together. If you do break up and meet someone else, then probably it wasn’t strong enough. It probably was good that you went in divergent paths.”        Amy DiLuna     Topic  Freshman Year   First Published  Aug 15 2015, 6:45 am ET         Next Story  Just Over Half of All College Students Actually Graduate, Report Finds           advertisement            advertisement       advertisement                   About Us  Careers  Contact    Privacy Policy   Terms of Service    nbcnews.com Site Map    Advertise    AdChoices   © 2018 NBCnews.com                                             We'd love your feedback on our redesign!
