This is a random draw for an ultra race where there were 363 entrants for 232 spots. There is an argument about whether the selection was biased against a certain group of 12 people.  My initial attempt at calculating this was that there was 232 choose 363 possible selections. The number of combinations of any one person from the list of twelve is 1 choose 12 + 2 choose 12 + ... + 11 choose 12 + 12 choose 12.
Thus 1 choose 12 + 2 choose 12 .... / 232 choose 363.
Which ends up being a very low number which is clearly too low.

First, you're now dealing with a likelihood rather than a probability as the outcome is known. Second, it doesn't matter what the theoretical likelihood is, given that you have a result. I think it would be better to approach the method used for selection: how were the selections chosen? You need to prove the correctness of the method, not the correctness of the result. – Michelle  Mar 6 '12 at 21:23        1      One would view this as a likelihood, Michelle, for the purpose of estimating selection probabilities.  That does not appear to be the case here. – whuber ♦  Mar 6 '12 at 22:43            You need to be careful in using the simple calculation of the hypergeometric RV, as the 12 people who are complaining are not randomly selected. They are complaining because they were not selected. – Guy  Mar 8 '12 at 22:46        add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  8  down vote  accepted      I interpret the question like this: suppose the sampling was purportedly carried out as if $363$ tickets of white paper were put in a jar, each labeled with the name of one person, and $232$ were taken out randomly after thoroughly stirring the jar's contents.  Beforehand, $12$ of the tickets were colored red.  What is the chance that exactly two of the selected tickets are red?  What is the chance that at most two of the tickets are red?  An exact formula can be obtained, but we don't need to do that much theoretical work.  Instead, we just track the chances as the tickets are pulled from the jar.  At the time $m$ of them have been withdrawn, let the chance that exactly $i$ red tickets have been seen be written $p(i,m)$.  To get started, note that $p(i,0)=0$ if $i\gt 0$ (you can't have any red tickets before you get started) and $p(0,0)=1$ (it's certain you have no red tickets at the outset).  Now, on the most recent draw, either the ticket was red or it wasn't.  In the first case, we previously had a chance $p(i-1,m-1)$ of seeing exactly $i-1$ red tickets.  We then happened then to pull a red one from the remaining $363 - m + 1$ tickets, making it exactly $i$ red tickets so far.  Because we assume all tickets have equal chances at every stage, our chance of drawing a red in this fashion was therefore $(12-i+1) / (363 - m + 1)$.  In the other case, we had a chance $p(i,m-1)$ of obtaining exactly $i$ red tickets in the previous $m-1$ draws, and the chance of not adding another red ticket to the sample on the next draw was $(363 - m + 1 - 12 + i) / (363 - m + 1)$.  Whence, using basic axioms of probability (to wit, chances of two mutually exclusive cases add and conditional chances multiply),  $$p(i,m) = \frac{p(i-1,m-1) (12-i+1) + p(i,m-1) (363 - m + 1 - 12 + i)}{363 - m + 1}.$$  We repeat this calculation recursively, laying out a triangular array of the values of $p(i,m)$ for $0\le i\le 12$ and $0 \le m \le 232$.  After a little calculation we obtain $p(2,232) \approx 0.000849884$ and $p(0,232)+p(1,232)+p(2,232)\approx 0.000934314$, answering both versions of the question.  These are small numbers: no matter how you look at it, they are pretty rare events (rarer than one in a thousand).  As a double-check, I performed this exercise with a computer 1,000,000 times.  In 932 = 0.000932 of these experiments, 2 or fewer red tickets were observed.  This is extremely close to the calculated result, because the sampling fluctuation in the expected value of 934.3 is about 30 (up or down).  Here is how the simulation is done in R:  > population <- c(rep(1,12), rep(0, 363-12)) # 1 is a "red" indicator
> results <- replicate(10^6, 
             sum(sample(population, 232)))   # Count the reds in 10^6 trials
> sum(results <= 2)                          # How many trials had 2 or fewer reds?
[1] 948  This time, because the experiments are random, the results changed a little: two or fewer red tickets were observed in 948 of the million trials.  That still is consistent with the theoretical result.)  The conclusion is that it's highly unlikely that two or fewer of the 232 tickets will be red. If you indeed have a sample of 232 of 363 people, this result is a strong indication that the tickets-in-a-jar model is not a correct description of how the sample was obtained. Alternative explanations include (a) the red tickets were made more difficult to take from the jar (a "bias" against them) as well as (b) the tickets were colored after the sample was observed ( post-hoc data snooping, which does not indicate any bias).  An example of explanation (b) in action would be a jury pool for a notorious murder trial.  Suppose it included 363 people.  Out of that pool, the court interviewed 232 of them.  An ambitious newspaper reporter meticulously reviews the vitae of everyone in the pool and notices that 12 of the 363 were goldfish fanciers, but only two of them had been interviewed.  Is the court biased against goldfish fanciers?  Probably not.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 6 '12 at 22:42       whuber ♦   188k 28 399 739                  NB In the simulation, it does not matter that it is the very first 12 "tickets" that are marked, because all sampling is performed randomly without replacement (via sample ).  In effect, at each iteration sample thoroughly mixes the tickets each time it is called before it withdraws 232 of them. – whuber ♦  Mar 6 '12 at 23:19        2      Goodness - that wasn't actually the result I expected. Thank you for your thorough work and good explanation.

So you can obtain any such probabilities directly in, say, R:  Probability of exactly 2 out of 12 selected:  > dhyper(2, 12, 363-12, 232)
   [1] 0.0008498838  Probability of 2 or fewer out of 12 selected:  > phyper(2, 12, 363-12, 232)

The hypergeometric distribution classically appears in sampling-resampling experiments.  The 12 specific people (my "red tickets") are like fish that have been caught, marked, and thrown back into the pool; the sample of 232 is like the set of fish that are subsequently caught.  The hypergeometric distribution describes the frequencies of recaptured fish. – whuber ♦  Mar 7 '12 at 15:15        add a comment |             up vote  -1  down vote      The odds are much higher than calculated with the simple hypergeometric distribution, as the group is not chosen randomly ( "12 fish are painted red before the draw" ).  From the description of the question, we are testing for a fraud in the draw. A specific group of 12 people complained that only 2 of them were selected, while the expected number was 232/363~2/3=8.  What we really need to calculated is what are the odds that " No group of size 12 will have only 2 member selected". The odds that at least one group will have 2 or fewer (therefore will complain against the fairness of the draw) are much higher.  When I run this simulation, and check in how many of the trials none of the 30 (=360/12) groups had 2 or fewer selections, I get about 2.3% of the times. 1:42 is low but not impossible.  You should still check the procedure of the draw as it might be biased against a specific group of people. They might have come together and received a range of the draw with less probability (the first or last numbers, for example), or whatever dependent variable on the procedure of the draw. But if you don't find any flaw in the procedure, you can return to the 1:42 odds that it is simply bad luck for the group.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 10 '12 at 8:30             answered Mar 9 '12 at 14:42       Guy   254 3 5                  A good point, BUT (a) surely not every possible group of 12 has enough similarity to matter, and (b) not all groups that have enough similarity to matter have exactly 12 members. – zbicyclist  Mar 9 '12 at 15:21            @zbicyclist, I don't claim that the calculation is accurate. I wanted to give a reasonable doubt (as we are in the realm of the law with fraud detection), that the draw is not guilty. – Guy  Mar 9 '12 at 15:33        add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

This is not a homework question, I'm just trying to learn some "advanced" statistics techniques out of personal interest (for example, I've recently learned that you can find the probability distribution for the sum of two independent events by convolving the individual distributions). So I'd like to know if there's a "better" way to do this than enumerating all the possible outcomes and counting those that fit the criterion. I suppose the criteria for "better" would be:   Less computationally expensive (i.e. faster if it were to be implemented on a computer)  More interesting from a mathematical analysis standpoint.   Thank you   Update to question  How would I generalize the explanation in dsaxton's answer, namely:  $P(\max(X_1, X_2) = k) = 2 P(X_1 = k \cap X_2 \leq k) - P(X_1 = k \cap X_2 = k)$  to the maximum of three or more dice?  In the case of the max of three dice, it looks like the cases are:   $x1 = k$ and $x2 \leq k$ and $x3 \leq k$  $x2 = k$ and $x1 \leq k$ and $x3 \leq k$  $x3 = k$ and $x1 \leq k$ and $x2 \leq k$   which suggests that the probability would be  $P(\max(x1, x2, x3) = k) = P(x1 = k \cap x2 \leq k \cap x3 \leq k) + P(x2 = k \cap x1 \leq k \cap x3 \leq k) + P(x3 = k \cap x1 \leq k \cap x2 \leq k) - P(x1 = k \cap x2 = k \cap x3 = k)$  (though maybe this is still multi-counting?)

So we just add the probabilities of these events (which by symmetry are equal) and subtract their intersection to avoid double counting,  \begin{align}
P(\max(X_1, X_2) = k) &= 2 P(X_1 = k \cap X_2 \leq k) - P(X_1 = k \cap X_2 = k) \\
&= \frac{2k}{36} - \frac{1}{36} \\
&= \frac{2k - 1}{36} .
\end{align}  To extend this idea to $m$ dice it gets a bit more complicated as we need to be more careful about applying the inclusion exclusion principle .  Let $A_i \equiv \{ X_i = k \cap X_j \leq k \text{ for $j \neq i$}\}$.  Then  \begin{align}
P(\max(X_1, \ldots , X_m) = k) =& P(\cup_{i=1}^{m} A_i) \\
=& \sum_{i=1}^{m} P(A_i) - \sum_{i \neq j} P(A_i \cap A_j) + \\
& \sum_{i \neq j, i \neq l, j \neq l} P(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_l) - \\
& \ldots + (-1)^{m + 1} P(\cap_{i=1}^{m} A_i) \\
=& \frac{m k^{m - 1}}{6^m} - \binom{m}{2} \frac{k^{m - 2}}{6^m} + \\
& \binom{m}{3} \frac{k^{m - 3}}{6^m} - \ldots + (-1)^{m + 1} \frac{1}{6^m} \\
=& \frac{1}{6^m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (-1)^{i+1} \binom{m}{i} k^{m - i} .
\end{align}  Edit:  I just realized the title of your post seems to be asking a different question than what's in the post itself.  If you want to find the probability that $X_1 \geq X_2$ then you can take a conditional expectation,  \begin{align}
P(X_1 \geq X_2) &= \text{E}[P(X_1 \geq X_2 \mid X_1)] \\
&= \text{E} \left ( \frac{X_1}{6} \right ) \\
&= \frac{3.5}{6} .
\end{align}  Here we've used the general result that $\text{E}(X) = \text{E}[\text{E}(X \mid Y)]$ for random variables $X$ and $Y$, and that probabilities themselves may be viewed as expectations of indicator random variables.  Even simpler perhaps, we can arrive at the answer by basically only using the fact that probabilities sum to one,  $$
P(X_1 \geq X_2) + P(X_2 \geq X_1) - P(X_1 = X_2) = 1 \Rightarrow \\
2 P(X_1 \geq X_2) - \frac{1}{6} = 1 \Rightarrow \\
P(X_1 \geq X_2) = \frac{3.5}{6} .

Is $n$ also known? (e.g. let's say my sequence was $(0.61,0.23,0.92)$, so $X_2=(0.61,0.92)$; do I only know $m=2$, do I know that $m=2$ and $n=3$, or do I know $x_2=0.93$?) Is this connected with some subject? – Glen_b ♦  Jan 11 '15 at 0:21         6      Easy: The probability that the largest of $n$ i.i.d observations is in specific position $i$ is clearly $1/n$ (since it has equal chance to be in any position); that still applies when $i=n$. – Glen_b ♦  Jan 11 '15 at 4:38         1      @Glen_b, thanks, call this an equally accepted answer. I think the questions asked were as helpful as the answer itself. – REFlint  Jan 11 '15 at 9:17        2      @Glen_b's comment is the best answer here because it generalizes to complicated situations the other answers cannot handle. For instance, when all the $x_i$ are independent with any common underlying distribution and $f$ is any measurable function of $n-1$ variables, then $\Pr(x_i \gt f(x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\ldots,x_{n}))$ does not depend on $i$, by exactly the same reasoning. In the present case $f=\max$. The nature of $f$ and the continuity of the uniform distribution assure that all $n$ of these events are (almost surely) mutually exclusive, immediately giving the $1/n$ result. – whuber ♦  Jan 15 '15 at 22:04        |  show 3 more comments          3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  5  down vote  accepted      Uppercase $X$ denotes random variables, lowercase $x$ denotes realizations of random variables.  If the realization of the sequence is known up to $n-1$, then we know what the value of the maximum is up to then, say $x_{(n-1)}$. Then we want the probability  $$\Pr\big(X_n > x_{(n-1)}) = 1-x_{(n-1)}$$  If we don't know  the actual realizations, then the probability we are after is the probability of the difference of two independent random variables:  $$\Pr\big(X_n > X_{(n-1)} \big) = \Pr\big(X_{(n-1)} -X_n \leq 0 \big)$$  (since we have continuous RVs the appearance of weak inequality to conform with standard expressions is neutral to the results).  The distribution of $X_n$ is $U(0,1)$. $X_{(n-1)}$ is the maximum order statistic from a sample of $n-1$ independent $U(0,1)$ random variables so its distribution and probability density functions are  $$F_{X_{(n-1)}} (x_{(n-1)}) = x_{(n-1)}^{n-1},\;\;\; f_{X_{(n-1)}} (x_{(n-1)}) = (n-1)x_{(n-1)}^{n-2}$$  Deriving the distribution of their difference $Z = X_{(n-1)} -X_n$ requires some care. $Z$ ranges in $(-1,1)$ while its defining components are non-negative. We can instead opt for the specific probability we are after: in order for $Z\leq 0$ it must be the case that $X_{(n-1)} \leq  X_n$. The general formula for calculating such a probability is  $$P(Y < W) = \int_{S_w}\int_{\{y<w\}}f_{YW}(y,w) {\rm d}y{\rm d}w$$ 
which in our case becomes (decomposing the joint density into the product of the marginals due to independence)  $$\Pr(Z\leq 0) = \int_0^1\int_0^{x_n}(n-1)x_{(n-1)}^{n-2}\cdot 1 {\rm d}x_{(n-1)}{\rm d}x_n$$  $$= \int_0^1x_n^{n-1} {\rm d}x_n = \frac 1n$$  That this probability decreases with $n$ (and so with $n-1$) is intuitive: the more chances the sequence has of obtaining the theoretical maximum, the more probable it is that it will get closer and closer to it, and so the less probable is that the next value will be even bigger.  Simulations verify the above result.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jan 15 '15 at 6:37             answered Jan 11 '15 at 2:15       Alecos Papadopoulos   38.8k 1 81 168              1      +1 for having actually read the question and given the answer for the uniform distribution, as requested. – Placidia  Jan 11 '15 at 2:24        add a comment |              up vote  3  down vote      Not quite sure of the setup. Here are some answers.  If you observe $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1}$, and wonder if the next observation will top the series, then the answer is $1-F(M)$, where $F$ is the cumulative distribution function and $M$ is the maximum of the first $n-1$ observations.  On the other hand, if you only observe $x_n$ and wonder about the probability that this was the maximum of the series, then the answer is $$F(x_n)^{n-1}$$.  And on the third hand, if you observe nothing at all, but wonder about the probability that the maximum will occur on the last observation, then the probability is $1/n$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jan 11 '15 at 2:13       Placidia   10.4k 4 23 49              1      Note: if this was actually a homework question it should have been tagged as such and I should not have answered it. – Placidia  Jan 11 '15 at 2:13        1      (+1) For the middle scenario that I missed. – Alecos Papadopoulos  Jan 11 '15 at 2:22        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      disclaimer: I'm not a statistician or algebrist.

orthogonal signals being transmitted and the
receiver attempting to decide which one was transmitted by examining
the outputs of $M$ filters matched to the signals. Conditioned
on the identity of the transmitted signal, the sample outputs of
the matched filters are (conditionally) independent unit-variance
normal random variables. The sample output
of the filter matched to the signal transmitted is a
$N(\mu,1)$ random variable while the outputs of all the other filters
are $N(0,1)$ random variables.  The conditional probability of a correct decision (which in the
present context is the event $C = \{X_0 > \max_i X_i\}$) conditioned
on $X_0 = \alpha$ is 
$$P(C \mid X_0 = \alpha) = \prod_{i=1}^n P\{X_i < \alpha \mid X_0 = \alpha\} 
= \left[\Phi(\alpha)\right]^n$$
where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the cumulative probability distribution 
of a standard normal random variable, and hence the unconditional
probability is 
$$P(C) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}P(C \mid X_0 = \alpha)
\phi(\alpha-\mu)\,\mathrm d\alpha
= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\Phi(\alpha)\right]^n
\phi(\alpha-\mu)\,\mathrm d\alpha$$
where $\phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal density function.
There is no closed-form expression for the value of this
integral which must be evaluated numerically.
Engineers are also interested in the complementary event -- that
the decision is in error -- but do not like to compute this as
$$P\{X_0 < \max_i X_i\} = P(E) = 1-P(C)$$
because this requires very careful evaluation of the integral for $P(C)$
to an accuracy of many significant digits, and such evaluation is both
difficult and time-consuming. Instead, the integral for
$1-P(C)$ can be integrated by parts to get
$$P\{X_0 < \max_i X_i\} =
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} n \left[\Phi(\alpha)\right]^{n-1}\phi(\alpha)
\Phi(\alpha - \mu)\,\mathrm d\alpha.$$
This integral is more easy to evaluate numerically,
and its value as a function of $\mu$ is graphed and
tabulated (though unfortunately only for $n \leq 20$)
in Chapter 5 of Telecommunication Systems
Engineering by Lindsey and Simon, Prentice-Hall 1973,
Dover Press 1991.
Alternatively, engineers use the union bound or Bonferroni inequality
$$\begin{align*}
P\{X_0 < \max_i X_i\} &= P\left\{(X_0 < X_1)\cup (X_0 < X_2) \cup \cdots 
\cup (X_0 < X_n)\right\}\\
&\leq \sum_{i=1}^{n}P\{X_0 < X_i\}\\
&= nQ\left(\frac{\mu}{\sqrt{2}}\right)
\end{align*}$$
where $Q(x) = 1-\Phi(x)$ is the complementary cumulative normal
distribution function.  From the union bound, we see that the desired value $0.01$ for
$P\{X_0 < \max_i X_i\}$ is bounded above by $60\cdot Q(\mu/\sqrt{2})$
which bound has value $0.01$ at $\mu = 5.09\ldots$. This is
slightly larger than the more exact value $\mu = 4.919\ldots$ 
obtained by @whuber by numerical integration.  More discussion and details about $M$-ary orthogonal signaling

$ P(E) = (N-1) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  \int_y^{\infty} p(x_0) p(y) \Phi^{N-2}(y) dx_0 dy$  You may need to look into various approximations in order to tractably deal with this for your specific application.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 15 '12 at 20:14       Dave   2,149 9 20              5      +1 Actually, the double integral simplifies into a single integral since $$\int_y^\infty p(x_0)\,\mathrm dx_0 = 1 - \Phi(y-\mu)$$ giving $$P(E) = 1 - (N-1)\int_{-\infty}^\infty \Phi^{N-2}(y)p(y)\Phi(y-\mu)\,\mathrm dy$$ which is the same as in my answer. – Dilip Sarwate  Nov 15 '12 at 23:35        add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

What is the probability that if I shout out an $x$, then $x$ will be exactly the second highest of all the draws?  I have a feeling its something like $n x^{n-1} (1-x)$, but I can't show it rigorously.    probability     share | cite | improve this question     asked Nov 25 '14 at 2:36       ProbsNot   159 6              add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  1  down vote      There are $n-1$ draws, then you draw $x$ on the $n$-th draw.  The probability that the $n$-th draw is the second-last order statistic of the $n$ draws, when given the value of that draw is $x$, is:  $$\frac{(n-1)!}{(n-2)!\;1!}x^{n-2}(1-x) \\[4ex] = (n-1)(1-x)x^{n-2}$$  Reasoning: Of the $n-1$ draws preceding yours, the favoured space is formed by $n-2$ of them being no greater than yours (individual probability $x$ each), and $1$ of them being no less (probability $1-x$), and there are ${n-1\choose n-2}$ ways of arranging these favoured results.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 25 '14 at 7:00       Graham Kemp   73.6k 4 30 66              add a comment |             up vote  -1  down vote      The problem is equivalent to finding the probability that $x$ is the second last order statistic.
In that case, out of the remaining $(n-1)$ draws, there should be $n-2$ draws which are smaller than $x$ and 1 draw is bigger than $x$. The probability of a draw being smaller than $x$ is $F(x)=x$. There are in total $n$ independent draws, out of which $n-1$ are smaller than or equal to $x$ so each has probability $F(x)=x$, and the last draw is greater than $x$ having probability $1-F(x)=1-x$. Note that these draws form a Binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $F(x)$.  So you have the required probability as $\dfrac{n!}{(n-1)!1!}$$x^{n-1}$$(1-x)$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 25 '14 at 2:57       Landon Carter   6,803 1 13 36              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

uncertainty of statements or events. It gives a numerical measure for the degree
of certainty (or degree of uncertainty) of the occurrence of an event.   Another way to define probability is the
ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of all possible
outcomes. The enumeration of all possible outcomes is called as the sample
space.   If there are totally n possible outcomes
in a sample space, S and m of those are favorable for an event, A. then
probability of event, A is given as   P(A) = (number of favorable outcomes) /
(total number of possible outcomes)   = n(A) / n(S)   = m/n   Example:- Find the probability of getting a 3 or 5 while
throwing a dice.   Answer:- Sample space, S = {1,2,3,4,5,6} and Event, A =
{3,5}.   n(A) = 2 and n(S) = 6.   So, P(A) = n(A) / n(S) = 2/6 = 0.3333       Axioms of Probability:      All probability values are positive numbers not greater than
1, i.e. 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. An event that is not likely to occur or impossible has
probability zero, while an highly likely event has a probability one.    Example:- P(A
pregnant human being a female) = 1   Example:- P(A
human male being pregnant) = 0.       If the probability that an event occurs is p, then the
probability that the event does not occur is q = (1-p). i.e. probability of the
complement of an event = 1 - probability of the event.    i.e. P(Ā) =
1 - P(A)   Example:- Find the
probability of not getting a 3 or 5 while throwing a dice.   Answer:- Sample
space, S = {1,2,3,4,5,6} and Event, B = {1,2,4,6}.   n(B) = 4 and n(S) = 6.   So, P(B) = n(B) / n(S) = 4/6 = 0.6667   Now A and B are complementary events, i.e. B = Ā.   So: 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.3333 = 0.6667 = P(B) = P(Ā).       If A and b are two different events then, P(A U B) = P(A) +
P(B) - P(A ∩ B). Consider the Venn diagram. P(A U B) is the probability of the
sum of all sample points in A U B. Now P(A) + P(B) is the sum of probabilities
of sample points in A and in B. Since we added up the sample points in (A ∩ B)
twice, we need to subtract once to obtain the sum of probabilities in (A U B),
which is P(A U B).     Example:- Probability that John passes a Math exam is 4/5 and
that he passes a Chemistry exam is 5/6. If the probability that he passes both
exams is 3/4, find the probability that he is pass at least one exam.   Answer:- Let M = John passes Math exam, and C = John passes
Chemistry exam.   P(John passes at least one exam) = P(M U C) = P(M) + P(C) - P(M ∩ C)   = 4/5 + 5/6 - 3/4   = 53/60      If two events, A and B are mutually exclusive then, P(A U B)
= P(A) + P(B). This follows immediately from (3). Since A and B are mutually
exclusive, n(A ∩ B)=0 and so P(A ∩ B)=0.    Example:- What is the probability of getting a total of 7 or
11, when two dice are rolled.   Answer:- Let A be the event that the total is 7 and B be the
event that it is 11.   Sample space, S = { (1,1), (1,2), .........., (2,1), (2,2), ........., (6,6) }   n(S) = 36.   A = { (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) } and n(A) = 6.   So P(A) = 6/36 = 1/6.   B = { (5,6), (6,5) } and n(A) = 2.   So P(B) = 2/36 = 1/18.   Since, we cannot have a total both 7 and 11, A and B are mutually exclusive.   i.e. (A ∩ B) = 0.   So we have P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/6 + 1/18 = 2/9.      Exercises:     A person draws 5 cards from a shuffled pack of cards. Find
the probability that the person has at least 3 aces. Find the probability that
the person has at least 4 cards of the same suit.    Two cards are drawn from a pack, without replacement. What is
the probability that both are greater than 2 and lesser than 8.    A permutation of the word "white" is chosen at random. Find
the probability that it beings with a vowel. Also find the probability that it
ends with a consonant.    A dice is tossed 5 times. Find the probability that we will
have 4 of a kind.    Find the probability that a leap year will have 53 Sundays.         Up   Next  >>>     Combinatorics and Probability Section 3.4      Using rules of probability cuts work by not having to count
the outcomes and sample space.  Using
combinatorics from Chapter 2 is another alternative.      Recall Combinatorics are the
Fundamenatal Counting Principle (FCP), permutations and
combinations.      FCP: Multiply each category of choices by the number of
choices.      Permutations:   Selecting
more than one item without replacement where order is important.      Combinations: Selecting more than one item without
replacement where order is not important.      Example 1:  A lottery has 53 numbers from which seven are
selected.  What is the probability
of picking all seven numbers?  Find n(S) .  Counting
is tedious and impractical, use combinatorics.  Selecting more than one item from a group without replacement and order
does not matter.   n C r =  53 C 7 =  53!   =  154,143,080 = n(S) (53-7)!7!  n(picking 7 out of 7) = 1      P(picking 7 out of 7) =  1/154,143,080      Example 2:  Find the probability of being dealt three kings in a
five-card hand in a 52-card standard deck.  (No jokers)  Sample space: how many 5-card hands are there?  Find  n(S) = 52 C 5 = 2,598,960  Find n(3 kings):  there are two categories, kings and non-kings.     4 C 3  x  48 C 2 = 4 x 1128 = 4512       Notice the sum of the numbers in front of C totals 52 and
the number after totals 5.  This is
one form of bookkeeping and checking your work. n = 52, r = 5      P(3 kings) = 4 C 3 x  48 C 2  =  4512   =  .001736   52 C 5    2,598,960      Example3:   Find the
probability of dealing any 3 of a kind.  Since the possibility of 3 kings is .001736, then extend
that to any 3 of a kind by multiplying by the number of different possibilities:

Undo Answer Wiki 8 Answers   Michael Lamar , PhD in Applied Mathematics Answered Aug 29, 2014 · Author has 1.8k answers and 4.7m answer views Your question is not well posed as asked.  Indeed, given the number n, then it either IS or IS NOT prime.  There is nothing random in your description, so there is no way to use a probability model. For example: Given 3, what is the probability that it is prime?  Answer: 1. Given 4, what is the probability that it is prime?  Answer: 0. Now, it's likely that you mean to ask something like: "Pick a number at random.  What is the probability that the number you pick is prime?" This still isn't a well-posed question, but we're getting closer.  First, you probably don't mean ANY number (as only positive integers can be prime).  That's easy to fix.  Just start the question like: "Pick a positive integer at random..." The more important problem is that when people say "Pick something at random," they usually mean in such a way that all choices are equally likely. This procedure leads to what is called a uniform distribution (either discrete or continuous).  Unfortunately, here we hit the bigger problem.  There is NO VALID probability model that can be assigned to give the same probability to all positive integers. (If you assign them a number other than zero, then adding all their probabilities together gives you infinity rather than one.  If you assign them all zero probability, then that sum is zero rather than one.) So it turns out that we cannot model "Pick a number at random from the set of all positive integers such that each number is equally likely to be chosen." So what can we do to fix this problem?  Well, the most straightforward idea is to try to answer this question using limits. Consider the first N positive integers.  Pick one at random (uniformly).  Find the probability that this number is prime.  Call that result [math]P_N[/math] . Now compute [math]\lim_{N \to \infty} P_N[/math] .  The answer is zero. 3k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Ask New Question   Conner Davis , PhD student Mathematics, The University of Texas at Dallas Answered Aug 29, 2014 · Upvoted by  David Joyce · Author has 1k answers and 6.6m answer views According to the prime number theorem, the probability that an integer, n, is prime is approximately [math]\frac{1}{\ln(n)}[/math] . However, the primes are not dense in the integers. As a result, if you didn't know n and simply asked "I'm going to pick a positive integer, n, less than K uniformly at random. What is [math]\lim_{K \to \infty} [/math] P[n is prime]?" The answer would be [math] 0 [/math] . Why did I use K as an upper bound and take the limit as K went to infinity?  Because you can't choose an integer uniformly at random from the set of all integers.  It simply doesn't make any sense. 2.3k Views · View Upvoters   Michael M. Ross , Autodidactic number empiricist Answered Feb 18, 2017 · Author has 1.1k answers and 995.8k answer views How you organize the numbers has a lot to do with this answer. Pick your [math]n[/math] s from the yellow strips in this table if you want to find primes (represented by [math]1[/math] ). Pick your [math]n[/math] s from the blue bands, and you can be confident you will NEVER find a prime. Why? This table uses the properties of a primorial ( [math]2*3*5*7=210[/math] ) to structure the number line symmetrically. The table is incomplete, but it shows the counting numbers decreasing in one direction and increasing in the other. The pivot is the midpoint of the primorial ( [math]105[/math] ), or a multiple of the primorial. The distribution of least prime factors (the numbers shown under the composites) is symmetric around the primorial midpoint. The composites that are prime-aligned (that is, occupy a paired position that would otherwise be prime) have a tight upper bound, determined by their least prime factor being greater than the primorial’s largest factor and less than the square root of [math]210[/math] or a multiple of it. 744 Views   Robert Nichols Answered Feb 18, 2017 · Author has 2.2k answers and 618.4k answer views I am not sure that this is an answerable question. There appear to be an infinite number of primes. But there are an infinite number of even numbers, but the probability of getting an even number (when restricted to integers) is 1/2. Because in any large interval the probability is 1/2 (if there are an even number of numbers in the interval, or very close to 1/2 if there are an odd number of numbers in the interval, and the larger your interval becomes the closer to 1/2 this will be). But you can’t apply that kind of logic to primes, because as the intervals grow larger and larger the probability of randomly selecting a prime is growing smaller and smaller. So the probability is approaching zero, but it clearly never reaches zero, because there do exist some prime numbers. 488 Views   Jim Greene , Math N00b Answered Jan 12, 2017 I came here because I asked the question myself, but I didn’t find the other answers very helpful.

Let P1 represent the prime number that proceeds P and P2 be the one that proceeds P1. {(P - 1)/P} * {(P1 - 1)/P1} * {(P2 - 1)/P2} * {(P3 - 1)/P3} * {(P4 - 1)/P4} … {(2–1)/2} = The probability that a number after P is prime, until the next prime number Here are some sloppy charts: You will notice that at P=1000 you get 8%. At P=10,000; 6%. P=100,000; close to 5%. And at 1,000,000; about 4%. It probably is safe to assume that the probability approaches zero. 604 Views Quora User , Software developer, sailor and seeing life is a rogue wave in a quantum sea Answered Aug 29, 2014 · Author has 6.3k answers and 16.3m answer views Initially, no more than 40% once you eliminate 2 and 5.  A prime number will never end in an even number or end in an zero or 5.  A prime will end in 1,3,7 or 9.  So 4 out of 10 possible digits. Once you eliminate the obvious non-prime values by this simple sieve, then you can apply probability tests to determine if a value is likely prime before applying a verification algorithm.

Undo Answer Wiki 1 Answer   Abhijeet Jain , Valar Pikiptan , All men must read ! Answered May 29, 2013 if you mean 'n' cards taken from deck and probability of getting n card straight, we can approach this in following manner:- for simplicity we can denote J->11, Q->12, K->13 , A->(14 or 1 depending on the situation) Assumption : Similar to straight other definations like Royal Flush and Flush will be similar ( Royal being n straight of the same color with highest card being A(14) , Flush is n straight card of the same color) clearly n <=13,  now depending upon 'n' the highest card in our set ( of n straight cards) can be 'n', 'n+1'.....J(11), Q(12), K (13), A(14). No. of highest possible cards ( in each set) = 14 - n +1 = 15 - n Total number of cases possible = (15 -n) *  4^n taking each of the n straight card from any of the 4 color sets. But this also contains cases of Flush and Royal Flush, we need to subtract the, from given cases. Clearly there can be 4 cases of royal flush starting from A(14) of each color to n straight cards. For Flush number of highest possible cards = 15 -n -1 ( subtracting one for Royal Flush scenario) number of highest possible cards for Flush = 14 -n Each of the set can be chosen from any of the 4 set , hence total combinations of Flush = (14-n) * 4 Now for our sample space we just need to choose n cards from 52 , it will be 52 [math]C n[/math] Hence our probability of n straight  = [(15-n) * 4^n  - 4 - (14-n) * 4 ] / 52 [math]C n[/math] 1.1k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Ask New Question   Michael Lamar , PhD in Applied Mathematics Answered Dec 24, 2014 · Author has 1.8k answers and 4.7m answer views Another nice way to arrive at Alan's approximation of [math]\frac 1 {\sqrt{\pi n}}[/math] is to use the normal approximation to the binomial which itself is just an application of the central limit theorem.  This approach shows us that the probability behaves the way it does because the standard deviation of the binomial is proportional to [math]{\sqrt n}[/math] (and the factor of [math]\sqrt \pi[/math] comes from the height of a normal density). Let [math]X[/math] be the number of heads flipped if we have [math]2 n[/math]  flips of the coin (for [math]n[/math] relatively large).  Then [math]E(X)=n[/math] .  The standard deviation in the number of heads is [math]\sigma_X = \sqrt {\frac n 2}\ .[/math]  Also, let [math]Z[/math] be a standard normal random variable.  Recall that the density of the standard normal is given by [math]f_Z(z) = \frac 1 {\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac {z^2} 2}[/math] . So we see that [math]f_Z(0) =\frac 1 {\sqrt{2 \pi}} [/math] .  Furthermore, [math]f_Z \left ( \pm \frac 1 2 \sqrt {\frac   2 n}  \right) =\frac 1 {\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{4n}}\approx \frac 1 {\sqrt{2 \pi} }[/math] .   So over the range of [math]|z|  \le  \frac 1 2 \sqrt {\frac   2 n} [/math] the density is very nearly flat. Now we use the normal approximation to the binomial to estimate the probability: [math]P \left ( X = n \right) =P \left (  n - \frac 1 2 < X <  n+ \frac 1 2\right) [/math]  [math]\approx P \left (  - \frac 1 2 \sqrt {\frac   2 n}   < Z <      - \frac 1 2 \sqrt {\frac   2 n} \right) [/math] . We can approximate the area under the standard normal density over this range of values using a single rectangle because (as noted above), the density is very nearly flat.  The width of the rectangle (from the range [math]Z[/math] values) is [math]\sqrt {\frac   2 n}[/math] and the height (from the height of the density) is [math]\frac 1 {\sqrt{2 \pi}}[/math] .  The area (which is the probability we seek) is then given by the product of this width and height: [math]\frac   1 {\sqrt {n  \pi} }[/math] . 766 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Undo   Alan Bustany , Trinity Wrangler, 1977 IMO Answered Dec 20, 2014 · Upvoted by  Michael Lamar , works at Centre College · Author has 5.2k answers and 14.2m answer views As David Joyce explains the probability of exactly [math]n/2[/math] flips being Heads is pretty small. In fact for odd  [math]n[/math] the probability is exactly zero! I would also add that [math]\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{n!^2}[/math] and there is a good estimate for factorial as [math]n[/math] increases called Stirling's approximation : [math]n! \approx \sqrt{2\pi n}(n/e)^n[/math] Thus for large [math]n[/math] the number of sequences with exactly [math]n[/math] Heads from [math]2n[/math] flips of a fair coin is approximately: [math]\frac{\sqrt{2\pi 2n}(2n/e)^{2n}}{2\pi n(n/e)^{2n}} = \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{\pi n}}[/math] So the probability of getting [math]n[/math] Heads in [math]2n[/math] flips is approximately [math]1/\sqrt{\pi n}[/math] which is pleasingly simply and, perhaps, surprisingly large. So for [math]10[/math] flips ( [math]n=5[/math] ) this estimate is [math]25.2%[/math] compared with the correct answer of [math]252/1,024 \approx 24.6%[/math] . For [math]20[/math] flips and [math]10[/math] Heads the estimate is [math]17.8%[/math] compared with the correct [math]184,756/1,048,576 \approx 17.6%[/math] . For [math]100[/math] flips and [math]50[/math] Heads the estimate of [math]7.98%[/math] pleasingly agrees with David's example. 1.1k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions If I flip a fair coin 1 million times, how do I calculate the probability of there being at least 1 series of 10 heads in a row?

One easy way of doing that is going through the element of X one by one and flipping a fair coin twice per element: the first coin flip says if the element should be a member of A, and the second, whether it should be a member of B. Every element of X is now equally likely to be in one of four states: a member of both A and B; a member of A and not B; a member of B and not A; a member of neither. Three of those cases are in agreement with A being a subset of B, and you need one of these to occur for each element.

Question Asked a year ago Hamna Maryam  3.54 Forman Christian College How the units in simple random sampling WR and WOR has the equal probability of being selected (1/N)? Suppose we have a population 1,2,3,4,5 and a sample selected 1,2,3. when using WR we know 1/N equals 1/5. The prob of 1,2,3 for being selected is 1/5. But in case of WOR how it is 1/N? As the definition of SRS says, each unit has an equal prob of being selected and in WOR, the unit is not returned, so wont it be 1/5 for 1, 1/4 for 2 and 1/3 for 3, So how does the definition hold?

Simple random sampling assumes every group of members in the current sample space has an equal chance of being selected. When you make multiple selections, the sample space will reduce for WOR and stay the same for WR.  For each selection, the probability will be 1/(N - k) for WOR where k previous selections have been made. 1 Recommendation a year ago William Josephson Southern New Hampshire University I meant to say, for Simple Random Sampling, all groups of the same size have an equal chance of being selected. 1 Recommendation a year ago Hemangi V. Kulkarni Shivaji University, Kolhapur A  particular unit can be selected in any of the n draws.  its selection probability at ith draw conditional on the event that it is not selected in previous i-1 draws is 1/(N-i+1)*{(N-i+1)/N}=1/N for each i=1....N.  Summing over i, the probability that ith unit is selected in the sample is n/N  which is same for each unit. 2 Recommendations a year ago Nadia Saeed University of the Punjab Probability of selection will remain the same at each draw.

Pavia University of Valencia It is simple: example for the second selected item. Imagine you have a group of N items. In the first draw, you see clear that the probability that an item is in the sample is 1/N. You also see clear that conditioned to the fact that a different item than item “a” has been drawn in the first draw the probability that item “a” is drawn in the second draw is 1/(N-1). The key is “conditioned to”. Now Bayes rule. In the first draw, any (whatever) of the others N-1 items could be drawn with probability 1/N. So the probability of drawing item “a” in the second extraction conditioned to any of the other items has been drawn in the first extraction is, by bayes rule, (N-1)/N * 1/(N-1) = 1/N. 2 Recommendations a year ago Ilya B.

I recommend you a Spanish book: Mirás, Julio (1985). Elementos de Muestreo para Poblaciones Finitas. Instituto Nacional de Estadística. Madrid. This book has been reedited more recently. a year ago Farah Yasmeen University of Karachi Dear Hamna! We use two conditions for SRS (both in sampling WR or WOR) 1. The probability of selecting an element from the population remains constant. 2. The prob, of selecting a  random sample of size 'n' remains constant. Consider a case with population size N=5 and  sample size n=3 { The population units are supposed to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and the sample units are 1, 2,3 (specifically)} The case of SRS with replacement is clear to you, now consider SRS without replacement. For condition 1, the probability of selecting an element (e.g. 1 ) is 1/5 at first draw. At second draw it is (4/5) * (1/4)   i.e (prob. of selecting any unit other than 1 at first draw) * (prob. of selecting 1 at second draw) = (4/5) * (1/4)= 1/5 Means that if one is not selected first time, any of (2, 3, 4, 5) is selected first, so the prob is 4/5 and now element 1 is selected at second, so the prob. is 1/4 (as sampling is done without replacement, so only 4 units left of which 1 is favorable). Similarly prob. of selecting 1 at third draw is (4/5)*(3/4)*(1/3) = 1/5 In this way probability remains the same for each element at every draw, whether it is SRS WR or SRS WOR.

Chapter · Jan 2003 · Transportation Research Part A Policy and Practice Sarjinder Singh Read Strategic sampling for large choice sets in estimation and application [Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT:  Many discrete choice contexts in transportation deal with large choice sets, including destination, route, and vehicle choices. Model estimation with large numbers of alternatives remains computationally expensive. In the context of the multinomial logit (MNL) model, limiting the number of alternatives in estimation by simple random sampling (SRS) yields consistent parameter estimates, but estimator efficiency suffers. In the context of more general models, such as the mixed MNL, limiting the number of alternatives via SRS yields biased parameter estimates. In this paper, a new, strategic sampling scheme is introduced, which draws alternatives in proportion to updated choice-probability estimates. Since such probabilities are not known a priori, the first iteration uses SRS among all available alternatives. The sampling scheme is implemented here for a variety of simulated MNL and mixed-MNL data sets, with results suggesting that the new sampling scheme provides substantial efficiency benefits. Thanks to reductions in estimation error, parameter estimates are more accurate, on average. Moreover, in the mixed MNL case, where SRS produces biased estimates (due to violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property), the new sampling scheme appears to effectively eliminate such biases. Finally, it appears that only a single iteration of the new strategy (following the initialization step using SRS) is needed to deliver the strategy’s maximum efficiency gains.Highlights► Drawing choice samples based on standard logit probabilities is strategic. ► Strategic sampling provides more efficient estimates than SRS counterpart. ► New strategy requires very little additional computational effort or analyst capability.

of random selection . In order to have a random selection method, you must set up
some process or procedure that assures that the different units in your population have
equal probabilities of being chosen. Humans have long practiced various forms of random
selection, such as picking a name out of a hat, or choosing the short straw. These days,
we tend to use computers as the mechanism for generating random numbers as the basis for
random selection.     Some Definitions  Before I can explain the various probability methods we have to define some basic
terms. These are:      N = the number of cases in the sampling frame  n = the number of cases in the sample  N C n = the number of combinations (subsets) of n from N  f = n/N = the sampling fraction   That's it. With those terms defined we can begin to define the different probability
sampling methods.     Simple Random Sampling  The simplest form of random sampling is called simple random sampling . Pretty
tricky, huh? Here's the quick description of simple random sampling:   Objective : To select n units out of N such that each N C n has an equal chance of being selected.  Procedure : Use a table of random numbers, a computer random number generator, or
    a mechanical device to select the sample.   A somewhat stilted, if accurate, definition. Let's see if we can make it a little more
real. How do we select a simple random
sample? Let's assume that we are doing some research with a small service agency that
wishes to assess clients' views of quality of service over the past year. First, we have
to get the sampling frame organized. To accomplish this, we'll go through agency records
to identify every client over the past 12 months. If we're lucky, the agency has good
accurate computerized records and can quickly produce such a list. Then, we have to
actually draw the sample. Decide on the number of clients you would like to have in the
final sample. For the sake of the example, let's say you want to select 100 clients to
survey and that there were 1000 clients over the past 12 months. Then, the sampling
fraction is f = n/N = 100/1000 = .10 or 10%. Now, to actually draw the sample, you have
several options. You could print off the list of 1000 clients, tear then into separate
strips, put the strips in a hat, mix them up real good, close your eyes and pull out the
first 100. But this mechanical procedure would be tedious and the quality of the sample
would depend on how thoroughly you mixed them up and how randomly you reached in. Perhaps
a better procedure would be to use the kind of ball machine that is popular with many of
the state lotteries. You would need three sets of balls numbered 0 to 9, one set for each
of the digits from 000 to 999 (if we select 000 we'll call that 1000). Number the list of
names from 1 to 1000 and then use the ball machine to select the three digits that selects
each person. The obvious disadvantage here is that you need to get the ball machines.
(Where do they make those things, anyway? Is there a ball machine industry?).  Neither of these mechanical procedures is very feasible and, with the development of
inexpensive computers there is a much easier way. Here's a simple procedure that's
especially useful if you have the names of the clients already on the computer. Many
computer programs can generate a series of random numbers. Let's assume you can copy and
paste the list of client names into a column in an EXCEL spreadsheet. Then, in the column
right next to it paste the function =RAND() which is EXCEL's way of putting a random
number between 0 and 1 in the cells. Then, sort both columns -- the list of names and the
random number -- by the random numbers. This rearranges the list in random order from the
lowest to the highest random number. Then, all you have to do is take the first hundred
names in this sorted list. pretty simple. You could probably accomplish the whole thing in
under a minute.  Simple random sampling is simple to accomplish and is easy to explain to others.
Because simple random sampling is a fair way to select a sample, it is reasonable to
generalize the results from the sample back to the population. Simple random sampling is
not the most statistically efficient method of sampling and you may, just because of the
luck of the draw, not get good representation of subgroups in a population. To deal with
these issues, we have to turn to other sampling methods.  Stratified Random Sampling  Stratified Random Sampling , also sometimes called proportional or quota random sampling, involves dividing your population into homogeneous subgroups and then
taking a simple random sample in each subgroup. In more formal terms:   Objective : Divide the population into non-overlapping groups (i.e., strata )
  N 1 , N 2 , N 3 , ... N i , such that N 1 +
  N 2 + N 3 + ... + N i = N. Then do a simple random sample of
  f = n/N in each strata.   There are several major reasons why you might prefer stratified sampling over simple
random sampling. First, it assures that you will be able to represent not only the overall
population, but also key subgroups of the population, especially small minority groups. If
you want to be able to talk about subgroups, this may be the only way to effectively
assure you'll be able to. If the subgroup is extremely small, you can use different
sampling fractions (f) within the different strata to randomly over-sample the small group
(although you'll then have to weight the within-group estimates using the sampling
fraction whenever you want overall population estimates). When we use the same sampling
fraction within strata we are conducting proportionate stratified random sampling.
When we use different sampling fractions in the strata, we call this disproportionate stratified random sampling. Second, stratified random sampling will generally have more
statistical precision than simple random sampling. This will only be true if the strata or
groups are homogeneous. If they are, we expect that the variability within-groups is lower
than the variability for the population as a whole. Stratified sampling capitalizes on
that fact.  For example, let's say that the
population of clients for our agency can be divided into three groups: Caucasian,
African-American and Hispanic-American. Furthermore, let's assume that both the
African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans are relatively small minorities of the clientele
(10% and 5% respectively). If we just did a simple random sample of n=100 with a sampling
fraction of 10%, we would expect by chance alone that we would only get 10 and 5 persons
from each of our two smaller groups. And, by chance, we could get fewer than that! If we
stratify, we can do better. First, let's determine how many people we want to have in each
group. Let's say we still want to take a sample of 100 from the population of 1000 clients
over the past year. But we think that in order to say anything about subgroups we will
need at least 25 cases in each group. So, let's sample 50 Caucasians, 25
African-Americans, and 25 Hispanic-Americans. We know that 10% of the population, or 100
clients, are African-American. If we randomly sample 25 of these, we have a within-stratum
sampling fraction of 25/100 = 25%. Similarly, we know that 5% or 50 clients are
Hispanic-American. So our within-stratum sampling fraction will be 25/50 = 50%. Finally,
by subtraction we know that there are 850 Caucasian clients. Our within-stratum sampling
fraction for them is 50/850 = about 5.88%. Because the groups are more homogeneous
within-group than across the population as a whole, we can expect greater statistical
precision (less variance). And, because we stratified, we know we will have enough cases
from each group to make meaningful subgroup inferences.  Systematic Random Sampling  Here are the steps you need to follow in order to achieve a systematic random sample :   number the units in the population from 1 to N  decide on the n (sample size) that you want or need  k = N/n = the interval size  randomly select an integer between 1 to k  then take every kth unit   All of this will be much clearer with an
example. Let's assume that we have a population that only has N=100 people in it and that
you want to take a sample of n=20. To use systematic sampling, the population must be
listed in a random order. The sampling fraction would be f = 20/100 = 20%. in this case,
the interval size, k, is equal to N/n = 100/20 = 5. Now, select a random integer from 1 to
5. In our example, imagine that you chose 4. Now, to select the sample, start with the 4th
unit in the list and take every k-th unit (every 5th, because k=5). You would be sampling
units 4, 9, 14, 19, and so on to 100 and you would wind up with 20 units in your sample.  For this to work, it is essential that the units in the population are 
randomly ordered, at least with respect to the characteristics you are 
measuring. Why would you ever want to use systematic random sampling? For one 
thing, it is fairly easy to do. You only have to select a single random number 
to start things off. It may also be more precise than simple random sampling. 
Finally, in some situations there is simply no easier way to do random sampling. 
For instance, I once had to do a study that involved sampling from all the books 
in a library. Once selected, I would have to go to the shelf, locate the book, 
and record when it last circulated. I knew that I had a fairly good sampling 
frame in the form of the shelf list (which is a card catalog where the entries 
are arranged in the order they occur on the shelf). To do a simple random 
sample, I could have estimated the total number of books and generated random 
numbers to draw the sample; but how would I find book #74,329 easily if that is 
the number I selected? I couldn't very well count the cards until I came to 
74,329! Stratifying wouldn't solve that problem either. For instance, I could 
have stratified by card catalog drawer and drawn a simple random sample within 
each drawer. But I'd still be stuck counting cards. Instead, I did a systematic 
random sample. I estimated the number of books in the entire collection. Let's 
imagine it was 100,000. I decided that I wanted to take a sample of 1000 for a 
sampling fraction of 1000/100,000 = 1%. To get the sampling interval k, I 
divided N/n = 100,000/1000 = 100. Then I selected a random integer between 1 and 
100. Let's say I got 57. Next I did a little side study to determine how thick a 
thousand cards are in the card catalog (taking into account the varying ages of 
the cards). Let's say that on average I found that two cards that were separated 
by 100 cards were about .75 inches apart in the catalog drawer. That information 
gave me everything I needed to draw the sample. I counted to the 57th by hand 
and recorded the book information. Then, I took a compass. (Remember those from 
your high-school math class? They're the funny little metal instruments with a 
sharp pin on one end and a pencil on the other that you used to draw circles in 
geometry class.) Then I set the compass at .75", stuck the pin end in at the 
57th card and pointed with the pencil end to the next card (approximately 100 
books away). In this way, I approximated selecting the 157th, 257th, 357th, and 
so on. I was able to accomplish the entire selection procedure in very little 
time using this systematic random sampling approach. I'd probably still be there 
counting cards if I'd tried another random sampling method. (Okay, so I have no 
life. I got compensated nicely, I don't mind saying, for coming up with this 
scheme.)  Cluster (Area) Random Sampling  The problem with random sampling methods when we have to sample a population that's
disbursed across a wide geographic region is that you will have to cover a lot of ground
geographically in order to get to each of the units you sampled. Imagine taking a simple
random sample of all the residents of New York State in order to conduct personal
interviews. By the luck of the draw you will wind up with respondents who come from all
over the state. Your interviewers are going to have a lot of traveling to do. It is for
precisely this problem that cluster or area random sampling was invented.  In cluster sampling, we follow these steps:   divide population into clusters (usually along geographic boundaries)  randomly sample clusters  measure all units within sampled clusters   For instance, in the figure we see a map
of the counties in New York State. Let's say that we have to do a survey of town
governments that will require us going to the towns personally. If we do a simple random
sample state-wide we'll have to cover the entire state geographically. Instead, we decide
to do a cluster sampling of five counties (marked in red in the figure). Once these are
selected, we go to every town government in the five areas. Clearly this strategy
will help us to economize on our mileage. Cluster or area sampling, then, is useful in
situations like this, and is done primarily for efficiency of administration. Note also,
that we probably don't have to worry about using this approach if we are conducting a mail
or telephone survey because it doesn't matter as much (or cost more or raise inefficiency)
where we call or send letters to.  Multi-Stage Sampling  The four methods we've covered so far -- simple, stratified, systematic and cluster --
are the simplest random sampling strategies. In most real applied social research, we
would use sampling methods that are considerably more complex than these simple
variations. The most important principle here is that we can combine the simple methods
described earlier in a variety of useful ways that help us address our sampling needs in
the most efficient and effective manner possible. When we combine sampling methods, we
call this multi-stage sampling .  For example, consider the idea of sampling New York State residents for face-to-face
interviews. Clearly we would want to do some type of cluster sampling as the first stage
of the process. We might sample townships or census tracts throughout the state. But in
cluster sampling we would then go on to measure everyone in the clusters we select. Even
if we are sampling census tracts we may not be able to measure everyone who is in
the census tract. So, we might set up a stratified sampling process within the clusters.
In this case, we would have a two-stage sampling process with stratified samples within
cluster samples. Or, consider the problem of sampling students in grade schools. We might
begin with a national sample of school districts stratified by economics and educational
level. Within selected districts, we might do a simple random sample of schools. Within
schools, we might do a simple random sample of classes or grades. And, within classes, we
might even do a simple random sample of students. In this case, we have three or four
stages in the sampling process and we use both stratified and simple random sampling. By
combining different sampling methods we are able to achieve a rich variety of
probabilistic sampling methods that can be used in a wide range of social research
contexts.      « Previous Home Next »  Copyright ©2006, William M.K. Trochim, All Rights Reserved  Purchase a printed copy of the Research Methods Knowledge

This is a random draw for an ultra race where there were 363 entrants for 232 spots. There is an argument about whether the selection was biased against a certain group of 12 people.  My initial attempt at calculating this was that there was 232 choose 363 possible selections. The number of combinations of any one person from the list of twelve is 1 choose 12 + 2 choose 12 + ... + 11 choose 12 + 12 choose 12.
Thus 1 choose 12 + 2 choose 12 .... / 232 choose 363.
Which ends up being a very low number which is clearly too low.

First, you're now dealing with a likelihood rather than a probability as the outcome is known. Second, it doesn't matter what the theoretical likelihood is, given that you have a result. I think it would be better to approach the method used for selection: how were the selections chosen? You need to prove the correctness of the method, not the correctness of the result. – Michelle  Mar 6 '12 at 21:23        1      One would view this as a likelihood, Michelle, for the purpose of estimating selection probabilities.  That does not appear to be the case here. – whuber ♦  Mar 6 '12 at 22:43            You need to be careful in using the simple calculation of the hypergeometric RV, as the 12 people who are complaining are not randomly selected.

Beforehand, $12$ of the tickets were colored red.  What is the chance that exactly two of the selected tickets are red?  What is the chance that at most two of the tickets are red?  An exact formula can be obtained, but we don't need to do that much theoretical work.  Instead, we just track the chances as the tickets are pulled from the jar.  At the time $m$ of them have been withdrawn, let the chance that exactly $i$ red tickets have been seen be written $p(i,m)$.  To get started, note that $p(i,0)=0$ if $i\gt 0$ (you can't have any red tickets before you get started) and $p(0,0)=1$ (it's certain you have no red tickets at the outset).  Now, on the most recent draw, either the ticket was red or it wasn't.  In the first case, we previously had a chance $p(i-1,m-1)$ of seeing exactly $i-1$ red tickets.  We then happened then to pull a red one from the remaining $363 - m + 1$ tickets, making it exactly $i$ red tickets so far.  Because we assume all tickets have equal chances at every stage, our chance of drawing a red in this fashion was therefore $(12-i+1) / (363 - m + 1)$.  In the other case, we had a chance $p(i,m-1)$ of obtaining exactly $i$ red tickets in the previous $m-1$ draws, and the chance of not adding another red ticket to the sample on the next draw was $(363 - m + 1 - 12 + i) / (363 - m + 1)$.  Whence, using basic axioms of probability (to wit, chances of two mutually exclusive cases add and conditional chances multiply),  $$p(i,m) = \frac{p(i-1,m-1) (12-i+1) + p(i,m-1) (363 - m + 1 - 12 + i)}{363 - m + 1}.$$  We repeat this calculation recursively, laying out a triangular array of the values of $p(i,m)$ for $0\le i\le 12$ and $0 \le m \le 232$.  After a little calculation we obtain $p(2,232) \approx 0.000849884$ and $p(0,232)+p(1,232)+p(2,232)\approx 0.000934314$, answering both versions of the question.  These are small numbers: no matter how you look at it, they are pretty rare events (rarer than one in a thousand).  As a double-check, I performed this exercise with a computer 1,000,000 times.  In 932 = 0.000932 of these experiments, 2 or fewer red tickets were observed.  This is extremely close to the calculated result, because the sampling fluctuation in the expected value of 934.3 is about 30 (up or down).  Here is how the simulation is done in R:  > population <- c(rep(1,12), rep(0, 363-12)) # 1 is a "red" indicator
> results <- replicate(10^6, 
             sum(sample(population, 232)))   # Count the reds in 10^6 trials
> sum(results <= 2)                          # How many trials had 2 or fewer reds?
[1] 948  This time, because the experiments are random, the results changed a little: two or fewer red tickets were observed in 948 of the million trials.  That still is consistent with the theoretical result.)  The conclusion is that it's highly unlikely that two or fewer of the 232 tickets will be red. If you indeed have a sample of 232 of 363 people, this result is a strong indication that the tickets-in-a-jar model is not a correct description of how the sample was obtained. Alternative explanations include (a) the red tickets were made more difficult to take from the jar (a "bias" against them) as well as (b) the tickets were colored after the sample was observed ( post-hoc data snooping, which does not indicate any bias).  An example of explanation (b) in action would be a jury pool for a notorious murder trial.  Suppose it included 363 people.  Out of that pool, the court interviewed 232 of them.  An ambitious newspaper reporter meticulously reviews the vitae of everyone in the pool and notices that 12 of the 363 were goldfish fanciers, but only two of them had been interviewed.  Is the court biased against goldfish fanciers?  Probably not.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 6 '12 at 22:42       whuber ♦   188k 28 399 739                  NB In the simulation, it does not matter that it is the very first 12 "tickets" that are marked, because all sampling is performed randomly without replacement (via sample ).  In effect, at each iteration sample thoroughly mixes the tickets each time it is called before it withdraws 232 of them. – whuber ♦  Mar 6 '12 at 23:19        2      Goodness - that wasn't actually the result I expected.

The hypergeometric distribution classically appears in sampling-resampling experiments.  The 12 specific people (my "red tickets") are like fish that have been caught, marked, and thrown back into the pool; the sample of 232 is like the set of fish that are subsequently caught.  The hypergeometric distribution describes the frequencies of recaptured fish. – whuber ♦  Mar 7 '12 at 15:15        add a comment |             up vote  -1  down vote      The odds are much higher than calculated with the simple hypergeometric distribution, as the group is not chosen randomly ( "12 fish are painted red before the draw" ).  From the description of the question, we are testing for a fraud in the draw. A specific group of 12 people complained that only 2 of them were selected, while the expected number was 232/363~2/3=8.  What we really need to calculated is what are the odds that " No group of size 12 will have only 2 member selected". The odds that at least one group will have 2 or fewer (therefore will complain against the fairness of the draw) are much higher.  When I run this simulation, and check in how many of the trials none of the 30 (=360/12) groups had 2 or fewer selections, I get about 2.3% of the times. 1:42 is low but not impossible.  You should still check the procedure of the draw as it might be biased against a specific group of people. They might have come together and received a range of the draw with less probability (the first or last numbers, for example), or whatever dependent variable on the procedure of the draw. But if you don't find any flaw in the procedure, you can return to the 1:42 odds that it is simply bad luck for the group.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 10 '12 at 8:30             answered Mar 9 '12 at 14:42       Guy   254 3 5                  A good point, BUT (a) surely not every possible group of 12 has enough similarity to matter, and (b) not all groups that have enough similarity to matter have exactly 12 members. – zbicyclist  Mar 9 '12 at 15:21            @zbicyclist, I don't claim that the calculation is accurate.

This is not a homework question, I'm just trying to learn some "advanced" statistics techniques out of personal interest (for example, I've recently learned that you can find the probability distribution for the sum of two independent events by convolving the individual distributions). So I'd like to know if there's a "better" way to do this than enumerating all the possible outcomes and counting those that fit the criterion. I suppose the criteria for "better" would be:   Less computationally expensive (i.e. faster if it were to be implemented on a computer)  More interesting from a mathematical analysis standpoint.   Thank you   Update to question  How would I generalize the explanation in dsaxton's answer, namely:  $P(\max(X_1, X_2) = k) = 2 P(X_1 = k \cap X_2 \leq k) - P(X_1 = k \cap X_2 = k)$  to the maximum of three or more dice?  In the case of the max of three dice, it looks like the cases are:   $x1 = k$ and $x2 \leq k$ and $x3 \leq k$  $x2 = k$ and $x1 \leq k$ and $x3 \leq k$  $x3 = k$ and $x1 \leq k$ and $x2 \leq k$   which suggests that the probability would be  $P(\max(x1, x2, x3) = k) = P(x1 = k \cap x2 \leq k \cap x3 \leq k) + P(x2 = k \cap x1 \leq k \cap x3 \leq k) + P(x3 = k \cap x1 \leq k \cap x2 \leq k) - P(x1 = k \cap x2 = k \cap x3 = k)$  (though maybe this is still multi-counting?)

So we just add the probabilities of these events (which by symmetry are equal) and subtract their intersection to avoid double counting,  \begin{align}
P(\max(X_1, X_2) = k) &= 2 P(X_1 = k \cap X_2 \leq k) - P(X_1 = k \cap X_2 = k) \\
&= \frac{2k}{36} - \frac{1}{36} \\
&= \frac{2k - 1}{36} .
\end{align}  To extend this idea to $m$ dice it gets a bit more complicated as we need to be more careful about applying the inclusion exclusion principle .  Let $A_i \equiv \{ X_i = k \cap X_j \leq k \text{ for $j \neq i$}\}$.  Then  \begin{align}
P(\max(X_1, \ldots , X_m) = k) =& P(\cup_{i=1}^{m} A_i) \\
=& \sum_{i=1}^{m} P(A_i) - \sum_{i \neq j} P(A_i \cap A_j) + \\
& \sum_{i \neq j, i \neq l, j \neq l} P(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_l) - \\
& \ldots + (-1)^{m + 1} P(\cap_{i=1}^{m} A_i) \\

& \binom{m}{3} \frac{k^{m - 3}}{6^m} - \ldots + (-1)^{m + 1} \frac{1}{6^m} \\
=& \frac{1}{6^m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (-1)^{i+1} \binom{m}{i} k^{m - i} .
\end{align}  Edit:  I just realized the title of your post seems to be asking a different question than what's in the post itself.  If you want to find the probability that $X_1 \geq X_2$ then you can take a conditional expectation,  \begin{align}
P(X_1 \geq X_2) &= \text{E}[P(X_1 \geq X_2 \mid X_1)] \\
&= \text{E} \left ( \frac{X_1}{6} \right ) \\
&= \frac{3.5}{6} .
\end{align}  Here we've used the general result that $\text{E}(X) = \text{E}[\text{E}(X \mid Y)]$ for random variables $X$ and $Y$, and that probabilities themselves may be viewed as expectations of indicator random variables.  Even simpler perhaps, we can arrive at the answer by basically only using the fact that probabilities sum to one,  $$
P(X_1 \geq X_2) + P(X_2 \geq X_1) - P(X_1 = X_2) = 1 \Rightarrow \\
2 P(X_1 \geq X_2) - \frac{1}{6} = 1 \Rightarrow \\
P(X_1 \geq X_2) = \frac{3.5}{6} .

Is $n$ also known? (e.g. let's say my sequence was $(0.61,0.23,0.92)$, so $X_2=(0.61,0.92)$; do I only know $m=2$, do I know that $m=2$ and $n=3$, or do I know $x_2=0.93$?) Is this connected with some subject? – Glen_b ♦  Jan 11 '15 at 0:21         6      Easy: The probability that the largest of $n$ i.i.d observations is in specific position $i$ is clearly $1/n$ (since it has equal chance to be in any position); that still applies when $i=n$. – Glen_b ♦  Jan 11 '15 at 4:38         1      @Glen_b, thanks, call this an equally accepted answer. I think the questions asked were as helpful as the answer itself. – REFlint  Jan 11 '15 at 9:17        2      @Glen_b's comment is the best answer here because it generalizes to complicated situations the other answers cannot handle. For instance, when all the $x_i$ are independent with any common underlying distribution and $f$ is any measurable function of $n-1$ variables, then $\Pr(x_i \gt f(x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\ldots,x_{n}))$ does not depend on $i$, by exactly the same reasoning. In the present case $f=\max$. The nature of $f$ and the continuity of the uniform distribution assure that all $n$ of these events are (almost surely) mutually exclusive, immediately giving the $1/n$ result. – whuber ♦  Jan 15 '15 at 22:04        |  show 3 more comments          3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  5  down vote  accepted      Uppercase $X$ denotes random variables, lowercase $x$ denotes realizations of random variables.  If the realization of the sequence is known up to $n-1$, then we know what the value of the maximum is up to then, say $x_{(n-1)}$. Then we want the probability  $$\Pr\big(X_n > x_{(n-1)}) = 1-x_{(n-1)}$$  If we don't know  the actual realizations, then the probability we are after is the probability of the difference of two independent random variables:  $$\Pr\big(X_n > X_{(n-1)} \big) = \Pr\big(X_{(n-1)} -X_n \leq 0 \big)$$  (since we have continuous RVs the appearance of weak inequality to conform with standard expressions is neutral to the results).  The distribution of $X_n$ is $U(0,1)$. $X_{(n-1)}$ is the maximum order statistic from a sample of $n-1$ independent $U(0,1)$ random variables so its distribution and probability density functions are  $$F_{X_{(n-1)}} (x_{(n-1)}) = x_{(n-1)}^{n-1},\;\;\; f_{X_{(n-1)}} (x_{(n-1)}) = (n-1)x_{(n-1)}^{n-2}$$  Deriving the distribution of their difference $Z = X_{(n-1)} -X_n$ requires some care. $Z$ ranges in $(-1,1)$ while its defining components are non-negative. We can instead opt for the specific probability we are after: in order for $Z\leq 0$ it must be the case that $X_{(n-1)} \leq  X_n$. The general formula for calculating such a probability is  $$P(Y < W) = \int_{S_w}\int_{\{y<w\}}f_{YW}(y,w) {\rm d}y{\rm d}w$$ 
which in our case becomes (decomposing the joint density into the product of the marginals due to independence)  $$\Pr(Z\leq 0) = \int_0^1\int_0^{x_n}(n-1)x_{(n-1)}^{n-2}\cdot 1 {\rm d}x_{(n-1)}{\rm d}x_n$$  $$= \int_0^1x_n^{n-1} {\rm d}x_n = \frac 1n$$  That this probability decreases with $n$ (and so with $n-1$) is intuitive: the more chances the sequence has of obtaining the theoretical maximum, the more probable it is that it will get closer and closer to it, and so the less probable is that the next value will be even bigger.  Simulations verify the above result.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jan 15 '15 at 6:37             answered Jan 11 '15 at 2:15       Alecos Papadopoulos   38.8k 1 81 168              1      +1 for having actually read the question and given the answer for the uniform distribution, as requested. – Placidia  Jan 11 '15 at 2:24        add a comment |              up vote  3  down vote      Not quite sure of the setup. Here are some answers.  If you observe $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1}$, and wonder if the next observation will top the series, then the answer is $1-F(M)$, where $F$ is the cumulative distribution function and $M$ is the maximum of the first $n-1$ observations.  On the other hand, if you only observe $x_n$ and wonder about the probability that this was the maximum of the series, then the answer is $$F(x_n)^{n-1}$$.  And on the third hand, if you observe nothing at all, but wonder about the probability that the maximum will occur on the last observation, then the probability is $1/n$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jan 11 '15 at 2:13       Placidia   10.4k 4 23 49              1      Note: if this was actually a homework question it should have been tagged as such and I should not have answered it. – Placidia  Jan 11 '15 at 2:13        1      (+1) For the middle scenario that I missed. – Alecos Papadopoulos  Jan 11 '15 at 2:22        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      disclaimer: I'm not a statistician or algebrist.

on the identity of the transmitted signal, the sample outputs of
the matched filters are (conditionally) independent unit-variance
normal random variables. The sample output
of the filter matched to the signal transmitted is a
$N(\mu,1)$ random variable while the outputs of all the other filters
are $N(0,1)$ random variables.  The conditional probability of a correct decision (which in the
present context is the event $C = \{X_0 > \max_i X_i\}$) conditioned
on $X_0 = \alpha$ is 
$$P(C \mid X_0 = \alpha) = \prod_{i=1}^n P\{X_i < \alpha \mid X_0 = \alpha\} 
= \left[\Phi(\alpha)\right]^n$$
where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the cumulative probability distribution 
of a standard normal random variable, and hence the unconditional
probability is 
$$P(C) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}P(C \mid X_0 = \alpha)
\phi(\alpha-\mu)\,\mathrm d\alpha
= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\Phi(\alpha)\right]^n
\phi(\alpha-\mu)\,\mathrm d\alpha$$
where $\phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal density function.
There is no closed-form expression for the value of this
integral which must be evaluated numerically.
Engineers are also interested in the complementary event -- that
the decision is in error -- but do not like to compute this as
$$P\{X_0 < \max_i X_i\} = P(E) = 1-P(C)$$
because this requires very careful evaluation of the integral for $P(C)$
to an accuracy of many significant digits, and such evaluation is both
difficult and time-consuming. Instead, the integral for
$1-P(C)$ can be integrated by parts to get
$$P\{X_0 < \max_i X_i\} =
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} n \left[\Phi(\alpha)\right]^{n-1}\phi(\alpha)
\Phi(\alpha - \mu)\,\mathrm d\alpha.$$
This integral is more easy to evaluate numerically,
and its value as a function of $\mu$ is graphed and
tabulated (though unfortunately only for $n \leq 20$)
in Chapter 5 of Telecommunication Systems
Engineering by Lindsey and Simon, Prentice-Hall 1973,
Dover Press 1991.
Alternatively, engineers use the union bound or Bonferroni inequality
$$\begin{align*}
P\{X_0 < \max_i X_i\} &= P\left\{(X_0 < X_1)\cup (X_0 < X_2) \cup \cdots 
\cup (X_0 < X_n)\right\}\\
&\leq \sum_{i=1}^{n}P\{X_0 < X_i\}\\
&= nQ\left(\frac{\mu}{\sqrt{2}}\right)
\end{align*}$$
where $Q(x) = 1-\Phi(x)$ is the complementary cumulative normal
distribution function.  From the union bound, we see that the desired value $0.01$ for
$P\{X_0 < \max_i X_i\}$ is bounded above by $60\cdot Q(\mu/\sqrt{2})$
which bound has value $0.01$ at $\mu = 5.09\ldots$. This is
slightly larger than the more exact value $\mu = 4.919\ldots$ 
obtained by @whuber by numerical integration.  More discussion and details about $M$-ary orthogonal signaling

What is the probability that if I shout out an $x$, then $x$ will be exactly the second highest of all the draws?

The probability that the $n$-th draw is the second-last order statistic of the $n$ draws, when given the value of that draw is $x$, is:  $$\frac{(n-1)!}{(n-2)!\;1!}x^{n-2}(1-x) \\[4ex] = (n-1)(1-x)x^{n-2}$$  Reasoning: Of the $n-1$ draws preceding yours, the favoured space is formed by $n-2$ of them being no greater than yours (individual probability $x$ each), and $1$ of them being no less (probability $1-x$), and there are ${n-1\choose n-2}$ ways of arranging these favoured results.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 25 '14 at 7:00       Graham Kemp   73.6k 4 30 66              add a comment |             up vote  -1  down vote      The problem is equivalent to finding the probability that $x$ is the second last order statistic.
In that case, out of the remaining $(n-1)$ draws, there should be $n-2$ draws which are smaller than $x$ and 1 draw is bigger than $x$. The probability of a draw being smaller than $x$ is $F(x)=x$. There are in total $n$ independent draws, out of which $n-1$ are smaller than or equal to $x$ so each has probability $F(x)=x$, and the last draw is greater than $x$ having probability $1-F(x)=1-x$. Note that these draws form a Binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $F(x)$.  So you have the required probability as $\dfrac{n!}{(n-1)!1!}$$x^{n-1}$$(1-x)$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 25 '14 at 2:57       Landon Carter   6,803 1 13 36              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

uncertainty of statements or events. It gives a numerical measure for the degree
of certainty (or degree of uncertainty) of the occurrence of an event.   Another way to define probability is the
ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of all possible
outcomes. The enumeration of all possible outcomes is called as the sample
space.   If there are totally n possible outcomes
in a sample space, S and m of those are favorable for an event, A. then
probability of event, A is given as   P(A) = (number of favorable outcomes) /
(total number of possible outcomes)   = n(A) / n(S)   = m/n   Example:- Find the probability of getting a 3 or 5 while
throwing a dice.   Answer:- Sample space, S = {1,2,3,4,5,6} and Event, A =
{3,5}.   n(A) = 2 and n(S) = 6.   So, P(A) = n(A) / n(S) = 2/6 = 0.3333       Axioms of Probability:      All probability values are positive numbers not greater than
1, i.e. 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. An event that is not likely to occur or impossible has
probability zero, while an highly likely event has a probability one.    Example:- P(A
pregnant human being a female) = 1   Example:- P(A
human male being pregnant) = 0.       If the probability that an event occurs is p, then the
probability that the event does not occur is q = (1-p). i.e. probability of the
complement of an event = 1 - probability of the event.    i.e. P(Ā) =
1 - P(A)   Example:- Find the
probability of not getting a 3 or 5 while throwing a dice.   Answer:- Sample
space, S = {1,2,3,4,5,6} and Event, B = {1,2,4,6}.   n(B) = 4 and n(S) = 6.   So, P(B) = n(B) / n(S) = 4/6 = 0.6667   Now A and B are complementary events, i.e. B = Ā.   So: 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.3333 = 0.6667 = P(B) = P(Ā).       If A and b are two different events then, P(A U B) = P(A) +
P(B) - P(A ∩ B). Consider the Venn diagram. P(A U B) is the probability of the
sum of all sample points in A U B. Now P(A) + P(B) is the sum of probabilities
of sample points in A and in B. Since we added up the sample points in (A ∩ B)
twice, we need to subtract once to obtain the sum of probabilities in (A U B),
which is P(A U B).     Example:- Probability that John passes a Math exam is 4/5 and
that he passes a Chemistry exam is 5/6. If the probability that he passes both
exams is 3/4, find the probability that he is pass at least one exam.   Answer:- Let M = John passes Math exam, and C = John passes
Chemistry exam.   P(John passes at least one exam) = P(M U C) = P(M) + P(C) - P(M ∩ C)   = 4/5 + 5/6 - 3/4   = 53/60      If two events, A and B are mutually exclusive then, P(A U B)
= P(A) + P(B). This follows immediately from (3). Since A and B are mutually
exclusive, n(A ∩ B)=0 and so P(A ∩ B)=0.    Example:- What is the probability of getting a total of 7 or
11, when two dice are rolled.   Answer:- Let A be the event that the total is 7 and B be the
event that it is 11.   Sample space, S = { (1,1), (1,2), .........., (2,1), (2,2), ........., (6,6) }   n(S) = 36.   A = { (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) } and n(A) = 6.   So P(A) = 6/36 = 1/6.   B = { (5,6), (6,5) } and n(A) = 2.   So P(B) = 2/36 = 1/18.   Since, we cannot have a total both 7 and 11, A and B are mutually exclusive.   i.e. (A ∩ B) = 0.   So we have P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/6 + 1/18 = 2/9.      Exercises:     A person draws 5 cards from a shuffled pack of cards. Find
the probability that the person has at least 3 aces. Find the probability that
the person has at least 4 cards of the same suit.    Two cards are drawn from a pack, without replacement. What is
the probability that both are greater than 2 and lesser than 8.    A permutation of the word "white" is chosen at random. Find
the probability that it beings with a vowel. Also find the probability that it

the outcomes and sample space.  Using
combinatorics from Chapter 2 is another alternative.      Recall Combinatorics are the
Fundamenatal Counting Principle (FCP), permutations and
combinations.      FCP: Multiply each category of choices by the number of
choices.      Permutations:   Selecting
more than one item without replacement where order is important.      Combinations: Selecting more than one item without
replacement where order is not important.      Example 1:  A lottery has 53 numbers from which seven are
selected.  What is the probability
of picking all seven numbers?  Find n(S) .  Counting
is tedious and impractical, use combinatorics.  Selecting more than one item from a group without replacement and order
does not matter.   n C r =  53 C 7 =  53!   =  154,143,080 = n(S) (53-7)!7!  n(picking 7 out of 7) = 1      P(picking 7 out of 7) =  1/154,143,080      Example 2:  Find the probability of being dealt three kings in a
five-card hand in a 52-card standard deck.  (No jokers)  Sample space: how many 5-card hands are there?  Find  n(S) = 52 C 5 = 2,598,960  Find n(3 kings):  there are two categories, kings and non-kings.     4 C 3  x  48 C 2 = 4 x 1128 = 4512       Notice the sum of the numbers in front of C totals 52 and
the number after totals 5.  This is
one form of bookkeeping and checking your work. n = 52, r = 5      P(3 kings) = 4 C 3 x  48 C 2  =  4512   =  .001736   52 C 5    2,598,960      Example3:   Find the
probability of dealing any 3 of a kind.  Since the possibility of 3 kings is .001736, then extend
that to any 3 of a kind by multiplying by the number of different possibilities:
13  4512 x 13   = .02256 2,598,960             Back

Undo Answer Wiki 8 Answers   Michael Lamar , PhD in Applied Mathematics Answered Aug 29, 2014 · Author has 1.8k answers and 4.7m answer views Your question is not well posed as asked.  Indeed, given the number n, then it either IS or IS NOT prime.  There is nothing random in your description, so there is no way to use a probability model. For example: Given 3, what is the probability that it is prime?  Answer: 1. Given 4, what is the probability that it is prime?  Answer: 0. Now, it's likely that you mean to ask something like: "Pick a number at random.  What is the probability that the number you pick is prime?" This still isn't a well-posed question, but we're getting closer.  First, you probably don't mean ANY number (as only positive integers can be prime).  That's easy to fix.  Just start the question like: "Pick a positive integer at random..." The more important problem is that when people say "Pick something at random," they usually mean in such a way that all choices are equally likely. This procedure leads to what is called a uniform distribution (either discrete or continuous).  Unfortunately, here we hit the bigger problem.  There is NO VALID probability model that can be assigned to give the same probability to all positive integers. (If you assign them a number other than zero, then adding all their probabilities together gives you infinity rather than one.  If you assign them all zero probability, then that sum is zero rather than one.) So it turns out that we cannot model "Pick a number at random from the set of all positive integers such that each number is equally likely to be chosen." So what can we do to fix this problem?  Well, the most straightforward idea is to try to answer this question using limits. Consider the first N positive integers.  Pick one at random (uniformly).  Find the probability that this number is prime.  Call that result [math]P_N[/math] . Now compute [math]\lim_{N \to \infty} P_N[/math] .  The answer is zero. 3k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

However, the primes are not dense in the integers. As a result, if you didn't know n and simply asked "I'm going to pick a positive integer, n, less than K uniformly at random.

Ross , Autodidactic number empiricist Answered Feb 18, 2017 · Author has 1.1k answers and 995.8k answer views How you organize the numbers has a lot to do with this answer. Pick your [math]n[/math] s from the yellow strips in this table if you want to find primes (represented by [math]1[/math] ). Pick your [math]n[/math] s from the blue bands, and you can be confident you will NEVER find a prime. Why? This table uses the properties of a primorial ( [math]2*3*5*7=210[/math] ) to structure the number line symmetrically. The table is incomplete, but it shows the counting numbers decreasing in one direction and increasing in the other. The pivot is the midpoint of the primorial ( [math]105[/math] ), or a multiple of the primorial. The distribution of least prime factors (the numbers shown under the composites) is symmetric around the primorial midpoint. The composites that are prime-aligned (that is, occupy a paired position that would otherwise be prime) have a tight upper bound, determined by their least prime factor being greater than the primorial’s largest factor and less than the square root of [math]210[/math] or a multiple of it. 744 Views   Robert Nichols Answered Feb 18, 2017 · Author has 2.2k answers and 618.4k answer views I am not sure that this is an answerable question. There appear to be an infinite number of primes. But there are an infinite number of even numbers, but the probability of getting an even number (when restricted to integers) is 1/2. Because in any large interval the probability is 1/2 (if there are an even number of numbers in the interval, or very close to 1/2 if there are an odd number of numbers in the interval, and the larger your interval becomes the closer to 1/2 this will be). But you can’t apply that kind of logic to primes, because as the intervals grow larger and larger the probability of randomly selecting a prime is growing smaller and smaller. So the probability is approaching zero, but it clearly never reaches zero, because there do exist some prime numbers. 488 Views   Jim Greene , Math N00b Answered Jan 12, 2017 I came here because I asked the question myself, but I didn’t find the other answers very helpful. This is the probability of a random number being prime: Let P represent a prime number. Let P1 represent the prime number that proceeds P and P2 be the one that proceeds P1. {(P - 1)/P} * {(P1 - 1)/P1} * {(P2 - 1)/P2} * {(P3 - 1)/P3} * {(P4 - 1)/P4} … {(2–1)/2} = The probability that a number after P is prime, until the next prime number Here are some sloppy charts: You will notice that at P=1000 you get 8%. At P=10,000; 6%. P=100,000; close to 5%. And at 1,000,000; about 4%. It probably is safe to assume that the probability approaches zero. 604 Views Quora User , Software developer, sailor and seeing life is a rogue wave in a quantum sea Answered Aug 29, 2014 · Author has 6.3k answers and 16.3m answer views Initially, no more than 40% once you eliminate 2 and 5.  A prime number will never end in an even number or end in an zero or 5.  A prime will end in 1,3,7 or 9.  So 4 out of 10 possible digits.

Undo Answer Wiki 1 Answer   Abhijeet Jain , Valar Pikiptan , All men must read ! Answered May 29, 2013 if you mean 'n' cards taken from deck and probability of getting n card straight, we can approach this in following manner:- for simplicity we can denote J->11, Q->12, K->13 , A->(14 or 1 depending on the situation) Assumption : Similar to straight other definations like Royal Flush and Flush will be similar ( Royal being n straight of the same color with highest card being A(14) , Flush is n straight card of the same color) clearly n <=13,  now depending upon 'n' the highest card in our set ( of n straight cards) can be 'n', 'n+1'.....J(11), Q(12), K (13), A(14). No. of highest possible cards ( in each set) = 14 - n +1 = 15 - n Total number of cases possible = (15 -n) *  4^n taking each of the n straight card from any of the 4 color sets. But this also contains cases of Flush and Royal Flush, we need to subtract the, from given cases. Clearly there can be 4 cases of royal flush starting from A(14) of each color to n straight cards. For Flush number of highest possible cards = 15 -n -1 ( subtracting one for Royal Flush scenario) number of highest possible cards for Flush = 14 -n Each of the set can be chosen from any of the 4 set , hence total combinations of Flush = (14-n) * 4 Now for our sample space we just need to choose n cards from 52 , it will be 52 [math]C n[/math] Hence our probability of n straight  = [(15-n) * 4^n  - 4 - (14-n) * 4 ] / 52 [math]C n[/math] 1.1k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Ask New Question   Michael Lamar , PhD in Applied Mathematics Answered Dec 24, 2014 · Author has 1.8k answers and 4.7m answer views Another nice way to arrive at Alan's approximation of [math]\frac 1 {\sqrt{\pi n}}[/math] is to use the normal approximation to the binomial which itself is just an application of the central limit theorem.  This approach shows us that the probability behaves the way it does because the standard deviation of the binomial is proportional to [math]{\sqrt n}[/math] (and the factor of [math]\sqrt \pi[/math] comes from the height of a normal density). Let [math]X[/math] be the number of heads flipped if we have [math]2 n[/math]  flips of the coin (for [math]n[/math] relatively large).  Then [math]E(X)=n[/math] .  The standard deviation in the number of heads is [math]\sigma_X = \sqrt {\frac n 2}\ .[/math]  Also, let [math]Z[/math] be a standard normal random variable.  Recall that the density of the standard normal is given by [math]f_Z(z) = \frac 1 {\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac {z^2} 2}[/math] . So we see that [math]f_Z(0) =\frac 1 {\sqrt{2 \pi}} [/math] .  Furthermore, [math]f_Z \left ( \pm \frac 1 2 \sqrt {\frac   2 n}  \right) =\frac 1 {\sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{4n}}\approx \frac 1 {\sqrt{2 \pi} }[/math] .   So over the range of [math]|z|  \le  \frac 1 2 \sqrt {\frac   2 n} [/math] the density is very nearly flat. Now we use the normal approximation to the binomial to estimate the probability: [math]P \left ( X = n \right) =P \left (  n - \frac 1 2 < X <  n+ \frac 1 2\right) [/math]  [math]\approx P \left (  - \frac 1 2 \sqrt {\frac   2 n}   < Z <      - \frac 1 2 \sqrt {\frac   2 n} \right) [/math] . We can approximate the area under the standard normal density over this range of values using a single rectangle because (as noted above), the density is very nearly flat.  The width of the rectangle (from the range [math]Z[/math] values) is [math]\sqrt {\frac   2 n}[/math] and the height (from the height of the density) is [math]\frac 1 {\sqrt{2 \pi}}[/math] .  The area (which is the probability we seek) is then given by the product of this width and height: [math]\frac   1 {\sqrt {n  \pi} }[/math] . 766 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Springboard Learn data science in Python with a mentor.

In fact for odd  [math]n[/math] the probability is exactly zero! I would also add that [math]\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{n!^2}[/math] and there is a good estimate for factorial as [math]n[/math] increases called Stirling's approximation : [math]n! \approx \sqrt{2\pi n}(n/e)^n[/math] Thus for large [math]n[/math] the number of sequences with exactly [math]n[/math] Heads from [math]2n[/math] flips of a fair coin is approximately: [math]\frac{\sqrt{2\pi 2n}(2n/e)^{2n}}{2\pi n(n/e)^{2n}} = \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{\pi n}}[/math] So the probability of getting [math]n[/math] Heads in [math]2n[/math] flips is approximately [math]1/\sqrt{\pi n}[/math] which is pleasingly simply and, perhaps, surprisingly large.

One easy way of doing that is going through the element of X one by one and flipping a fair coin twice per element: the first coin flip says if the element should be a member of A, and the second, whether it should be a member of B. Every element of X is now equally likely to be in one of four states: a member of both A and B; a member of A and not B; a member of B and not A; a member of neither. Three of those cases are in agreement with A being a subset of B, and you need one of these to occur for each element.

The set A precedes B. If A is a subset of B, then what sets are A∪B and A ∩ B'? Set A contains 2 elements, and set B contains 20 elements. What is the probability that a given function is one-one? Sets: an element of a set can never be a subset of itself?

Question Asked a year ago Hamna Maryam  3.54 Forman Christian College How the units in simple random sampling WR and WOR has the equal probability of being selected (1/N)? Suppose we have a population 1,2,3,4,5 and a sample selected 1,2,3. when using WR we know 1/N equals 1/5. The prob of 1,2,3 for being selected is 1/5. But in case of WOR how it is 1/N? As the definition of SRS says, each unit has an equal prob of being selected and in WOR, the unit is not returned, so wont it be 1/5 for 1, 1/4 for 2 and 1/3 for 3, So how does the definition hold?

Simple random sampling assumes every group of members in the current sample space has an equal chance of being selected. When you make multiple selections, the sample space will reduce for WOR and stay the same for WR.  For each selection, the probability will be 1/(N - k) for WOR where k previous selections have been made. 1 Recommendation a year ago William Josephson Southern New Hampshire University I meant to say, for Simple Random Sampling, all groups of the same size have an equal chance of being selected. 1 Recommendation a year ago Hemangi V. Kulkarni Shivaji University, Kolhapur A  particular unit can be selected in any of the n draws.  its selection probability at ith draw conditional on the event that it is not selected in previous i-1 draws is 1/(N-i+1)*{(N-i+1)/N}=1/N for each i=1....N.  Summing over i, the probability that ith unit is selected in the sample is n/N  which is same for each unit. 2 Recommendations a year ago Nadia Saeed University of the Punjab Probability of selection will remain the same at each draw.

Pavia University of Valencia It is simple: example for the second selected item. Imagine you have a group of N items. In the first draw, you see clear that the probability that an item is in the sample is 1/N. You also see clear that conditioned to the fact that a different item than item “a” has been drawn in the first draw the probability that item “a” is drawn in the second draw is 1/(N-1). The key is “conditioned to”. Now Bayes rule. In the first draw, any (whatever) of the others N-1 items could be drawn with probability 1/N. So the probability of drawing item “a” in the second extraction conditioned to any of the other items has been drawn in the first extraction is, by bayes rule, (N-1)/N * 1/(N-1) = 1/N. 2 Recommendations a year ago Ilya B.

I recommend you a Spanish book: Mirás, Julio (1985). Elementos de Muestreo para Poblaciones Finitas. Instituto Nacional de Estadística. Madrid. This book has been reedited more recently. a year ago Farah Yasmeen University of Karachi Dear Hamna! We use two conditions for SRS (both in sampling WR or WOR) 1. The probability of selecting an element from the population remains constant. 2. The prob, of selecting a  random sample of size 'n' remains constant. Consider a case with population size N=5 and  sample size n=3 { The population units are supposed to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and the sample units are 1, 2,3 (specifically)} The case of SRS with replacement is clear to you, now consider SRS without replacement. For condition 1, the probability of selecting an element (e.g. 1 ) is 1/5 at first draw. At second draw it is (4/5) * (1/4)   i.e (prob. of selecting any unit other than 1 at first draw) * (prob. of selecting 1 at second draw) = (4/5) * (1/4)= 1/5 Means that if one is not selected first time, any of (2, 3, 4, 5) is selected first, so the prob is 4/5 and now element 1 is selected at second, so the prob. is 1/4 (as sampling is done without replacement, so only 4 units left of which 1 is favorable). Similarly prob. of selecting 1 at third draw is (4/5)*(3/4)*(1/3) = 1/5 In this way probability remains the same for each element at every draw, whether it is SRS WR or SRS WOR. I hope it will help you. Regards 2 Recommendations Can you help by adding an answer?

In other words, simple random sampling is a method of selecting a sample s of n units from a population Ω of size N by giving equal probability of selection to all units. It is a sampling scheme in which all possible combinations of n units may be formed from the population of N units with the same chance of selection. Chapter · Jan 2003 · Transportation Research Part A Policy and Practice Sarjinder Singh Read Strategic sampling for large choice sets in estimation and application [Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT:  Many discrete choice contexts in transportation deal with large choice sets, including destination, route, and vehicle choices. Model estimation with large numbers of alternatives remains computationally expensive. In the context of the multinomial logit (MNL) model, limiting the number of alternatives in estimation by simple random sampling (SRS) yields consistent parameter estimates, but estimator efficiency suffers. In the context of more general models, such as the mixed MNL, limiting the number of alternatives via SRS yields biased parameter estimates. In this paper, a new, strategic sampling scheme is introduced, which draws alternatives in proportion to updated choice-probability estimates. Since such probabilities are not known a priori, the first iteration uses SRS among all available alternatives. The sampling scheme is implemented here for a variety of simulated MNL and mixed-MNL data sets, with results suggesting that the new sampling scheme provides substantial efficiency benefits. Thanks to reductions in estimation error, parameter estimates are more accurate, on average. Moreover, in the mixed MNL case, where SRS produces biased estimates (due to violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property), the new sampling scheme appears to effectively eliminate such biases. Finally, it appears that only a single iteration of the new strategy (following the initialization step using SRS) is needed to deliver the strategy’s maximum efficiency gains.Highlights► Drawing choice samples based on standard logit probabilities is strategic. ► Strategic sampling provides more efficient estimates than SRS counterpart. ► New strategy requires very little additional computational effort or analyst capability.

of random selection . In order to have a random selection method, you must set up
some process or procedure that assures that the different units in your population have
equal probabilities of being chosen. Humans have long practiced various forms of random
selection, such as picking a name out of a hat, or choosing the short straw. These days,
we tend to use computers as the mechanism for generating random numbers as the basis for
random selection.     Some Definitions  Before I can explain the various probability methods we have to define some basic
terms. These are:   N = the number of cases in the sampling frame  n = the number of cases in the sample  N C n = the number of combinations (subsets) of n from N  f = n/N = the sampling fraction   That's it. With those terms defined we can begin to define the different probability
sampling methods.     Simple Random Sampling  The simplest form of random sampling is called simple random sampling . Pretty
tricky, huh? Here's the quick description of simple random sampling:   Objective : To select n units out of N such that each N C n has an equal chance of being selected.  Procedure : Use a table of random numbers, a computer random number generator, or
    a mechanical device to select the sample.   A somewhat stilted, if accurate, definition. Let's see if we can make it a little more
real. How do we select a simple random
sample? Let's assume that we are doing some research with a small service agency that
wishes to assess clients' views of quality of service over the past year. First, we have
to get the sampling frame organized. To accomplish this, we'll go through agency records
to identify every client over the past 12 months. If we're lucky, the agency has good
accurate computerized records and can quickly produce such a list. Then, we have to
actually draw the sample. Decide on the number of clients you would like to have in the
final sample. For the sake of the example, let's say you want to select 100 clients to
survey and that there were 1000 clients over the past 12 months. Then, the sampling
fraction is f = n/N = 100/1000 = .10 or 10%. Now, to actually draw the sample, you have
several options. You could print off the list of 1000 clients, tear then into separate
strips, put the strips in a hat, mix them up real good, close your eyes and pull out the
first 100. But this mechanical procedure would be tedious and the quality of the sample
would depend on how thoroughly you mixed them up and how randomly you reached in. Perhaps
a better procedure would be to use the kind of ball machine that is popular with many of
the state lotteries. You would need three sets of balls numbered 0 to 9, one set for each
of the digits from 000 to 999 (if we select 000 we'll call that 1000). Number the list of
names from 1 to 1000 and then use the ball machine to select the three digits that selects
each person. The obvious disadvantage here is that you need to get the ball machines.
(Where do they make those things, anyway? Is there a ball machine industry?).  Neither of these mechanical procedures is very feasible and, with the development of
inexpensive computers there is a much easier way. Here's a simple procedure that's
especially useful if you have the names of the clients already on the computer. Many
computer programs can generate a series of random numbers. Let's assume you can copy and
paste the list of client names into a column in an EXCEL spreadsheet. Then, in the column
right next to it paste the function =RAND() which is EXCEL's way of putting a random
number between 0 and 1 in the cells. Then, sort both columns -- the list of names and the
random number -- by the random numbers. This rearranges the list in random order from the
lowest to the highest random number. Then, all you have to do is take the first hundred
names in this sorted list. pretty simple. You could probably accomplish the whole thing in
under a minute.  Simple random sampling is simple to accomplish and is easy to explain to others.
Because simple random sampling is a fair way to select a sample, it is reasonable to
generalize the results from the sample back to the population. Simple random sampling is
not the most statistically efficient method of sampling and you may, just because of the
luck of the draw, not get good representation of subgroups in a population. To deal with
these issues, we have to turn to other sampling methods.  Stratified Random Sampling  Stratified Random Sampling , also sometimes called proportional or quota random sampling, involves dividing your population into homogeneous subgroups and then
taking a simple random sample in each subgroup. In more formal terms:   Objective : Divide the population into non-overlapping groups (i.e., strata )
  N 1 , N 2 , N 3 , ... N i , such that N 1 +
  N 2 + N 3 + ... + N i = N. Then do a simple random sample of
  f = n/N in each strata.   There are several major reasons why you might prefer stratified sampling over simple
random sampling. First, it assures that you will be able to represent not only the overall
population, but also key subgroups of the population, especially small minority groups. If
you want to be able to talk about subgroups, this may be the only way to effectively
assure you'll be able to. If the subgroup is extremely small, you can use different
sampling fractions (f) within the different strata to randomly over-sample the small group
(although you'll then have to weight the within-group estimates using the sampling
fraction whenever you want overall population estimates). When we use the same sampling
fraction within strata we are conducting proportionate stratified random sampling.
When we use different sampling fractions in the strata, we call this disproportionate stratified random sampling. Second, stratified random sampling will generally have more
statistical precision than simple random sampling. This will only be true if the strata or
groups are homogeneous. If they are, we expect that the variability within-groups is lower
than the variability for the population as a whole. Stratified sampling capitalizes on
that fact.  For example, let's say that the
population of clients for our agency can be divided into three groups: Caucasian,
African-American and Hispanic-American. Furthermore, let's assume that both the
African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans are relatively small minorities of the clientele
(10% and 5% respectively). If we just did a simple random sample of n=100 with a sampling
fraction of 10%, we would expect by chance alone that we would only get 10 and 5 persons
from each of our two smaller groups. And, by chance, we could get fewer than that! If we
stratify, we can do better. First, let's determine how many people we want to have in each
group. Let's say we still want to take a sample of 100 from the population of 1000 clients
over the past year. But we think that in order to say anything about subgroups we will
need at least 25 cases in each group. So, let's sample 50 Caucasians, 25
African-Americans, and 25 Hispanic-Americans. We know that 10% of the population, or 100
clients, are African-American. If we randomly sample 25 of these, we have a within-stratum
sampling fraction of 25/100 = 25%. Similarly, we know that 5% or 50 clients are
Hispanic-American. So our within-stratum sampling fraction will be 25/50 = 50%. Finally,
by subtraction we know that there are 850 Caucasian clients. Our within-stratum sampling
fraction for them is 50/850 = about 5.88%. Because the groups are more homogeneous
within-group than across the population as a whole, we can expect greater statistical
precision (less variance). And, because we stratified, we know we will have enough cases
from each group to make meaningful subgroup inferences.  Systematic Random Sampling  Here are the steps you need to follow in order to achieve a systematic random sample :   number the units in the population from 1 to N  decide on the n (sample size) that you want or need  k = N/n = the interval size  randomly select an integer between 1 to k  then take every kth unit   All of this will be much clearer with an
example. Let's assume that we have a population that only has N=100 people in it and that
you want to take a sample of n=20. To use systematic sampling, the population must be
listed in a random order. The sampling fraction would be f = 20/100 = 20%. in this case,
the interval size, k, is equal to N/n = 100/20 = 5. Now, select a random integer from 1 to
5. In our example, imagine that you chose 4. Now, to select the sample, start with the 4th
unit in the list and take every k-th unit (every 5th, because k=5). You would be sampling
units 4, 9, 14, 19, and so on to 100 and you would wind up with 20 units in your sample.  For this to work, it is essential that the units in the population are 
randomly ordered, at least with respect to the characteristics you are 
measuring. Why would you ever want to use systematic random sampling? For one 
thing, it is fairly easy to do. You only have to select a single random number 
to start things off. It may also be more precise than simple random sampling. 
Finally, in some situations there is simply no easier way to do random sampling. 
For instance, I once had to do a study that involved sampling from all the books 
in a library. Once selected, I would have to go to the shelf, locate the book, 
and record when it last circulated. I knew that I had a fairly good sampling 
frame in the form of the shelf list (which is a card catalog where the entries 
are arranged in the order they occur on the shelf). To do a simple random 
sample, I could have estimated the total number of books and generated random 
numbers to draw the sample; but how would I find book #74,329 easily if that is 
the number I selected? I couldn't very well count the cards until I came to 
74,329! Stratifying wouldn't solve that problem either. For instance, I could 
have stratified by card catalog drawer and drawn a simple random sample within 
each drawer. But I'd still be stuck counting cards. Instead, I did a systematic 
random sample. I estimated the number of books in the entire collection. Let's 
imagine it was 100,000. I decided that I wanted to take a sample of 1000 for a 
sampling fraction of 1000/100,000 = 1%. To get the sampling interval k, I 
divided N/n = 100,000/1000 = 100. Then I selected a random integer between 1 and 
100. Let's say I got 57. Next I did a little side study to determine how thick a 
thousand cards are in the card catalog (taking into account the varying ages of 
the cards). Let's say that on average I found that two cards that were separated 
by 100 cards were about .75 inches apart in the catalog drawer. That information 
gave me everything I needed to draw the sample. I counted to the 57th by hand 
and recorded the book information. Then, I took a compass. (Remember those from 
your high-school math class? They're the funny little metal instruments with a 
sharp pin on one end and a pencil on the other that you used to draw circles in 
geometry class.) Then I set the compass at .75", stuck the pin end in at the 
57th card and pointed with the pencil end to the next card (approximately 100 
books away). In this way, I approximated selecting the 157th, 257th, 357th, and 
so on. I was able to accomplish the entire selection procedure in very little 
time using this systematic random sampling approach. I'd probably still be there 
counting cards if I'd tried another random sampling method. (Okay, so I have no 
life. I got compensated nicely, I don't mind saying, for coming up with this 
scheme.)  Cluster (Area) Random Sampling  The problem with random sampling methods when we have to sample a population that's
disbursed across a wide geographic region is that you will have to cover a lot of ground
geographically in order to get to each of the units you sampled. Imagine taking a simple
random sample of all the residents of New York State in order to conduct personal
interviews. By the luck of the draw you will wind up with respondents who come from all
over the state. Your interviewers are going to have a lot of traveling to do. It is for
precisely this problem that cluster or area random sampling was invented.  In cluster sampling, we follow these steps:   divide population into clusters (usually along geographic boundaries)  randomly sample clusters  measure all units within sampled clusters   For instance, in the figure we see a map
of the counties in New York State. Let's say that we have to do a survey of town
governments that will require us going to the towns personally. If we do a simple random
sample state-wide we'll have to cover the entire state geographically. Instead, we decide
to do a cluster sampling of five counties (marked in red in the figure). Once these are
selected, we go to every town government in the five areas. Clearly this strategy
will help us to economize on our mileage. Cluster or area sampling, then, is useful in
situations like this, and is done primarily for efficiency of administration. Note also,
that we probably don't have to worry about using this approach if we are conducting a mail
or telephone survey because it doesn't matter as much (or cost more or raise inefficiency)
where we call or send letters to.  Multi-Stage Sampling  The four methods we've covered so far -- simple, stratified, systematic and cluster --
are the simplest random sampling strategies. In most real applied social research, we
would use sampling methods that are considerably more complex than these simple
variations. The most important principle here is that we can combine the simple methods
described earlier in a variety of useful ways that help us address our sampling needs in
the most efficient and effective manner possible. When we combine sampling methods, we
call this multi-stage sampling .  For example, consider the idea of sampling New York State residents for face-to-face
interviews. Clearly we would want to do some type of cluster sampling as the first stage
of the process. We might sample townships or census tracts throughout the state. But in
cluster sampling we would then go on to measure everyone in the clusters we select. Even
if we are sampling census tracts we may not be able to measure everyone who is in
the census tract. So, we might set up a stratified sampling process within the clusters.
In this case, we would have a two-stage sampling process with stratified samples within
cluster samples. Or, consider the problem of sampling students in grade schools. We might
begin with a national sample of school districts stratified by economics and educational
level. Within selected districts, we might do a simple random sample of schools. Within
schools, we might do a simple random sample of classes or grades. And, within classes, we
might even do a simple random sample of students. In this case, we have three or four
stages in the sampling process and we use both stratified and simple random sampling. By
combining different sampling methods we are able to achieve a rich variety of
probabilistic sampling methods that can be used in a wide range of social research
contexts.      « Previous Home Next »  Copyright ©2006, William M.K. Trochim, All Rights Reserved  Purchase a printed copy of the Research Methods Knowledge
