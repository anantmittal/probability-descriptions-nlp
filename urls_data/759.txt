This makes UT Austin Strongly Competitive for GPAs.   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.
    
    This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.)  With a GPA of 3.75, UT Austin
      
      requires you to be above average in your high school class. You'll need a mix of A's and B's, with a leaning toward A's. If you took some AP or IB classes, this will help boost your weighted GPA and show your ability to take college classes.  If you're a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change from this point on. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.75, you'll need a higher SAT score to compensate and show that you're prepared to take on college academics. This will help you compete effectively with other applicants.    Admissions Rate: 40%   The acceptance rate at UT Austin is 40% . In other words, of 100 students who apply, 40 are admitted.   This means the school is somewhat selective . You should prepare your academic scores well, but you have an excellent chance if you impress them.    Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is moderately selective, strong academic performance will almost guarantee you admission . Scoring at a 1904 SAT or above will already give you a great shot at getting in. Scoring a 2070 will nearly guarantee you admission, given that your GPA is roughly the average of 3.75.

While there are a lot of pieces that go into a college application, you should focus on only a few critical things:   GPA requirements  Testing requirements, including SAT and ACT requirements  Application requirements   In this guide we'll cover what you need to get into UT Austin and build a strong application.  School location: Austin, TX  This school is also known as: University of Texas at Austin       Admissions Rate: 40%   If you want to get in, the first thing to look at is the acceptance rate. This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.  The acceptance rate at UT Austin is 40% . For every 100 applicants, 40 are admitted.    This means the school is moderately selective . The school expects you to meet their requirements for GPA and SAT/ACT scores, but they're more flexible than other schools. If you exceed their requirements, you have an excellent chance of getting in. But if you don't, you might be one of the unlucky minority that gets a rejection letter.   UT Austin GPA Requirements  Many schools specify a minimum GPA requirement, but this is often just the bare minimum to submit an application without immediately getting rejected.  The GPA requirement that really matters is the GPA you need for a real chance of getting in. For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.   Average GPA: 3.75   The average GPA at UT Austin is 3.75 .   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.
          
          This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.)  With a GPA of 3.75, UT Austin
	  
	  requires you to be above average in your high school class. You'll need at least a mix of A's and B's, with more A's than B's. You can compensate for a lower GPA with harder classes, like AP or IB classes. This will show that you're able to handle more difficult academics than the average high school student.  If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.75, you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate . This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you.   SAT and ACT Requirements   Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.   You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to UT Austin. More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. UT Austin SAT Requirements  Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.   Average SAT: 1350 (Old: 1904)   The average SAT score composite at UT Austin is a 1350 on the 1600 SAT scale.  On the old 2400 SAT , this corresponds to an average SAT score of 1904 .  This score makes UT Austin Moderately Competitive for SAT test scores.    UT Austin SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)  The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1240, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1450. In other words, a 1240 on the New SAT places you below average, while a 1450 will move you up to above average .  For students looking to make the move from the Houston area to Austin, the SAT and ACT can be formidable obstacles, but with our guide to tutoring in Houston , we can help you overcome them. Here's the breakdown of new SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 670 620 740  Reading 33 31 36  Writing 34 31 36  Composite 1350 1240 1450     UT Austin SAT Score Analysis (Old 2400 SAT)  The 25th percentile Old SAT score is 1730, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 2070. In other words, a 1730 on the Old SAT places you below average, while a 2070 puts you well above average .  Here's the breakdown of old SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 655 600 710  Reading 628 570 680  Writing 621 560 680  Composite 1904 1730 2070    SAT Score Choice Policy  The Score Choice policy at your school is an important part of your testing strategy.  UT Austin has the Score Choice policy of "Contact School."  This means that the school wants you to contact them to learn more about their Score Choice policies.

Download our free guide on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve your score. This guide was written by Harvard graduates and SAT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 UT Austin ACT Requirements  Just like for the SAT, UT Austin likely doesn't have a hard ACT cutoff, but if you score too low, your application will get tossed in the trash.   Average ACT: 29   The average ACT score at UT Austin is 29. This score makes UT Austin Moderately Competitive for ACT scores.   The 25th percentile ACT score is 26, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 31.  Even though UT Austin likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 26 or below, you'll have a very hard time getting in, unless you have something else very impressive in your application. There are so many applicants scoring 29 and above that a 26 will look academically weak.  ACT Score Sending Policy  If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.  Here it is: when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send. You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.  This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 29 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.  ACT Superscore Policy  By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.  We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to UT Austin, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 29.    Studying for the ACT instead?

This guide was written by Harvard graduates and ACT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                SAT/ACT Writing Section Requirements  Both the SAT and ACT have a Writing section that includes an essay.  UT Austin requires you to take the SAT/ACT Writing section . They'll use this as another factor in their admissions consideration.   SAT Subject Test Requirements  Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.  We did not find information that UT Austin requires SAT subject tests, and so most likely it does not . At least 6 months before applying, you should still doublecheck just to make sure, so you have enough time to take the test.    Our Expert's Notes   We did more detailed research into this school and found the following information.   Enrolling students with SAT Writing scores between 600 and 800 and ACT writing scores of 26 or higher earn credit for freshman English (RHE 306) at UT Austin. Additionally, certain majors in Engineering, Geosciences, and Natural Sciences have a "calculus readiness requirement," which can be fulfilled in multiple ways including getting at least a 600 on SAT Math or a 26 on ACT Math. More on the calculus readiness requirement here.   Source        Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is moderately selective, strong academic performance will almost guarantee you admission . Scoring a 2070 SAT or a 31 ACT or above will nearly guarantee you admission. Because the school admits 40% of all applicants, being far above average raises the admission rate for you to nearly 100%.  If you can achieve a high SAT/ACT score, the rest of your application essentially doesn't matter. You still need to meet the rest of the application requirements, and your GPA shouldn't be too far off from the school average of 3.75. But you won't need dazzling extracurriculars and breathtaking letters of recommendation to get in. You can get in based on the merits of your score alone.  But if your score is a 1730 SAT or a 26 ACT and below, you have a good chance of being one of the unlucky few to be rejected.

Plug in your numbers to see what your chances of getting in are.

Also, make sure to consult the page of extra requirements for programs like Engineering, Nursing, and Fine Arts.

In this guide, we'll discuss what scores are needed for you to get admitted into UT Austin. You'll also get to calculate your own chances with our admissions calculator.  Location: Austin, TX  This school is also known as: University of Texas at Austin   UT Austin Admissions Statistics  There are three critical numbers when considering your admissions chances: ACT scores, GPA, and acceptance rate . All these combine to tell you what you scores are required to get into University of Texas at Austin.    Average ACT: 29   The average ACT score composite at UT Austin is a 29 .   The 25th percentile ACT score is 26, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 31.  In other words, a 26 places you below average, while a 31 will move you up to above average. There's no absolute ACT requirement at UT Austin, but they really want to see at least a 26 to have a chance at being considered.

This guide was written by Harvard graduates and ACT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 Average GPA: 3.8   The average GPA at UT Austin is 3.8 . This makes UT Austin Extremely Competitive for GPAs.   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.
    
    This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.)  With a GPA of 3.8, UT Austin
      
      requires you to be near the top of your class , and well above average. You'll need mostly A's, ideally with several AP or IB classes to help show your preparation at a college level.  If you're a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change from this point on. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.8, you'll need a higher ACT score to compensate and show that you're prepared to take on college academics. This will help you compete effectively with other applicants.    Admissions Rate: 40%   The acceptance rate at UT Austin is 40% . In other words, of 100 students who apply, 40 are admitted.   This means the school is somewhat selective . You should prepare your academic scores well, but you have an excellent chance if you impress them.    Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is moderately selective, strong academic performance will almost guarantee you admission . Scoring at a 29 ACT or above will already give you a great shot at getting in. Scoring a 31 will nearly guarantee you admission, given that your GPA is roughly the average of 3.8.    Admissions Calculator    What are your chances of admission at University of Texas at Austin?   Chances of admission with these scores:   Here's our custom admissions calculator. Plug in your numbers to see what your chances of getting in are.

This tool provides only a simplistic estimate of your chances of admission. Instead of treating this tool as a crystal ball, we recommend you consider the big picture of what your chance means:  80-100%: Safety school: Strong chance of getting in  50-80%: More likely than not getting in  20-50%: Lower but still good chance of getting in  5-20%: Reach school: Unlikely to get in, but still have a shot  0-5%: Hard reach school: Very difficult to get in  We recommend you apply to schools across a range of chances. Applying to some safety schools will guarantee you have a college to go to, while applying to some reach schools will give you a shot at getting into the school at the top of your range.

While there are a lot of pieces that go into a college application, you should focus on only a few critical things:   GPA requirements  Testing requirements, including SAT and ACT requirements  Application requirements   In this guide we'll cover what you need to get into UT Austin and build a strong application.  School location: Austin, TX  This school is also known as: University of Texas at Austin       Admissions Rate: 40%   If you want to get in, the first thing to look at is the acceptance rate. This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.  The acceptance rate at UT Austin is 40% . For every 100 applicants, 40 are admitted.    This means the school is moderately selective . The school expects you to meet their requirements for GPA and SAT/ACT scores, but they're more flexible than other schools. If you exceed their requirements, you have an excellent chance of getting in. But if you don't, you might be one of the unlucky minority that gets a rejection letter.   UT Austin GPA Requirements  Many schools specify a minimum GPA requirement, but this is often just the bare minimum to submit an application without immediately getting rejected.  The GPA requirement that really matters is the GPA you need for a real chance of getting in. For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.   Average GPA: 3.75   The average GPA at UT Austin is 3.75 .   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.
          
          This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.)  With a GPA of 3.75, UT Austin
	  
	  requires you to be above average in your high school class. You'll need at least a mix of A's and B's, with more A's than B's. You can compensate for a lower GPA with harder classes, like AP or IB classes. This will show that you're able to handle more difficult academics than the average high school student.  If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.75, you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate . This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you.   SAT and ACT Requirements   Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.   You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to UT Austin. More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. UT Austin SAT Requirements  Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.   Average SAT: 1350 (Old: 1904)   The average SAT score composite at UT Austin is a 1350 on the 1600 SAT scale.  On the old 2400 SAT , this corresponds to an average SAT score of 1904 .  This score makes UT Austin Moderately Competitive for SAT test scores.    UT Austin SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)  The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1240, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1450. In other words, a 1240 on the New SAT places you below average, while a 1450 will move you up to above average .  For students looking to make the move from the Houston area to Austin, the SAT and ACT can be formidable obstacles, but with our guide to tutoring in Houston , we can help you overcome them. Here's the breakdown of new SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 670 620 740  Reading 33 31 36  Writing 34 31 36  Composite 1350 1240 1450     UT Austin SAT Score Analysis (Old 2400 SAT)  The 25th percentile Old SAT score is 1730, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 2070. In other words, a 1730 on the Old SAT places you below average, while a 2070 puts you well above average .  Here's the breakdown of old SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 655 600 710  Reading 628 570 680  Writing 621 560 680  Composite 1904 1730 2070    SAT Score Choice Policy  The Score Choice policy at your school is an important part of your testing strategy.  UT Austin has the Score Choice policy of "Contact School."  This means that the school wants you to contact them to learn more about their Score Choice policies.

Download our free guide on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve your score. This guide was written by Harvard graduates and SAT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 UT Austin ACT Requirements  Just like for the SAT, UT Austin likely doesn't have a hard ACT cutoff, but if you score too low, your application will get tossed in the trash.   Average ACT: 29   The average ACT score at UT Austin is 29. This score makes UT Austin Moderately Competitive for ACT scores.   The 25th percentile ACT score is 26, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 31.  Even though UT Austin likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 26 or below, you'll have a very hard time getting in, unless you have something else very impressive in your application. There are so many applicants scoring 29 and above that a 26 will look academically weak.  ACT Score Sending Policy  If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.  Here it is: when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send. You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.  This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 29 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.  ACT Superscore Policy  By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.  We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to UT Austin, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 29.    Studying for the ACT instead?

This guide was written by Harvard graduates and ACT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                SAT/ACT Writing Section Requirements  Both the SAT and ACT have a Writing section that includes an essay.  UT Austin requires you to take the SAT/ACT Writing section . They'll use this as another factor in their admissions consideration.   SAT Subject Test Requirements  Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.  We did not find information that UT Austin requires SAT subject tests, and so most likely it does not . At least 6 months before applying, you should still doublecheck just to make sure, so you have enough time to take the test.    Our Expert's Notes   We did more detailed research into this school and found the following information.   Enrolling students with SAT Writing scores between 600 and 800 and ACT writing scores of 26 or higher earn credit for freshman English (RHE 306) at UT Austin. Additionally, certain majors in Engineering, Geosciences, and Natural Sciences have a "calculus readiness requirement," which can be fulfilled in multiple ways including getting at least a 600 on SAT Math or a 26 on ACT Math. More on the calculus readiness requirement here.   Source        Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is moderately selective, strong academic performance will almost guarantee you admission . Scoring a 2070 SAT or a 31 ACT or above will nearly guarantee you admission. Because the school admits 40% of all applicants, being far above average raises the admission rate for you to nearly 100%.  If you can achieve a high SAT/ACT score, the rest of your application essentially doesn't matter. You still need to meet the rest of the application requirements, and your GPA shouldn't be too far off from the school average of 3.75. But you won't need dazzling extracurriculars and breathtaking letters of recommendation to get in. You can get in based on the merits of your score alone.  But if your score is a 1730 SAT or a 26 ACT and below, you have a good chance of being one of the unlucky few to be rejected.

Instead of treating this tool as a crystal ball, we recommend you consider the big picture of what your chance means:  80-100%: Safety school: Strong chance of getting in  50-80%: More likely than not getting in  20-50%: Lower but still good chance of getting in  5-20%: Reach school: Unlikely to get in, but still have a shot  0-5%: Hard reach school: Very difficult to get in  We recommend you apply to schools across a range of chances. Applying to some safety schools will guarantee you have a college to go to, while applying to some reach schools will give you a shot at getting into the school at the top of your range.    How would your chances improve with a better score?  Try to take your current SAT score and add 160 points (or take your ACT score and add 4 points) to the calculator above.

If so you are obviously in the top 10% of your class, so yes you will be admitted the UT.  However if you aren't in-state, then you are most likely going to be rejected from UT. Competition is extremely fierce for in state students. OOS admissions is a whole other ballgame. I had the same ACT score as you and a higher GPA a(nd was in-state +URM), but I got CAP admission (which is basically rejected).   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     bellabiology99    Registered User  Posts: 43  Junior Member      January 2017       I'm out of state :(   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     KingBibi    Registered User  Posts: 231  Junior Member      January 2017       Well, what state are you in? Your state school could offer you great education at a good price, and preferable admissions treatment.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #5     bellabiology99    Registered User  Posts: 43  Junior Member      January 2017       I got an $90,000 scholarship to Loyola University Chicago but i really don't plan on staying in state.

As I said earlier, I'd cross off the UCs if you can't afford them; they won't give you aid. Michigan is as likely to reject you as it is to accept you, though if you do get in and can pay what they're asking then I'd jump on it.

The average ACT of the College of Natural Sciences is a 30... neuroscience is even more competitive than that.  Your chances are very slim if getting accepted into neuroscience because you're an out of state student with a low ACT, comparatively.  Can you afford 53k/year? If not, you shouldn't be applying to UT Austin. The same goes for UCLA.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #15     GreenTeaFanatic    Registered User  Posts: 232  Junior Member      January 2017       ASU is a great school, you should strongly consider going there.

Jmarza    Registered User  Posts: 4  New Member      February 2017   in The University of Texas at Austin      Hello! I just wanted to get some insight into what my chances look like for getting into UT-Austin, as I am starting to narrow down my college list. I am a female, hispanic, and will be the first person in my family to go to college in the United Sates. I go to a very competitive high school, nevertheless my GPA is still average and I am counting on my SAT scores and AP classes to make up for it. Here are my scores and extra curricular activities:  GPA: 4.45/5.0 SAT: 1480/1600 AP Classes: 8 Class Rank: 296/691  Extracurriculars: Club and School Sports VP of National Hispanic Honors Society National Honors Society National Hispanic Recognition Program Qualifier Robotics (Marketing Team) I also work with a non profit organization, and make videos for their website. And I am thinking about applying to the UT Research Program this summer.  I have been looking into applying to the College of Natural Science. I have tried to do some research, but I am getting very mixed answers, which is fair considering that the admissions process is different for everyone. Is there any chance that I might get in? Or should I consider this a reach school. Input is greatly appreciated thank you so much!!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook      Replies to: What are the chances that I will get into UT-Austin?       #1     ucbalumnus    Registered User  Posts: 66,851  Senior Member      February 2017    edited February 2017        http://www.collegedata.com/cs/data/college/college_pg02_tmpl.jhtml?schoolId=788 shows that rank is very important and GPA is not considered by UT Austin.  Therefore, your rank of top 43% makes UT Austin an extreme reach.  Basically, the automatic admission applicants (top 7% Texas residents) take up about 3/4 of the spots, so everyone else (all non-Texas residents and Texas residents outside the top 7%) is left with the remaining 1/4 of the spots.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #2     insanedreamer    Registered User  Posts: 1,536  Senior Member      February 2017       Your stats/ECs are quite good.

But most of its freshman class is admitted based solely on grades because of the Top 10 Percent Rule. So when the school considers students who are not automatically eligible, it is especially interested in high test scores — and white and Asian students are more likely to fit that profile."  But with your scores, presumably you do fit that profile. I'd still say it's a reach but not unrealistic.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook         This discussion has been closed.

Omee55    Registered User  Posts: 1  New Member      February 2017    edited February 2017   in The University of Texas at Austin      Hi, I was wondering what my chances of getting into UT-Austin look like. As of right now I have  a 3.05 GPA (Unweighted) and in the top 27% of my class (I only need to move up 7 spots to get into the top 25%). I have taken my PSAT and scored an 1100, but took the actual SAT two weeks ago and am waiting to get my scores. Along with those numbers I have done 58 hours of community service, got A/B honor roll my freshman year, and hopefully going to be inducted into NHS this year. I've taken nothing but Pre-AP classes except one CP class my sophomore year (Pre-AP is the same thing as honors classes). As of right now I have taken 2 Dual Enrollment classes ( Avearged out to an 85.5, but they are college classes so it should add more points to that and will boost my GPA and rank ). At the end of my junior year I am projected to have a 3.13 GPA (Unweighted), ( Could be a 3.25 because of the Dual Enrollment classes) and be in the top 25% of my class. I also plan to take AP classes my senior year to help my GPA and rank even more. So as of right now, what are my chances of getting admitted into UT-Austin?

UT Austin is top 7% for 2018. 25% is for A&M (with SAT).   I have taken my PSAT and scored an 1100, but took the actual SAT two weeks ago and am waiting to get my scores.  If you have a 3.05 GPA, you are going to need a very high (1500+) to make up for it.   done 58 hours of community service, got A/B honor roll my freshman year, and hopefully going to be inducted into NHS this year.  58 hours is pretty average, honor roll is decent, but why is NHS so late?   Also, will it help that my mom attended UT and graduated with a masters degree?  It might help but only so far.   In order to make a comparison, I will tell you a bit about myself. I am also a junior at a texas high school. I currently have 7 AP classes with all the rest being honors except 5 classes. I plan to take 7 more in senior year. I scored a 1460 on my PSAT (and also waiting for my SAT). I have a 3.89 GPA, along with being a president of a group with ~150 hours.  Yet, I am 90% certain that I will not be able to get into UT Austin. It is insanely competitive for engineering and unless your class ranking is 4-5%, you will not get in.  I don't want to put you down or anything, but unless you have some crazy recs and a mind-blowing essay I just can't see it happening.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     MYOS1634    Registered User  Posts: 35,194  Senior Member      February 2017    edited February 2017       Short version : you're not getting in. Longer version: You need to be top 7% just to get into UT, and to get into engineering you need to be at the top of these. UT then looks at top 10% students from top high schools who have sufficient course rigor and top grades. Again,  not you. Then,  they take athletes. Not you. Then, oos applicants whom they want,  either because of stellar stats or legacy status. So,  you're not getting into UT. Nor TAMU engineering btw. Tamu liberal arts, perhaps,  but not sure) they want top 20% max).  Top 25% and engineering : perhaps Texas Tech and UT Dallas but even there it's not certain at all. Utsa you have a shot. I'd look seriously at oos colleges too (UOklahoma,Montana State , UWyoming) And discuss costs with our parents.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     TexasMom2017    Registered User  Posts: 185  Junior Member      February 2017    edited February 2017       There is a lot of misinformation on this thread.  I suggest that you google "utexas kroll report" and "utexas admission best practices" to find some concrete and reliable information about the admission process.  If you are not top 7% of your (Texas) high school class (and even if you are but want a major other than undeclared liberal arts), there is a holistic review process that does not have a specific cutoff for class rank or test scores.  However, the academic index (based on class rank and test scores) is extremely important.  It is true that @Omee55 is extremely unlikely to get in with those stats, but no one can know for sure without seeing the entire application.  Also, UT does not consider whether one's parents attended or have a connection to UT (except in very unusual circumstances discussed in the Kroll report, and which I suspect are a lot more rare now than even a couple of years ago).  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #5     MYOS1634    Registered User  Posts: 35,194  Senior Member      February 2017       ^ l The Kroll report mostly focused on connections (ie., not just legacies, but powerful donors' letters of recommendation with admissions made directly by the president... those would now become exceedingly rare for IS applicants). Legacies considered are students whose parents and/or grandparents attended the university, continue the tradition, and are now living out of state.  Only 7% are OOS students and academic criteria are even more rigorous for them, so more criteria are taken into account; they represent a very small number of admitted students.  @TexasMom2017 : I know what you're saying, but most students admitted outside the Top 7% are top 10% with excellent grades, scores, and course rigor. Some students who are admitted outside the top 10% are really close to top 10% and/or attended a super competitive high school or bring something unique to the university (such as the ability to win football games).  Even among that last group they're top 25% and that's what OP is hoping for, I'm guessing. While there's no exact cutoff after top 7%, UT is a top public university nationally and admits top students period. A student who might squeak into top 25% with a B+ average is extremely unlikely to make it as you said, but "no one knows for sure" isn't setting things right for this student, who needs to focus on finding affordable safeties, matches, and reachable reaches.This is a good student who has excellent choices in Texas and elsewhere. If s/he wants to throw in an application to UT after completing the rest, sure, but right now we really can't nurture his/her hope that going from 27% to 25% will matter.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     ACT2017    Registered User  Posts: 191  Junior Member      February 2017    edited February 2017        @Omee55 - don't give up hope yet. Try to get best SAT or ACT score and focus on extracurriculars (and summer job) related to your intended major. Make sure to present yourself through essays. Write all three essays and couple of good recommendation letters. BTW your senior year grades doesn't count for admission decisions.

While I agree that it would be a reach for OP, it's certainly not as impossible as you are making it out to be. A good SAT score (1450-1500+) can make up for not being in the top 7%.

I doubt it's counteract the class rank though.  @KohliTheBeast : unfortunately @RMNiMiTz isn't exaggerating. Top 7% gets you into UT not into your major. For restricted /impacted majors, there's holistic review, and admission to UT engineering is for the top of those top 7%. Look at the results thread from last year.

High test scores, strong ECs, etc. can offset *some* weakness in class rank (*up to a point*).

The fact it's possible doesn't make it likely. What I'm trying to say is that UT Engineering is a reach if you're top 7% and if you're not it becomes "reach for everyone" territory. The Best Practices doc is invaluable indeed. the AI/PAI formulas are a bit confusing though.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #13     RMNiMiTz    Registered User  Posts: 802  Member      February 2017        @KohliTheBeast  This kid got a 1100 on the PSAT. Unless he works some magic and improves by 500 points in the scope of a year, he probably isn't getting in. With only 58 hours and beginning NHS this year, his EC's don't look spectacular, unless he is hiding a lot from us.  It is possible to get into UT without being top 7%. However, 27% (and he says he is trying for 25%) is definitely on the low end.  I just don't want to sell him false hope.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #14     KohliTheBeast    Registered User  Posts: 85  Junior Member      February 2017        @RMNiMiTz Oh I didn't mean for the OP.

New Discussion Chances Of Getting Into UT Austin       ConnerA    Registered User  Posts: 2  New Member      February 2015    edited February 2015   in The University of Texas at Austin      I'm a junior currently at a very prestigious private school in Texas, where about 10% of our graduating class (class of about 100) tends to get accepted into an ivy. Last year, I believe we had 9 ivy acceptances out of 100 students as well as a few MIT, Stanford, etc. Because of this, I am far from top 10% (our school does not rank anyways), but I want to know my chances of getting into UT Austin. My ultimate goal would be to be a business major at McCombs, but I know that I will not get into that school initially, so I plan to apply with Radio-Television as my first choice and business as my second (just in case I get lucky) and then switch after freshman year.  My freshman year of high school, my grades were basically awful. I had about a 3 GPA, with a few honors classes. By the end of my sophomore year, my GPA was up to a 3.11, because I averaged around a 3.2 that year (still bad I know). However, junior year, I decided to actually put some effort into school, and my first semester I finished with a 4.11 GPA (3.9 unweighted I believe, but our school only shows us the weighted version). Second semester this year should be about the same, and I should finish junior year with about a 3.45 realistically.  As for the class rigor, senior year I will be taking 3 math classes (AP Stat, AP calc ab, and advanced financial algebra). I will also be taking AP Gov and AP Econ. Also, I will take phycology, regular english, astro physics and the 4th level of our film class. Junior year, I only took 2 AP classes as well as honors math (precalculus honors). Also, I did an independent study in music history.  Below are my extra circulars: -50+ hours of community service -30+ hours of campus service -Cofounder and officer of Science Club -President of Cinema Charities Club (we make promotional videos for non profits who can not afford them to help them get the word of their organization out there) -Investment Club member -Model United Nations member -In a group of students selected to give tours to prospective students and parents at our school -Worked for a radio station as a full time employee for a month over summer -2 Scholastic Art and Writing regional Gold Keys for films -2 Separate Films Selected to Screen At South by Southwest (festival in Austin) -Cinefestival 2014 film best of festival + emerging artist award (san antonio film festival) -Anim!Arte International 2014 - worked on film that received Best student international film of North America + 2nd place youth jury -award (this is a film festival based in Brazil) -Outsiders film festival - movie screened here as well -2 years of basketball and 4 years of tennis -National French Exam - honorary mention  Here are my test scores so far PSAT: 202 (commended) SAT: 1920 (I am retaking this soon, with the goal of a 2050) ACT: 29 (Also retaking this and goal to get 31)  I took the ACT and SAT unprepared, so I feel like I can do significantly better on both. On the ACT, I got a 32 on math and reading, 28 on science but only 24 on english, because I was not prepared for how long the test was. If I had finished it (which I could have if I had practiced and known how long it was), I could easily get a 30 on that section.  Sorry this was so long, but based on all of that, what do you think the chances are of me getting into UT Austin? Also, what should I do to improve my chances aside from grades, because I am already doing everything I can to get those up.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook      Replies to: Chances Of Getting Into UT Austin       #1     smoothies7    Registered User  Posts: 19  New Member      February 2015       Well, UT has a 40.2% acceptance rate (2013) so shouldn't be too hard to get in.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #2     Loganator    Registered User  Posts: 184  Junior Member      February 2015       Your chances are likely better with RTF than with the more competitive McCombs, but you should investigate the transfer possibility if your goal is a business degree. I don't know how possible that would be. FYI, we learned this year that UT is moving away from considering an applicant for the second choice major. Good luck!  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     frostcause    Registered User  Posts: 76  Junior Member      February 2015       You need to be careful about going into Radio-TV initially and planning to transfer to McCombs. While it's not impossible, internal transfers to McCombs are notoriously hard, and you don't want to get trapped in a major you don't want. Just my two cents.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     ConnerA    Registered User  Posts: 2  New Member      February 2015       Thanks for the responses. From what i've read, it seems like you need about a 3.7-3.8 freshman year to transfer into McCombs. Is this generally true? And is it easier to transfer in from harder majors than arts or do they strictly look at gpa?  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #5     evanian15    Registered User  Posts: 158  Junior Member      February 2015        @smoothies7‌ it's a misleading 40.2%, especially if you're in state. The top 7% auto-admit rule causes so many kids in state outside of that range to be rejected because the university wants some geographic diversity.  2   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     DogShelter    Registered User  Posts: 72  Junior Member      February 2015       By the way, McCombs has a 25% acceptance rate. And the overall is skewed by auto-admits. I would say get a 33 ACT or 2150 at the least. I had friends with about the same level of EC's as you with 2050 SATs and auto-admit status denied to McCombs. And everyone is right about you having much greater chances at RTF, plus you seem like you would have fun with it. You should check out the formulas that UT uses for non-auto admits.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #7     OhSorryYo    Registered User  Posts: 248  Junior Member      February 2015       I lol'd at the "shouldn't be too hard" comment.  I think you have pretty good shot at getting in the university, but probably not a spot in McCombs, at least not initially. You have very good ECs. Just try to raise those scores a bit, like at least 32 ACT and 2100 SAT  4   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #8     fatherof2boys    Registered User  Posts: 338  Member      February 2015    edited February 2015       I would concur that you have to make a very hard choice here.  Your stats look competitive for RTF but they are likely to come up short respecting McCombs.  Your plan to enter UT as a RTF major and simply transfer to McCombs is risky to say the least.  I think you are going to have to decide which is more important to you...being a student at UT-Austin, albeit without your preferred major, or being somewhere like A&M with your preferred major.  If you are okay with the former, then go ahead and apply for RTF and see if you can transfer to McCombs later. If you fail to get the transfer, at least you'll be at your dream school.  However, if you really know that you'll be unhappy being stuck as a RTF major, then I'd suggest you simply roll the dice and apply directly to McCombs coming out of high school as your "reach" school, and then consider a school like A&M where (I assume) you are likely going to be a competitive applicant for admission to their undergraduate business program.  In the latter case, if you are granted admission to McCombs under the holistic review for non-auto admits, you are golden! On the other hand, if you are denied admission to UT, you are likely to get into A&M with your preferred major and at a quality,affordable school.  I think your plan to game the system maybe to risky, unless you are truly willing to take the risk of being stuck as a RTF major.  Good luck.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #9     Fuffy24    Registered User  Posts: 162  Junior Member      February 2015       UT's 40.2 percent acceptance rate is inflated by its super easy colleges and majors and auto admit. Getting into business, engineering, and college of natural sciences aligns with 20-30%, similar to other non auto admit public university's, such as UNC. If it makes you feel better, I got into Electrical Engineering from the top 17 percent and my friend got into McCombs with a top 36 percent rank. UT loves rank, but they're holistic, and me and my friend got in due to really good test scores and really good essays, so your not done, you just have to put in a lot of effort. Also note that we didn't have a lot of extracurriculars, certainly not as much as you. Try and hope for the best.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #10     smoothies7    Registered User  Posts: 19  New Member      February 2015       thanks for clearing that up! @evanian15‌   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook         This discussion has been closed.

I was wondering what you guys think of my chances of getting into UT (Austin). I'm just talking any major, I'd transfer once i got there.  High school weighted GPA: 4.0  High School rank: I'm at private school and we don't rank. I'm in the top 17%.  Where? I live in Texas, so I'm in state.  SAT Score? 1930 Total, 1310 CR/Math   Extras that matter: National Honor Society Local Low-Budget Newspaper Writer Job with the Houston Astros     What do you think guys? Do i need to take SAT IIs? Do i need to raise that SAT score? If so to what? Any info helps!   EDIT: Honesty is the best policy. I'm not afriad of a bad answer, I would just like some honest opinions.

I got CAP.  You gotta double your EC, try a higher SAT score, but most important, you gotta get that rank up, and fast.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #2     JRo    Registered User  Posts: 47  Junior Member      May 2008       What major did you apply for?  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     theloneranger    Registered User  Posts: 1,624  Senior Member      May 2008       Okay, here's the deal: if your school does not rank, UT will simply make up a rank for you to use in your calculations. It looks like, given the fact that you have a 4.0 and are barely in the top 20%, that serious grade inflation goes on at your school. This will likely help you. I am unsure how they determine your estimated rank exactly, but I am fairly certain it does involve to some extent comparing you to other applicants from your school to UT. So if the smart kids from your school are applying to UT, it will hurt you. If they aren't, it will likely end up helping you. I like how you provided your rank and then said "my school doesn't rank." Haha, my school does the same thing. They give you an exact rank for internal use, but for college admissions certify anyone who is above a 94.0 GPA as top ten percent. I don't know if they even provide the rank of kids who aren't in the top ten percent. Obviously if your school doesn't release rank it doesn't matter if your rank goes up. It would be good for you if your grades were near the top of those kids applying to UT from your school, however. So do what you can on finals and in the first semester to get that done.  SAT IIs will not help you at UT. UT does not consider them at all. You would do well to raise your SAT score 50-100 points on CR/M. UT is introducing writing into its admissions next year from what I hear, so I don't know how that will affect the admissions formulae. Your SAT is about 50 points above the 2007 average for a non-top ten student who was admitted. But having a 1400+ will significantly increase your chances.  You don't need to double your ECs if you are giving a significant amount of time to them. How much time are you giving to the Stros and the paper? In all honesty, NHS does not matter 90% of the time. Almost every kid who applies to UT is either in NHS or has the grades to be in it. Are you an officer? Is your school's NHS one in which members make an active commitment to giving service, or is it more of an honorary society, as is the case in my school? If you are in any other clubs, try to assume leadership roles and more significant time commitments as this will help your cause significantly. Being in a bunch of clubs does not help, but showing a significant commitment to a few activities and being a leader in those activities does. Also, if you have not already done a large amount of community service, start immediately. If you have little to none done now, you may want to do as much as possible this summer. Having a paying job will take some of that burden away, but this is an often overlooked area of the resume and will have a big impact on your admission...either positively or negatively, depending on your effort and dedication.  Your essays matter almost as much as your resume (3/7 of the personal score, compared to 4/7 for the resume). So write those well, and make sure you go to multiple people for help with proofing and suggestions for change. This is the area where I think the most kids fall apart: they write them at the last minute, or they don't look for suggestions for change. As a rule, even if you are one of the better writers in your school, and are getting As in English, that does NOT mean your writing will be good compared to other UT applicants. ESPECIALLY if you try to do it at the last minute. I know a few people who have done that and been successful, but I know far more who did that and received a lovely CAP letter in March.  Good luck with your application. Coming from a nonranking school, a strong SAT and leadership will make your cause very strong. I think that if you are decent compared to the rest of the UT applicants from your school, and present a strong resume with leadership and service, you will have a strong chance for admission.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     Sedna    User Awaiting Email Confirmation  Posts: 83  Junior Member      May 2008       economics, liberal arts.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #5     theloneranger    Registered User  Posts: 1,624  Senior Member      May 2008       Also: DON'T apply to a tough major if your first goal is simply to get in to UT. It is MUCH harder to get an undeclared Liberal Arts position than it is to simply get accepted to a COLA department.  Do NOT apply to Architecture. Do NOT apply to Engineering. Do NOT apply to Communication. And God forbid, do NOT apply to Business. You are just asking for a rejection there.  Make an average-to-unpopular Liberal Arts or Natural Sciences your first or second choice, and you will have a much better chance to get in.  If you are interested in trying an unconventional route, three colleges of the university have a higher acceptance rate than is the norm: Education, Nursing, and Geosciences. If you have a suitable background to earn admission for one of those schools, you should consider applying to one. If you don't want to continue, you can transfer after your freshman year. You will just be taking area requirements freshman year anyways, so you lose nothing.  But I know a lot of strong candidates who've applied to Business first choice and Engineering second and seen themselves get CAPped.  You must be an EXCEPTIONAL candidate to get into Business or other top colleges from outside the top ten percent. And earning an undeclared spot after declaring another college your first choice has also been difficult in the past. Learn from others' mistakes and you will have a good chance to get in.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     Sedna    User Awaiting Email Confirmation  Posts: 83  Junior Member      May 2008       uh oh, I need economics first and business second...  shoot.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #7     JRo    Registered User  Posts: 47  Junior Member      May 2008       Thank you SO much for everything.

Start Apply Texas and your essays early. The biggest mistake that applicants make is procrastinating. Last minute efforts never produce your best efforts. It shocked me when I worked for UT the number of otherwise highly qualified applicants who submitted sloppy essays. More than half of all UT applicants apply during the last two weeks in November. Don't make your senior year any more stressful than it needs to be. Pick up your UT admissions guide "Your Ticket to the Forty Acres" today! 2. Assemble a small college application army. It is hard to go about your college applications alone. Especially if you are applying to more than eight universities, it can be difficult to balance deadlines, essay prompts, and application logins. Work with one or two trusted people to help with your essays like a teacher or current college student. Create a schedule and timeline to complete your applications. Parents can help juggle these responsibilities, but it is important that the application process be student-centered. 3. It's never too late to improve your college resume. Sometimes, students exiting junior year feel that they can't improve your resume. Consider spending your summer productively by working, volunteering, or participating in summer camps. There is always room for improvement. Admissions reviewers don't necessarily care what you do as long as you commit quality time to an activity or two. Do you enjoy this content? Check out my exclusive premium content at "Getting into Texas Universities." 4. Submit an expanded resume. It always surprised me when I worked for UT how few students submitted the recommended expanded (paper) resume. Apply Texas hasn't been updated in over ten years. It can be hard to include and describe all of your activities. UT allows you to submit a paper resume that can be as long as you want. Take advantage! For more resume tips, check out these posts. 5. Establish a relationship with your high school counselor. Your high school counseling staff can be a great ally in your college search and application process. They may know of scholarships, summer programs, or lesser known programs and universities that may be a great fit for you. Especially if you attend a large public high school, consider making the effort to get to know your assigned counselor. Even though they are busy, if you make an earnest effort to get to know them or help them out, it may help limit the stress of your college search. 6. Choose a first-choice major you actually want. UT admits applicants based on their choice of college or school. They do not admit students to the university. It is important to choose your major wisely because UT is making it more difficult for students to change their major at summer orientation and after you enroll. UT is trying to increase its four-year graduation rates. Major changes sometimes puts students behind. It is also important to choose and stick with your first-choice major because a major review criteria is your "fit for major." You should craft your entire application arguing why you deserve a spot in your desired program. Complete my questionnaire for a free consultation. 7.  Don't get lost in the details. Especially on Reddit and College Confidential, I see students drowning in the minutiae. They worry about marking down 45 versus 50 volunteer hours, whether to take AP Chemistry rather than honors, or minor errors they made on their essay and resume submissions. College admissions is about the big picture. Reviewers will likely spend no more than ten minutes reviewing your application. They are looking for an overall portrait of who to admit. By focusing on the details, you are guaranteeing yourself more stress. Don't overedit | resist perfectionism Students often hesitate and second-guess themselves before submitting. I sometimes receive frantic emails weeks later from students who I assumed had already completed their applications. After our third or fourth draft of detailed and intensive editing and feedback, the essays are polished and enjoyable. There may be imperfections, but they are ready to submit. Occasionally, students overedit to the point that their finished essays look substantially worse than the previous drafts. Students edit out their voice or add new information that subtracts from the overall application. Plan II Honors specifically warns against this tendency. “Take your time, but beware over-editing . . . Although you want to write with care, you should not spend weeks or months rewriting essays. There is little to gain after the third draft. Don’t delay the submission of your application to write the fourth, or fifteenth, version of your essays. Overwritten and over-edited essays are never the best essays.” 8. Focus on what you can control I dedicate a chapter to this approach in my book "Your Ticket to the Forty Acres: The Unofficial Guide for UT Undergraduate Admissions." Applicants, families, and even high school counselors focus on the wrong things. I hear about how challenging and competitive one’s school is or disbelief at how college admissions is much more selective than a generation ago. People vent about state laws they can’t control. They wish the process could be different. College admissions isn’t fair or predictable, but neither is life. Factors outside of an applicant’s control: •    The competitiveness of the other applicants in the pool •    State and federal laws •    The number of applicants for a given major •    The needs of the university •    How admissions committees measure and calculate the desirability of an applicant •    Essay topics •    The competitiveness of one’s high school •    Biographical factors like race or income •    How UT handles nonranking schools •    Preferences for in-state versus out-of-state applicants •    The mood of your reviewer This is not an exhaustive list, but you get the idea. There are many things that you cannot change. Obsessing over things like the Top 10 percent Rule or how UT doesn’t consider the competitiveness of your school takes away from focusing on the factors one can control. I find people spend way more of their time discussing what they can’t change rather than what they have some power over. It may be cathartic to complain, but you will wear thin the patience of your admissions representatives and high school counselors. Factors within your control •    Your essays •    Your expanded resume •    Who writes your recommendation letters •    Your desired majors or universities •    Where you choose to apply •    How you spend your summers and weekends •    Your academic course selection •    Engaging with admissions professionals or attending recruitment events •    Seeking out resources in your school and community •    Your activities outside of class •    When you apply •    Your attitude, effort, and expectations  9. College admissions isn't life and death At age seventeen or eighteen, undoubtedly receiving your college admissions decisions during the spring of your senior year will be the most important milestone of your life. Students often get so fixated on one school that they lose sight of the bigger picture. What seems like the most important thing in the world right now may seem less so a few years in the future. One of my favorite books on college admissions and the return on investment for a university education is Frank Bruni's "Where You Go Is Not Who You Will Be." He argues convincingly that how you approach college and why you choose your pursuits is more important than where you go. Most importantly, don't let college admissions - an uncertain, unpredictable, and often unfair process - define who you are. 10. Submit it and forget it. Once you submit your application, there is nothing to do but wait. You are going to stress yourself out going back and reading your essays and inevitably finding errors or areas of improvement. Sometimes, students ask what they can do to improve an already-submitted application. The answer? Nothing. 11. Be flexible It is important to keep an open mind to the universities you are willing and excited to attend. It matters less where you go than what you do once you arrive. There are over four thousand universities in the United States, but unfortunately the public gets fixated on the same forty or fifty that dominate rankings like US News and World Report. Especially in Texas, it is the dream of tens of thousands of students to be Longhorns. The reality is the university can admit only about 15,000 students each year enrolling a class between 7,000-8,000. You cannot control your admissions outcomes. You can control your control your attitude and outlook for the future. Interested in receiving a free admissions consultation?

UT Austin notes that the average SAT score of admitted students is 1259 out of 1600 and the average ACT score is 29. Over 73 percent of admitted students graduated in the top 10 percent of their high school class and over 90 percent graduated in the top quarter.

UT Austin GPA, SAT, and ACT Graph                 University of Texas Austin GPA, SAT Scores and ACT Scores for Admission.
Data courtesy of Cappex.   In this graph, green and blue represent accepted students. As you can see, the majority of accepted students had a GPA of B+/A- or higher, an SAT score (RW+M) above about 1100, and an ACT composite score of 22 or higher. Chances of admission improve as those numbers go up. Realize, however, that hidden beneath the blue and green on the graph is a lot of red -- some students with excellent transcripts and strong standardized test results still get rejected from the University of Texas (see the graph below for more information) Note also that a number of students were accepted with test scores and grades a bit below the norm. The University of Texas has holistic admissions , so the admissions officers are considering qualitative as well as quantitative information. Students who show some kind of interesting talent or have a compelling story to tell will often get a close look even if grades and test scores aren't quite up to the ideal. A winning essay , strong letters of recommendation , and interesting extracurricular activities are all important pieces of a successful application.

Data courtesy of Cappex   From the graph at the top of this article, you might be led to conclude that students with "A" averages and strong SAT or ACT scores are almost certain to get into the University of Texas at Austin. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Plenty of students with GPAs and standardized test scores that are on target for the university fail to be admitted. The rejection of a seemingly qualified student can be the result of many factors: lack of depth or accomplishment in extracurricular activities; failure to demonstrate leadership ability; a lack of challenging AP, IB or Honors courses; a sloppy admissions essay; and more. Also, out-of-state applicants will face a higher admissions bar than Texas students. Be sure to strengthen your application by submitting an optional activities resumé and optional letters of recommendation.

[12] Founded in 1881, its campus is located in Austin, Texas , United States , approximately one mile (1.6 km) from the Texas State Capitol . UT Austin was inducted into the Association of American Universities in 1929, becoming only the third university in the American South to be elected. The institution has the nation's eighth-largest single-campus enrollment , with over 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and over 24,000 faculty and staff. [13]  A Public Ivy , it is a major center for academic research, with research expenditures exceeding $550 million for the 2014–2015 school year. [14] The university houses seven museums and seventeen libraries, including the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum and the Blanton Museum of Art , and operates various auxiliary research facilities, such as the J. J. Pickle Research Campus and the McDonald Observatory . Among university faculty are recipients of the Nobel Prize , Pulitzer Prize , the Wolf Prize , the Emmy Award , the Turing Award , and the National Medal of Science , as well as many other awards.  UT Austin student athletes compete as the Texas Longhorns and are members of the Big 12 Conference . Its Longhorn Network is the only sports network featuring the college sports of a single university. The Longhorns have won four NCAA Division I National Football Championships, six NCAA Division I National Baseball Championships, thirteen NCAA Division I National Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, and has claimed more titles in men's and women's sports than any other school in the Big 12 since the league was founded in 1996.

Although Title 6, Article 217 of the Constitution promised to establish public education in the arts and sciences, [15] no action was taken by the Mexican government. After Texas obtained its independence from Mexico in 1836, the Texas Congress adopted the Constitution of the Republic , which, under Section 5 of its General Provisions, stated "It shall be the duty of Congress, as soon as circumstances will permit, to provide, by law, a general system of education." [16]  On April 18, 1838, "An Act to Establish the University of Texas" was referred to a special committee of the Texas Congress , but was not reported back for further action. [17] On January 26, 1839, the Texas Congress agreed to set aside fifty leagues of land—approximately 288,000 acres (117,000 ha)—towards the establishment of a publicly funded university. [18] In addition, 40 acres (16 ha) in the new capital of Austin were reserved and designated "College Hill." [1] (The term "Forty Acres" is colloquially used to refer to the University as a whole. The original 40 acres is the area from Guadalupe to Speedway and 21st Street to 24th Street. [19] )  In 1845, Texas was annexed into the United States . Interestingly, the state's Constitution of 1845 failed to mention higher education. [20] On February 11, 1858, the Seventh Texas Legislature approved O.B. 102, an act to establish the University of Texas, which set aside $100,000 in United States bonds toward construction of the state's first publicly funded university [21] (the $100,000 was an allocation from the $10 million the state received pursuant to the Compromise of 1850 and Texas's relinquishing claims to lands outside its present boundaries). The legislature also designated land reserved for the encouragement of railroad construction toward the university's endowment. On January 31, 1860, the state legislature, wanting to avoid raising taxes, passed an act authorizing the money set aside for the University of Texas to be used for frontier defense in west Texas to protect settlers from Indian attacks. [22]  Texas's secession from the Union and the American Civil War delayed repayment of the borrowed monies. At the end of the Civil War in 1865, The University of Texas's endowment was just over $16,000 in warrants [23] and nothing substantive had been done to organize the university's operations. This effort to establish a University was again mandated by Article 7, Section 10 of the Texas Constitution of 1876 which directed the legislature to "establish, organize and provide for the maintenance, support and direction of a university of the first class, to be located by a vote of the people of this State, and styled "The University of Texas." [24]  Additionally, Article 7, Section 11 of the 1876 Constitution established the Permanent University Fund , a sovereign wealth fund managed by the Board of Regents of the University of Texas and dedicated for the maintenance of the university. Because some state legislators perceived an extravagance in the construction of academic buildings of other universities, Article 7, Section 14 of the Constitution expressly prohibited the legislature from using the state's general revenue to fund construction of university buildings. Funds for constructing university buildings had to come from the university's endowment or from private gifts to the university, but the university's operating expenses could come from the state's general revenues.     The university's Old Main building in 1903    The 1876 Constitution also revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858, but dedicated 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) of land, along with other property appropriated for the university, to the Permanent University Fund. This was greatly to the detriment of the university as the lands the Constitution of 1876 granted the university represented less than 5% of the value of the lands granted to the university under the Act of 1858 (the lands close to the railroads were quite valuable, while the lands granted the university were in far west Texas, distant from sources of transportation and water). [25] The more valuable lands reverted to the fund to support general education in the state (the Special School Fund).  On April 10, 1883, the legislature supplemented the Permanent University Fund with another 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) of land in west Texas granted to the Texas and Pacific Railroad, but returned to the state as seemingly too worthless to even survey. [26] The legislature additionally appropriated $256,272.57 to repay the funds taken from the university in 1860 to pay for frontier defense and for transfers to the state's General Fund in 1861 and 1862. [27] The 1883 grant of land increased the land in the Permanent University Fund to almost 2.2 million acres. Under the Act of 1858, the university was entitled to just over 1,000 acres (400 ha) of land for every mile of railroad built in the state. Had the 1876 Constitution not revoked the original 1858 grant of land, by 1883 the university lands would have totaled 3.2 million acres, [28] so the 1883 grant was to restore lands taken from the university by the 1876 Constitution, not an act of munificence.  On March 30, 1881, the legislature set forth the university's structure and organization and called for an election to establish its location. [29] By popular election on September 6, 1881, Austin (with 30,913 votes) was chosen as the site. Galveston, having come in second in the election (20,741 votes) was designated the location of the medical department (Houston was third with 12,586 votes). [30] On November 17, 1882, on the original "College Hill," an official ceremony commemorated the laying of the cornerstone of the Old Main building. University President Ashbel Smith , presiding over the ceremony, prophetically proclaimed "Texas holds embedded in its earth rocks and minerals which now lie idle because unknown, resources of incalculable industrial utility, of wealth and power. Smite the earth, smite the rocks with the rod of knowledge and fountains of unstinted wealth will gush forth." [31] The University of Texas officially opened its doors on September 15, 1883.  Expansion and growth [ edit ]  In 1890, George Washington Brackenridge donated $18,000 for the construction of a three-story brick mess hall known as Brackenridge Hall (affectionately known as "B.Hall"), one of the university's most storied buildings and one that played an important place in university life until its demolition in 1952. [32]  The old Victorian - Gothic  Main Building served as the central point of the campus's 40-acre (16 ha) site, and was used for nearly all purposes. But by the 1930s, discussions arose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.  In 1910, George Washington Brackenridge again displayed his philanthropy, this time donating 500 acres (200 ha) on the Colorado River to the university. A vote by the regents to move the campus to the donated land was met with outrage, and the land has only been used for auxiliary purposes such as graduate student housing. Part of the tract was sold in the late-1990s for luxury housing, and there are controversial proposals to sell the remainder of the tract. The Brackenridge Field Laboratory was established on 82 acres (33 ha) of the land in 1967.     UT Architecture Library    In 1916, Gov. James E. Ferguson became involved in a serious quarrel with the University of Texas. The controversy grew out of the board of regents' refusal to remove certain faculty members whom the governor found objectionable. When Ferguson found he could not have his way, he vetoed practically the entire appropriation for the university. Without sufficient funding, the university would have been forced to close its doors. In the middle of the controversy, Ferguson's critics brought to light a number of irregularities on the part of the governor. Eventually, the Texas House of Representatives prepared 21 charges against Ferguson and the Senate convicted him on 10 of them, including misapplication of public funds and receiving $156,000 from an unnamed source. The Texas Senate removed Ferguson as governor and declared him ineligible to hold office. [33]  In 1921, the legislature appropriated $1,350,000 for the purchase of land next to the main campus. However, expansion was hampered by the restriction against using state revenues to fund construction of university buildings as set forth in Article 7, Section 14 of the Constitution. With the completion of Santa Rita No. 1 well [34] and the discovery of oil on university-owned lands in 1923, the university added significantly to its Permanent University Fund. The additional income from Permanent University Fund investments allowed for bond issues in 1931 and 1947, with the latter expansion necessary from the spike in enrollment following World War II. The university built 19 permanent structures between 1950 and 1965, when it was given the right of eminent domain . With this power, the university purchased other properties surrounding the original 40 acres (16 ha).  The discovery of oil on university-owned lands in 1923 and the subsequent addition of money to the university's Permanent University Fund allowed the legislature to address funding for the university along with the Agricultural and Mechanical College (now known as Texas A&M University ). With sufficient funds now in the Permanent University Fund to finance construction on both campuses, on April 8, 1931, the Forty Second Legislature passed H.B. 368. [35] which dedicated the Agricultural and Mechanical College a 1/3 interest in the Available University Fund, [36] the annual income from Permanent University Fund investments.  UT Austin was inducted into the Association of American Universities in 1929. [37] During World War II, the University of Texas was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. [38]  In 1950, the University of Texas was the first major university in the South to accept an African-American student. John S. Chase went on to become the first licensed African-American architect in Texas. [39]  In the fall of 1956, the first black students entered UT's undergraduate class. [40] Black students were permitted to live in campus dorms, but were barred from campus cafeterias. [40] UT integrated its facilities and desegregated its dorms in 1965. [41]  On March 6, 1967, the Sixtieth Texas Legislature changed the university's official name from "The University of Texas" to "The University of Texas at Austin" to reflect the growth of the University of Texas System . [42]  1966 shooting spree [ edit ]      The Tower , completed in 1937, stands 307 ft (94 m) tall and dons different colors of lighting on special occasions.    Main article: University of Texas tower shooting  On August 1, 1966, Texas student Charles Whitman barricaded the observation deck in the tower of the Main Building. With two rifles, a sawed-off shotgun , and other weapons, he killed 14 people on campus, 11 from the observation deck and below the clocks on the tower, and three more in the tower, as well as wounding two others inside the observation deck. The massacre ended after Whitman was shot and killed by police after they breached the tower. Before the massacre, Whitman had killed his mother and his wife. Whitman had been a patient at the University Health Center, and on March 29, preceding the shootings, had conveyed to psychiatrist Maurice Heatley his feelings of overwhelming hostilities and he was thinking about "going up on the tower with a deer rifle and start shooting people." [43]  After the Whitman event, the observation deck was closed until 1968, and then closed again in 1975 following a series of suicide jumps during the 1970s. In 1999, after installation of security fencing and other safety precautions, the tower observation deck reopened to the public. There is a turtle pond park near the tower dedicated to those affected by the tragedy.  Recent history [ edit ]  The first presidential library on a university campus was dedicated on May 22, 1971 with former President Johnson , Lady Bird Johnson and then-President Richard Nixon in attendance. Constructed on the eastern side of the main campus, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum is one of 13 presidential libraries administered by the National Archives and Records Administration .  A statue of Martin Luther King Jr. was unveiled on campus in 1999 and subsequently vandalized. [44] By 2004, John Butler , a professor at the McCombs School of Business suggested moving it to Morehouse College , a historically black college, "a place where he is loved." [44]  The University of Texas at Austin has experienced a wave of new construction recently with several significant buildings. On April 30, 2006, the school opened the Blanton Museum of Art . [45] In August 2008, the AT&T Executive Education and Conference Center opened, with the hotel and conference center forming part of a new gateway to the university. Also in 2008, Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium was expanded to a seating capacity of 100,119, making it the largest stadium (by capacity) in the state of Texas at the time.  On January 19, 2011, the university announced the creation of a 24-hour television network in partnership with ESPN , dubbed the Longhorn Network . ESPN will pay a $300 million guaranteed rights fee over 20 years to the university and to IMG College, UT Austin's multimedia rights partner. The network covers the university's intercollegiate athletics, music, cultural arts and academics programs. The channel first aired in September 2011. [46]  In May 2017, a stabbing on campus near Gregory Gym killed one and injured three. [47] A 21-year-old UT-Austin student was charged with the murder; the man had previously been involuntarily committed for psychiatric problems. [48]  Campus [ edit ]  See also: List of University of Texas at Austin buildings  The university's property totals 1,438.5 acres (582.1 ha), comprising the 423.5 acres (171.4 ha) for the Main Campus in central Austin and the J. J. Pickle Research Campus in north Austin and the other properties throughout Texas. The main campus has 150 buildings totalling over 18,000,000 square feet (1,700,000 m 2 ).     Interior lobby of the Lyndon B Johnson Presidential Library and Museum    One of the University's most visible features is the Beaux-Arts  Main Building , including a 307-foot (94 m) tower designed by Paul Philippe Cret . [49] Completed in 1937, the Main Building is in the middle of campus. The tower usually appears illuminated in white light in the evening but is lit orange for various special occasions, including athletic victories and academic accomplishments; it is conversely darkened for solemn occasions. [50] At the top of the tower is a carillon of 56 bells, the largest in Texas. Songs are played on weekdays by student carillonneurs, [51] in addition to the usual pealing of Westminster Quarters every quarter-hour between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. [52] In 1998, after the installation of security and safety measures, the observation deck reopened to the public indefinitely for weekend tours. [53]  The university's seven museums and seventeen libraries hold over nine million volumes, making it the seventh-largest academic library in the country. [54] The holdings of the university's Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center include one of only 21 remaining complete copies of the Gutenberg Bible and the first permanent photograph, View from the Window at Le Gras , taken by Nicéphore Niépce . [55] The newest museum, the 155,000-square-foot (14,400 m 2 ) Blanton Museum of Art , is the largest university art museum in the United States and hosts approximately 17,000 works from Europe, the United States, and Latin America. [56] [57]  The University of Texas at Austin has an extensive underground tunnel system that links the buildings on campus. Constructed in the 1930s under the supervision of creator Carl Eckhardt, then head of the physical plant, the tunnels have grown along with the university campus. They measure approximately six miles in length. [58] [59] The tunnel system is used for communications and utility service. It is closed to the public and guarded by silent alarms . Since the late 1940s, the university has generated its own electricity. Today its natural gas cogeneration plant has a capacity of 123 MW. The university also operates a TRIGA nuclear reactor at the J. J. Pickle Research Campus . [60] [60] [61]  The university continues to expand its facilities on campus. In 2010, the university opened the state-of-the-art Norman Hackerman building (on the site of the former Experimental Sciences Building) housing chemistry and biology research and teaching laboratories. In 2010, the university broke ground on the $120 million Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and Dell Computer Science Hall and the $51 million Belo Center for New Media, both of which are now complete. [62] [63] The new LEED gold-certified, 110,000-square-foot (10,000 m 2 ) Student Activity Center (SAC) opened in January 2011, housing study rooms, lounges and food vendors. The SAC was constructed as a result of a student referendum passed in 2006 which raised student fees by $65 per semester. [64] In 2012, the Moody Foundation awarded the College of Communication $50 million, the largest endowment any communication college has received, so naming it the Moody College of Communication.  The university operates two public radio stations, KUT with news and information, and KUTX with music, via local FM broadcasts as well as live streaming audio over the Internet. The university uses Capital Metro to provide bus transportation for students around the campus and throughout Austin.  Organization and administration [ edit ]      Battle Hall , also known as "The Old Library," was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.    The university contains eighteen colleges and schools and one academic unit, each listed with its founding date: [65]    Cockrell School of Engineering (1894)  Dell Medical School (2013)  College of Education (1905)  College of Fine Arts (1938)  College of Liberal Arts (1883)  College of Natural Sciences (1883)  College of Pharmacy  Continuing Education (1909)  Graduate Studies (1910)  Jackson School of Geosciences (2005)  LBJ School of Public Affairs (1970)  McCombs School of Business (1922)  Moody College of Communication (1965)  School of Architecture (1948)  School of Information (1948)  School of Law (1883)  School of Nursing (1976)  School of Undergraduate Studies (2008)  Steve Hicks School of Social Work (1950)    Academics [ edit ]      Proctor's  Mustangs (1948) overlooking the Engineering Sciences buildings    The University of Texas at Austin offers more than 100 undergraduate and 170 graduate degrees. In the 2009–2010 academic year, the university awarded a total of 13,215 degrees: 67.7% bachelor's degrees , 22.0% master's degrees, 6.4% doctoral degrees , and 3.9% Professional degrees. [66]  In addition, the university has eight honors programs , seven of which span a variety of academic fields: Liberal Arts Honors, the Business Honors Program, the Turing Scholars Program in Computer Science, Engineering Honors, the Dean's Scholars Program in Natural Sciences, the Health Science Scholars Program in Natural Sciences, and the Polymathic Scholars Program in Natural Sciences. The eighth is the Plan II Honors Program, a rigorous interdisciplinary program that is a major in and of itself. [67] Many Plan II students pursue a second major, often participating in another department's honors program in addition to Plan II. [68] The university also offers innovative programs for promoting academic excellence and leadership development such as the Freshman Research Initiative and Texas Interdisciplinary Plan. [69]  Admission [ edit ]  The University of Texas at Austin is one of the most selective universities in the region. Relative to other universities in the state of Texas, UT Austin is second to Rice University in selectivity according to a Business Journal study weighing acceptance rates and the mid-range of the SAT and ACT. UT Austin was ranked as the 18th most selective in the South. [70] As a state public university, UT Austin was subject to Texas House Bill 588 , which guaranteed graduating Texas high school seniors in the top 10% of their class admission to any public Texas university. A new state law granting UT (but no other state university) a partial exemption from the top 10% rule, Senate Bill 175, was passed by the 81st Legislature in 2009. It modified this admissions policy by limiting automatically admitted freshmen to 75% of the entering in-state freshman class, starting in 2011. The university will admit the top one percent, the top two percent and so forth until the cap is reached; the university currently admits the top 7 percent. [71] Furthermore, students admitted under Texas House Bill 588 are not guaranteed their choice of college or major, but rather only guaranteed admission to the university as a whole. Many colleges, such as the Cockrell School of Engineering, have secondary requirements that must be met for admission. [72]  For others who go through the traditional application process, selectivity is deemed "more selective" according to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and by U.S. News & World Report . [73] [74] For Fall 2017, 51,033 applied and 18,620 were accepted (36.5%), and of those accepted, 45.2% enrolled. [75] Among freshman students who enrolled in Fall 2017, SAT scores for the middle 50% ranged from 570–690 for critical reading and 600–710 for math. [75]  ACT composite scores for the middle 50% ranged from 26 to 31. [75] In terms of class rank, 74.4% of enrolled freshmen were in the top 10% of their high school classes and 91.7% ranked in the top quarter. [75]  Rankings [ edit ]    University rankings    National    ARWU [76]  30    Forbes [77]  91    U.S. News & World Report [78]  56    Washington Monthly [79]  70    Global    ARWU [80]  51    QS [81]  67    Times [82]  50    U.S. News & World Report [83]  30    UT Austin is consistently ranked among the country's top public universities. Nationally, UT Austin was ranked tied for 56th among all universities, and tied for 18th place among public universities, according to U.S. News & World Report ' s 2017 rankings. [84] Internationally, UT Austin was ranked 30th in the 2017 "Best Global Universities" ranking by U.S. News & World Report , tied for 44th in the world by Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) in 2016, 46th worldwide by Times Higher Education World University Rankings (2015–16), and 67th globally by QS World University Rankings (2016–17).  UT Austin is considered to be a " Public Ivy "—a public university that provides an Ivy League collegiate experience at a public school price, having been ranked in virtually every list of "Public Ivies" since Richard Moll coined the term in his 1985 book Public Ivies: A Guide to America's best public undergraduate colleges and universities . The seven other "Public Ivy" universities, according to Moll, were The College of William & Mary, Miami University, The University of California, The University of Michigan, The University of North Carolina, The University of Vermont, and The University of Virginia. [85]  In its 2016 edition of college rankings, U.S. News & World Report ranked the Accounting and Latin American History programs as the top in the nation and more than 50 other science, humanities and professional programs rank in the top 25 nationally. [84] The College of Pharmacy is listed as the third best in the nation and The School of Information (iSchool) is sixth best in Library and Information Sciences. [84] Among other rankings, the School of Social Work is 7th, the Jackson School of Geosciences is 8th for Earth Sciences, the Cockrell School of Engineering is tied for 10th-best (with the undergraduate engineering program tied for 11th-best in the country), the Nursing School is tied for 13th, the University of Texas School of Law is 14th, the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs is 16th, and the McCombs School of Business is tied for 16th-best (with the undergraduate business program tied for 7th-best in the country). [84]  The University of Texas School of Architecture was ranked second among national undergraduate programs in 2012. [86]  A 2005 Bloomberg survey ranked the school 5th among all business schools and first among public business schools for the largest number of alumni who are S&P 500 CEOs. [87] Similarly, a 2005 USA Today report ranked the university as "the number one source of new Fortune 1000 CEOs." [88] A "payback" analysis published by SmartMoney in 2011 comparing graduates' salaries to tuition costs concluded the school was the second-best value of all colleges in the nation, behind only Georgia Tech . [89] [90] A 2013 College Database study found UT was 22nd in the nation in terms of increased lifetime earnings by graduates. [91]  Research [ edit ]     Harlan J. Smith Telescope    For the 2014-2015 cycle, the university was awarded over $580,000,000 in sponsored projects, [92] [93] and has earned more than 300 patents since 2003. [94] UT Austin houses the Office of Technology Commercialization, a technology transfer center which serves as the bridge between laboratory research and commercial development. In 2009, UT Austin created nine new start-up companies to commercialize technology developed at the university and has created 46 start-ups in the past seven years. UT Austin license agreements generated $10.9 million in revenue for the university in 2009. [94]  Research at UT Austin is largely focused in the engineering and physical sciences, [95] and the university is a world-leading research institution in fields such as computer science. [96] Energy is a major research thrust, with federally funded projects on biofuels, [97] battery and solar cell technology, and geological carbon dioxide storage, [98] water purification membranes, among others. In 2009, UT Austin founded the Energy Institute, led by former Under Secretary for Science Raymond L. Orbach , to organize and advance multi-disciplinary energy research. [99] While the university does not have a medical school, it houses medical programs associated with other campuses and allied health professional programs, as well as major research programs in pharmacy, biomedical engineering, neuroscience, and others.  In 2010, UT Austin opened the $100 million Dell Pediatric Research Institute to increase medical research at the university and establish a medical research complex, and associated medical school, in Austin. [100] [101]  UT Austin operates several major auxiliary research centers. The world's third-largest telescope, the Hobby–Eberly Telescope , and three other large telescopes are part of UT Austin's McDonald Observatory , 450 miles (720 km) west of Austin. [102] [103] The university manages nearly 300 acres (120 ha) of biological field laboratories, including the Brackenridge Field Laboratory in Austin. The Center for Agile Technology focuses on software development challenges. [104] The J.J. Pickle Research Campus (PRC) is home to the Texas Advanced Computing Center which operates the Ranger supercomputer, one of the world's most powerful supercomputers [105] as well as the Microelectronics Research Center which houses micro- and nanoelectronics research and features a 15,000 square foot (1,400 m 2 ) cleanroom for device fabrication.  Founded in 1946, UT Austin's Applied Research Laboratories at the PRC has developed or tested the vast majority of the Navy's high-frequency sonar equipment. In 2007, the Navy granted it a research contract funded up to $928 million over ten years. [106] [107] The Institute for Advanced Technology, founded in 1990 and located in the West Pickle Research Building, supports the U.S. Army with basic and applied research in several fields.  The Center for Transportation Research UT Austin is a nationally recognized research institution focusing on transportation research, education, and public service. Established in 1963 as the Center for Highway Research, its projects address virtually all aspects of transportation, including economics, multimodal systems, traffic congestion relief, transportation policy, materials, structures, transit, environmental impacts, driver behavior, land use, geometric design, accessibility, and pavements. [108]  In 2013, UT Austin announced the naming of the O'Donnell Building for Applied Computational Engineering and Sciences. The O'Donnell Foundation of Dallas, headed by Peter O'Donnell and his wife, Edith Jones O'Donnell, has given more than $135 million to UT Austin between 1983 and 2013. UT Austin President William C. Powers declared the O'Donnells "among the greatest supporters of the University of Texas in its 130-year history. Their transformative generosity is based on the belief in our power to change society for the better." [109] In 2008, O'Donnell pledged $18 million to finance the hiring of UT Austin faculty members undertaking research in mathematics, computers, and multiple scientific disciplines; his pledge was matched by W. A. "Tex" Moncrief Jr., an oilman and philanthropist from Fort Worth . [110]  Endowment [ edit ]     The Norman Hackerman Building    Main article: Permanent University Fund  Thirty percent of the university's endowment comes from Permanent University Fund (PUF), with nearly $15 billion in assets as of 2007. [111] the University of Texas System gets two-thirds of the Available University Fund , the annual distribution of PUF income. A regental policy [112] requires at least 45 percent of this money go to the university for "program enrichment." By taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent, we get 30 percent which is the minimum amount of AUF income that can be distributed to the school under current policies. The Regents, however, can decide to allocate additional amounts to the university. Also, the majority of the University of Texas system share of the AUF is used for its debt service bonds , some of which were issued for the benefit of the Austin campus. [113] The Regents can change the 45 percent minimum of the University of Texas System share to goes to the Austin campus at any time, although doing so might be difficult politically.  Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of PUF. At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas' two university systems, the University of Texas System and the Texas A&M University System ; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10 percent of the universities' annual budgets. This has challenged the universities to increase sponsored research and private donations. Privately funded endowments contribute over $2 billion to the university's total endowment.  Student life [ edit ]  Student profile [ edit ]  For Fall 2011, the university enrolled 38,437 undergraduate, 11,497 graduate and 1,178 law students. [114] Out-of-state and international students comprised 9.1% of the undergraduate student body and 20.1% of the total student body, with students from all 50 states and more than 120 foreign countries—most notably, the Republic of Korea , followed by the People's Republic of China, India, Mexico , and Taiwan . [115] For Fall 2015, the undergraduate student body was 48.9% male and 51.1% female. [114] The three largest undergraduate majors in 2009 were Biological Sciences, Unspecified Business, and Psychology, while the three largest graduate majors were Business Administration ( MBA ), Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Pharmacy ( PharmD ). [115]    + Demographics of the UT Austin student body – Fall 2015 [116] [117]  Undergraduate  Graduate  Texas  U.S. Census    African American  4%  3.0%  12.6%  12.9%    Asian American  23%  7.2%  4.4%  4.6%    Non-Hispanic White  45%  53.0%  45.3%  65.1%    Hispanic American  21%  10.0%  37.6%  15.8%    Native American  1%  0.2%  1.3%  1.0%    Foreign  4%  22.4%  N/A  N/A    Residential life [ edit ]  The campus has fourteen residence halls, the newest of which opened in Spring 2007. On-campus housing can hold more than 7,100 students. [118]  Jester Center is the largest residence hall with its capacity of 2,945. [119] Academic enrollment exceeds the on-campus housing capacity; as a result, most students must live in private residence halls, housing cooperatives , apartments, or with Greek organizations and other off-campus residences. The Division of Housing and Food Service, which already has the largest market share of 7,000 of the estimated 27,000 beds in the campus area, plans to expand to 9,000 beds. [120]  Student organizations [ edit ]  The university recognizes more than 1,300 student organizations. [121] [122] In addition, it supports three official student governance organizations that represent student interests to faculty, administrators, and the Texas Legislature. Student Government, established in 1902, is the oldest governance organization and represents student interests in general. [123] The Senate of College Councils represents students in academic affairs and coordinates the college councils, [124] and the Graduate Student Assembly represents graduate student interests. [125] The University Unions Student Events Center serves as the hub for student activities on campus. [126] The Friar Society serves as the oldest honor society at the university. [127] Texas Orange Jackets , founded in 1923, is the oldest women's honorary service organization on campus and empowers young women leaders to serve the campus and community. Texas 4000 for Cancer is another student organization, which also doubles as an Austin-based nonprofit, that hosts a 4,500-mile bike ride from Austin, Texas to Anchorage, Alaska, thus far raising over $5 million for cancer research and patient support services since its inception in 2004. [128]  Greek life [ edit ]  See also: List of fraternities and sororities at University of Texas at Austin  The University of Texas at Austin is home to an active Greek community. Approximately 14 percent of undergraduate students are in fraternities or sororities. [129] With more than 65 national chapters, the university's Greek community is one of the nation's largest. [129] These chapters are under the authority of one of the school's six Greek council communities, Interfraternity Council , National Pan-Hellenic Council , Texas Asian Pan-Hellenic Council, Latino Pan-Hellenic Council, Multicultural Greek Council and University Panhellenic Council. [130] Other registered student organizations also name themselves with Greek letters and are called affiliates. They are not a part of one of the six councils but have all of the same privileges and responsibilities of any other organization. [131] Most Greek houses are west of the Drag in the West Campus neighborhood.  Media [ edit ]  See also: Texas Student Media  Students express their opinions in and out of class through periodicals including Study Breaks magazine, Longhorn Life, The Daily Texan (the most award-winning daily college newspaper in the United States), [132] and the Texas Travesty . Over the airwaves students' voices are heard through Texas Student Television ( K29HW-D ) and KVRX Radio.  The Computer Writing and Research Lab of the university's Department of Rhetoric and Writing also hosts the Blogora , a blog for "connecting rhetoric, rhetorical methods and theories, and rhetoricians with public life" by the Rhetoric Society of America . [133]  Traditions [ edit ]     The "Silver Spurs" with the university's mascot, Bevo    Traditions at the University of Texas are perpetuated through several school symbols and mediums. At athletic events, students frequently sing " Texas Fight ", the university's fight song while displaying the Hook 'em Horns hand gesture—the gesture mimicking the horns of the school's mascot, Bevo the Texas Longhorn .  Athletics [ edit ]  Main article: Texas Longhorns  The University of Texas offers a wide variety of varsity and intramural sports programs. As of 2015, the university's athletics program ranked ninth in the nation among Division I schools according to the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics . [134] Due to the breadth of sports offered and the quality of the programs, Texas was selected as "America's Best Sports College" in a 2002 analysis by Sports Illustrated . [135] Texas was also listed as the number one Collegiate Licensing Company client for the second consecutive year in regards to the amount of annual trademark royalties received from fan merchandise sales. But this ranking is based only on clients of the Collegiate Licensing Company, which does not handle licensing for approximately three-dozen large schools including Ohio State , USC , and UCLA . [136] [137]  Varsity sports [ edit ]      Texas Longhorns football playing against Oklahoma in the 2007 Red River Rivalry    The university's men's and women's athletics teams are nicknamed the Longhorns. A charter member of the Southwest Conference until it dissolved in 1996, Texas now competes in the Big 12 Conference of the NCAA's Division I-FBS . Texas has won 50 total national championships, [138] 42 of which are NCAA national championships. [139]  The University of Texas has traditionally been considered a college football powerhouse. [140] [141] [142] Through the 2015 season, the Longhorns were ranked seventh in the all-time list for winning percentage and third all time for total wins. [143] The team experienced its greatest success under coach Darrell Royal , winning three national championships in 1963, 1969, and 1970. It won a fourth title under head coach Mack Brown in 2005 after a 41–38 victory over previously undefeated Southern California in the 2006 Rose Bowl .  In recent years, the men's basketball team has gained prominence, advancing to the NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen in 2002 and 2004, the Elite Eight in 2006 and 2008, and the Final Four in 2003.  The University's baseball team is one of the nation's best. It has made more trips to the College World Series (35) than any other school, and it posted wins in 1949, 1950, 1975, 1983, 2002, and 2005. [144]  Additionally, the university's highly successful men's and women's swimming and diving teams lay claim to sixteen NCAA Division I titles, with the men's team having 13 of those titles, more than any other division 1 team has. [145] The swim team was first developed under Coach Tex Robertson . [146] In particular, the men's team is led by Eddie Reese , who served as the men's head coach at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, the 2004 Games in Athens and the 2008 Games in Beijing.  People [ edit ]  Faculty [ edit ]  Main article: List of University of Texas at Austin faculty  In the Fall of 2016, the school employed 3,128 full-time faculty members, with a student-to-faculty ratio of 18.86 to 1.

Published on August 24, 2015 at 1:11 am  Last update on August 24, 2015 at 4:57 am  By Marisa Charpentier , Cat Cardenas   After loading up your car for move-in day, your parents probably flooded you with college advice between the goodbye tears. While they might be able offer advice about laundry and money management, it’s been a few years since they’ve hit the books. Here’s the real skinny on how to traverse freshman year from actual UT students.   Class Tips  • Check out sites such as MyEdu and Rate My Professors when class registration comes up again. Knowing how different teachers grade, how their classes are structured and how easy other students thought the course was will help you find the right class.  • Don’t stress if your grades aren’t what they were in high school. College is more difficult, especially when you are adjusting to a new environment and different teaching techniques. If you need extra help, check out the free tutoring available at Sanger Learning Center. Each student gets five free one-on-one sessions each semester, and drop-in tutoring is free for all students.  • UT offers more than 450 different study abroad programs. Visit the study abroad website to find programs in your major, and visit the Study Abroad Fair on Wednesday, Sept. 9 at Gregory Plaza.   @thedailytexan If you're not a morning person don't schedule 8am classes. #KnowThyself — Rob-T (@RRTorres73) August 20, 2015    Dorm Life  • Make your overly-cramped dorm an excuse to explore the city. With a different festival or event going on every weekend, you’ll almost always have something to do. From poetry slams, comedy, improv and concerts, there’s something here for everyone.  • Don’t lose your key or student ID or forget it in your room. UT will start charging you after the fourth time.  • The Freshmen Fifteen is real, so be careful with your meals. Try to make your own food in the morning so you can save your Dine In dollars and Bevo Bucks for lunch and dinner. Be sure to check which on-campus dining places take Bevo Bucks and which take Dine In Dollars because your money can run out quickly.  • Be aware of campus dining schedules. They’re not all the same, and nothing’s more disappointing than walking across campus with an empty stomach to a closed dining hall.  • If you’re planning on moving off campus in the future, plan early. West campus is a prime location for student living, and people start signing leases for the following year as early as October.   @thedailytexan  @UTHousing Bring silverware — Joy Puder (@JoyPuder) August 20, 2015     Connecting to Campus  • Check out the organization fairs throughout the year. Party on the Plaza, an event where students promote their organizations, takes place Sept. 2 at the Gregory Gym Plaza. UT has over 1,100 student organizations. Attending information sessions and trying out different clubs is a guaranteed way to make friends.  • If you don’t find one you like, start your own. Check out the full list of student organizations on HornsLink.  • Understand that no one has friends during Moov-In week. Reach out to classmates online and in person. Campus Facebook groups can be helpful for finding people who share similar interests, hear about cool events on and off campus and buy and sell items you might need throughout the year. And don’t be afraid to befriend upperclassmen, too.   @thedailytexan make friends in your classes and study with them! — Carter Smith (@CarterSaucy) August 22, 2015    Health & Safety  • Don’t pull consecutive all-nighters. Every once in a while might work depending on your needs, but sleep is a must.  • Use the University Health Center ­— appointments are usually only $10. If you are having health issues or feel like you need to talk to someone, the faculty is always there to listen.  • Set aside time to chill. Between classes, take a break in the Union recliners or nap on the second floor of the SAC.  • Anxiety is the number one mental health concern college students face. Don’t brush it off. If you can’t talk to a friend or family member about it, visit UT’s Mental Health Center or, if it’s urgent, call CMHC’s Crisis Helpline at (512) 471-3515. The services are confidential and great when you need to let college or life stress off your chest.  • If you go to parties, you should always have someone you can count on to be there with you. If things get weird or you’re ready to leave, you won’t have to head out into the Austin streets alone.       View the discussion thread.

The ads emphasize how the university and Austin together forge a dynamic, creative and diverse community that few American cities can match. Screen shot of Tower and view of Austin's skyline from Town Lake in Soul video The 30-second spots were produced in conjunction with the strategic planning and positioning firm GSD&M Advertising. The series incorporates a new theme, "What Starts Here Changes the World," developed by the university's Office of Public Affairs and the Center for Brand Research in concert with GSD&M, in a year-long project led by Advertising Professors Neal Burns and Deborah Morrison. "Austin, Texas is the 'City of Ideas'—a city that brings the doers and dreamers together to see new things, dream new dreams and create things and experiences that make a difference," said Roy Spence, founder and president of GSD&M Advertising. "The heartbeat of this City of Ideas is the University of Texas, a place of learning, discovery, leadership, freedom and responsibility, where everyone is a student of both our proud heritage as well as a seeker of what is next. The University of Texas and the City of Ideas, working, living and learning together. What starts here changes the world—that is what this new campaign for the University of Texas is all about." "What starts here at UT is an amazing array of life-altering events," said Morrison, associate professor of advertising. "Certainly, this theme speaks to that energy and optimism." Air time for the ad spots, which typically are broadcast during televised NCAA sporting events, is provided to the participating universities free of charge. http://www.utexas.edu/what-starts-here                    0:31   Play next Play now        What Starts Here Changes The World - Breakfast Tacos - Duration: 31 seconds.

This makes UT Austin Strongly Competitive for GPAs.   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.
    
    This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.)  With a GPA of 3.75, UT Austin
      
      requires you to be above average in your high school class. You'll need a mix of A's and B's, with a leaning toward A's. If you took some AP or IB classes, this will help boost your weighted GPA and show your ability to take college classes.  If you're a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change from this point on. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.75, you'll need a higher SAT score to compensate and show that you're prepared to take on college academics. This will help you compete effectively with other applicants.    Admissions Rate: 40%   The acceptance rate at UT Austin is 40% . In other words, of 100 students who apply, 40 are admitted.   This means the school is somewhat selective . You should prepare your academic scores well, but you have an excellent chance if you impress them.    Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is moderately selective, strong academic performance will almost guarantee you admission . Scoring at a 1904 SAT or above will already give you a great shot at getting in. Scoring a 2070 will nearly guarantee you admission, given that your GPA is roughly the average of 3.75.

While there are a lot of pieces that go into a college application, you should focus on only a few critical things:   GPA requirements  Testing requirements, including SAT and ACT requirements  Application requirements   In this guide we'll cover what you need to get into UT Austin and build a strong application.  School location: Austin, TX  This school is also known as: University of Texas at Austin       Admissions Rate: 40%   If you want to get in, the first thing to look at is the acceptance rate. This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.  The acceptance rate at UT Austin is 40% . For every 100 applicants, 40 are admitted.    This means the school is moderately selective . The school expects you to meet their requirements for GPA and SAT/ACT scores, but they're more flexible than other schools. If you exceed their requirements, you have an excellent chance of getting in. But if you don't, you might be one of the unlucky minority that gets a rejection letter.   UT Austin GPA Requirements  Many schools specify a minimum GPA requirement, but this is often just the bare minimum to submit an application without immediately getting rejected.  The GPA requirement that really matters is the GPA you need for a real chance of getting in. For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.   Average GPA: 3.75   The average GPA at UT Austin is 3.75 .   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.
          
          This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.)  With a GPA of 3.75, UT Austin
	  
	  requires you to be above average in your high school class. You'll need at least a mix of A's and B's, with more A's than B's. You can compensate for a lower GPA with harder classes, like AP or IB classes. This will show that you're able to handle more difficult academics than the average high school student.  If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.75, you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate . This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you.   SAT and ACT Requirements   Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.   You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to UT Austin. More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. UT Austin SAT Requirements  Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.   Average SAT: 1350 (Old: 1904)   The average SAT score composite at UT Austin is a 1350 on the 1600 SAT scale.  On the old 2400 SAT , this corresponds to an average SAT score of 1904 .  This score makes UT Austin Moderately Competitive for SAT test scores.    UT Austin SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)  The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1240, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1450. In other words, a 1240 on the New SAT places you below average, while a 1450 will move you up to above average .  For students looking to make the move from the Houston area to Austin, the SAT and ACT can be formidable obstacles, but with our guide to tutoring in Houston , we can help you overcome them. Here's the breakdown of new SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 670 620 740  Reading 33 31 36  Writing 34 31 36  Composite 1350 1240 1450     UT Austin SAT Score Analysis (Old 2400 SAT)  The 25th percentile Old SAT score is 1730, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 2070. In other words, a 1730 on the Old SAT places you below average, while a 2070 puts you well above average .  Here's the breakdown of old SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 655 600 710  Reading 628 570 680  Writing 621 560 680  Composite 1904 1730 2070    SAT Score Choice Policy  The Score Choice policy at your school is an important part of your testing strategy.  UT Austin has the Score Choice policy of "Contact School."  This means that the school wants you to contact them to learn more about their Score Choice policies.

Download our free guide on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve your score. This guide was written by Harvard graduates and SAT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 UT Austin ACT Requirements  Just like for the SAT, UT Austin likely doesn't have a hard ACT cutoff, but if you score too low, your application will get tossed in the trash.   Average ACT: 29   The average ACT score at UT Austin is 29. This score makes UT Austin Moderately Competitive for ACT scores.   The 25th percentile ACT score is 26, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 31.  Even though UT Austin likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 26 or below, you'll have a very hard time getting in, unless you have something else very impressive in your application. There are so many applicants scoring 29 and above that a 26 will look academically weak.  ACT Score Sending Policy  If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.  Here it is: when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send. You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.  This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 29 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.  ACT Superscore Policy  By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.  We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to UT Austin, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 29.    Studying for the ACT instead?

This guide was written by Harvard graduates and ACT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                SAT/ACT Writing Section Requirements  Both the SAT and ACT have a Writing section that includes an essay.  UT Austin requires you to take the SAT/ACT Writing section . They'll use this as another factor in their admissions consideration.   SAT Subject Test Requirements  Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.  We did not find information that UT Austin requires SAT subject tests, and so most likely it does not . At least 6 months before applying, you should still doublecheck just to make sure, so you have enough time to take the test.    Our Expert's Notes   We did more detailed research into this school and found the following information.   Enrolling students with SAT Writing scores between 600 and 800 and ACT writing scores of 26 or higher earn credit for freshman English (RHE 306) at UT Austin. Additionally, certain majors in Engineering, Geosciences, and Natural Sciences have a "calculus readiness requirement," which can be fulfilled in multiple ways including getting at least a 600 on SAT Math or a 26 on ACT Math. More on the calculus readiness requirement here.   Source        Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is moderately selective, strong academic performance will almost guarantee you admission . Scoring a 2070 SAT or a 31 ACT or above will nearly guarantee you admission. Because the school admits 40% of all applicants, being far above average raises the admission rate for you to nearly 100%.  If you can achieve a high SAT/ACT score, the rest of your application essentially doesn't matter. You still need to meet the rest of the application requirements, and your GPA shouldn't be too far off from the school average of 3.75. But you won't need dazzling extracurriculars and breathtaking letters of recommendation to get in. You can get in based on the merits of your score alone.  But if your score is a 1730 SAT or a 26 ACT and below, you have a good chance of being one of the unlucky few to be rejected.

While there are a lot of pieces that go into a college application, you should focus on only a few critical things:   GPA requirements  Testing requirements, including SAT and ACT requirements  Application requirements   In this guide we'll cover what you need to get into UT Austin and build a strong application.  School location: Austin, TX  This school is also known as: University of Texas at Austin       Admissions Rate: 40%   If you want to get in, the first thing to look at is the acceptance rate. This tells you how competitive the school is and how serious their requirements are.  The acceptance rate at UT Austin is 40% . For every 100 applicants, 40 are admitted.    This means the school is moderately selective . The school expects you to meet their requirements for GPA and SAT/ACT scores, but they're more flexible than other schools. If you exceed their requirements, you have an excellent chance of getting in. But if you don't, you might be one of the unlucky minority that gets a rejection letter.   UT Austin GPA Requirements  Many schools specify a minimum GPA requirement, but this is often just the bare minimum to submit an application without immediately getting rejected.  The GPA requirement that really matters is the GPA you need for a real chance of getting in. For this, we look at the school's average GPA for its current students.   Average GPA: 3.75   The average GPA at UT Austin is 3.75 .   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.
          
          This school did not officially report its average GPA, but we've estimated it here using data from over 1,000 schools.)  With a GPA of 3.75, UT Austin
	  
	  requires you to be above average in your high school class. You'll need at least a mix of A's and B's, with more A's than B's. You can compensate for a lower GPA with harder classes, like AP or IB classes. This will show that you're able to handle more difficult academics than the average high school student.  If you're currently a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change in time for college applications. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.75, you'll need a higher SAT or ACT score to compensate . This will help you compete effectively against other applicants who have higher GPAs than you.   SAT and ACT Requirements   Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Most schools require the SAT or ACT, and many also require SAT subject tests.   You must take either the SAT or ACT to submit an application to UT Austin. More importantly, you need to do well to have a strong application. UT Austin SAT Requirements  Many schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.   Average SAT: 1350 (Old: 1904)   The average SAT score composite at UT Austin is a 1350 on the 1600 SAT scale.  On the old 2400 SAT , this corresponds to an average SAT score of 1904 .  This score makes UT Austin Moderately Competitive for SAT test scores.    UT Austin SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)  The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1240, and the 75th percentile New SAT score is 1450. In other words, a 1240 on the New SAT places you below average, while a 1450 will move you up to above average .  For students looking to make the move from the Houston area to Austin, the SAT and ACT can be formidable obstacles, but with our guide to tutoring in Houston , we can help you overcome them. Here's the breakdown of new SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 670 620 740  Reading 33 31 36  Writing 34 31 36  Composite 1350 1240 1450     UT Austin SAT Score Analysis (Old 2400 SAT)  The 25th percentile Old SAT score is 1730, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 2070. In other words, a 1730 on the Old SAT places you below average, while a 2070 puts you well above average .  Here's the breakdown of old SAT scores by section:    Section Average 25th Percentile 75th Percentile    Math 655 600 710  Reading 628 570 680  Writing 621 560 680  Composite 1904 1730 2070    SAT Score Choice Policy  The Score Choice policy at your school is an important part of your testing strategy.  UT Austin has the Score Choice policy of "Contact School."  This means that the school wants you to contact them to learn more about their Score Choice policies.

Download our free guide on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve your score. This guide was written by Harvard graduates and SAT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 UT Austin ACT Requirements  Just like for the SAT, UT Austin likely doesn't have a hard ACT cutoff, but if you score too low, your application will get tossed in the trash.   Average ACT: 29   The average ACT score at UT Austin is 29. This score makes UT Austin Moderately Competitive for ACT scores.   The 25th percentile ACT score is 26, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 31.  Even though UT Austin likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 26 or below, you'll have a very hard time getting in, unless you have something else very impressive in your application. There are so many applicants scoring 29 and above that a 26 will look academically weak.  ACT Score Sending Policy  If you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.  Here it is: when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send. You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.  This means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 29 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.  ACT Superscore Policy  By and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.  We weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to UT Austin, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 29.    Studying for the ACT instead?

This guide was written by Harvard graduates and ACT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                SAT/ACT Writing Section Requirements  Both the SAT and ACT have a Writing section that includes an essay.  UT Austin requires you to take the SAT/ACT Writing section . They'll use this as another factor in their admissions consideration.   SAT Subject Test Requirements  Schools vary in their SAT subject test requirements. Typically, selective schools tend to require them, while most schools in the country do not.  We did not find information that UT Austin requires SAT subject tests, and so most likely it does not . At least 6 months before applying, you should still doublecheck just to make sure, so you have enough time to take the test.    Our Expert's Notes   We did more detailed research into this school and found the following information.   Enrolling students with SAT Writing scores between 600 and 800 and ACT writing scores of 26 or higher earn credit for freshman English (RHE 306) at UT Austin. Additionally, certain majors in Engineering, Geosciences, and Natural Sciences have a "calculus readiness requirement," which can be fulfilled in multiple ways including getting at least a 600 on SAT Math or a 26 on ACT Math. More on the calculus readiness requirement here.   Source        Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is moderately selective, strong academic performance will almost guarantee you admission . Scoring a 2070 SAT or a 31 ACT or above will nearly guarantee you admission. Because the school admits 40% of all applicants, being far above average raises the admission rate for you to nearly 100%.  If you can achieve a high SAT/ACT score, the rest of your application essentially doesn't matter. You still need to meet the rest of the application requirements, and your GPA shouldn't be too far off from the school average of 3.75. But you won't need dazzling extracurriculars and breathtaking letters of recommendation to get in. You can get in based on the merits of your score alone.  But if your score is a 1730 SAT or a 26 ACT and below, you have a good chance of being one of the unlucky few to be rejected.         Admissions Calculator    What are your chances of admission at University of Texas at Austin?   Chances of admission with these scores:   Here's our custom admissions calculator. Plug in your numbers to see what your chances of getting in are. Pick your test: Old SAT  New SAT  ACT    SAT Score      Your GPA       Note: Your admission decision relies not only on your GPA and SAT/ACT scores, but also on your coursework difficulty, extracurriculars, letters of recommendation, and personal statements. This tool provides only a simplistic estimate of your chances of admission. Instead of treating this tool as a crystal ball, we recommend you consider the big picture of what your chance means:  80-100%: Safety school: Strong chance of getting in  50-80%: More likely than not getting in  20-50%: Lower but still good chance of getting in  5-20%: Reach school: Unlikely to get in, but still have a shot  0-5%: Hard reach school: Very difficult to get in  We recommend you apply to schools across a range of chances. Applying to some safety schools will guarantee you have a college to go to, while applying to some reach schools will give you a shot at getting into the school at the top of your range.

Also, make sure to consult the page of extra requirements for programs like Engineering, Nursing, and Fine Arts. For the Honors Programs (available in Business, Engineering, Liberal Arts, Natural Sciences, and the Plan II program), you must submit both the regular UT application as well as an honors application by the December 1st deadline.

If so you are obviously in the top 10% of your class, so yes you will be admitted the UT.  However if you aren't in-state, then you are most likely going to be rejected from UT. Competition is extremely fierce for in state students. OOS admissions is a whole other ballgame. I had the same ACT score as you and a higher GPA a(nd was in-state +URM), but I got CAP admission (which is basically rejected).   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     bellabiology99    Registered User  Posts: 43  Junior Member      January 2017       I'm out of state :(   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     KingBibi    Registered User  Posts: 231  Junior Member      January 2017       Well, what state are you in?

As I said earlier, I'd cross off the UCs if you can't afford them; they won't give you aid. Michigan is as likely to reject you as it is to accept you, though if you do get in and can pay what they're asking then I'd jump on it. And don't discount either Loyola or ASU -- that's free money they're offering you!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #9     bellabiology99    Registered User  Posts: 43  Junior Member      January 2017       So you think UT is out of the question as well?

The average ACT of the College of Natural Sciences is a 30... neuroscience is even more competitive than that.  Your chances are very slim if getting accepted into neuroscience because you're an out of state student with a low ACT, comparatively.  Can you afford 53k/year? If not, you shouldn't be applying to UT Austin.

Jmarza    Registered User  Posts: 4  New Member      February 2017   in The University of Texas at Austin      Hello! I just wanted to get some insight into what my chances look like for getting into UT-Austin, as I am starting to narrow down my college list. I am a female, hispanic, and will be the first person in my family to go to college in the United Sates. I go to a very competitive high school, nevertheless my GPA is still average and I am counting on my SAT scores and AP classes to make up for it. Here are my scores and extra curricular activities:  GPA: 4.45/5.0 SAT: 1480/1600 AP Classes: 8 Class Rank: 296/691  Extracurriculars: Club and School Sports VP of National Hispanic Honors Society National Honors Society National Hispanic Recognition Program Qualifier Robotics (Marketing Team) I also work with a non profit organization, and make videos for their website. And I am thinking about applying to the UT Research Program this summer.  I have been looking into applying to the College of Natural Science. I have tried to do some research, but I am getting very mixed answers, which is fair considering that the admissions process is different for everyone. Is there any chance that I might get in? Or should I consider this a reach school. Input is greatly appreciated thank you so much!!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook      Replies to: What are the chances that I will get into UT-Austin?       #1     ucbalumnus    Registered User  Posts: 66,851  Senior Member      February 2017    edited February 2017        http://www.collegedata.com/cs/data/college/college_pg02_tmpl.jhtml?schoolId=788 shows that rank is very important and GPA is not considered by UT Austin.  Therefore, your rank of top 43% makes UT Austin an extreme reach.  Basically, the automatic admission applicants (top 7% Texas residents) take up about 3/4 of the spots, so everyone else (all non-Texas residents and Texas residents outside the top 7%) is left with the remaining 1/4 of the spots.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #2     insanedreamer    Registered User  Posts: 1,536  Senior Member      February 2017       Your stats/ECs are quite good. But unless you're a Texas resident, you should consider UT-Austin a reach. Still worth applying to though!  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     tk21769    Registered User  Posts: 10,049  Senior Member      February 2017       You won't get automatic admission under the state's Top 10% Rule (or 7% for UTA), but apparently test scores are a major factor for everyone else.   https://www.texastribune.org/2016/06/23/race-and-admissions-ut-austin-last-five-years/ "...UT-Austin, like many other universities, is always seeking out more students with high SAT and ACT scores. But most of its freshman class is admitted based solely on grades because of the Top 10 Percent Rule. So when the school considers students who are not automatically eligible, it is especially interested in high test scores — and white and Asian students are more likely to fit that profile."  But with your scores, presumably you do fit that profile. I'd still say it's a reach but not unrealistic.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook         This discussion has been closed.

Omee55    Registered User  Posts: 1  New Member      February 2017    edited February 2017   in The University of Texas at Austin      Hi, I was wondering what my chances of getting into UT-Austin look like. As of right now I have  a 3.05 GPA (Unweighted) and in the top 27% of my class (I only need to move up 7 spots to get into the top 25%). I have taken my PSAT and scored an 1100, but took the actual SAT two weeks ago and am waiting to get my scores. Along with those numbers I have done 58 hours of community service, got A/B honor roll my freshman year, and hopefully going to be inducted into NHS this year. I've taken nothing but Pre-AP classes except one CP class my sophomore year (Pre-AP is the same thing as honors classes). As of right now I have taken 2 Dual Enrollment classes ( Avearged out to an 85.5, but they are college classes so it should add more points to that and will boost my GPA and rank ). At the end of my junior year I am projected to have a 3.13 GPA (Unweighted), ( Could be a 3.25 because of the Dual Enrollment classes) and be in the top 25% of my class. I also plan to take AP classes my senior year to help my GPA and rank even more. So as of right now, what are my chances of getting admitted into UT-Austin?

UT Austin is top 7% for 2018. 25% is for A&M (with SAT).   I have taken my PSAT and scored an 1100, but took the actual SAT two weeks ago and am waiting to get my scores.  If you have a 3.05 GPA, you are going to need a very high (1500+) to make up for it.   done 58 hours of community service, got A/B honor roll my freshman year, and hopefully going to be inducted into NHS this year.  58 hours is pretty average, honor roll is decent, but why is NHS so late?   Also, will it help that my mom attended UT and graduated with a masters degree?  It might help but only so far.   In order to make a comparison, I will tell you a bit about myself. I am also a junior at a texas high school. I currently have 7 AP classes with all the rest being honors except 5 classes. I plan to take 7 more in senior year. I scored a 1460 on my PSAT (and also waiting for my SAT). I have a 3.89 GPA, along with being a president of a group with ~150 hours.  Yet, I am 90% certain that I will not be able to get into UT Austin. It is insanely competitive for engineering and unless your class ranking is 4-5%, you will not get in.  I don't want to put you down or anything, but unless you have some crazy recs and a mind-blowing essay I just can't see it happening.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     MYOS1634    Registered User  Posts: 35,194  Senior Member      February 2017    edited February 2017       Short version : you're not getting in. Longer version: You need to be top 7% just to get into UT, and to get into engineering you need to be at the top of these. UT then looks at top 10% students from top high schools who have sufficient course rigor and top grades. Again,  not you. Then,  they take athletes. Not you. Then, oos applicants whom they want,  either because of stellar stats or legacy status. So,  you're not getting into UT. Nor TAMU engineering btw. Tamu liberal arts, perhaps,  but not sure) they want top 20% max).  Top 25% and engineering : perhaps Texas Tech and UT Dallas but even there it's not certain at all. Utsa you have a shot. I'd look seriously at oos colleges too (UOklahoma,Montana State , UWyoming) And discuss costs with our parents.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     TexasMom2017    Registered User  Posts: 185  Junior Member      February 2017    edited February 2017       There is a lot of misinformation on this thread.  I suggest that you google "utexas kroll report" and "utexas admission best practices" to find some concrete and reliable information about the admission process.  If you are not top 7% of your (Texas) high school class (and even if you are but want a major other than undeclared liberal arts), there is a holistic review process that does not have a specific cutoff for class rank or test scores.  However, the academic index (based on class rank and test scores) is extremely important.  It is true that @Omee55 is extremely unlikely to get in with those stats, but no one can know for sure without seeing the entire application.  Also, UT does not consider whether one's parents attended or have a connection to UT (except in very unusual circumstances discussed in the Kroll report, and which I suspect are a lot more rare now than even a couple of years ago).  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #5     MYOS1634    Registered User  Posts: 35,194  Senior Member      February 2017       ^ l The Kroll report mostly focused on connections (ie., not just legacies, but powerful donors' letters of recommendation with admissions made directly by the president... those would now become exceedingly rare for IS applicants). Legacies considered are students whose parents and/or grandparents attended the university, continue the tradition, and are now living out of state.  Only 7% are OOS students and academic criteria are even more rigorous for them, so more criteria are taken into account; they represent a very small number of admitted students.  @TexasMom2017 : I know what you're saying, but most students admitted outside the Top 7% are top 10% with excellent grades, scores, and course rigor. Some students who are admitted outside the top 10% are really close to top 10% and/or attended a super competitive high school or bring something unique to the university (such as the ability to win football games).  Even among that last group they're top 25% and that's what OP is hoping for, I'm guessing. While there's no exact cutoff after top 7%, UT is a top public university nationally and admits top students period. A student who might squeak into top 25% with a B+ average is extremely unlikely to make it as you said, but "no one knows for sure" isn't setting things right for this student, who needs to focus on finding affordable safeties, matches, and reachable reaches.This is a good student who has excellent choices in Texas and elsewhere. If s/he wants to throw in an application to UT after completing the rest, sure, but right now we really can't nurture his/her hope that going from 27% to 25% will matter.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     ACT2017    Registered User  Posts: 191  Junior Member      February 2017    edited February 2017        @Omee55 - don't give up hope yet. Try to get best SAT or ACT score and focus on extracurriculars (and summer job) related to your intended major. Make sure to present yourself through essays. Write all three essays and couple of good recommendation letters. BTW your senior year grades doesn't count for admission decisions.

While I agree that it would be a reach for OP, it's certainly not as impossible as you are making it out to be. A good SAT score (1450-1500+) can make up for not being in the top 7%.

If s/he reaches that it opens up some opportunities (full tuition and honors college at ole miss for one.) I doubt it's counteract the class rank though.  @KohliTheBeast : unfortunately @RMNiMiTz isn't exaggerating. Top 7% gets you into UT not into your major. For restricted /impacted majors, there's holistic review, and admission to UT engineering is for the top of those top 7%. Look at the results thread from last year.

High test scores, strong ECs, etc. can offset *some* weakness in class rank (*up to a point*).

The fact it's possible doesn't make it likely. What I'm trying to say is that UT Engineering is a reach if you're top 7% and if you're not it becomes "reach for everyone" territory. The Best Practices doc is invaluable indeed. the AI/PAI formulas are a bit confusing though.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #13     RMNiMiTz    Registered User  Posts: 802  Member      February 2017        @KohliTheBeast  This kid got a 1100 on the PSAT. Unless he works some magic and improves by 500 points in the scope of a year, he probably isn't getting in. With only 58 hours and beginning NHS this year, his EC's don't look spectacular, unless he is hiding a lot from us.  It is possible to get into UT without being top 7%. However, 27% (and he says he is trying for 25%) is definitely on the low end.  I just don't want to sell him false hope.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #14     KohliTheBeast    Registered User  Posts: 85  Junior Member      February 2017        @RMNiMiTz Oh I didn't mean for the OP.

New Discussion Chances Of Getting Into UT Austin       ConnerA    Registered User  Posts: 2  New Member      February 2015    edited February 2015   in The University of Texas at Austin      I'm a junior currently at a very prestigious private school in Texas, where about 10% of our graduating class (class of about 100) tends to get accepted into an ivy. Last year, I believe we had 9 ivy acceptances out of 100 students as well as a few MIT, Stanford, etc. Because of this, I am far from top 10% (our school does not rank anyways), but I want to know my chances of getting into UT Austin. My ultimate goal would be to be a business major at McCombs, but I know that I will not get into that school initially, so I plan to apply with Radio-Television as my first choice and business as my second (just in case I get lucky) and then switch after freshman year.  My freshman year of high school, my grades were basically awful. I had about a 3 GPA, with a few honors classes. By the end of my sophomore year, my GPA was up to a 3.11, because I averaged around a 3.2 that year (still bad I know). However, junior year, I decided to actually put some effort into school, and my first semester I finished with a 4.11 GPA (3.9 unweighted I believe, but our school only shows us the weighted version). Second semester this year should be about the same, and I should finish junior year with about a 3.45 realistically.  As for the class rigor, senior year I will be taking 3 math classes (AP Stat, AP calc ab, and advanced financial algebra). I will also be taking AP Gov and AP Econ. Also, I will take phycology, regular english, astro physics and the 4th level of our film class. Junior year, I only took 2 AP classes as well as honors math (precalculus honors). Also, I did an independent study in music history.  Below are my extra circulars: -50+ hours of community service -30+ hours of campus service -Cofounder and officer of Science Club -President of Cinema Charities Club (we make promotional videos for non profits who can not afford them to help them get the word of their organization out there) -Investment Club member -Model United Nations member -In a group of students selected to give tours to prospective students and parents at our school -Worked for a radio station as a full time employee for a month over summer -2 Scholastic Art and Writing regional Gold Keys for films -2 Separate Films Selected to Screen At South by Southwest (festival in Austin) -Cinefestival 2014 film best of festival + emerging artist award (san antonio film festival) -Anim!Arte International 2014 - worked on film that received Best student international film of North America + 2nd place youth jury -award (this is a film festival based in Brazil) -Outsiders film festival - movie screened here as well -2 years of basketball and 4 years of tennis -National French Exam - honorary mention  Here are my test scores so far PSAT: 202 (commended) SAT: 1920 (I am retaking this soon, with the goal of a 2050) ACT: 29 (Also retaking this and goal to get 31)  I took the ACT and SAT unprepared, so I feel like I can do significantly better on both. On the ACT, I got a 32 on math and reading, 28 on science but only 24 on english, because I was not prepared for how long the test was. If I had finished it (which I could have if I had practiced and known how long it was), I could easily get a 30 on that section.  Sorry this was so long, but based on all of that, what do you think the chances are of me getting into UT Austin? Also, what should I do to improve my chances aside from grades, because I am already doing everything I can to get those up.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook      Replies to: Chances Of Getting Into UT Austin       #1     smoothies7    Registered User  Posts: 19  New Member      February 2015       Well, UT has a 40.2% acceptance rate (2013) so shouldn't be too hard to get in.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #2     Loganator    Registered User  Posts: 184  Junior Member      February 2015       Your chances are likely better with RTF than with the more competitive McCombs, but you should investigate the transfer possibility if your goal is a business degree. I don't know how possible that would be. FYI, we learned this year that UT is moving away from considering an applicant for the second choice major.

While it's not impossible, internal transfers to McCombs are notoriously hard, and you don't want to get trapped in a major you don't want.

From what i've read, it seems like you need about a 3.7-3.8 freshman year to transfer into McCombs. Is this generally true? And is it easier to transfer in from harder majors than arts or do they strictly look at gpa?  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #5     evanian15    Registered User  Posts: 158  Junior Member      February 2015        @smoothies7‌ it's a misleading 40.2%, especially if you're in state. The top 7% auto-admit rule causes so many kids in state outside of that range to be rejected because the university wants some geographic diversity.  2   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     DogShelter    Registered User  Posts: 72  Junior Member      February 2015       By the way, McCombs has a 25% acceptance rate. And the overall is skewed by auto-admits. I would say get a 33 ACT or 2150 at the least. I had friends with about the same level of EC's as you with 2050 SATs and auto-admit status denied to McCombs. And everyone is right about you having much greater chances at RTF, plus you seem like you would have fun with it. You should check out the formulas that UT uses for non-auto admits.  1   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #7     OhSorryYo    Registered User  Posts: 248  Junior Member      February 2015       I lol'd at the "shouldn't be too hard" comment.  I think you have pretty good shot at getting in the university, but probably not a spot in McCombs, at least not initially. You have very good ECs. Just try to raise those scores a bit, like at least 32 ACT and 2100 SAT  4   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #8     fatherof2boys    Registered User  Posts: 338  Member      February 2015    edited February 2015       I would concur that you have to make a very hard choice here.  Your stats look competitive for RTF but they are likely to come up short respecting McCombs.  Your plan to enter UT as a RTF major and simply transfer to McCombs is risky to say the least.  I think you are going to have to decide which is more important to you...being a student at UT-Austin, albeit without your preferred major, or being somewhere like A&M with your preferred major.  If you are okay with the former, then go ahead and apply for RTF and see if you can transfer to McCombs later. If you fail to get the transfer, at least you'll be at your dream school.  However, if you really know that you'll be unhappy being stuck as a RTF major, then I'd suggest you simply roll the dice and apply directly to McCombs coming out of high school as your "reach" school, and then consider a school like A&M where (I assume) you are likely going to be a competitive applicant for admission to their undergraduate business program.  In the latter case, if you are granted admission to McCombs under the holistic review for non-auto admits, you are golden! On the other hand, if you are denied admission to UT, you are likely to get into A&M with your preferred major and at a quality,affordable school.  I think your plan to game the system maybe to risky, unless you are truly willing to take the risk of being stuck as a RTF major.  Good luck.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #9     Fuffy24    Registered User  Posts: 162  Junior Member      February 2015       UT's 40.2 percent acceptance rate is inflated by its super easy colleges and majors and auto admit. Getting into business, engineering, and college of natural sciences aligns with 20-30%, similar to other non auto admit public university's, such as UNC. If it makes you feel better, I got into Electrical Engineering from the top 17 percent and my friend got into McCombs with a top 36 percent rank. UT loves rank, but they're holistic, and me and my friend got in due to really good test scores and really good essays, so your not done, you just have to put in a lot of effort. Also note that we didn't have a lot of extracurriculars, certainly not as much as you. Try and hope for the best.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #10     smoothies7    Registered User  Posts: 19  New Member      February 2015       thanks for clearing that up! @evanian15‌   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook         This discussion has been closed.

I was wondering what you guys think of my chances of getting into UT (Austin). I'm just talking any major, I'd transfer once i got there.  High school weighted GPA: 4.0  High School rank: I'm at private school and we don't rank. I'm in the top 17%.  Where? I live in Texas, so I'm in state.  SAT Score? 1930 Total, 1310 CR/Math   Extras that matter: National Honor Society Local Low-Budget Newspaper Writer Job with the Houston Astros     What do you think guys? Do i need to take SAT IIs? Do i need to raise that SAT score? If so to what? Any info helps!   EDIT: Honesty is the best policy. I'm not afriad of a bad answer, I would just like some honest opinions.

I got CAP.  You gotta double your EC, try a higher SAT score, but most important, you gotta get that rank up, and fast.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #2     JRo    Registered User  Posts: 47  Junior Member      May 2008       What major did you apply for?  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #3     theloneranger    Registered User  Posts: 1,624  Senior Member      May 2008       Okay, here's the deal: if your school does not rank, UT will simply make up a rank for you to use in your calculations. It looks like, given the fact that you have a 4.0 and are barely in the top 20%, that serious grade inflation goes on at your school. This will likely help you. I am unsure how they determine your estimated rank exactly, but I am fairly certain it does involve to some extent comparing you to other applicants from your school to UT. So if the smart kids from your school are applying to UT, it will hurt you. If they aren't, it will likely end up helping you. I like how you provided your rank and then said "my school doesn't rank." Haha, my school does the same thing. They give you an exact rank for internal use, but for college admissions certify anyone who is above a 94.0 GPA as top ten percent. I don't know if they even provide the rank of kids who aren't in the top ten percent. Obviously if your school doesn't release rank it doesn't matter if your rank goes up. It would be good for you if your grades were near the top of those kids applying to UT from your school, however. So do what you can on finals and in the first semester to get that done.  SAT IIs will not help you at UT. UT does not consider them at all. You would do well to raise your SAT score 50-100 points on CR/M. UT is introducing writing into its admissions next year from what I hear, so I don't know how that will affect the admissions formulae. Your SAT is about 50 points above the 2007 average for a non-top ten student who was admitted. But having a 1400+ will significantly increase your chances.  You don't need to double your ECs if you are giving a significant amount of time to them. How much time are you giving to the Stros and the paper? In all honesty, NHS does not matter 90% of the time. Almost every kid who applies to UT is either in NHS or has the grades to be in it. Are you an officer? Is your school's NHS one in which members make an active commitment to giving service, or is it more of an honorary society, as is the case in my school? If you are in any other clubs, try to assume leadership roles and more significant time commitments as this will help your cause significantly. Being in a bunch of clubs does not help, but showing a significant commitment to a few activities and being a leader in those activities does. Also, if you have not already done a large amount of community service, start immediately. If you have little to none done now, you may want to do as much as possible this summer. Having a paying job will take some of that burden away, but this is an often overlooked area of the resume and will have a big impact on your admission...either positively or negatively, depending on your effort and dedication.  Your essays matter almost as much as your resume (3/7 of the personal score, compared to 4/7 for the resume). So write those well, and make sure you go to multiple people for help with proofing and suggestions for change. This is the area where I think the most kids fall apart: they write them at the last minute, or they don't look for suggestions for change. As a rule, even if you are one of the better writers in your school, and are getting As in English, that does NOT mean your writing will be good compared to other UT applicants. ESPECIALLY if you try to do it at the last minute. I know a few people who have done that and been successful, but I know far more who did that and received a lovely CAP letter in March.  Good luck with your application. Coming from a nonranking school, a strong SAT and leadership will make your cause very strong. I think that if you are decent compared to the rest of the UT applicants from your school, and present a strong resume with leadership and service, you will have a strong chance for admission.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     Sedna    User Awaiting Email Confirmation  Posts: 83  Junior Member      May 2008       economics, liberal arts.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #5     theloneranger    Registered User  Posts: 1,624  Senior Member      May 2008       Also: DON'T apply to a tough major if your first goal is simply to get in to UT. It is MUCH harder to get an undeclared Liberal Arts position than it is to simply get accepted to a COLA department.  Do NOT apply to Architecture. Do NOT apply to Engineering. Do NOT apply to Communication. And God forbid, do NOT apply to Business. You are just asking for a rejection there.  Make an average-to-unpopular Liberal Arts or Natural Sciences your first or second choice, and you will have a much better chance to get in.  If you are interested in trying an unconventional route, three colleges of the university have a higher acceptance rate than is the norm: Education, Nursing, and Geosciences. If you have a suitable background to earn admission for one of those schools, you should consider applying to one. If you don't want to continue, you can transfer after your freshman year. You will just be taking area requirements freshman year anyways, so you lose nothing.  But I know a lot of strong candidates who've applied to Business first choice and Engineering second and seen themselves get CAPped.  You must be an EXCEPTIONAL candidate to get into Business or other top colleges from outside the top ten percent. And earning an undeclared spot after declaring another college your first choice has also been difficult in the past. Learn from others' mistakes and you will have a good chance to get in.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     Sedna    User Awaiting Email Confirmation  Posts: 83  Junior Member      May 2008       uh oh, I need economics first and business second...  shoot.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #7     JRo    Registered User  Posts: 47  Junior Member      May 2008       Thank you SO much for everything.

Start Apply Texas and your essays early. The biggest mistake that applicants make is procrastinating. Last minute efforts never produce your best efforts. It shocked me when I worked for UT the number of otherwise highly qualified applicants who submitted sloppy essays. More than half of all UT applicants apply during the last two weeks in November. Don't make your senior year any more stressful than it needs to be. Pick up your UT admissions guide "Your Ticket to the Forty Acres" today! 2. Assemble a small college application army. It is hard to go about your college applications alone. Especially if you are applying to more than eight universities, it can be difficult to balance deadlines, essay prompts, and application logins. Work with one or two trusted people to help with your essays like a teacher or current college student. Create a schedule and timeline to complete your applications. Parents can help juggle these responsibilities, but it is important that the application process be student-centered. 3. It's never too late to improve your college resume. Sometimes, students exiting junior year feel that they can't improve your resume. Consider spending your summer productively by working, volunteering, or participating in summer camps. There is always room for improvement. Admissions reviewers don't necessarily care what you do as long as you commit quality time to an activity or two. Do you enjoy this content? Check out my exclusive premium content at "Getting into Texas Universities." 4. Submit an expanded resume. It always surprised me when I worked for UT how few students submitted the recommended expanded (paper) resume. Apply Texas hasn't been updated in over ten years. It can be hard to include and describe all of your activities. UT allows you to submit a paper resume that can be as long as you want. Take advantage! For more resume tips, check out these posts. 5. Establish a relationship with your high school counselor. Your high school counseling staff can be a great ally in your college search and application process. They may know of scholarships, summer programs, or lesser known programs and universities that may be a great fit for you. Especially if you attend a large public high school, consider making the effort to get to know your assigned counselor. Even though they are busy, if you make an earnest effort to get to know them or help them out, it may help limit the stress of your college search. 6. Choose a first-choice major you actually want. UT admits applicants based on their choice of college or school. They do not admit students to the university. It is important to choose your major wisely because UT is making it more difficult for students to change their major at summer orientation and after you enroll. UT is trying to increase its four-year graduation rates. Major changes sometimes puts students behind. It is also important to choose and stick with your first-choice major because a major review criteria is your "fit for major." You should craft your entire application arguing why you deserve a spot in your desired program. Complete my questionnaire for a free consultation. 7.  Don't get lost in the details. Especially on Reddit and College Confidential, I see students drowning in the minutiae. They worry about marking down 45 versus 50 volunteer hours, whether to take AP Chemistry rather than honors, or minor errors they made on their essay and resume submissions. College admissions is about the big picture. Reviewers will likely spend no more than ten minutes reviewing your application. They are looking for an overall portrait of who to admit. By focusing on the details, you are guaranteeing yourself more stress. Don't overedit | resist perfectionism Students often hesitate and second-guess themselves before submitting. I sometimes receive frantic emails weeks later from students who I assumed had already completed their applications. After our third or fourth draft of detailed and intensive editing and feedback, the essays are polished and enjoyable. There may be imperfections, but they are ready to submit. Occasionally, students overedit to the point that their finished essays look substantially worse than the previous drafts. Students edit out their voice or add new information that subtracts from the overall application. Plan II Honors specifically warns against this tendency. “Take your time, but beware over-editing . . . Although you want to write with care, you should not spend weeks or months rewriting essays. There is little to gain after the third draft. Don’t delay the submission of your application to write the fourth, or fifteenth, version of your essays. Overwritten and over-edited essays are never the best essays.” 8. Focus on what you can control I dedicate a chapter to this approach in my book "Your Ticket to the Forty Acres: The Unofficial Guide for UT Undergraduate Admissions." Applicants, families, and even high school counselors focus on the wrong things. I hear about how challenging and competitive one’s school is or disbelief at how college admissions is much more selective than a generation ago. People vent about state laws they can’t control. They wish the process could be different. College admissions isn’t fair or predictable, but neither is life. Factors outside of an applicant’s control: •    The competitiveness of the other applicants in the pool •    State and federal laws •    The number of applicants for a given major •    The needs of the university •    How admissions committees measure and calculate the desirability of an applicant •    Essay topics •    The competitiveness of one’s high school •    Biographical factors like race or income •    How UT handles nonranking schools •    Preferences for in-state versus out-of-state applicants •    The mood of your reviewer This is not an exhaustive list, but you get the idea. There are many things that you cannot change. Obsessing over things like the Top 10 percent Rule or how UT doesn’t consider the competitiveness of your school takes away from focusing on the factors one can control. I find people spend way more of their time discussing what they can’t change rather than what they have some power over. It may be cathartic to complain, but you will wear thin the patience of your admissions representatives and high school counselors. Factors within your control •    Your essays •    Your expanded resume •    Who writes your recommendation letters •    Your desired majors or universities •    Where you choose to apply •    How you spend your summers and weekends •    Your academic course selection •    Engaging with admissions professionals or attending recruitment events •    Seeking out resources in your school and community •    Your activities outside of class •    When you apply •    Your attitude, effort, and expectations  9. College admissions isn't life and death At age seventeen or eighteen, undoubtedly receiving your college admissions decisions during the spring of your senior year will be the most important milestone of your life. Students often get so fixated on one school that they lose sight of the bigger picture. What seems like the most important thing in the world right now may seem less so a few years in the future. One of my favorite books on college admissions and the return on investment for a university education is Frank Bruni's "Where You Go Is Not Who You Will Be." He argues convincingly that how you approach college and why you choose your pursuits is more important than where you go. Most importantly, don't let college admissions - an uncertain, unpredictable, and often unfair process - define who you are. 10. Submit it and forget it. Once you submit your application, there is nothing to do but wait. You are going to stress yourself out going back and reading your essays and inevitably finding errors or areas of improvement. Sometimes, students ask what they can do to improve an already-submitted application. The answer? Nothing. 11. Be flexible It is important to keep an open mind to the universities you are willing and excited to attend. It matters less where you go than what you do once you arrive. There are over four thousand universities in the United States, but unfortunately the public gets fixated on the same forty or fifty that dominate rankings like US News and World Report. Especially in Texas, it is the dream of tens of thousands of students to be Longhorns. The reality is the university can admit only about 15,000 students each year enrolling a class between 7,000-8,000. You cannot control your admissions outcomes. You can control your control your attitude and outlook for the future. Interested in receiving a free admissions consultation?

Data courtesy of Cappex.   In this graph, green and blue represent accepted students. As you can see, the majority of accepted students had a GPA of B+/A- or higher, an SAT score (RW+M) above about 1100, and an ACT composite score of 22 or higher. Chances of admission improve as those numbers go up. Realize, however, that hidden beneath the blue and green on the graph is a lot of red -- some students with excellent transcripts and strong standardized test results still get rejected from the University of Texas (see the graph below for more information) Note also that a number of students were accepted with test scores and grades a bit below the norm. The University of Texas has holistic admissions , so the admissions officers are considering qualitative as well as quantitative information. Students who show some kind of interesting talent or have a compelling story to tell will often get a close look even if grades and test scores aren't quite up to the ideal. A winning essay , strong letters of recommendation , and interesting extracurricular activities are all important pieces of a successful application.

Data courtesy of Cappex   From the graph at the top of this article, you might be led to conclude that students with "A" averages and strong SAT or ACT scores are almost certain to get into the University of Texas at Austin. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Plenty of students with GPAs and standardized test scores that are on target for the university fail to be admitted. The rejection of a seemingly qualified student can be the result of many factors: lack of depth or accomplishment in extracurricular activities; failure to demonstrate leadership ability; a lack of challenging AP, IB or Honors courses; a sloppy admissions essay; and more. Also, out-of-state applicants will face a higher admissions bar than Texas students. Be sure to strengthen your application by submitting an optional activities resumé and optional letters of recommendation.

[12] Founded in 1881, its campus is located in Austin, Texas , United States , approximately one mile (1.6 km) from the Texas State Capitol . UT Austin was inducted into the Association of American Universities in 1929, becoming only the third university in the American South to be elected. The institution has the nation's eighth-largest single-campus enrollment , with over 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and over 24,000 faculty and staff. [13]  A Public Ivy , it is a major center for academic research, with research expenditures exceeding $550 million for the 2014–2015 school year. [14] The university houses seven museums and seventeen libraries, including the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum and the Blanton Museum of Art , and operates various auxiliary research facilities, such as the J. J. Pickle Research Campus and the McDonald Observatory . Among university faculty are recipients of the Nobel Prize , Pulitzer Prize , the Wolf Prize , the Emmy Award , the Turing Award , and the National Medal of Science , as well as many other awards.  UT Austin student athletes compete as the Texas Longhorns and are members of the Big 12 Conference . Its Longhorn Network is the only sports network featuring the college sports of a single university. The Longhorns have won four NCAA Division I National Football Championships, six NCAA Division I National Baseball Championships, thirteen NCAA Division I National Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, and has claimed more titles in men's and women's sports than any other school in the Big 12 since the league was founded in 1996.

Although Title 6, Article 217 of the Constitution promised to establish public education in the arts and sciences, [15] no action was taken by the Mexican government. After Texas obtained its independence from Mexico in 1836, the Texas Congress adopted the Constitution of the Republic , which, under Section 5 of its General Provisions, stated "It shall be the duty of Congress, as soon as circumstances will permit, to provide, by law, a general system of education." [16]  On April 18, 1838, "An Act to Establish the University of Texas" was referred to a special committee of the Texas Congress , but was not reported back for further action. [17] On January 26, 1839, the Texas Congress agreed to set aside fifty leagues of land—approximately 288,000 acres (117,000 ha)—towards the establishment of a publicly funded university. [18] In addition, 40 acres (16 ha) in the new capital of Austin were reserved and designated "College Hill." [1] (The term "Forty Acres" is colloquially used to refer to the University as a whole. The original 40 acres is the area from Guadalupe to Speedway and 21st Street to 24th Street. [19] )  In 1845, Texas was annexed into the United States . Interestingly, the state's Constitution of 1845 failed to mention higher education. [20] On February 11, 1858, the Seventh Texas Legislature approved O.B. 102, an act to establish the University of Texas, which set aside $100,000 in United States bonds toward construction of the state's first publicly funded university [21] (the $100,000 was an allocation from the $10 million the state received pursuant to the Compromise of 1850 and Texas's relinquishing claims to lands outside its present boundaries). The legislature also designated land reserved for the encouragement of railroad construction toward the university's endowment. On January 31, 1860, the state legislature, wanting to avoid raising taxes, passed an act authorizing the money set aside for the University of Texas to be used for frontier defense in west Texas to protect settlers from Indian attacks. [22]  Texas's secession from the Union and the American Civil War delayed repayment of the borrowed monies. At the end of the Civil War in 1865, The University of Texas's endowment was just over $16,000 in warrants [23] and nothing substantive had been done to organize the university's operations. This effort to establish a University was again mandated by Article 7, Section 10 of the Texas Constitution of 1876 which directed the legislature to "establish, organize and provide for the maintenance, support and direction of a university of the first class, to be located by a vote of the people of this State, and styled "The University of Texas." [24]  Additionally, Article 7, Section 11 of the 1876 Constitution established the Permanent University Fund , a sovereign wealth fund managed by the Board of Regents of the University of Texas and dedicated for the maintenance of the university. Because some state legislators perceived an extravagance in the construction of academic buildings of other universities, Article 7, Section 14 of the Constitution expressly prohibited the legislature from using the state's general revenue to fund construction of university buildings. Funds for constructing university buildings had to come from the university's endowment or from private gifts to the university, but the university's operating expenses could come from the state's general revenues.     The university's Old Main building in 1903    The 1876 Constitution also revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858, but dedicated 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) of land, along with other property appropriated for the university, to the Permanent University Fund. This was greatly to the detriment of the university as the lands the Constitution of 1876 granted the university represented less than 5% of the value of the lands granted to the university under the Act of 1858 (the lands close to the railroads were quite valuable, while the lands granted the university were in far west Texas, distant from sources of transportation and water). [25] The more valuable lands reverted to the fund to support general education in the state (the Special School Fund).  On April 10, 1883, the legislature supplemented the Permanent University Fund with another 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) of land in west Texas granted to the Texas and Pacific Railroad, but returned to the state as seemingly too worthless to even survey. [26] The legislature additionally appropriated $256,272.57 to repay the funds taken from the university in 1860 to pay for frontier defense and for transfers to the state's General Fund in 1861 and 1862. [27] The 1883 grant of land increased the land in the Permanent University Fund to almost 2.2 million acres. Under the Act of 1858, the university was entitled to just over 1,000 acres (400 ha) of land for every mile of railroad built in the state. Had the 1876 Constitution not revoked the original 1858 grant of land, by 1883 the university lands would have totaled 3.2 million acres, [28] so the 1883 grant was to restore lands taken from the university by the 1876 Constitution, not an act of munificence.  On March 30, 1881, the legislature set forth the university's structure and organization and called for an election to establish its location. [29] By popular election on September 6, 1881, Austin (with 30,913 votes) was chosen as the site. Galveston, having come in second in the election (20,741 votes) was designated the location of the medical department (Houston was third with 12,586 votes). [30] On November 17, 1882, on the original "College Hill," an official ceremony commemorated the laying of the cornerstone of the Old Main building. University President Ashbel Smith , presiding over the ceremony, prophetically proclaimed "Texas holds embedded in its earth rocks and minerals which now lie idle because unknown, resources of incalculable industrial utility, of wealth and power. Smite the earth, smite the rocks with the rod of knowledge and fountains of unstinted wealth will gush forth." [31] The University of Texas officially opened its doors on September 15, 1883.  Expansion and growth [ edit ]  In 1890, George Washington Brackenridge donated $18,000 for the construction of a three-story brick mess hall known as Brackenridge Hall (affectionately known as "B.Hall"), one of the university's most storied buildings and one that played an important place in university life until its demolition in 1952. [32]  The old Victorian - Gothic  Main Building served as the central point of the campus's 40-acre (16 ha) site, and was used for nearly all purposes. But by the 1930s, discussions arose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.  In 1910, George Washington Brackenridge again displayed his philanthropy, this time donating 500 acres (200 ha) on the Colorado River to the university. A vote by the regents to move the campus to the donated land was met with outrage, and the land has only been used for auxiliary purposes such as graduate student housing. Part of the tract was sold in the late-1990s for luxury housing, and there are controversial proposals to sell the remainder of the tract. The Brackenridge Field Laboratory was established on 82 acres (33 ha) of the land in 1967.     UT Architecture Library    In 1916, Gov. James E. Ferguson became involved in a serious quarrel with the University of Texas. The controversy grew out of the board of regents' refusal to remove certain faculty members whom the governor found objectionable. When Ferguson found he could not have his way, he vetoed practically the entire appropriation for the university. Without sufficient funding, the university would have been forced to close its doors. In the middle of the controversy, Ferguson's critics brought to light a number of irregularities on the part of the governor. Eventually, the Texas House of Representatives prepared 21 charges against Ferguson and the Senate convicted him on 10 of them, including misapplication of public funds and receiving $156,000 from an unnamed source. The Texas Senate removed Ferguson as governor and declared him ineligible to hold office. [33]  In 1921, the legislature appropriated $1,350,000 for the purchase of land next to the main campus. However, expansion was hampered by the restriction against using state revenues to fund construction of university buildings as set forth in Article 7, Section 14 of the Constitution. With the completion of Santa Rita No. 1 well [34] and the discovery of oil on university-owned lands in 1923, the university added significantly to its Permanent University Fund. The additional income from Permanent University Fund investments allowed for bond issues in 1931 and 1947, with the latter expansion necessary from the spike in enrollment following World War II. The university built 19 permanent structures between 1950 and 1965, when it was given the right of eminent domain . With this power, the university purchased other properties surrounding the original 40 acres (16 ha).  The discovery of oil on university-owned lands in 1923 and the subsequent addition of money to the university's Permanent University Fund allowed the legislature to address funding for the university along with the Agricultural and Mechanical College (now known as Texas A&M University ). With sufficient funds now in the Permanent University Fund to finance construction on both campuses, on April 8, 1931, the Forty Second Legislature passed H.B. 368. [35] which dedicated the Agricultural and Mechanical College a 1/3 interest in the Available University Fund, [36] the annual income from Permanent University Fund investments.  UT Austin was inducted into the Association of American Universities in 1929. [37] During World War II, the University of Texas was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. [38]  In 1950, the University of Texas was the first major university in the South to accept an African-American student. John S. Chase went on to become the first licensed African-American architect in Texas. [39]  In the fall of 1956, the first black students entered UT's undergraduate class. [40] Black students were permitted to live in campus dorms, but were barred from campus cafeterias. [40] UT integrated its facilities and desegregated its dorms in 1965. [41]  On March 6, 1967, the Sixtieth Texas Legislature changed the university's official name from "The University of Texas" to "The University of Texas at Austin" to reflect the growth of the University of Texas System . [42]  1966 shooting spree [ edit ]      The Tower , completed in 1937, stands 307 ft (94 m) tall and dons different colors of lighting on special occasions.    Main article: University of Texas tower shooting  On August 1, 1966, Texas student Charles Whitman barricaded the observation deck in the tower of the Main Building. With two rifles, a sawed-off shotgun , and other weapons, he killed 14 people on campus, 11 from the observation deck and below the clocks on the tower, and three more in the tower, as well as wounding two others inside the observation deck. The massacre ended after Whitman was shot and killed by police after they breached the tower. Before the massacre, Whitman had killed his mother and his wife. Whitman had been a patient at the University Health Center, and on March 29, preceding the shootings, had conveyed to psychiatrist Maurice Heatley his feelings of overwhelming hostilities and he was thinking about "going up on the tower with a deer rifle and start shooting people." [43]  After the Whitman event, the observation deck was closed until 1968, and then closed again in 1975 following a series of suicide jumps during the 1970s. In 1999, after installation of security fencing and other safety precautions, the tower observation deck reopened to the public. There is a turtle pond park near the tower dedicated to those affected by the tragedy.  Recent history [ edit ]  The first presidential library on a university campus was dedicated on May 22, 1971 with former President Johnson , Lady Bird Johnson and then-President Richard Nixon in attendance. Constructed on the eastern side of the main campus, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum is one of 13 presidential libraries administered by the National Archives and Records Administration .  A statue of Martin Luther King Jr. was unveiled on campus in 1999 and subsequently vandalized. [44] By 2004, John Butler , a professor at the McCombs School of Business suggested moving it to Morehouse College , a historically black college, "a place where he is loved." [44]  The University of Texas at Austin has experienced a wave of new construction recently with several significant buildings. On April 30, 2006, the school opened the Blanton Museum of Art . [45] In August 2008, the AT&T Executive Education and Conference Center opened, with the hotel and conference center forming part of a new gateway to the university. Also in 2008, Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium was expanded to a seating capacity of 100,119, making it the largest stadium (by capacity) in the state of Texas at the time.  On January 19, 2011, the university announced the creation of a 24-hour television network in partnership with ESPN , dubbed the Longhorn Network . ESPN will pay a $300 million guaranteed rights fee over 20 years to the university and to IMG College, UT Austin's multimedia rights partner. The network covers the university's intercollegiate athletics, music, cultural arts and academics programs. The channel first aired in September 2011. [46]  In May 2017, a stabbing on campus near Gregory Gym killed one and injured three. [47] A 21-year-old UT-Austin student was charged with the murder; the man had previously been involuntarily committed for psychiatric problems. [48]  Campus [ edit ]  See also: List of University of Texas at Austin buildings  The university's property totals 1,438.5 acres (582.1 ha), comprising the 423.5 acres (171.4 ha) for the Main Campus in central Austin and the J. J. Pickle Research Campus in north Austin and the other properties throughout Texas. The main campus has 150 buildings totalling over 18,000,000 square feet (1,700,000 m 2 ).     Interior lobby of the Lyndon B Johnson Presidential Library and Museum    One of the University's most visible features is the Beaux-Arts  Main Building , including a 307-foot (94 m) tower designed by Paul Philippe Cret . [49] Completed in 1937, the Main Building is in the middle of campus. The tower usually appears illuminated in white light in the evening but is lit orange for various special occasions, including athletic victories and academic accomplishments; it is conversely darkened for solemn occasions. [50] At the top of the tower is a carillon of 56 bells, the largest in Texas. Songs are played on weekdays by student carillonneurs, [51] in addition to the usual pealing of Westminster Quarters every quarter-hour between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. [52] In 1998, after the installation of security and safety measures, the observation deck reopened to the public indefinitely for weekend tours. [53]  The university's seven museums and seventeen libraries hold over nine million volumes, making it the seventh-largest academic library in the country. [54] The holdings of the university's Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center include one of only 21 remaining complete copies of the Gutenberg Bible and the first permanent photograph, View from the Window at Le Gras , taken by Nicéphore Niépce . [55] The newest museum, the 155,000-square-foot (14,400 m 2 ) Blanton Museum of Art , is the largest university art museum in the United States and hosts approximately 17,000 works from Europe, the United States, and Latin America. [56] [57]  The University of Texas at Austin has an extensive underground tunnel system that links the buildings on campus. Constructed in the 1930s under the supervision of creator Carl Eckhardt, then head of the physical plant, the tunnels have grown along with the university campus. They measure approximately six miles in length. [58] [59] The tunnel system is used for communications and utility service. It is closed to the public and guarded by silent alarms . Since the late 1940s, the university has generated its own electricity. Today its natural gas cogeneration plant has a capacity of 123 MW. The university also operates a TRIGA nuclear reactor at the J. J. Pickle Research Campus . [60] [60] [61]  The university continues to expand its facilities on campus. In 2010, the university opened the state-of-the-art Norman Hackerman building (on the site of the former Experimental Sciences Building) housing chemistry and biology research and teaching laboratories. In 2010, the university broke ground on the $120 million Bill & Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and Dell Computer Science Hall and the $51 million Belo Center for New Media, both of which are now complete. [62] [63] The new LEED gold-certified, 110,000-square-foot (10,000 m 2 ) Student Activity Center (SAC) opened in January 2011, housing study rooms, lounges and food vendors. The SAC was constructed as a result of a student referendum passed in 2006 which raised student fees by $65 per semester. [64] In 2012, the Moody Foundation awarded the College of Communication $50 million, the largest endowment any communication college has received, so naming it the Moody College of Communication.  The university operates two public radio stations, KUT with news and information, and KUTX with music, via local FM broadcasts as well as live streaming audio over the Internet. The university uses Capital Metro to provide bus transportation for students around the campus and throughout Austin.  Organization and administration [ edit ]      Battle Hall , also known as "The Old Library," was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.    The university contains eighteen colleges and schools and one academic unit, each listed with its founding date: [65]    Cockrell School of Engineering (1894)  Dell Medical School (2013)  College of Education (1905)  College of Fine Arts (1938)  College of Liberal Arts (1883)  College of Natural Sciences (1883)  College of Pharmacy  Continuing Education (1909)  Graduate Studies (1910)  Jackson School of Geosciences (2005)  LBJ School of Public Affairs (1970)  McCombs School of Business (1922)  Moody College of Communication (1965)  School of Architecture (1948)  School of Information (1948)  School of Law (1883)  School of Nursing (1976)  School of Undergraduate Studies (2008)  Steve Hicks School of Social Work (1950)    Academics [ edit ]      Proctor's  Mustangs (1948) overlooking the Engineering Sciences buildings    The University of Texas at Austin offers more than 100 undergraduate and 170 graduate degrees. In the 2009–2010 academic year, the university awarded a total of 13,215 degrees: 67.7% bachelor's degrees , 22.0% master's degrees, 6.4% doctoral degrees , and 3.9% Professional degrees. [66]  In addition, the university has eight honors programs , seven of which span a variety of academic fields: Liberal Arts Honors, the Business Honors Program, the Turing Scholars Program in Computer Science, Engineering Honors, the Dean's Scholars Program in Natural Sciences, the Health Science Scholars Program in Natural Sciences, and the Polymathic Scholars Program in Natural Sciences. The eighth is the Plan II Honors Program, a rigorous interdisciplinary program that is a major in and of itself. [67] Many Plan II students pursue a second major, often participating in another department's honors program in addition to Plan II. [68] The university also offers innovative programs for promoting academic excellence and leadership development such as the Freshman Research Initiative and Texas Interdisciplinary Plan. [69]  Admission [ edit ]  The University of Texas at Austin is one of the most selective universities in the region. Relative to other universities in the state of Texas, UT Austin is second to Rice University in selectivity according to a Business Journal study weighing acceptance rates and the mid-range of the SAT and ACT. UT Austin was ranked as the 18th most selective in the South. [70] As a state public university, UT Austin was subject to Texas House Bill 588 , which guaranteed graduating Texas high school seniors in the top 10% of their class admission to any public Texas university. A new state law granting UT (but no other state university) a partial exemption from the top 10% rule, Senate Bill 175, was passed by the 81st Legislature in 2009. It modified this admissions policy by limiting automatically admitted freshmen to 75% of the entering in-state freshman class, starting in 2011. The university will admit the top one percent, the top two percent and so forth until the cap is reached; the university currently admits the top 7 percent. [71] Furthermore, students admitted under Texas House Bill 588 are not guaranteed their choice of college or major, but rather only guaranteed admission to the university as a whole. Many colleges, such as the Cockrell School of Engineering, have secondary requirements that must be met for admission. [72]  For others who go through the traditional application process, selectivity is deemed "more selective" according to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and by U.S. News & World Report . [73] [74] For Fall 2017, 51,033 applied and 18,620 were accepted (36.5%), and of those accepted, 45.2% enrolled. [75] Among freshman students who enrolled in Fall 2017, SAT scores for the middle 50% ranged from 570–690 for critical reading and 600–710 for math. [75]  ACT composite scores for the middle 50% ranged from 26 to 31. [75] In terms of class rank, 74.4% of enrolled freshmen were in the top 10% of their high school classes and 91.7% ranked in the top quarter. [75]  Rankings [ edit ]    University rankings    National    ARWU [76]  30    Forbes [77]  91    U.S. News & World Report [78]  56    Washington Monthly [79]  70    Global    ARWU [80]  51    QS [81]  67    Times [82]  50    U.S. News & World Report [83]  30    UT Austin is consistently ranked among the country's top public universities. Nationally, UT Austin was ranked tied for 56th among all universities, and tied for 18th place among public universities, according to U.S. News & World Report ' s 2017 rankings. [84] Internationally, UT Austin was ranked 30th in the 2017 "Best Global Universities" ranking by U.S. News & World Report , tied for 44th in the world by Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) in 2016, 46th worldwide by Times Higher Education World University Rankings (2015–16), and 67th globally by QS World University Rankings (2016–17).  UT Austin is considered to be a " Public Ivy "—a public university that provides an Ivy League collegiate experience at a public school price, having been ranked in virtually every list of "Public Ivies" since Richard Moll coined the term in his 1985 book Public Ivies: A Guide to America's best public undergraduate colleges and universities . The seven other "Public Ivy" universities, according to Moll, were The College of William & Mary, Miami University, The University of California, The University of Michigan, The University of North Carolina, The University of Vermont, and The University of Virginia. [85]  In its 2016 edition of college rankings, U.S. News & World Report ranked the Accounting and Latin American History programs as the top in the nation and more than 50 other science, humanities and professional programs rank in the top 25 nationally. [84] The College of Pharmacy is listed as the third best in the nation and The School of Information (iSchool) is sixth best in Library and Information Sciences. [84] Among other rankings, the School of Social Work is 7th, the Jackson School of Geosciences is 8th for Earth Sciences, the Cockrell School of Engineering is tied for 10th-best (with the undergraduate engineering program tied for 11th-best in the country), the Nursing School is tied for 13th, the University of Texas School of Law is 14th, the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs is 16th, and the McCombs School of Business is tied for 16th-best (with the undergraduate business program tied for 7th-best in the country). [84]  The University of Texas School of Architecture was ranked second among national undergraduate programs in 2012. [86]  A 2005 Bloomberg survey ranked the school 5th among all business schools and first among public business schools for the largest number of alumni who are S&P 500 CEOs. [87] Similarly, a 2005 USA Today report ranked the university as "the number one source of new Fortune 1000 CEOs." [88] A "payback" analysis published by SmartMoney in 2011 comparing graduates' salaries to tuition costs concluded the school was the second-best value of all colleges in the nation, behind only Georgia Tech . [89] [90] A 2013 College Database study found UT was 22nd in the nation in terms of increased lifetime earnings by graduates. [91]  Research [ edit ]     Harlan J. Smith Telescope    For the 2014-2015 cycle, the university was awarded over $580,000,000 in sponsored projects, [92] [93] and has earned more than 300 patents since 2003. [94] UT Austin houses the Office of Technology Commercialization, a technology transfer center which serves as the bridge between laboratory research and commercial development. In 2009, UT Austin created nine new start-up companies to commercialize technology developed at the university and has created 46 start-ups in the past seven years. UT Austin license agreements generated $10.9 million in revenue for the university in 2009. [94]  Research at UT Austin is largely focused in the engineering and physical sciences, [95] and the university is a world-leading research institution in fields such as computer science. [96] Energy is a major research thrust, with federally funded projects on biofuels, [97] battery and solar cell technology, and geological carbon dioxide storage, [98] water purification membranes, among others. In 2009, UT Austin founded the Energy Institute, led by former Under Secretary for Science Raymond L. Orbach , to organize and advance multi-disciplinary energy research. [99] While the university does not have a medical school, it houses medical programs associated with other campuses and allied health professional programs, as well as major research programs in pharmacy, biomedical engineering, neuroscience, and others.  In 2010, UT Austin opened the $100 million Dell Pediatric Research Institute to increase medical research at the university and establish a medical research complex, and associated medical school, in Austin. [100] [101]  UT Austin operates several major auxiliary research centers. The world's third-largest telescope, the Hobby–Eberly Telescope , and three other large telescopes are part of UT Austin's McDonald Observatory , 450 miles (720 km) west of Austin. [102] [103] The university manages nearly 300 acres (120 ha) of biological field laboratories, including the Brackenridge Field Laboratory in Austin. The Center for Agile Technology focuses on software development challenges. [104] The J.J. Pickle Research Campus (PRC) is home to the Texas Advanced Computing Center which operates the Ranger supercomputer, one of the world's most powerful supercomputers [105] as well as the Microelectronics Research Center which houses micro- and nanoelectronics research and features a 15,000 square foot (1,400 m 2 ) cleanroom for device fabrication.  Founded in 1946, UT Austin's Applied Research Laboratories at the PRC has developed or tested the vast majority of the Navy's high-frequency sonar equipment. In 2007, the Navy granted it a research contract funded up to $928 million over ten years. [106] [107] The Institute for Advanced Technology, founded in 1990 and located in the West Pickle Research Building, supports the U.S. Army with basic and applied research in several fields.  The Center for Transportation Research UT Austin is a nationally recognized research institution focusing on transportation research, education, and public service. Established in 1963 as the Center for Highway Research, its projects address virtually all aspects of transportation, including economics, multimodal systems, traffic congestion relief, transportation policy, materials, structures, transit, environmental impacts, driver behavior, land use, geometric design, accessibility, and pavements. [108]  In 2013, UT Austin announced the naming of the O'Donnell Building for Applied Computational Engineering and Sciences. The O'Donnell Foundation of Dallas, headed by Peter O'Donnell and his wife, Edith Jones O'Donnell, has given more than $135 million to UT Austin between 1983 and 2013. UT Austin President William C. Powers declared the O'Donnells "among the greatest supporters of the University of Texas in its 130-year history. Their transformative generosity is based on the belief in our power to change society for the better." [109] In 2008, O'Donnell pledged $18 million to finance the hiring of UT Austin faculty members undertaking research in mathematics, computers, and multiple scientific disciplines; his pledge was matched by W. A. "Tex" Moncrief Jr., an oilman and philanthropist from Fort Worth . [110]  Endowment [ edit ]     The Norman Hackerman Building    Main article: Permanent University Fund  Thirty percent of the university's endowment comes from Permanent University Fund (PUF), with nearly $15 billion in assets as of 2007. [111] the University of Texas System gets two-thirds of the Available University Fund , the annual distribution of PUF income. A regental policy [112] requires at least 45 percent of this money go to the university for "program enrichment." By taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent, we get 30 percent which is the minimum amount of AUF income that can be distributed to the school under current policies. The Regents, however, can decide to allocate additional amounts to the university. Also, the majority of the University of Texas system share of the AUF is used for its debt service bonds , some of which were issued for the benefit of the Austin campus. [113] The Regents can change the 45 percent minimum of the University of Texas System share to goes to the Austin campus at any time, although doing so might be difficult politically.  Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of PUF. At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas' two university systems, the University of Texas System and the Texas A&M University System ; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10 percent of the universities' annual budgets. This has challenged the universities to increase sponsored research and private donations. Privately funded endowments contribute over $2 billion to the university's total endowment.  Student life [ edit ]  Student profile [ edit ]  For Fall 2011, the university enrolled 38,437 undergraduate, 11,497 graduate and 1,178 law students. [114] Out-of-state and international students comprised 9.1% of the undergraduate student body and 20.1% of the total student body, with students from all 50 states and more than 120 foreign countries—most notably, the Republic of Korea , followed by the People's Republic of China, India, Mexico , and Taiwan . [115] For Fall 2015, the undergraduate student body was 48.9% male and 51.1% female. [114] The three largest undergraduate majors in 2009 were Biological Sciences, Unspecified Business, and Psychology, while the three largest graduate majors were Business Administration ( MBA ), Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Pharmacy ( PharmD ). [115]    + Demographics of the UT Austin student body – Fall 2015 [116] [117]  Undergraduate  Graduate  Texas  U.S. Census    African American  4%  3.0%  12.6%  12.9%    Asian American  23%  7.2%  4.4%  4.6%    Non-Hispanic White  45%  53.0%  45.3%  65.1%    Hispanic American  21%  10.0%  37.6%  15.8%    Native American  1%  0.2%  1.3%  1.0%    Foreign  4%  22.4%  N/A  N/A    Residential life [ edit ]  The campus has fourteen residence halls, the newest of which opened in Spring 2007. On-campus housing can hold more than 7,100 students. [118]  Jester Center is the largest residence hall with its capacity of 2,945. [119] Academic enrollment exceeds the on-campus housing capacity; as a result, most students must live in private residence halls, housing cooperatives , apartments, or with Greek organizations and other off-campus residences. The Division of Housing and Food Service, which already has the largest market share of 7,000 of the estimated 27,000 beds in the campus area, plans to expand to 9,000 beds. [120]  Student organizations [ edit ]  The university recognizes more than 1,300 student organizations. [121] [122] In addition, it supports three official student governance organizations that represent student interests to faculty, administrators, and the Texas Legislature. Student Government, established in 1902, is the oldest governance organization and represents student interests in general. [123] The Senate of College Councils represents students in academic affairs and coordinates the college councils, [124] and the Graduate Student Assembly represents graduate student interests. [125] The University Unions Student Events Center serves as the hub for student activities on campus. [126] The Friar Society serves as the oldest honor society at the university. [127] Texas Orange Jackets , founded in 1923, is the oldest women's honorary service organization on campus and empowers young women leaders to serve the campus and community. Texas 4000 for Cancer is another student organization, which also doubles as an Austin-based nonprofit, that hosts a 4,500-mile bike ride from Austin, Texas to Anchorage, Alaska, thus far raising over $5 million for cancer research and patient support services since its inception in 2004.

The Daily Texan does not guarantee their accuracy.       Published on August 24, 2015 at 1:11 am  Last update on August 24, 2015 at 4:57 am  By Marisa Charpentier , Cat Cardenas   After loading up your car for move-in day, your parents probably flooded you with college advice between the goodbye tears. While they might be able offer advice about laundry and money management, it’s been a few years since they’ve hit the books. Here’s the real skinny on how to traverse freshman year from actual UT students.   Class Tips  • Check out sites such as MyEdu and Rate My Professors when class registration comes up again. Knowing how different teachers grade, how their classes are structured and how easy other students thought the course was will help you find the right class.  • Don’t stress if your grades aren’t what they were in high school. College is more difficult, especially when you are adjusting to a new environment and different teaching techniques. If you need extra help, check out the free tutoring available at Sanger Learning Center. Each student gets five free one-on-one sessions each semester, and drop-in tutoring is free for all students.  • UT offers more than 450 different study abroad programs. Visit the study abroad website to find programs in your major, and visit the Study Abroad Fair on Wednesday, Sept. 9 at Gregory Plaza.   @thedailytexan If you're not a morning person don't schedule 8am classes. #KnowThyself — Rob-T (@RRTorres73) August 20, 2015    Dorm Life  • Make your overly-cramped dorm an excuse to explore the city. With a different festival or event going on every weekend, you’ll almost always have something to do. From poetry slams, comedy, improv and concerts, there’s something here for everyone.  • Don’t lose your key or student ID or forget it in your room. UT will start charging you after the fourth time.  • The Freshmen Fifteen is real, so be careful with your meals. Try to make your own food in the morning so you can save your Dine In dollars and Bevo Bucks for lunch and dinner. Be sure to check which on-campus dining places take Bevo Bucks and which take Dine In Dollars because your money can run out quickly.  • Be aware of campus dining schedules. They’re not all the same, and nothing’s more disappointing than walking across campus with an empty stomach to a closed dining hall.  • If you’re planning on moving off campus in the future, plan early. West campus is a prime location for student living, and people start signing leases for the following year as early as October.   @thedailytexan  @UTHousing Bring silverware — Joy Puder (@JoyPuder) August 20, 2015     Connecting to Campus  • Check out the organization fairs throughout the year. Party on the Plaza, an event where students promote their organizations, takes place Sept. 2 at the Gregory Gym Plaza. UT has over 1,100 student organizations. Attending information sessions and trying out different clubs is a guaranteed way to make friends.  • If you don’t find one you like, start your own. Check out the full list of student organizations on HornsLink.  • Understand that no one has friends during Moov-In week. Reach out to classmates online and in person. Campus Facebook groups can be helpful for finding people who share similar interests, hear about cool events on and off campus and buy and sell items you might need throughout the year. And don’t be afraid to befriend upperclassmen, too.   @thedailytexan make friends in your classes and study with them! — Carter Smith (@CarterSaucy) August 22, 2015    Health & Safety  • Don’t pull consecutive all-nighters. Every once in a while might work depending on your needs, but sleep is a must.  • Use the University Health Center ­— appointments are usually only $10. If you are having health issues or feel like you need to talk to someone, the faculty is always there to listen.  • Set aside time to chill. Between classes, take a break in the Union recliners or nap on the second floor of the SAC.  • Anxiety is the number one mental health concern college students face. Don’t brush it off. If you can’t talk to a friend or family member about it, visit UT’s Mental Health Center or, if it’s urgent, call CMHC’s Crisis Helpline at (512) 471-3515. The services are confidential and great when you need to let college or life stress off your chest.  • If you go to parties, you should always have someone you can count on to be there with you. If things get weird or you’re ready to leave, you won’t have to head out into the Austin streets alone.       View the discussion thread.

The ads emphasize how the university and Austin together forge a dynamic, creative and diverse community that few American cities can match. Screen shot of Tower and view of Austin's skyline from Town Lake in Soul video The 30-second spots were produced in conjunction with the strategic planning and positioning firm GSD&M Advertising. The series incorporates a new theme, "What Starts Here Changes the World," developed by the university's Office of Public Affairs and the Center for Brand Research in concert with GSD&M, in a year-long project led by Advertising Professors Neal Burns and Deborah Morrison. "Austin, Texas is the 'City of Ideas'—a city that brings the doers and dreamers together to see new things, dream new dreams and create things and experiences that make a difference," said Roy Spence, founder and president of GSD&M Advertising. "The heartbeat of this City of Ideas is the University of Texas, a place of learning, discovery, leadership, freedom and responsibility, where everyone is a student of both our proud heritage as well as a seeker of what is next. The University of Texas and the City of Ideas, working, living and learning together. What starts here changes the world—that is what this new campaign for the University of Texas is all about." "What starts here at UT is an amazing array of life-altering events," said Morrison, associate professor of advertising. "Certainly, this theme speaks to that energy and optimism." Air time for the ad spots, which typically are broadcast during televised NCAA sporting events, is provided to the participating universities free of charge. http://www.utexas.edu/what-starts-here                    0:31   Play next Play now        What Starts Here Changes The World - Breakfast Tacos - Duration: 31 seconds.
