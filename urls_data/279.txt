About four in ten people who have had a stroke, go on to have another one within ten years. It is important to reduce your risk of having another stroke.  The ways to reduce your risk of another stroke is the same as for preventing stroke in the first place. However, given you have a higher risk due to your stroke or TIA it is more important you review your risk factors, change to a healthier lifestyle, and take all the medications you have been prescribed.  After a stroke or TIA you should be taking medication to reduce blood pressure and cholesterol as well as medication to reduce the blood from clotting unless clearly advised not to by your doctor.

The best defense against recurrent stroke is good offense. Equip yourself with information and tips for preventing another stroke. Be aware of your symptoms and risk factors. Managing your health will help reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.  Second stroke facts   Having a stroke means you have a greater risk for another (recurrent) stroke. The good news is that there are steps you can take to prevent a recurrent stroke. It has been suggested that 80% of secondary strokes can be prevented by a combination of lifestyle changes and medical interventions. Here are the facts:  Approximately 795,000 Americans experience a stroke each year—about 185,000 of those strokes are recurrent strokes.  At least 1 in 4 (25%-35%) of the 795,000 Americans who have a stroke each year will have another stroke within their lifetime.  Within 5 years of a first stroke, the risk for another stroke can increase more than 40%.  Recurrent strokes often have a higher rate of death and disability because parts of the brain already injured by the original stroke may not be as resilient.  Within 5 years of a stroke, 24% of women and 42% of men will experience a recurrent stroke.   Tips for managing recurrent stroke risk   Identify the risk factors that caused your first stroke. Once you have identified and discussed the causes with your healthcare professional, address each of risk factors individually and find ways to gain control so that you can be active in preventing a recurrent stroke. The strategies will be different for each risk factor. The goal is for you to make a plan and take control of your health.  Stop smoking — it doubles risk for another stroke. Download a fact sheet on how to stop smoking.  Manage high blood pressure — high blood pressure is the most important modifiable risk factor for stroke. People who have high blood pressure have at least one and a half times the risk of having a stroke. Download a high blood pressure brochure .  Medications — Take medication as prescribed as this is critical to recovery and recurrent stroke prevention. Research shows that at least a quarter of stroke survivors stop taking one or more of their prescribed stroke prevention medications within the first three months — when the chance of having another stroke is highest—after having a stroke.  Manage high cholesterol — cholesterol or plaque build-up in the arteries can block normal blood flow to the brain and cause a stroke and increase risk of heart disease. Download a cholesterol brochure .  Keep diabetes under control — people with diabetes are up to 4 times as likely to have a stroke as someone who does not have the disease. Download a fact sheet about diabetes and stroke risk .  Manage atrial fibrillation (Afib) — Afib, a type of irregular heartbeat, increases your stroke risk five times, so it’s important to work with a healthcare professional to control it. Download an Afib fact sheet .  Eat a healthy diet — maintaining a diet low in calories, saturated fats, trans-fats and cholesterol helps manage both obesity and healthy cholesterol levels in the blood, which also reduces risk for stroke. Download a healthy eating fact sheet .  Increase physical activity — A recent study showed that people who exercise five or more times per week are less likely to have another stroke. Read more tips for how to incorporate physical exercise into your daily routine .  Control alcohol use — some studies say that drinking more than 2 drinks per day may increase stroke risk by 50 percent. Talk with your healthcare professional about alcohol use and how it can best be controlled to prevent another stroke. Find out the risk factors that caused your first stroke. Take control and live your best life .

The best defense against recurrent stroke is good offense. Equip yourself with information and tips for preventing another stroke. Be aware of your symptoms and risk factors. Managing your health will help reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.  Second stroke facts   Having a stroke means you have a greater risk for another (recurrent) stroke. The good news is that there are steps you can take to prevent a recurrent stroke. It has been suggested that 80% of secondary strokes can be prevented by a combination of lifestyle changes and medical interventions. Here are the facts:  Approximately 795,000 Americans experience a stroke each year—about 185,000 of those strokes are recurrent strokes.  At least 1 in 4 (25%-35%) of the 795,000 Americans who have a stroke each year will have another stroke within their lifetime.  Within 5 years of a first stroke, the risk for another stroke can increase more than 40%.  Recurrent strokes often have a higher rate of death and disability because parts of the brain already injured by the original stroke may not be as resilient.  Within 5 years of a stroke, 24% of women and 42% of men will experience a recurrent stroke.   Tips for managing recurrent stroke risk   Identify the risk factors that caused your first stroke. Once you have identified and discussed the causes with your healthcare professional, address each of risk factors individually and find ways to gain control so that you can be active in preventing a recurrent stroke. The strategies will be different for each risk factor. The goal is for you to make a plan and take control of your health.  Stop smoking — it doubles risk for another stroke. Download a fact sheet on how to stop smoking.  Manage high blood pressure — high blood pressure is the most important modifiable risk factor for stroke. People who have high blood pressure have at least one and a half times the risk of having a stroke. Download a high blood pressure brochure .  Medications — Take medication as prescribed as this is critical to recovery and recurrent stroke prevention. Research shows that at least a quarter of stroke survivors stop taking one or more of their prescribed stroke prevention medications within the first three months — when the chance of having another stroke is highest—after having a stroke.  Manage high cholesterol — cholesterol or plaque build-up in the arteries can block normal blood flow to the brain and cause a stroke and increase risk of heart disease. Download a cholesterol brochure .  Keep diabetes under control — people with diabetes are up to 4 times as likely to have a stroke as someone who does not have the disease. Download a fact sheet about diabetes and stroke risk .  Manage atrial fibrillation (Afib) — Afib, a type of irregular heartbeat, increases your stroke risk five times, so it’s important to work with a healthcare professional to control it. Download an Afib fact sheet .  Eat a healthy diet — maintaining a diet low in calories, saturated fats, trans-fats and cholesterol helps manage both obesity and healthy cholesterol levels in the blood, which also reduces risk for stroke. Download a healthy eating fact sheet .  Increase physical activity — A recent study showed that people who exercise five or more times per week are less likely to have another stroke. Read more tips for how to incorporate physical exercise into your daily routine .  Control alcohol use — some studies say that drinking more than 2 drinks per day may increase stroke risk by 50 percent. Talk with your healthcare professional about alcohol use and how it can best be controlled to prevent another stroke. Find out the risk factors that caused your first stroke.

These three tips will help you stay healthier if you’ve experienced a stroke -- or if you'd like to reduce your risk of illness.       Stroke is serious business. It’s the second leading cause of death in the world and fifth in the United States.  Even after surviving a stroke, you’re not out of the woods, since having one makes it a lot more likely that you’ll have another. In fact, of the 795,000 Americans who will have a first stroke this year, 23 percent will suffer a second stroke.  What can stroke patients do to avoid a recurrence?  It turns out that stroke has a lot in common, risk-wise, with diabetes, cardiovascular problems, hypertension and other chronic conditions. Here are three ways to strike out a second stroke (or avoid stroke altogether):  1. Stop smoking.  The list of illnesses caused or worsened by smoking is a long one. Cutting out tobacco eases dangerous stress on the blood vessels in your brain—as well as in your heart and elsewhere. You’ll also lower your risk for a range of cancers.  2. Take your medicine.  If your doctor has prescribed medicine to help you control your cholesterol, blood pressure, or diabetes, don’t slack off or skip doses.  Not taking your medicine is an important risk factor for repeat stroke. According to one study in patients with coronary artery disease, those patients who took 75 percent or less of their medications as prescribed had a four times higher risk of stroke than patients who took their medications exactly as directed.  Even if you’re recovering from a stroke and you feel better, it’s essential to keep high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and diabetes under control by taking every pill you’re prescribed every time and not discontinuing medications until your doctor gives you the go-ahead.  Prescription medications can’t cure you of these chronic problems, but they can lower the risk of bad consequences such as stroke, secondary stroke and heart attack.  3. Go Mediterranean.  A recently published study by Johns Hopkins stroke expert Victor C. Urrutia, with Jennifer Dearborn and Walter Kernan from Yale University School of Medicine showed that stroke patients can likely prevent another occurrence by eating well.  Although it’s difficult to capture data on people’s long-term dietary habits, the researchers pooled results from a number of studies and found that a diet rich in fruit and vegetables was associated with a 21 percent lower risk of stroke.  The study found that, “Dietary patterns consumed along the Mediterranean, consisting of abundant fruits and vegetables [and] whole grains and low in processed foods, with a substantial polyunsaturated source of fat, such as olive oil, are consistently associated with reduced rate of stroke.”  Avoid a second stroke -- or a first  All three of these healthy habits can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. They’re useful for those who have had a stroke and want to prevent a recurrence, and also for those who are stroke-free and want to stay that way.

Episode number: 205       Topics:   Aging Neurological Disorders         Transcript:  Stroke (transcript)         A stroke is the interruption of the flow of blood to any part of the brain, which causes damage to brain tissue.  Today, some call a stroke a "brain attack" to illustrate its seriousness and its relationship to heart attack (the interruption of blood flow to the heart).  Stroke causes one out every fifteen deaths in the U.S., is the third leading cause of death in most developed countries, and the leading cause of disability in adults. The damage to brain tissue can lead to various problems, such as impaired speech and mobility, changes in vision, reflexes, and eye movements, decreased sensation, and weakness or even paralysis in one side of the body. In most cases, the blood flow is interrupted by a blood clot blocking an artery in the brain or leading to the brain.  There are four main arteries leading to the brain: two carotid arteries in the front of the neck and two vertebral arteries in the back of the neck.  Blockage in these arteries, especially in the carotid arteries, is often caused by atherosclerosis, an accumulation of "plaque" (deposits of fat) on the inside wall of the arteries; this is the same condition that can lead to heart attack.  The type of stroke caused by blockage in an artery is called an ischemic stroke. There is a second, less common type, called a hemorrhagic stroke, in which the blood flow is interrupted by bleeding in the brain, caused by a ruptured blood vessel. The risk factors (things that increase your chance of getting a disease) for stroke include: High blood pressure: This is the leading modifiable risk factor for stroke. Age: The chance of having a stroke goes up with age and doubles for every decade after 55. Family history: The chance of having a stroke goes up (is higher than average) if your family members had one. High cholesterol: This can cause fat to build up in the arteries, leading to blockage and stroke (as well as heart attack). Diabetes:  This disease can cause high blood pressure, blocked arteries (atherosclerosis), and inability to break down blood clots. Heart disease:  This disease can result from atherosclerosis and doubles your risk of stroke. Smoking: Cigarette smoke damages the cardiovascular system, which can lead to heart disease and stroke. Previous stroke:  Having a stroke places you at higher risk of having another one, compared to people who have not had a stroke. Race: The chance of getting the disease is higher for African-Americans because they have a higher rate of diabetes and high blood pressure. Certain medications: Among the drugs that promote clot formation are birth control pills, especially if you're over 35 and a smoker.  But newer, low dose pills create a much lower risk. Gender: Generally, men are more likely to have a stroke, women are more likely to die of one, and women have a higher than normal risk during pregnancy and the weeks immediately after it. Life style:  Among life style risk factors are smoking, alcohol abuse, illicit drugs such as cocaine, and uncontrolled stress. There are preventative measures (things that decrease your risk of getting a disease) you can take against stroke.  For information about them, go to Key Point 3.  Quick Facts A stroke is not a death sentence, nor does it necessarily mean you must live with diminished capabilities. Preventative measures, such as taking medicines and making some lifestyle changes, can prevent a first or second stroke; today's rehabilitation facilities and techniques can help stroke patients greatly improve their physical and mental abilities. Most of the steps you can take to prevent a stroke will also help prevent heart attack.  So you get "double benefits" when you: keep your blood pressure under control keep your cholesterol under control eat a "head-healthy" and heart-healthy low fat diet get more physical exercise stop smoking stop drinking alcohol heavily The body manufactures more cholesterol at night than during the day.  Therefore, cholesterol lowering medicines are most effective when taken during the evening, at dinner or before bed. A transient ischemic attack or TIA is a temporary disturbance in brain function that creates stroke-like symptoms, such as dizziness, loss of ability to speak or walk, mental confusion, weakness, etc.  But these symptoms usually last for less than 24 hours and possibly as short as a few minutes. A TIA may not be serious in itself, but it's a warning sign that a person may be a potential stroke victim. Angioplasty is the process of opening or widening a narrowed blood vessel. First used in the 1970s to treat coronary artery disease, it is now used to open the carotid arteries that carry blood to the brain, to prevent stroke. Recently, the procedure has included the placement of a stent. A stent is an object put inside a blood vessel to keep it open and unblocked.  It's usually a tiny tube made of a metallic mesh and looks something like a wire cage or spring. Ignore television commercials for prescription drugs.  The "pill" advertised may not be appropriate for your problem, and probably will have side effects.  Get your medical treatment from your doctor, not your television. *Quick Facts have been reviewed by Medical Advisors and are current as of October 2005. Ask Your Doctor This list of questions is a good starting point for discussion with your doctor. However, it is not a comprehensive list. What life-style changes (such as diet, exercise, etc.) should I make to prevent a stroke? What medications can I take to make to prevent a stroke? What kind of services are available to people who have had a stroke? What kind of services are available to those taking care of people who have had a stroke? What are the treatment options, and what are their benefits, risks, and side effects? What follow-up care will I need? If I have pain, how will it be managed? Am I a good candidate for a clinical trial? What will the recovery period be like? Key Point 1 Time is essential.  You have a very limited period of time to restore blood flow to the brain before the injury is irreversible.  You must know what a stroke looks like and get to a hospital. The sudden occurrence of one or more of the following may be symptoms of a stroke: Numbness, weakness, or tingling in the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body) Changes in vision, double vision, blurriness, loss of vision in one or both eyes Confusion or problems with judgment, memory, spatial orientation, or perception Difficulty with or inability to walk, loss of balance, and dizziness Difficulty with or inability to speak or understand Difficulty with swallowing Dizziness, loss of balance, coordination or consciousness Drowsiness or lethargy Mood changes (sudden depression or apathy) Severe, sudden headache, possibly along with pain between the eyes, in the face, or a stiff neck, and vomiting or altered consciousness Note that the key words for all symptoms are sudden onset.  Slowly developing problems in any of these areas are probably not symptoms of a stroke.  Furthermore, a condition called a transient ischemic attack or TIA creates symptoms that mimic a stroke, but they usually last for less than 24 hours (possibly as short as a few minutes).  A TIA is a temporary loss of or disturbance in brain function.  In itself it may not be serious, but it is a warning sign that you could have stroke in the future. A number of tests can be used to decide the type and cause of a stroke, and the specific areas of the brain that have been affected. Most of these tests create images of the brain and the arteries that feed it.  They could also be used before a stroke to look for blockages in the carotid arteries.  Among the imaging techniques used are arteriography, computerized tomographic angiography (a form of CT scanning with a dye injected into the vein), MRI, and ultrasound.  For information about them, go to Key Point #2. One of the most effective ways to limit the effects of a stroke is to begin treatment as quickly as possible.  A stroke is the interruption of the flow of blood to any part of the brain, which damages brain tissue.  The longer the delay before treatment begins, the more damage to the brain tissue.  The interruption in blood flow is caused either by a blood clot or other particles blocking the arteries that carry blood to the brain (an ischemic stroke) or by bleeding in the brain, caused by a ruptured blood vessel or an injury (a hemorrhagic stroke). So the goal of emergency treatment is to find out what kind of stroke the person is having and then take appropriate measures to stop it by dissolving the blood clot or stopping the bleeding. Ischemic strokes can be stopped by using a class of drugs known as thrombolytics or clot busting medicines.  Injected directly into a vein, they can break up or dissolve blood clots, thus removing the blockage and restoring blood flow to the brain.  The most widely used is called TPA (for tissue plasminogen activator).  However, TPA must be given within three hours of the start of symptoms.  After three hours, the benefits of dissolving the clot no longer outweigh the risk of hemorrhage (N.B. There really is no debate about IV TPA after 3 hours-it is contraindicated. ) Further, because of potential side effects and risks, some people who have had an ischemic stroke are not ideal candidates for thrombolytics even within three hours. Doctors must understand the details of each individual case before giving the drugs. For example, if your blood pressure is uncontrollable when they're being considered, your doctor may not use them. Finally, before any thrombolytics can be given, it must be certain that the person is having an ischemic stroke.  If the stroke is caused by bleeding, the drugs could make things worse. Other possible drugs to treat ischemic strokes include blood thinners, such as heparin and coumadin, and aspirin and other anti-platelet agents. Hemorrhagic strokes are caused by bleeding. One of the most common types of hemorrhagic stroke is due to high blood pressure.  Tiny blood vessels deep in the brain can rupture, causing bleeding into the brain tissue.  This type of bleeding is often called "intracerebral hemorrhage".  Another type of  bleeding may be caused by a ruptured.(broken), badly formed blood vessel.  This type of blood vessel is called an AVM, for "arteriovenous malformation."  Some AVMs can be removed by surgery, and that may be a way of preventing a possible stroke.  But if an AVM is too large or found deep within the brain, surgery may not be possible.  There are other possible treatments for AVMs, including procedures that shrink them by blocking the arteries that supply them with blood. Another possible cause of a hemorrhagic stroke is an aneurysm, a localized, blood-filled dilatation (swelling) of a blood vessel caused by a disease or the weakening of the vessel's wall.  Again, there are a number of surgical treatments for aneurysms, including aneurysm clipping (the aneurysm is clamped shut, preventing it from getting blood from the artery it's attached to) and aneurysm embolization (a tiny coil is put into the aneurysm which makes it clot, preventing blood from nearby arteries getting into it). A hemorrhagic stroke may also require surgery to remove blood that has pooled in the brain during the stroke. After a stroke, the emphasis should be on preventing a second stroke (about 25 % of people who recover from a first stroke will have a second within 5 years) and rehabilitation.  Rehabilitation obviously depends on the type of disability the person has, and can include speech, occupational, and physical therapy.  About 10% of those who have had a stroke recover most or all of their abilities; 50% can remain at home with medical assistance; 40% move to long-term care facilities.  Unquestionably, however, a supportive family, friends and environment can help stroke patients in their recovery. For links to information about long-term recovery go to Resources.  Key Point 2 Treatment of an ischemic stroke is the restoration of blood flow to the brain to prevent and minimize damage. A blockage is usually caused by atherosclerosis, an accumulation of "plaque" (deposits of fat) in the arteries that narrows them, reducing blood flow, or by blood clots in the arteries.  The plaque not only blocks the blood flow itself, it can also help create a clot because it forces the blood to flow abnormally.  A clot that stays in one place (usually the place it was formed) is called a thrombus.  A clot that breaks loose, travels to another spot, and wedges itself into a narrower blood vessel, is called an embolism. The first indication that an artery may be blocked can be an abnormally loud, harsh noise coming from it, heard through a stethoscope during a physical examination. This noise is called a bruit (pronounced "bru-we").  The next step can be one or more tests to look at the arteries that feed the brain and measure the amount and type of blockage in them.  They're the same type of diagnostic imaging tests now used to diagnose a wide range of conditions, including heart problems.  They include: Carotid arteriogram (also called carotid angiogram): This is an x-ray of the carotid arteries to look for blockages. A catheter (a small tube) is inserted through a small incision into a blood vessel and threaded up into the carotid arteries. A contrast dye is then injected into the catheter to make blockages more visible on the x-ray. Carotid ultrasound:  Many people are familiar with ultrasound imaging used with pregnant women to produce images of fetuses.  Similarly, carotid ultrasound produces pictures of the carotid arteries.  High-frequency sound waves are sent into the neck, pass through the tissue, and then bounce back.  The results are images that show any narrowing or clotting in the carotid arteries. Computerized tomography angiography (CTA):  Many people are also familiar with CT scanning (often called "CAT scanning") which produces detailed images of organs and tissues.  CTA is a form of CT scanning that uses dyes injected into the bloodstream to make blockages and other problems more visible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This technique uses a strong magnetic field to create a three-dimensional view of the brain to look for the areas damaged by a stroke. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) combines an MRI with an injected dye to better see the arteries in the neck and brain. It is used to determine if the stroke was caused by bleeding (hemorrhage) or other lesions and to define the location and extent of the stroke. If these tests show that either of the two carotid arteries are narrowed, a physical intervention to remove the blockage may be needed.  When an individual has symptoms of a stroke or TIA from a carotid artery that is over 70% blocked, evidence suggests that those individuals should strongly consider undergoing an operation to remove the blockage.  If the individual has not had any symptoms from the severe blockage, or if the amount of blockage is less severe (50-70%), decisions about surgery should be individualized, depending on unique patient characteristics and preferences. The process of removing the blockage is called carotid revascularization.  Currently, one of two approaches is generally followed. One approach is an operation called a carotid endarterectomy (CEA).  The surgeon opens the affected artery and physically removes the blockage – the plaque, clot, etc. Studies show that this procedure reduces the risk of stroke and is especially helpful to people with severe blockages, even if they have no symptoms at all.  Although all surgery has general and specific risks (the specific risks for carotid endarterectomy is that the surgery itself might cause a stroke or heart attack), the risks for CEA are not great. The second approach is known as carotid artery stenting or carotid angioplasty-stent (CAS) and may be more appropriate than surgery in some patients.  Angioplasty is the process of opening or widening a narrowed blood vessel. The procedure was first used in the 1970s to treat coronary artery disease; now it has been extended to other arteries, including the carotid artery.  A catheter is threaded up into the arteries.  A tiny balloon at the end of the catheter is inflated to open the narrowed blood vessel.  The process may also involve using a tiny umbrella-like filter (called a "distal protection device") at the end of the catheter to catch any particles that break free from the artery and prevent them from traveling to and blocking some other blood vessel. A stent is an object put inside a blood vessel to keep it open and unblocked.  Today a stent is usually a tiny tube made of a metallic mesh that looks something like a wire cage or spring.  After a blocked blood vessel has been opened, a stent can be slid along the catheter and put in place to keep the vessel open.  Some stents are coated with medicines to help prevent further blockages. While carotid stenting is a newer technique and still under investigation, current research has shown it to be as effective as carotid endarterectomy in some cases and a less invasive form of surgery.  Meanwhile, other new techniques to remove clots, such as catheter embolectomy (using a catheter threaded into one of the carotid arteries to remove clots) are being explored.  Key Point 3 You may not have to have a stroke.  You've heard it before – control your blood pressure, control your cholesterol, stop smoking and keep your body to a healthy weight.  You can dramatically reduce the risk of having a stroke, along with preventing a heart attack, Type 2 diabetes and many other diseases. In general, to prevent stroke you shold: Know your risk factors and develop a plan, with your doctor, to reduce them; Learn more about the risk factors for stroke . Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease with lifestyle changes and medicines prescribed by your doctor. High blood pressure is the leading risk factor for stroke. But you can reduce your blood pressure by making some simple lifestyle changes. Stop smoking. Don't abuse alcohol (no more than 1 to 2 drinks per day). Eat a low-fat diet. Minimize the amount of sodium in your diet. Sodium is found in table salt (chemical name, sodium chloride), so minimize the amount of salt you eat; avoid salty snacks. Exercise often, on a regular schedule. Lose weight if you're overweight. Reduce and manage stress by changing your lifestyle and simplifying your life, exercising and using relaxation techniques. There are also prescription medicines that help reduce blood pressure, such as: Diuretics ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors Angiotensin receptor blockers Beta-blockers Calcium channel blockers You should discuss these medicines with your doctor, who will prescribe what's appropriate for you.  You can get more information about them at Medline Plus, an on-line service of the National Library of Medicine, the National Institutes of Health, and other government agencies and health-related organizations. Most strokes are caused by a blood clot or atherosclerosis (fatty build-up) blocking the flow of blood through arteries leading to the brain.   Atherosclerosis is the same condition that can also cause a heart attack.  High levels of LDL-cholesterol (commonly called "bad cholesterol") are a major cause of atherosclerosis. Therefore, two other types of  stroke preventing medicines are those that: reduce blood clotting reduce LDL-cholesterol, plaque and atherosclerosis The first type, prescription anti-clotting medicines, include anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and thrombolytics. Like all prescription medicines, they must be used properly, following all of your doctor's recommendations and precautions. Anticoagulants decrease the blood's ability to form clots.  They're often called "blood thinners," though they don't actually thin the blood, nor do they dissolve clots already present. Antiplatelets stop blood platelets (substances in blood that promote clotting) from clumping together to form clots. Thrombolytics are often called "clot busters" because they break up or dissolve already existing blood clots.  For information about them, go to Key Point 1. Aspirin is a non-prescription antiplatelet medicine.  But even though it is available over-the-counter, it may not be appropriate because it increases the risk of bleeding. Do not "self-medicate" yourself with aspirin.  Instead, talk to your doctor about its risks and benefits. The second type of medicine, prescription LDL-cholesterol reducing drugs, include statins, bile acid sequestrants, and fibrates. Statins are currently considered the most important and effective group of LDL-cholesterol reducing medicines. They slow cholesterol production and increase the liver's ability to remove the LDL-cholesterol already there.  Because the body makes more cholesterol at night, these drugs are usually taken in the evening, at dinner or before bed.  Side effects appear to be minimal and studies show that people using statins have reported 20 to 60 percent lower LDL-cholesterol levels. As of this writing, five statin drugs are available in the U. S.: lovastatin simvastatin pravastatin fluvastatin atorvastatin Bile acid sequestrants bind with bile acids in the intestines that contain cholesterol.  Then they are eliminated during defecation, reducing the amount of cholesterol in the blood.  Often, these drugs are prescribed in combination with statins.  As of this writing, three main bile acid sequestrants are available here: cholestyramine, colestipol colesevelam Fibrates lower the level of triglycerides (the main component of  fat and therefore another major cause of atherosclerosis) in the blood. Nicotinic acid is a non-prescription cholesterol lowering substance.  It's a form of niacin, the water-soluble B vitamin.  When taken in high doses, well above the suggested daily amount, it can be effective in lowering LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  Note that there's another form of niacin, nicotinamide, that doesn't lower cholesterol and shouldn't be used instead of nicotinic acid.  Further, high doses of nicotinic acid can have side effects.  Do not "self-medicate" yourself with Vitamin B.  Instead, talk to your doctor about its risks and benefits. In addition to all these preventative measures, there are also physical ways to unblock an artery, including surgery and a procedure called "stenting."  For information about them, go to Key Point  2.

En Español By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter THURSDAY, June 16, 2005 (HealthDayNews) -- People who have had a minor stroke have a 43 percent risk of another, potentially fatal stroke within 10 years, Dutch researchers report. While deaths from cerebrovascular disease have dropped around the world, stroke remains a serious neurological problem, leaving many patients with a chronic disability. After a stroke, or transient ischemic attack (TIA), secondary stroke prevention is standard practice. But many patients have a recurrent stroke or other vascular complications, according to the report in the June 18 issue of The Lancet . "The risk for a vascular event is very high in these people," said study author Dr. Ale Algra, of the Julius Centre for Health Sciences and Primary Care at the University Medical Centre Utrecht. In their study, Algra and his colleagues collected data on 2,447 patients who had had a minor stroke, which is a transient stroke that lasts only a few minutes. These patients had participated in the Dutch TIA Trial. After a follow-up of 10.1 years, 60 percent of the patients had died and 54 percent had had at least one vascular event. This is twice as many deaths as would be seen in the general population, Algra said. The 10-year risk of death was 42.7 percent, Algra's team found. The risk of a vascular event was highest shortly after the stroke, reached its lowest point about three years later, and then gradually rose again, the researchers said.  Given these findings, Algra believes more emphasis should placed on preventing second strokes. "People should pay attention to secondary prevention," he said. "This includes lifestyle, as well as drug therapy." In terms of lifestyle, Algra suggested exercising, eating a healthy diet, and not smoking. In addition, doctors should work to keep their patients' blood pressure and cholesterol low and prescribe aspirin or other drugs to prevent blood from clotting in the small arteries. "All these measures together may decrease the risks of new vascular events," he said. One expert agrees that secondary prevention after a minor stroke is often overlooked. "This study makes us say 'Holy moly, these early risks of recurrence are very high,'" said Dr. Lawrence M. Brass, a professor of neurology and epidemiology and public health at Yale University School of Medicine. For the medical community, Brass thinks this study sends a strong message that secondary stroke prevention needs to be a priority. "Often the approach of many physicians is, 'You've had a TIA. Let's put you on an aspirin and send you on your way,'" he said. "This data indicates that half these people are going to be dead in five years, and a similar portion may have another stroke. You've really got to do more than just this." Brass noted there are many things doctors can do that are often not done to help prevent second, fatal strokes, such as monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol. "This is a real wake-up call," Brass said. "We've got to get our butts in gear to make sure we are doing things appropriately." Patients, too, can play a role in preventing the recurrence of stroke, Brass said. "Patients should know what their risk is, and know what they and their doctors are doing about it," he said.  "People need to realize that heart attack and stroke are going to kill me, not dirt on the oranges or something else. This is what's going to kill more Americans than anything else," Brass said. "You need to be an active advocate and say to your doctor, 'What are my risks for heart attack and stroke? What are we doing to prevent it? What more can we do to prevent it?'"

Be aware of the medications that have been prescribed to your loved one and their side effects. Ask if your home should be modified to meet the specific needs of the stroke survivor. Ask a doctor, nurse or therapist to clarify any unanswered questions or to provide written information that explains what occurs after the stroke and during recovery or rehabilitation.   Reduce risks, or stroke may strike again. Survivors who have had one stroke are at high risk of having another one if the treatment recommendations are not followed. Make sure your loved one eats a healthy diet, exercises (taking walks is great exercise), takes medications as prescribed, and has regular visits with their physician to help prevent a second stroke.   Many factors influence recovery. Recovery depends on many different factors: where in the brain the stroke occurred, how much of the brain was affected, the patient’s motivation, caregiver support, the quantity and quality of rehabilitation, and how healthy the survivor was before the stroke.  Because every stroke and stroke survivor is unique, avoid comparisons.   Gains can happen quickly or over time. The most rapid recovery usually occurs during the first three to four months after a stroke, but some stroke survivors continue to recover well into the first and second year post-stroke.   Some signs point to physical therapy. Caregivers should consider seeking assistance from a physical or occupational therapist if their loved one has any of these complaints: dizziness; imbalance that results in falls, difficulty walking or moving around in daily life; inability to walk six minutes without stopping to rest; inability to do things that he/she enjoys like recreational activities or outings with family or increased need for help to engage in daily activities.   Don’t ignore falls. Falls after stroke are common. If a fall is serious and results in severe pain, bruising or bleeding, go the Emergency Department for treatment. If a loved one experiences minor falls (with no injury) that occur more than two times within six months, see your physician or the physical therapist for treatment.   Measuring progress matters. How much acute rehabilitation therapy your loved one receives depends partly on his/her rate of improvement. Stroke survivors on an acute rehabilitation unit are expected to make measurable functional gains every week as measured by the Functional Independence Measure Score (FIMS). Functional improvements include activities of daily living skills, mobility skills and communication skills. The typical rehabilitation expectation is improving 1 to 2 FIM points per day.   A change in abilities can trigger a change in services. Medicare coverage for rehabilitation therapies may be available if your loved one’s physical function has changed. It there appears to be improvement or a decline in motor skills, speech or self-care since the last time the patient was in therapy, he/she may be eligible for more services.   Monitor changes in attitude and behavior . Evaluate whether your loved one is showing signs of emotional lability (when a person has difficulty controlling their emotions). Consult a physician to develop a plan of action.   Stop depression before it hinders recovery. Post-stroke depression is common, with as many as 30–50 percent of stroke survivors developing depression in the early or later phases post stroke. Post-stroke depression can significantly affect your loved one’s recovery and rehabilitation.  Consult a physician to develop a plan of action.   Seek out support. Community resources, such as stroke survivor and caregiver support groups, are available for you and your loved one. Stay in touch with a case manager, social worker or discharge planner who can help you find resources in your community.   Learn the ins and outs of  insurance coverage. Be sure to consult with your loved-one’s doctor, case manager or social worker to find how much and how long insurance will pay for rehabilitation services. Rehabilitation services can vary substantially from one case to another. Clarify what medical and rehabilitation services are available for hospital and outpatient care. Determine the length of coverage provided from your insurance (private or government supported) and what out-of-pocket expenses you can expect.   Know when to enlist help. If rehabilitation services are denied due to lack of “medical necessity,” ask your loved one’s physician to intervene on his or her behalf. Ask the physician to provide records to the insurance carrier and, if needed, follow up yourself by calling the insurance company.   Know your rights. You have rights to access your loved-one’s medical and rehabilitation records. You are entitled to copies of the medical records, including written notes and brain imaging films.   Take care of you. Take a break from caregiving by asking another family member, friend or neighbor to help while you take time for yourself. Keep balance in your life by eating right, exercising or walking daily, and getting adequate rest.     This content was last reviewed on 07/31/2013.

I've had a stroke               A stroke is not something you prepare for. So you’re going to have a lot of questions when it happens. That’s why we’re here. We have lots of information to help you understand what’s happened and get the support you need.  Here we’ve tackled some of the questions that you're likely to have, including details of how to find out more.                          What’s happened?      Because a stroke happens so quickly, people sometimes leave hospital without being completely sure what’s happened or why. You need to understand what a stroke is and the things that make it more likely to happen, so that you can do all you can to reduce the risk of it happening again.                          Will I get better?      Because every stroke is different, there is no set pattern for recovering from one. So it can be difficult to say how well or how quickly you’ll recover.  It’s likely that you’ll see some immediate recovery in the first few days and weeks after your stroke. After this early burst of recovery, progress tends to slow down. This is normal and doesn’t mean that you won’t recover any further.  Getting better will involve rehabilitation , which is about overcoming and adapting to the effects of your stroke. Your therapists will give you exercises and advice to help your relearn abilities you have lost and how you new ways of doing things. Starting your rehabilitation as soon as possible after your stroke will help to avoid further problems from developing and give you the best chances for recovery.                          Will I have another stroke?      For many stroke survivors, their greatest fear is having another stroke.  Once you’ve had a stroke your risk of having another is increased, but understanding what factors may have caused your stroke will help you know how to reduce your risk  of having another one. If you’re not clear, go back to your GP and ask for more information about your own risk of a stroke.                          How do I cope with what’s happened?      Stroke brings a lot of questions and uncertainty with it. Coping with this can be overwhelming for both you and the people around you. Fear of another stroke, anger and grief about the things you’ve lost, shock and helplessness are all natural emotions to have after a stroke.  Coping with these emotions is not easy. If you’re struggling, you need to speak up. Your doctors, family or friends may not think to ask about how you are feeling, but there is support available if you need it.  Talking to your doctors and therapists and getting answers to your questions will help you feel more in control of your situation and help you plan for the future. Talk to your social worker about the support you can get when you return home , as well as the financial support  that’s available.                          Five things you need to know      Don’t be afraid to ask questions, even if it’s weeks or months later. It’s important that you understand what happened and why.  Coping with the impact of stroke is not easy but the best thing to do is talk about it – with the people around you and professionals who can offer support.  Friendships can slip away after a stroke but friends are important. Talk to them about what has happened as they may not appreciate the impact that your stroke has had on you.  Remember that recovery takes time and patience, as well as practice and determination. Some days will be harder than others but the important thing is to keep going.

Now you have had a stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA), your risk of having another stroke is higher than someone who has not had a stroke or mini stroke (TIA).  About four in ten people who have had a stroke, go on to have another one within ten years. It is important to reduce your risk of having another stroke.  The ways to reduce your risk of another stroke is the same as for preventing stroke in the first place. However, given you have a higher risk due to your stroke or TIA it is more important you review your risk factors, change to a healthier lifestyle, and take all the medications you have been prescribed.  After a stroke or TIA you should be taking medication to reduce blood pressure and cholesterol as well as medication to reduce the blood from clotting unless clearly advised not to by your doctor.

The best defense against recurrent stroke is good offense. Equip yourself with information and tips for preventing another stroke. Be aware of your symptoms and risk factors. Managing your health will help reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.  Second stroke facts   Having a stroke means you have a greater risk for another (recurrent) stroke. The good news is that there are steps you can take to prevent a recurrent stroke. It has been suggested that 80% of secondary strokes can be prevented by a combination of lifestyle changes and medical interventions. Here are the facts:  Approximately 795,000 Americans experience a stroke each year—about 185,000 of those strokes are recurrent strokes.  At least 1 in 4 (25%-35%) of the 795,000 Americans who have a stroke each year will have another stroke within their lifetime.  Within 5 years of a first stroke, the risk for another stroke can increase more than 40%.  Recurrent strokes often have a higher rate of death and disability because parts of the brain already injured by the original stroke may not be as resilient.  Within 5 years of a stroke, 24% of women and 42% of men will experience a recurrent stroke.   Tips for managing recurrent stroke risk   Identify the risk factors that caused your first stroke. Once you have identified and discussed the causes with your healthcare professional, address each of risk factors individually and find ways to gain control so that you can be active in preventing a recurrent stroke. The strategies will be different for each risk factor. The goal is for you to make a plan and take control of your health.  Stop smoking — it doubles risk for another stroke. Download a fact sheet on how to stop smoking.  Manage high blood pressure — high blood pressure is the most important modifiable risk factor for stroke. People who have high blood pressure have at least one and a half times the risk of having a stroke. Download a high blood pressure brochure .  Medications — Take medication as prescribed as this is critical to recovery and recurrent stroke prevention. Research shows that at least a quarter of stroke survivors stop taking one or more of their prescribed stroke prevention medications within the first three months — when the chance of having another stroke is highest—after having a stroke.  Manage high cholesterol — cholesterol or plaque build-up in the arteries can block normal blood flow to the brain and cause a stroke and increase risk of heart disease. Download a cholesterol brochure .  Keep diabetes under control — people with diabetes are up to 4 times as likely to have a stroke as someone who does not have the disease. Download a fact sheet about diabetes and stroke risk .  Manage atrial fibrillation (Afib) — Afib, a type of irregular heartbeat, increases your stroke risk five times, so it’s important to work with a healthcare professional to control it. Download an Afib fact sheet .  Eat a healthy diet — maintaining a diet low in calories, saturated fats, trans-fats and cholesterol helps manage both obesity and healthy cholesterol levels in the blood, which also reduces risk for stroke. Download a healthy eating fact sheet .  Increase physical activity — A recent study showed that people who exercise five or more times per week are less likely to have another stroke. Read more tips for how to incorporate physical exercise into your daily routine .  Control alcohol use — some studies say that drinking more than 2 drinks per day may increase stroke risk by 50 percent. Talk with your healthcare professional about alcohol use and how it can best be controlled to prevent another stroke. Find out the risk factors that caused your first stroke. Take control and live your best life .

Now you have had a stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA), your risk of having another stroke is higher than someone who has not had a stroke or mini stroke (TIA).  About four in ten people who have had a stroke, go on to have another one within ten years. It is important to reduce your risk of having another stroke.  The ways to reduce your risk of another stroke is the same as for preventing stroke in the first place. However, given you have a higher risk due to your stroke or TIA it is more important you review your risk factors, change to a healthier lifestyle, and take all the medications you have been prescribed.  After a stroke or TIA you should be taking medication to reduce blood pressure and cholesterol as well as medication to reduce the blood from clotting unless clearly advised not to by your doctor.

The best defense against recurrent stroke is good offense. Equip yourself with information and tips for preventing another stroke. Be aware of your symptoms and risk factors. Managing your health will help reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.  Second stroke facts   Having a stroke means you have a greater risk for another (recurrent) stroke. The good news is that there are steps you can take to prevent a recurrent stroke. It has been suggested that 80% of secondary strokes can be prevented by a combination of lifestyle changes and medical interventions. Here are the facts:  Approximately 795,000 Americans experience a stroke each year—about 185,000 of those strokes are recurrent strokes.  At least 1 in 4 (25%-35%) of the 795,000 Americans who have a stroke each year will have another stroke within their lifetime.  Within 5 years of a first stroke, the risk for another stroke can increase more than 40%.  Recurrent strokes often have a higher rate of death and disability because parts of the brain already injured by the original stroke may not be as resilient.  Within 5 years of a stroke, 24% of women and 42% of men will experience a recurrent stroke.   Tips for managing recurrent stroke risk   Identify the risk factors that caused your first stroke. Once you have identified and discussed the causes with your healthcare professional, address each of risk factors individually and find ways to gain control so that you can be active in preventing a recurrent stroke. The strategies will be different for each risk factor. The goal is for you to make a plan and take control of your health.  Stop smoking — it doubles risk for another stroke. Download a fact sheet on how to stop smoking.  Manage high blood pressure — high blood pressure is the most important modifiable risk factor for stroke. People who have high blood pressure have at least one and a half times the risk of having a stroke. Download a high blood pressure brochure .  Medications — Take medication as prescribed as this is critical to recovery and recurrent stroke prevention. Research shows that at least a quarter of stroke survivors stop taking one or more of their prescribed stroke prevention medications within the first three months — when the chance of having another stroke is highest—after having a stroke.  Manage high cholesterol — cholesterol or plaque build-up in the arteries can block normal blood flow to the brain and cause a stroke and increase risk of heart disease. Download a cholesterol brochure .  Keep diabetes under control — people with diabetes are up to 4 times as likely to have a stroke as someone who does not have the disease. Download a fact sheet about diabetes and stroke risk .  Manage atrial fibrillation (Afib) — Afib, a type of irregular heartbeat, increases your stroke risk five times, so it’s important to work with a healthcare professional to control it. Download an Afib fact sheet .  Eat a healthy diet — maintaining a diet low in calories, saturated fats, trans-fats and cholesterol helps manage both obesity and healthy cholesterol levels in the blood, which also reduces risk for stroke. Download a healthy eating fact sheet .  Increase physical activity — A recent study showed that people who exercise five or more times per week are less likely to have another stroke. Read more tips for how to incorporate physical exercise into your daily routine .  Control alcohol use — some studies say that drinking more than 2 drinks per day may increase stroke risk by 50 percent. Talk with your healthcare professional about alcohol use and how it can best be controlled to prevent another stroke. Find out the risk factors that caused your first stroke.

These three tips will help you stay healthier if you’ve experienced a stroke -- or if you'd like to reduce your risk of illness.       Stroke is serious business. It’s the second leading cause of death in the world and fifth in the United States.  Even after surviving a stroke, you’re not out of the woods, since having one makes it a lot more likely that you’ll have another. In fact, of the 795,000 Americans who will have a first stroke this year, 23 percent will suffer a second stroke.  What can stroke patients do to avoid a recurrence?  It turns out that stroke has a lot in common, risk-wise, with diabetes, cardiovascular problems, hypertension and other chronic conditions. Here are three ways to strike out a second stroke (or avoid stroke altogether):  1. Stop smoking.  The list of illnesses caused or worsened by smoking is a long one. Cutting out tobacco eases dangerous stress on the blood vessels in your brain—as well as in your heart and elsewhere. You’ll also lower your risk for a range of cancers.  2. Take your medicine.  If your doctor has prescribed medicine to help you control your cholesterol, blood pressure, or diabetes, don’t slack off or skip doses.  Not taking your medicine is an important risk factor for repeat stroke. According to one study in patients with coronary artery disease, those patients who took 75 percent or less of their medications as prescribed had a four times higher risk of stroke than patients who took their medications exactly as directed.  Even if you’re recovering from a stroke and you feel better, it’s essential to keep high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol and diabetes under control by taking every pill you’re prescribed every time and not discontinuing medications until your doctor gives you the go-ahead.  Prescription medications can’t cure you of these chronic problems, but they can lower the risk of bad consequences such as stroke, secondary stroke and heart attack.  3. Go Mediterranean.  A recently published study by Johns Hopkins stroke expert Victor C. Urrutia, with Jennifer Dearborn and Walter Kernan from Yale University School of Medicine showed that stroke patients can likely prevent another occurrence by eating well.  Although it’s difficult to capture data on people’s long-term dietary habits, the researchers pooled results from a number of studies and found that a diet rich in fruit and vegetables was associated with a 21 percent lower risk of stroke.  The study found that, “Dietary patterns consumed along the Mediterranean, consisting of abundant fruits and vegetables [and] whole grains and low in processed foods, with a substantial polyunsaturated source of fat, such as olive oil, are consistently associated with reduced rate of stroke.”  Avoid a second stroke -- or a first  All three of these healthy habits can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. They’re useful for those who have had a stroke and want to prevent a recurrence, and also for those who are stroke-free and want to stay that way.

Episode number: 205       Topics:   Aging Neurological Disorders         Transcript:  Stroke (transcript)         A stroke is the interruption of the flow of blood to any part of the brain, which causes damage to brain tissue.  Today, some call a stroke a "brain attack" to illustrate its seriousness and its relationship to heart attack (the interruption of blood flow to the heart).  Stroke causes one out every fifteen deaths in the U.S., is the third leading cause of death in most developed countries, and the leading cause of disability in adults. The damage to brain tissue can lead to various problems, such as impaired speech and mobility, changes in vision, reflexes, and eye movements, decreased sensation, and weakness or even paralysis in one side of the body. In most cases, the blood flow is interrupted by a blood clot blocking an artery in the brain or leading to the brain.  There are four main arteries leading to the brain: two carotid arteries in the front of the neck and two vertebral arteries in the back of the neck.  Blockage in these arteries, especially in the carotid arteries, is often caused by atherosclerosis, an accumulation of "plaque" (deposits of fat) on the inside wall of the arteries; this is the same condition that can lead to heart attack.  The type of stroke caused by blockage in an artery is called an ischemic stroke. There is a second, less common type, called a hemorrhagic stroke, in which the blood flow is interrupted by bleeding in the brain, caused by a ruptured blood vessel. The risk factors (things that increase your chance of getting a disease) for stroke include: High blood pressure: This is the leading modifiable risk factor for stroke. Age: The chance of having a stroke goes up with age and doubles for every decade after 55. Family history: The chance of having a stroke goes up (is higher than average) if your family members had one. High cholesterol: This can cause fat to build up in the arteries, leading to blockage and stroke (as well as heart attack). Diabetes:  This disease can cause high blood pressure, blocked arteries (atherosclerosis), and inability to break down blood clots. Heart disease:  This disease can result from atherosclerosis and doubles your risk of stroke. Smoking: Cigarette smoke damages the cardiovascular system, which can lead to heart disease and stroke. Previous stroke:  Having a stroke places you at higher risk of having another one, compared to people who have not had a stroke. Race: The chance of getting the disease is higher for African-Americans because they have a higher rate of diabetes and high blood pressure. Certain medications: Among the drugs that promote clot formation are birth control pills, especially if you're over 35 and a smoker.  But newer, low dose pills create a much lower risk. Gender: Generally, men are more likely to have a stroke, women are more likely to die of one, and women have a higher than normal risk during pregnancy and the weeks immediately after it. Life style:  Among life style risk factors are smoking, alcohol abuse, illicit drugs such as cocaine, and uncontrolled stress. There are preventative measures (things that decrease your risk of getting a disease) you can take against stroke.  For information about them, go to Key Point 3.  Quick Facts A stroke is not a death sentence, nor does it necessarily mean you must live with diminished capabilities. Preventative measures, such as taking medicines and making some lifestyle changes, can prevent a first or second stroke; today's rehabilitation facilities and techniques can help stroke patients greatly improve their physical and mental abilities. Most of the steps you can take to prevent a stroke will also help prevent heart attack.  So you get "double benefits" when you: keep your blood pressure under control keep your cholesterol under control eat a "head-healthy" and heart-healthy low fat diet get more physical exercise stop smoking stop drinking alcohol heavily The body manufactures more cholesterol at night than during the day.  Therefore, cholesterol lowering medicines are most effective when taken during the evening, at dinner or before bed. A transient ischemic attack or TIA is a temporary disturbance in brain function that creates stroke-like symptoms, such as dizziness, loss of ability to speak or walk, mental confusion, weakness, etc.  But these symptoms usually last for less than 24 hours and possibly as short as a few minutes. A TIA may not be serious in itself, but it's a warning sign that a person may be a potential stroke victim. Angioplasty is the process of opening or widening a narrowed blood vessel. First used in the 1970s to treat coronary artery disease, it is now used to open the carotid arteries that carry blood to the brain, to prevent stroke. Recently, the procedure has included the placement of a stent. A stent is an object put inside a blood vessel to keep it open and unblocked.  It's usually a tiny tube made of a metallic mesh and looks something like a wire cage or spring. Ignore television commercials for prescription drugs.  The "pill" advertised may not be appropriate for your problem, and probably will have side effects.  Get your medical treatment from your doctor, not your television. *Quick Facts have been reviewed by Medical Advisors and are current as of October 2005. Ask Your Doctor This list of questions is a good starting point for discussion with your doctor. However, it is not a comprehensive list. What life-style changes (such as diet, exercise, etc.) should I make to prevent a stroke? What medications can I take to make to prevent a stroke? What kind of services are available to people who have had a stroke? What kind of services are available to those taking care of people who have had a stroke? What are the treatment options, and what are their benefits, risks, and side effects? What follow-up care will I need? If I have pain, how will it be managed? Am I a good candidate for a clinical trial? What will the recovery period be like? Key Point 1 Time is essential.  You have a very limited period of time to restore blood flow to the brain before the injury is irreversible.  You must know what a stroke looks like and get to a hospital. The sudden occurrence of one or more of the following may be symptoms of a stroke: Numbness, weakness, or tingling in the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body) Changes in vision, double vision, blurriness, loss of vision in one or both eyes Confusion or problems with judgment, memory, spatial orientation, or perception Difficulty with or inability to walk, loss of balance, and dizziness Difficulty with or inability to speak or understand Difficulty with swallowing Dizziness, loss of balance, coordination or consciousness Drowsiness or lethargy Mood changes (sudden depression or apathy) Severe, sudden headache, possibly along with pain between the eyes, in the face, or a stiff neck, and vomiting or altered consciousness Note that the key words for all symptoms are sudden onset.  Slowly developing problems in any of these areas are probably not symptoms of a stroke.  Furthermore, a condition called a transient ischemic attack or TIA creates symptoms that mimic a stroke, but they usually last for less than 24 hours (possibly as short as a few minutes).  A TIA is a temporary loss of or disturbance in brain function.  In itself it may not be serious, but it is a warning sign that you could have stroke in the future. A number of tests can be used to decide the type and cause of a stroke, and the specific areas of the brain that have been affected. Most of these tests create images of the brain and the arteries that feed it.  They could also be used before a stroke to look for blockages in the carotid arteries.  Among the imaging techniques used are arteriography, computerized tomographic angiography (a form of CT scanning with a dye injected into the vein), MRI, and ultrasound.  For information about them, go to Key Point #2. One of the most effective ways to limit the effects of a stroke is to begin treatment as quickly as possible.  A stroke is the interruption of the flow of blood to any part of the brain, which damages brain tissue.  The longer the delay before treatment begins, the more damage to the brain tissue.  The interruption in blood flow is caused either by a blood clot or other particles blocking the arteries that carry blood to the brain (an ischemic stroke) or by bleeding in the brain, caused by a ruptured blood vessel or an injury (a hemorrhagic stroke). So the goal of emergency treatment is to find out what kind of stroke the person is having and then take appropriate measures to stop it by dissolving the blood clot or stopping the bleeding. Ischemic strokes can be stopped by using a class of drugs known as thrombolytics or clot busting medicines.  Injected directly into a vein, they can break up or dissolve blood clots, thus removing the blockage and restoring blood flow to the brain.  The most widely used is called TPA (for tissue plasminogen activator).  However, TPA must be given within three hours of the start of symptoms.  After three hours, the benefits of dissolving the clot no longer outweigh the risk of hemorrhage (N.B. There really is no debate about IV TPA after 3 hours-it is contraindicated. ) Further, because of potential side effects and risks, some people who have had an ischemic stroke are not ideal candidates for thrombolytics even within three hours. Doctors must understand the details of each individual case before giving the drugs. For example, if your blood pressure is uncontrollable when they're being considered, your doctor may not use them. Finally, before any thrombolytics can be given, it must be certain that the person is having an ischemic stroke.  If the stroke is caused by bleeding, the drugs could make things worse. Other possible drugs to treat ischemic strokes include blood thinners, such as heparin and coumadin, and aspirin and other anti-platelet agents. Hemorrhagic strokes are caused by bleeding. One of the most common types of hemorrhagic stroke is due to high blood pressure.  Tiny blood vessels deep in the brain can rupture, causing bleeding into the brain tissue.  This type of bleeding is often called "intracerebral hemorrhage".  Another type of  bleeding may be caused by a ruptured.(broken), badly formed blood vessel.  This type of blood vessel is called an AVM, for "arteriovenous malformation."  Some AVMs can be removed by surgery, and that may be a way of preventing a possible stroke.  But if an AVM is too large or found deep within the brain, surgery may not be possible.  There are other possible treatments for AVMs, including procedures that shrink them by blocking the arteries that supply them with blood. Another possible cause of a hemorrhagic stroke is an aneurysm, a localized, blood-filled dilatation (swelling) of a blood vessel caused by a disease or the weakening of the vessel's wall.  Again, there are a number of surgical treatments for aneurysms, including aneurysm clipping (the aneurysm is clamped shut, preventing it from getting blood from the artery it's attached to) and aneurysm embolization (a tiny coil is put into the aneurysm which makes it clot, preventing blood from nearby arteries getting into it). A hemorrhagic stroke may also require surgery to remove blood that has pooled in the brain during the stroke. After a stroke, the emphasis should be on preventing a second stroke (about 25 % of people who recover from a first stroke will have a second within 5 years) and rehabilitation.  Rehabilitation obviously depends on the type of disability the person has, and can include speech, occupational, and physical therapy.  About 10% of those who have had a stroke recover most or all of their abilities; 50% can remain at home with medical assistance; 40% move to long-term care facilities.  Unquestionably, however, a supportive family, friends and environment can help stroke patients in their recovery. For links to information about long-term recovery go to Resources.  Key Point 2 Treatment of an ischemic stroke is the restoration of blood flow to the brain to prevent and minimize damage. A blockage is usually caused by atherosclerosis, an accumulation of "plaque" (deposits of fat) in the arteries that narrows them, reducing blood flow, or by blood clots in the arteries.  The plaque not only blocks the blood flow itself, it can also help create a clot because it forces the blood to flow abnormally.  A clot that stays in one place (usually the place it was formed) is called a thrombus.  A clot that breaks loose, travels to another spot, and wedges itself into a narrower blood vessel, is called an embolism. The first indication that an artery may be blocked can be an abnormally loud, harsh noise coming from it, heard through a stethoscope during a physical examination. This noise is called a bruit (pronounced "bru-we").  The next step can be one or more tests to look at the arteries that feed the brain and measure the amount and type of blockage in them.  They're the same type of diagnostic imaging tests now used to diagnose a wide range of conditions, including heart problems.  They include: Carotid arteriogram (also called carotid angiogram): This is an x-ray of the carotid arteries to look for blockages. A catheter (a small tube) is inserted through a small incision into a blood vessel and threaded up into the carotid arteries. A contrast dye is then injected into the catheter to make blockages more visible on the x-ray. Carotid ultrasound:  Many people are familiar with ultrasound imaging used with pregnant women to produce images of fetuses.  Similarly, carotid ultrasound produces pictures of the carotid arteries.  High-frequency sound waves are sent into the neck, pass through the tissue, and then bounce back.  The results are images that show any narrowing or clotting in the carotid arteries. Computerized tomography angiography (CTA):  Many people are also familiar with CT scanning (often called "CAT scanning") which produces detailed images of organs and tissues.  CTA is a form of CT scanning that uses dyes injected into the bloodstream to make blockages and other problems more visible. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This technique uses a strong magnetic field to create a three-dimensional view of the brain to look for the areas damaged by a stroke. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) combines an MRI with an injected dye to better see the arteries in the neck and brain. It is used to determine if the stroke was caused by bleeding (hemorrhage) or other lesions and to define the location and extent of the stroke. If these tests show that either of the two carotid arteries are narrowed, a physical intervention to remove the blockage may be needed.  When an individual has symptoms of a stroke or TIA from a carotid artery that is over 70% blocked, evidence suggests that those individuals should strongly consider undergoing an operation to remove the blockage.  If the individual has not had any symptoms from the severe blockage, or if the amount of blockage is less severe (50-70%), decisions about surgery should be individualized, depending on unique patient characteristics and preferences. The process of removing the blockage is called carotid revascularization.  Currently, one of two approaches is generally followed. One approach is an operation called a carotid endarterectomy (CEA).  The surgeon opens the affected artery and physically removes the blockage – the plaque, clot, etc. Studies show that this procedure reduces the risk of stroke and is especially helpful to people with severe blockages, even if they have no symptoms at all.  Although all surgery has general and specific risks (the specific risks for carotid endarterectomy is that the surgery itself might cause a stroke or heart attack), the risks for CEA are not great. The second approach is known as carotid artery stenting or carotid angioplasty-stent (CAS) and may be more appropriate than surgery in some patients.  Angioplasty is the process of opening or widening a narrowed blood vessel. The procedure was first used in the 1970s to treat coronary artery disease; now it has been extended to other arteries, including the carotid artery.  A catheter is threaded up into the arteries.  A tiny balloon at the end of the catheter is inflated to open the narrowed blood vessel.  The process may also involve using a tiny umbrella-like filter (called a "distal protection device") at the end of the catheter to catch any particles that break free from the artery and prevent them from traveling to and blocking some other blood vessel. A stent is an object put inside a blood vessel to keep it open and unblocked.  Today a stent is usually a tiny tube made of a metallic mesh that looks something like a wire cage or spring.  After a blocked blood vessel has been opened, a stent can be slid along the catheter and put in place to keep the vessel open.  Some stents are coated with medicines to help prevent further blockages. While carotid stenting is a newer technique and still under investigation, current research has shown it to be as effective as carotid endarterectomy in some cases and a less invasive form of surgery.  Meanwhile, other new techniques to remove clots, such as catheter embolectomy (using a catheter threaded into one of the carotid arteries to remove clots) are being explored.  Key Point 3 You may not have to have a stroke.  You've heard it before – control your blood pressure, control your cholesterol, stop smoking and keep your body to a healthy weight.  You can dramatically reduce the risk of having a stroke, along with preventing a heart attack, Type 2 diabetes and many other diseases. In general, to prevent stroke you shold: Know your risk factors and develop a plan, with your doctor, to reduce them; Learn more about the risk factors for stroke . Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease with lifestyle changes and medicines prescribed by your doctor. High blood pressure is the leading risk factor for stroke. But you can reduce your blood pressure by making some simple lifestyle changes. Stop smoking. Don't abuse alcohol (no more than 1 to 2 drinks per day). Eat a low-fat diet. Minimize the amount of sodium in your diet. Sodium is found in table salt (chemical name, sodium chloride), so minimize the amount of salt you eat; avoid salty snacks. Exercise often, on a regular schedule. Lose weight if you're overweight. Reduce and manage stress by changing your lifestyle and simplifying your life, exercising and using relaxation techniques. There are also prescription medicines that help reduce blood pressure, such as: Diuretics ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors Angiotensin receptor blockers Beta-blockers Calcium channel blockers You should discuss these medicines with your doctor, who will prescribe what's appropriate for you.  You can get more information about them at Medline Plus, an on-line service of the National Library of Medicine, the National Institutes of Health, and other government agencies and health-related organizations. Most strokes are caused by a blood clot or atherosclerosis (fatty build-up) blocking the flow of blood through arteries leading to the brain.   Atherosclerosis is the same condition that can also cause a heart attack.  High levels of LDL-cholesterol (commonly called "bad cholesterol") are a major cause of atherosclerosis. Therefore, two other types of  stroke preventing medicines are those that: reduce blood clotting reduce LDL-cholesterol, plaque and atherosclerosis The first type, prescription anti-clotting medicines, include anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and thrombolytics. Like all prescription medicines, they must be used properly, following all of your doctor's recommendations and precautions. Anticoagulants decrease the blood's ability to form clots.  They're often called "blood thinners," though they don't actually thin the blood, nor do they dissolve clots already present. Antiplatelets stop blood platelets (substances in blood that promote clotting) from clumping together to form clots. Thrombolytics are often called "clot busters" because they break up or dissolve already existing blood clots.  For information about them, go to Key Point 1. Aspirin is a non-prescription antiplatelet medicine.  But even though it is available over-the-counter, it may not be appropriate because it increases the risk of bleeding. Do not "self-medicate" yourself with aspirin.  Instead, talk to your doctor about its risks and benefits. The second type of medicine, prescription LDL-cholesterol reducing drugs, include statins, bile acid sequestrants, and fibrates. Statins are currently considered the most important and effective group of LDL-cholesterol reducing medicines. They slow cholesterol production and increase the liver's ability to remove the LDL-cholesterol already there.  Because the body makes more cholesterol at night, these drugs are usually taken in the evening, at dinner or before bed.  Side effects appear to be minimal and studies show that people using statins have reported 20 to 60 percent lower LDL-cholesterol levels. As of this writing, five statin drugs are available in the U. S.: lovastatin simvastatin pravastatin fluvastatin atorvastatin Bile acid sequestrants bind with bile acids in the intestines that contain cholesterol.  Then they are eliminated during defecation, reducing the amount of cholesterol in the blood.  Often, these drugs are prescribed in combination with statins.  As of this writing, three main bile acid sequestrants are available here: cholestyramine, colestipol colesevelam Fibrates lower the level of triglycerides (the main component of  fat and therefore another major cause of atherosclerosis) in the blood. Nicotinic acid is a non-prescription cholesterol lowering substance.  It's a form of niacin, the water-soluble B vitamin.  When taken in high doses, well above the suggested daily amount, it can be effective in lowering LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  Note that there's another form of niacin, nicotinamide, that doesn't lower cholesterol and shouldn't be used instead of nicotinic acid.  Further, high doses of nicotinic acid can have side effects.  Do not "self-medicate" yourself with Vitamin B.  Instead, talk to your doctor about its risks and benefits. In addition to all these preventative measures, there are also physical ways to unblock an artery, including surgery and a procedure called "stenting."  For information about them, go to Key Point  2.

En Español By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter THURSDAY, June 16, 2005 (HealthDayNews) -- People who have had a minor stroke have a 43 percent risk of another, potentially fatal stroke within 10 years, Dutch researchers report. While deaths from cerebrovascular disease have dropped around the world, stroke remains a serious neurological problem, leaving many patients with a chronic disability. After a stroke, or transient ischemic attack (TIA), secondary stroke prevention is standard practice. But many patients have a recurrent stroke or other vascular complications, according to the report in the June 18 issue of The Lancet . "The risk for a vascular event is very high in these people," said study author Dr. Ale Algra, of the Julius Centre for Health Sciences and Primary Care at the University Medical Centre Utrecht. In their study, Algra and his colleagues collected data on 2,447 patients who had had a minor stroke, which is a transient stroke that lasts only a few minutes. These patients had participated in the Dutch TIA Trial. After a follow-up of 10.1 years, 60 percent of the patients had died and 54 percent had had at least one vascular event. This is twice as many deaths as would be seen in the general population, Algra said. The 10-year risk of death was 42.7 percent, Algra's team found. The risk of a vascular event was highest shortly after the stroke, reached its lowest point about three years later, and then gradually rose again, the researchers said.  Given these findings, Algra believes more emphasis should placed on preventing second strokes. "People should pay attention to secondary prevention," he said. "This includes lifestyle, as well as drug therapy." In terms of lifestyle, Algra suggested exercising, eating a healthy diet, and not smoking. In addition, doctors should work to keep their patients' blood pressure and cholesterol low and prescribe aspirin or other drugs to prevent blood from clotting in the small arteries. "All these measures together may decrease the risks of new vascular events," he said. One expert agrees that secondary prevention after a minor stroke is often overlooked. "This study makes us say 'Holy moly, these early risks of recurrence are very high,'" said Dr. Lawrence M. Brass, a professor of neurology and epidemiology and public health at Yale University School of Medicine. For the medical community, Brass thinks this study sends a strong message that secondary stroke prevention needs to be a priority. "Often the approach of many physicians is, 'You've had a TIA. Let's put you on an aspirin and send you on your way,'" he said. "This data indicates that half these people are going to be dead in five years, and a similar portion may have another stroke. You've really got to do more than just this." Brass noted there are many things doctors can do that are often not done to help prevent second, fatal strokes, such as monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol. "This is a real wake-up call," Brass said. "We've got to get our butts in gear to make sure we are doing things appropriately." Patients, too, can play a role in preventing the recurrence of stroke, Brass said. "Patients should know what their risk is, and know what they and their doctors are doing about it," he said.  "People need to realize that heart attack and stroke are going to kill me, not dirt on the oranges or something else. This is what's going to kill more Americans than anything else," Brass said. "You need to be an active advocate and say to your doctor, 'What are my risks for heart attack and stroke? What are we doing to prevent it? What more can we do to prevent it?'"

Be aware of the medications that have been prescribed to your loved one and their side effects. Ask if your home should be modified to meet the specific needs of the stroke survivor. Ask a doctor, nurse or therapist to clarify any unanswered questions or to provide written information that explains what occurs after the stroke and during recovery or rehabilitation.   Reduce risks, or stroke may strike again. Survivors who have had one stroke are at high risk of having another one if the treatment recommendations are not followed. Make sure your loved one eats a healthy diet, exercises (taking walks is great exercise), takes medications as prescribed, and has regular visits with their physician to help prevent a second stroke.   Many factors influence recovery. Recovery depends on many different factors: where in the brain the stroke occurred, how much of the brain was affected, the patient’s motivation, caregiver support, the quantity and quality of rehabilitation, and how healthy the survivor was before the stroke.  Because every stroke and stroke survivor is unique, avoid comparisons.   Gains can happen quickly or over time. The most rapid recovery usually occurs during the first three to four months after a stroke, but some stroke survivors continue to recover well into the first and second year post-stroke.   Some signs point to physical therapy. Caregivers should consider seeking assistance from a physical or occupational therapist if their loved one has any of these complaints: dizziness; imbalance that results in falls, difficulty walking or moving around in daily life; inability to walk six minutes without stopping to rest; inability to do things that he/she enjoys like recreational activities or outings with family or increased need for help to engage in daily activities.   Don’t ignore falls. Falls after stroke are common. If a fall is serious and results in severe pain, bruising or bleeding, go the Emergency Department for treatment. If a loved one experiences minor falls (with no injury) that occur more than two times within six months, see your physician or the physical therapist for treatment.   Measuring progress matters. How much acute rehabilitation therapy your loved one receives depends partly on his/her rate of improvement. Stroke survivors on an acute rehabilitation unit are expected to make measurable functional gains every week as measured by the Functional Independence Measure Score (FIMS). Functional improvements include activities of daily living skills, mobility skills and communication skills. The typical rehabilitation expectation is improving 1 to 2 FIM points per day.   A change in abilities can trigger a change in services. Medicare coverage for rehabilitation therapies may be available if your loved one’s physical function has changed. It there appears to be improvement or a decline in motor skills, speech or self-care since the last time the patient was in therapy, he/she may be eligible for more services.   Monitor changes in attitude and behavior . Evaluate whether your loved one is showing signs of emotional lability (when a person has difficulty controlling their emotions). Consult a physician to develop a plan of action.   Stop depression before it hinders recovery. Post-stroke depression is common, with as many as 30–50 percent of stroke survivors developing depression in the early or later phases post stroke. Post-stroke depression can significantly affect your loved one’s recovery and rehabilitation.  Consult a physician to develop a plan of action.   Seek out support. Community resources, such as stroke survivor and caregiver support groups, are available for you and your loved one. Stay in touch with a case manager, social worker or discharge planner who can help you find resources in your community.   Learn the ins and outs of  insurance coverage. Be sure to consult with your loved-one’s doctor, case manager or social worker to find how much and how long insurance will pay for rehabilitation services. Rehabilitation services can vary substantially from one case to another. Clarify what medical and rehabilitation services are available for hospital and outpatient care. Determine the length of coverage provided from your insurance (private or government supported) and what out-of-pocket expenses you can expect.   Know when to enlist help. If rehabilitation services are denied due to lack of “medical necessity,” ask your loved one’s physician to intervene on his or her behalf. Ask the physician to provide records to the insurance carrier and, if needed, follow up yourself by calling the insurance company.   Know your rights. You have rights to access your loved-one’s medical and rehabilitation records. You are entitled to copies of the medical records, including written notes and brain imaging films.   Take care of you. Take a break from caregiving by asking another family member, friend or neighbor to help while you take time for yourself. Keep balance in your life by eating right, exercising or walking daily, and getting adequate rest.     This content was last reviewed on 07/31/2013.

I've had a stroke               A stroke is not something you prepare for. So you’re going to have a lot of questions when it happens. That’s why we’re here. We have lots of information to help you understand what’s happened and get the support you need.  Here we’ve tackled some of the questions that you're likely to have, including details of how to find out more.                          What’s happened?      Because a stroke happens so quickly, people sometimes leave hospital without being completely sure what’s happened or why. You need to understand what a stroke is and the things that make it more likely to happen, so that you can do all you can to reduce the risk of it happening again.                          Will I get better?      Because every stroke is different, there is no set pattern for recovering from one. So it can be difficult to say how well or how quickly you’ll recover.  It’s likely that you’ll see some immediate recovery in the first few days and weeks after your stroke. After this early burst of recovery, progress tends to slow down. This is normal and doesn’t mean that you won’t recover any further.  Getting better will involve rehabilitation , which is about overcoming and adapting to the effects of your stroke. Your therapists will give you exercises and advice to help your relearn abilities you have lost and how you new ways of doing things. Starting your rehabilitation as soon as possible after your stroke will help to avoid further problems from developing and give you the best chances for recovery.                          Will I have another stroke?      For many stroke survivors, their greatest fear is having another stroke.  Once you’ve had a stroke your risk of having another is increased, but understanding what factors may have caused your stroke will help you know how to reduce your risk  of having another one. If you’re not clear, go back to your GP and ask for more information about your own risk of a stroke.                          How do I cope with what’s happened?      Stroke brings a lot of questions and uncertainty with it. Coping with this can be overwhelming for both you and the people around you. Fear of another stroke, anger and grief about the things you’ve lost, shock and helplessness are all natural emotions to have after a stroke.  Coping with these emotions is not easy. If you’re struggling, you need to speak up. Your doctors, family or friends may not think to ask about how you are feeling, but there is support available if you need it.  Talking to your doctors and therapists and getting answers to your questions will help you feel more in control of your situation and help you plan for the future. Talk to your social worker about the support you can get when you return home , as well as the financial support  that’s available.                          Five things you need to know      Don’t be afraid to ask questions, even if it’s weeks or months later. It’s important that you understand what happened and why.  Coping with the impact of stroke is not easy but the best thing to do is talk about it – with the people around you and professionals who can offer support.  Friendships can slip away after a stroke but friends are important. Talk to them about what has happened as they may not appreciate the impact that your stroke has had on you.  Remember that recovery takes time and patience, as well as practice and determination. Some days will be harder than others but the important thing is to keep going.  Don’t forget, we’re here to help you. Whether you want to know more about stroke and its effects, are looking for practical information and support, or simply need someone to talk to, there are lots of ways that we can help.
