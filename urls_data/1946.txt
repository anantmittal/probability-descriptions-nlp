Other people have earlobes that blend in with the side of the head, known as "attached" or "adherent" earlobes, as shown in the lower right.  Attached vs. free earlobes are often used to illustrate basic genetics. The myth is that earlobes can be divided into into two clear categories, free and attached, and that a single gene controls the trait, with the allele for free earlobes being dominant. Neither part of the myth is true.     Earlobes ranging from unattached (upper left) to attached (lower right).    The reality  Earlobes as a character  Classroom exercises on earlobe genetics say that there are two distinct categories, free (F) and attached (A). However, many of the papers on earlobe genetics have pointed out that there are many people with intermediate earlobes (Quelprud 1934, Wiener 1937, Dutta and Ganguly 1965). El Kollali (2009) classified earlobes into three types, based on whether the attachment angle was acute, right, or obtuse. To make the picture above, I searched for pictures of professional bicyclists (because they have short hair), found 12 with their ears showing, and arranged them from free to attached. It doesn't look to me as if there are just two categories; instead, there is continuous variation in the height of the attachment point (the "otobasion inferius") relative to the lowest point on the earlobe (the "subaurale"). My own earlobes are exactly halfway in between the two extremes; I couldn't tell you whether my earlobes should be considered free or attached.  Family studies  Carrière (1922) and Hilden (1922) were among the first to study the genetics of earlobes, and they reached opposite conclusions. Carrière (1922) looked at 15 families and concluded that attached earlobes were dominant. However, all of the offspring of A x A matings had attached earlobes, and there were no F x F matings, so his data are consistent with either free or attached being dominant.  Powell and Whitney (1937) looked at one family and concluded that attached earlobes were recessive. Wiener (1937) responded by pointing out that the "arbitrary classification into two sharply defined types...gives a false picture, since all gradations between the two extremes are encountered." He divided earlobes into four arbitrary groups, from 0 (completely free) to 3 (completely attached). All possible matings, from completely 0 x 0 to 3 x 3, produced some intermediate earlobes. Wiener (1937) concluded that earlobes were determined by more than one gene, or by a singe gene with more than two alleles.  Lai and Walsh (1966) called earlobes in which the lowest point on the earlobe was the attachment point "attached," and they classified all other earlobes as "free." They recorded the following data on families in New Guinea:    Parents  F offspring  A offspring Percent F    F x F  12  22 35%    F x A  72  114 39%    A x A  37  90 29%    If the myth were true, two parents with attached earlobes could not have a child with a free earlobe. There are slightly more A offspring from A x A matings, but the large numbers of F offspring from A x A matings and A offspring from F x F matings indicate that this is not a one-locus, two-allele trait.  Mohanraju and Mukherjee (1973) performed a similar study in India and found similar results:    Parents  F offspring  A offspring Percent F    F x F  13  1 93%    F x A  7  7 50%    A x A  5  29 15%    They found a much stronger association between parents and offspring, but the five F offspring of A x A matings are inconsistent with the myth that this is a one-locus, two-allele trait.   Conclusion  Earlobes do not fall into two categories, "free" and "attached"; there is continuous variation in attachment point, from up near the ear cartilage to well below the ear. While there is probably some genetic influence on earlobe attachment point, family studies show that it does not fit the simple one-locus, two-allele myth. You should not use earlobe attachment to demonstrate basic genetics.   References  Carrière, R. 1922. Über erbliche Orhformen, insbesondere das angewachsene Ohrläppchen.

Donate Home Basic Genetics Observable Human Characteristics Observable Human Characteristics We are all unique. Even though we share some characteristics with our peers and our family members, every one of us 
has a unique combination of traits. Some traits are controlled by genes that pass from parent to child. Others are acquired through learning. But most 
are influenced by a combination of genes and environmental factors. Below are some examples of variable traits that 
are easy to observe. To learn more about traits see What are Traits? Earlobe attachment If earlobes hang free, they are detached. If they connect directly to the sides of the head, they are attached. Earlobe attachment is a continuous trait: while most earlobes can be neatly categorized as attached or unattached, some are in-between. Although some sources say that this trait is controlled by a single gene, with unattached earlobes being dominant over attached earlobes, no published studies support this view. Earlobe attachment and shape are inherited, but it is likely that many genes contribute to this trait. As such, its pattern of inheritance is difficult to predict. Tongue Rolling Some people can curl up the sides of their tongue to form a tube shape. In 1940, Alfred Sturtevant observed that about 70% of people of European ancestry could roll their tongues and the remaining 30% could not. Many sources state that tongue rolling is controlled by a single gene. However, as Sturtevant observed, people can learn to roll their tongue as they get older, suggesting that environmental factors—not just genes—influence the trait. Consistent with this view, just 70% of identical twins share the trait (if tongue rolling were influenced only by genes, then 100% of identical traits would share the trait).  Dimples  Dimples are small, natural indentations on the cheeks. They can appear on one or both sides, and they often change with age. Some people are born with dimples that disappear when they’re adults; others develop dimples later in childhood. Dimples are highly heritable, meaning that people who have dimples tend to have children with dimples—but not always. Because their inheritance isn&apos;t completely predictable, dimples are considered an “irregular” dominant trait. Having dimples is probably controlled mainly by one gene but also influenced by other genes.  Handedness  Handedness describes our preference for using either our left or right hand for activities such as writing and throwing a ball. Overall, about 10% of people are left-handed, but the number varies among cultures from 0.5% to 24%. Some have reported that handedness is controlled by just one or two genes, but this is not the case. Multiple studies present evidence that handedness is controlled by many genes—at least 30 and as many as 100—each with a small effect; many are linked to brain development. Environment also plays an important role: some cultures actively discourage left-handedness.  Freckles  Freckles are small, concentrated spots of a skin pigment called melanin. Most fair-skinned, red-haired people have them. Freckles are controlled primarily by the MC1R gene. Freckles show a dominant inheritance pattern: parents who have freckles tend to have children with freckles. Variations, also called alleles, of MC1R control freckle number. Other genes and the environment influence freckle size, color, and pattern. For example, sun exposure can temporarily cause more freckles to appear.  Curly hair  Round hair follicles make straight hair, flattened or c-shaped hair follicles make curly hair, and oval hair follicles make wavy hair. Hair texture is a continuous trait, meaning that hair can be straight or curly or anywhere in between. Curly hair is influenced by genes much more than by the environment. While curly hair runs in families—people with curly hair tend to have children with curly hair—its inheritance patterns are often unpredictable. Multiple genes control hair texture, and different variations in these genes are found in different populations. For instance, curly hair is common in African populations, rare in Asian populations, and in-between in Europeans. Straight hair in Asians is mostly caused by variations in two genes—different genes from the ones that influence hair texture in Europeans. And different genetic variations make hair curly in African and European populations.  Hand clasping  Without thinking about it, fold your hands together by interlocking your fingers. Which thumb is on top—your left or your right? One study found that 55% of people place their left thumb on top, 45% place their right thumb on top, and 1% have no preference. A study of identical twins concluded that hand clasping has a strong genetic basis (most twins share the trait), but it doesn’t fit a predictable inheritance pattern. It is likely affected by multiple genes as well as environmental factors.  Red/Green Colorblindness  Red-green colorblindness is caused by a single gene located on the X-chromosome. This gene codes for a protein in the eye that detects certain colors of light. When this gene is defective, the eye cannot differentiate between red and green. You need at least one working copy of the gene to be able to see red and green. Since boys have just one X-chromosome, which they receive from their mother, inheriting one defective copy of the gene will render them colorblind. Girls have two X-chromosomes; to be colorblind they must inherit two defective copies, one from each parent. Consequently, red-green colorblindness is much more frequent in boys (1 in 12) than in girls (1 in 250). Red-green color blindness follows a very predictable recessive, sex-linked inheritance pattern. A woman with one defective copy of the gene and one functional copy, even though she is not colorblind herself, is known as a "carrier." She has a 50% chance of passing the defective copy to each of her children. Half of her sons will be colorblind, and half of her daughters will be carriers.  Hairline shape  If your hairline forms a point at the center of the forehead, you have a widow&apos;s peak. If not, you have a straight hairline. While some sources say that widow’s peak is a dominant trait controlled by one gene, no scientific study supports this claim. Complicating the question of heritability is the fact that the trait is continuous: some people have just a slight suggestion of a peak. Widow&apos;s peak is likely controlled by genes rather than the environment. But while hairline shape tends to run in families, its pattern of inheritance is usually unpredictable, suggesting that multiple genes are involved.  PTC tasting  To about 75% of us, the chemical PTC (phenylthiocarbamide) tastes very bitter. For the other 25%, it is tasteless. The ability to taste PTC is controlled mainly by a single gene that codes for a bitter-taste receptor on the tongue. Different variations, or alleles, of this gene control whether PTC tastes bitter or not. PTC tasting follows a very predictable pattern of inheritance. Tasting is dominant, meaning that if you have at least one copy of the tasting version of the gene, you can taste PTC. Non-tasters have two copies of the non-tasting allele.

Other Traits          Back to Other Traits           English   Español       So, everyone in my family has attached earlobes yet I came out with unattached earlobes. Why is that?        -An undergraduate from California   August 4, 2010  Sounds like you listened to your high school biology teacher about ear lobe genetics. Or did some research on your own.  Your teacher and just about everything on the web says that parents with attached earlobes can't have kids with unattached ones. And they're all wrong.  Most everyone presents ear lobe attachment as a very simple trait. (We've even fallen into this trap here .) But it's not. Even though ear lobe genetics hasn't been studied a whole lot, the little bit that has been done shows it is pretty complicated.  This means that it isn't uncommon for parents with attached earlobes to have kids with unattached lobes. Or even for parents to have kids with one attached and one unattached earlobe !  So what's going on here? Is there a vast conspiracy to make some people worry? Probably not.  There is a seed of truth to everything out there on the web. Early studies did create a model where parents with attached earlobes couldn't have kids with unattached ones. It is just that people probably didn't hear about the later studies that showed that this wasn't the case.  What I thought I'd do for the rest of the answer is go over the history of ear lobe genetics. I'll talk about why scientists thought what they did at first and then what caused them to reverse their thinking. To discuss all of this, we need to first step back and talk about dominant and recessive traits.   Genes Are Like Recipes  Most of us know that we get half our DNA from our mom and half from our dad. This DNA has long stretches in it called genes.  Each gene is a set of instructions for one small part of us. So all the genes in our DNA together have enough information to make an entire human being.  Now here's something interesting: we all have almost the exact same set of genes! Which might make you think that everyone should look identical. But we don't, of course. So what's going on?  Although we all have the same set of genes, we can have different versions of some of them. These different versions of the same gene are called alleles. And it is these different alleles that make each of us unique.  Imagine an oatmeal cookie recipe. Some people have a recipe for an oatmeal cookie with raisins and some people have one with chocolate chips. But they're both still oatmeal cookie recipes.  Same thing with genes. For example, there is a hair color gene that comes in two versions, red and not-red. Which alleles you get determine whether you'll have red hair or not. Just like which recipe you use determines if you'll have raisins or chocolate chips in your oatmeal cookie.   Gene Versions That Dominate  Remember, we get a copy of each gene from our mom and a copy from our dad. So our bodies take the two versions of every gene and follow each set of instructions.  Sometimes, the instructions go together and we can see the result of both. If you mix a recipe for oatmeal chocolate chip together with one for oatmeal raisin, you'll get oatmeal chocolate chip raisin cookies.  Sometimes, though, one allele of a gene dominates the other. This is just like when we mix a chocolate cupcake recipe together with a vanilla one and get a chocolate tasting cupcake. Even though both recipes were made, chocolate wins out.  The hidden gene version is called the recessive allele. So if you get a dominant allele of a gene from one parent and a recessive allele from the other, you'll only show the dominant trait. Even though the recessive one is still in there.  This is how earlobes were thought to work. Often the kids of one parent with attached and one parent with unattached earlobes will all have unattached earlobes. Because unattached was thought to be dominant.  But unlike cupcakes, the dominant version doesn't seem to always win. Sometimes you'll end up with a recessive trait even if one of your parents has a dominant one. Sometimes a chocolate and a vanilla make a vanilla.  To understand why this is, we need to remember that we have two copies of each of our genes. Sometimes someone with a dominant trait has a hidden recessive allele. If they pass that on (and the other parent does too), then the child will have the recessive trait.  So for earlobes, imagine a parent with an attached and an unattached allele. This parent will have unattached earlobes but could pass the attached allele to their child. That child might end up with attached earlobes. Click here to read more about how this works.  Of course, given all of this, two parents with a recessive trait can't have a child with a dominant one. So two parents with attached earlobes should not be able to have a child with unattached ones. Except that sometimes they do. Which means that earlobes are more complicated than is usually advertised.   Ear Lobe Studies  In one of the first earlobe studies , scientists concluded that unattached earlobes were dominant over attached ones. They based this on two families.  Everyone in the first family had attached earlobes and everyone in the second had unattached ones. When a man from the first family married a woman from the second, all six kids had unattached earlobes.  But in lots of follow up studies , this result didn't hold up anymore. Sometimes parents with attached earlobes had kids with unattached earlobes. So the scientists concluded that earlobe inheritance must be more complicated than they initially thought. And that it might even involve more than one gene.  Why the different results? There are at least a couple of reasons.  The first explanation is actually something you may already know -- things often happen by chance. If you flip a coin three times, the chances of them all being heads is high enough that you might bet on it. However, few people would bet on having 100 coin flips all be heads. This is because even though the chances of any one coin flip being heads is 50-50, the chances of 100 of them doing so are much less than this.  What if something similar is going on for earlobes? Imagine that earlobes often followed a simple dominant/recessive pattern. But not always. Maybe one in every 100 people would have unattached earlobes when his or her parents both have attached ones.  If we look at only a dozen people, we are likely to miss this. We might conclude that earlobe inheritance is simple and predictable based on genetic rules of dominance. And we'd be wrong.  The second issue with the initial studies is that they looked at only two families and the children from the marriage. People that live in the same regions of the world often share many of the same alleles. And members of the same family share even more.  So it could very well be that in the family they studied unattached earlobes were dominant because everyone shared the same set of alleles. But a more diverse set of people may follow a different pattern because they have different alleles.  It could also be that there are different ways to end up with attached and unattached earlobes. Sometimes they work in a simple dominant/recessive way and sometimes they don't. The scientists happened to study a couple of families where the simple explanation was right.   Exceptions to the Rules  So there you have it: it isn't actually surprising or uncommon for parents from families with attached earlobes to have a child with unattached earlobes. What is more surprising is that the old data has hung around for so long and that everyone has ignored the more recent data.  We simply do not yet understand how earlobe attachment is passed down. And we probably won't for a long time. This is not a problem keeping scientists up at night!  A word of caution though. Even if earlobe attachment were a simple dominant/recessive trait, there still would be rare exceptions. Nothing in genetics is 100%; things can and do change.

In some cases the lower lobe is connected to the side of the face. Since the earlobe does not contain cartilage [1] it has a large blood supply and may help to warm the ears and maintain balance. However, earlobes are not generally considered to have any major biological function. [2] The earlobe contains many nerve endings , and for some people is an erogenous zone .  The zoologist Desmond Morris in his book The Naked Ape (1967) conjectured that the lobes developed as an additional erogenous zone to facilitate the extended sexuality necessary in the evolution of human monogamous pair bonding.

[4] However this is not the case, in the surrounding tissue there are no somites – thus also there is no dermatome. In this area, the dermis is derived from cells of mesenchymal cells , whereas the mesenchyme is derived from the sclerotome and splanchnopleura located in the nearby regions of the torso . [5]  The earlobe as a body part arises and develops in the vicinity of auricular follicle, as a result of cascade induction: [6]   The first-level inductor is the central segment of Archenteron's roof , which induces the production of the Medulla oblongata (part of the Hindbrain ).  The second-level inductor is the Medulla oblongata , which induces the production of a pair of auricular follicles derived from the mesoderm .  The third-level inductor is the auricular follicle, which induces the production of the auditory bulla .   Genetics [ edit ]      Clint Eastwood , who has an extreme form of attached ear lobe.    Earlobes average about 2 centimeters long, and elongate slightly with age. [7] Although the "free" vs. "attached" appearance of earlobes is often presented as an example of a simple "one gene – two alleles" Mendelian trait in humans, earlobes do not all fall neatly into either category; there is a continuous range from one extreme to the other, suggesting the influence of several genes.

(1952) [12]    Clinical significance [ edit ]  Earlobes are normally smooth, but occasionally exhibit creases. Creased earlobes are sometimes associated with genetic disorders in children, including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome . [24] In some early studies, earlobe creases were thought to be associated with an increased risk of heart attack and coronary heart disease ; however, more recent studies have concluded that since earlobes become more creased with age, and older people are more likely to experience heart disease than younger people, age may account for the findings linking heart attack to earlobe creases. [24] The earlobe crease is also called Frank's Sign .  Society and culture [ edit ]     Stretched earlobe piercing, Ethiopia    Earlobe piercing and stretching [ edit ]  Piercing the earlobes is a commonplace activity in many cultures in many historical eras; no other location on the body is as commonly pierced. Consequently, injury to the earlobe due to the weight of heavy earrings is also common. [25] Some cultures practice earlobe stretching , using piercing ornaments to stretch and enlarge the earlobes to accommodate plugs .  Negative effects of wearing earrings [ edit ]  Some research has found that the most frequent complications connected with wearing earrings are: [26]   inflammation ,  keloids ,  loss of tissue by tearing, and  mechanical division of earlobes.   There was noticeable relationship between the piercing of young girls' earlobes and following development of allergy. [27] [28] [29] In the view of Professor Ewa Czarnobilska, the manager of the research team, the primary reason for the allergies connected to earrings is the presence of nickel , which is a common component of the alloys used in jewelry production. [28] [29] The symptom seen is generally eczema , and is often misdiagnosed as a food allergy , for instance to milk. The specific mechanism in allergies caused by earrings is the contact of nickel ions with the Lymphatic system . [28] [29]  The study noted that children who simply stopped wearing earrings did not see the disappearance of the allergic symptoms. The immune system remembers the presence of the nickel ions in the person's blood and lymph , so the child can still react to: [28] [29]   metal parts of wardrobe,  dental braces ,  dental prosthesis ,  orthotics ,  meals cooked in pots with addition of nickel,  margarine (nickel is a catalyst in hydrogenation of unsaturated fats),  coins,  chocolate,  nuts,  leguminous vegetables,  wine, and  beer.   Research by allergists has found that in a sample of 428 pupils of ages 7–8 and 16–17 years old: [28] [29]   30% of the research population showed an allergy to nickel, and  the allergy occurred in girls who had started wearing earrings in early childhood.   Other symptoms of allergy to nickel are recurring infections, Asthma attacks and chronic larynxis. [28] [29]  References [ edit ]    ^  Steinberg, Avraham (2003).

Subscriptions State Science Standards Learnalong Help! Science Videos Science Log               Ear Genes     This week's experiment is a result of me looking over the various state science standards to see where I have gaps in coverage.  One big gap turned up in genetics, so I began working on a couple of genetics videos.  I kept finding more and more interesting stuff, and could not wait to share some and let you in on the fun.  This time, we will take a quick look at dominant and recessive traits, to see what that really means.  To explore that, you will need:  - your ears - the ears of other family members  Friends, Romans, and countrymen.  Lend me your ears!  I only need them for a moment, just long enough to look at your ear lobes.  No, it does not matter if they are pierced or not.  We just want to see how they connect to your head.  For some people, the ear lobes are connected directly to the side of their head, all the way to the bottom of the lobe.  We will refer to those as attached ear lobes.  I have attached ear lobes.  For other people, the ear lobe hangs down beyond the point of attachment.  We will refer to those as free ear lobes.  OK, so why do some people have attached lobes and others have free lobes?  That is where the science of genetics comes in, because ear lobe attachment is an inherited trait.  That's right.  You got your ear lobes from your parents.  Inside most of the cells in your body (not red blood cells) there is a complete set of instructions for your body and how it develops.  These instructions are chemicals that fit together into very long molecules called DNA.  In a human cell, the DNA forms 46 strands, called chromosomes, which fit together to form 23 pairs.  Each pair of chromosomes fits together in a specific way.  Arranged along the chromosomes are sequences of chemicals that form genes.  Each gene is a part of the chromosome that contains some of the instructions for making you you.  Genes control the color of your hair, how tall you will be, the color of your eyes, the color of your skin, and many, many other characteristics, called traits.  Now, it gets even better.  Some genes control more than one trait, and some traits are controlled by several genes working together.  Some genes turn other genes on or off.  Some genes don't do anything that we can detect so far.  That does not mean that they are useless, just that we don't yet know what they do.  The connection of ear lobes seems to be controlled by a single gene.  I say "seems to be" because there is still a tremendous amount that we don't know about genes.  For example, many books list tongue rolling (the ability to roll up the sides of your tongue to form a tube) as a single gene trait, but recent studies suggest that it is not.  Recent studies in the genes that control attached and unattached ear lobes are starting to suggest that there may be more than one gene involved too.  So that must mean that you can look at your ears and tell whether you got the gene for your ear lobes from your father or your mother, right?  No.  Actually, you got an ear lobe gene from each of them.  Remember that I said your chromosomes form pairs that fit together in a specific way.  So, what happens if your father has attached ear lobes and your mother has free ear lobes?  Do you wind up with ears that don't match, one attached and one free?  Not usually, although it does happen for some people (which is why scientists are considering that there may be more than one gene involved).  Some genes are dominant, and others are recessive.  Dominant genes take priority.  In the case of ear lobes, free lobes are dominant and attached lobes are recessive.  Since you got one gene from each parent, and there are two options for each gene; there are four possible combinations.  1.  If you got a dominant, free lobe gene (we will label that E) from your father and a dominant, free lobe gene from your mother (E), then you have (EE), two dominant, free lobe genes, so your ears will have free lobes.  2.  If you got a recessive, attached lobe gene from your father (we will label that with a lower case e) and a dominant, free lobe gene from your mother (E), then you have (Ee), one dominant, free lobe gene and one recessive, attached lobe gene.  The dominant gene takes priority, so your ears will have free lobes.  3.  If you got a dominant, free lobe gene from your father (E) and a recessive, attached lobe gene from your mother (e), then you have (eE), one dominant, free lobe gene and one recessive, attached lobe gene.  The dominant gene takes priority, so, again, your ears will have free lobes.  4.  If you got a recessive, attached lobe gene from your father (e) and a recessive, attached lobe gene from your mother (e), then you have (ee), two recessive, attached lobe genes, so your ears will have attached lobes.  Now, if you are reading this and realizing that you have attached lobes and both of your parents have free lobes, don't start worrying that you are adopted.  Remember that each of your parents also has a pair of genes that control ear lobe attachment, and that you only get one from each parent.  If your father has (Ee), then you have a 50/50 chance of getting either an E (dominant, free lobe) or an e (recessive, attached lobe) gene.  The same is true for your mother, so if both are (Ee), they would both have free lobes, but there is a one in four chance that you could wind up with (ee), getting the recessive attached lobe gene from both parents.  When you add in more variables, it gets more difficult to predict the outcome.  For example, hair color depends on the interaction of several genes that control different amounts of different pigments, and it is also genetically connected to skin tone and eye color.   That is why it is much easier to deal with traits that are controlled by a single gene.  Next time, we will look at some other traits and learn a bit more about the wonders of genetics.

Other Traits          Back to Other Traits           English   Español       So, everyone in my family has attached earlobes yet I came out with unattached earlobes. Why is that?        -An undergraduate from California   August 4, 2010  Sounds like you listened to your high school biology teacher about ear lobe genetics. Or did some research on your own.  Your teacher and just about everything on the web says that parents with attached earlobes can't have kids with unattached ones. And they're all wrong.  Most everyone presents ear lobe attachment as a very simple trait. (We've even fallen into this trap here .) But it's not. Even though ear lobe genetics hasn't been studied a whole lot, the little bit that has been done shows it is pretty complicated.  This means that it isn't uncommon for parents with attached earlobes to have kids with unattached lobes. Or even for parents to have kids with one attached and one unattached earlobe !  So what's going on here? Is there a vast conspiracy to make some people worry? Probably not.  There is a seed of truth to everything out there on the web. Early studies did create a model where parents with attached earlobes couldn't have kids with unattached ones. It is just that people probably didn't hear about the later studies that showed that this wasn't the case.  What I thought I'd do for the rest of the answer is go over the history of ear lobe genetics. I'll talk about why scientists thought what they did at first and then what caused them to reverse their thinking. To discuss all of this, we need to first step back and talk about dominant and recessive traits.   Genes Are Like Recipes  Most of us know that we get half our DNA from our mom and half from our dad. This DNA has long stretches in it called genes.  Each gene is a set of instructions for one small part of us. So all the genes in our DNA together have enough information to make an entire human being.  Now here's something interesting: we all have almost the exact same set of genes! Which might make you think that everyone should look identical. But we don't, of course. So what's going on?  Although we all have the same set of genes, we can have different versions of some of them. These different versions of the same gene are called alleles. And it is these different alleles that make each of us unique.  Imagine an oatmeal cookie recipe. Some people have a recipe for an oatmeal cookie with raisins and some people have one with chocolate chips. But they're both still oatmeal cookie recipes.  Same thing with genes. For example, there is a hair color gene that comes in two versions, red and not-red. Which alleles you get determine whether you'll have red hair or not. Just like which recipe you use determines if you'll have raisins or chocolate chips in your oatmeal cookie.   Gene Versions That Dominate  Remember, we get a copy of each gene from our mom and a copy from our dad. So our bodies take the two versions of every gene and follow each set of instructions.  Sometimes, the instructions go together and we can see the result of both. If you mix a recipe for oatmeal chocolate chip together with one for oatmeal raisin, you'll get oatmeal chocolate chip raisin cookies.  Sometimes, though, one allele of a gene dominates the other. This is just like when we mix a chocolate cupcake recipe together with a vanilla one and get a chocolate tasting cupcake. Even though both recipes were made, chocolate wins out.  The hidden gene version is called the recessive allele. So if you get a dominant allele of a gene from one parent and a recessive allele from the other, you'll only show the dominant trait. Even though the recessive one is still in there.  This is how earlobes were thought to work. Often the kids of one parent with attached and one parent with unattached earlobes will all have unattached earlobes. Because unattached was thought to be dominant.  But unlike cupcakes, the dominant version doesn't seem to always win. Sometimes you'll end up with a recessive trait even if one of your parents has a dominant one. Sometimes a chocolate and a vanilla make a vanilla.  To understand why this is, we need to remember that we have two copies of each of our genes. Sometimes someone with a dominant trait has a hidden recessive allele. If they pass that on (and the other parent does too), then the child will have the recessive trait.  So for earlobes, imagine a parent with an attached and an unattached allele. This parent will have unattached earlobes but could pass the attached allele to their child. That child might end up with attached earlobes. Click here to read more about how this works.  Of course, given all of this, two parents with a recessive trait can't have a child with a dominant one. So two parents with attached earlobes should not be able to have a child with unattached ones. Except that sometimes they do. Which means that earlobes are more complicated than is usually advertised.   Ear Lobe Studies  In one of the first earlobe studies , scientists concluded that unattached earlobes were dominant over attached ones. They based this on two families.  Everyone in the first family had attached earlobes and everyone in the second had unattached ones. When a man from the first family married a woman from the second, all six kids had unattached earlobes.  But in lots of follow up studies , this result didn't hold up anymore. Sometimes parents with attached earlobes had kids with unattached earlobes. So the scientists concluded that earlobe inheritance must be more complicated than they initially thought. And that it might even involve more than one gene.  Why the different results? There are at least a couple of reasons.  The first explanation is actually something you may already know -- things often happen by chance. If you flip a coin three times, the chances of them all being heads is high enough that you might bet on it. However, few people would bet on having 100 coin flips all be heads. This is because even though the chances of any one coin flip being heads is 50-50, the chances of 100 of them doing so are much less than this.  What if something similar is going on for earlobes? Imagine that earlobes often followed a simple dominant/recessive pattern. But not always. Maybe one in every 100 people would have unattached earlobes when his or her parents both have attached ones.  If we look at only a dozen people, we are likely to miss this. We might conclude that earlobe inheritance is simple and predictable based on genetic rules of dominance. And we'd be wrong.  The second issue with the initial studies is that they looked at only two families and the children from the marriage. People that live in the same regions of the world often share many of the same alleles. And members of the same family share even more.  So it could very well be that in the family they studied unattached earlobes were dominant because everyone shared the same set of alleles. But a more diverse set of people may follow a different pattern because they have different alleles.  It could also be that there are different ways to end up with attached and unattached earlobes. Sometimes they work in a simple dominant/recessive way and sometimes they don't. The scientists happened to study a couple of families where the simple explanation was right.   Exceptions to the Rules  So there you have it: it isn't actually surprising or uncommon for parents from families with attached earlobes to have a child with unattached earlobes. What is more surprising is that the old data has hung around for so long and that everyone has ignored the more recent data.  We simply do not yet understand how earlobe attachment is passed down. And we probably won't for a long time. This is not a problem keeping scientists up at night!  A word of caution though. Even if earlobe attachment were a simple dominant/recessive trait, there still would be rare exceptions. Nothing in genetics is 100%; things can and do change.

Some genes are like cookie recipes. If you mix them together, you get a combination of the two.  You can't tell that heads and tails are equally likely from just a few flips.

Privacy Policy  Disclaimer  Our Mission                                Fundamentals of Inheritance  In the 1860s, Gregor Mendel studied seven clearly defined traits in 
        pea plants, each of which occurred in one of two characteristic forms. 
        After eight years of rather painstaking study on how traits were passed 
        from one generation to another, Mendel presented his findings to an audience 
        unable to understand it or its significance.  Mendel lived in the 1800s. His contemporaries thought parent's "hereditary 
        fluids" mixed together in some unknown manner during the formation of 
        progeny and "blended" to produce offspring with a mixture of their parent's 
        characteristics.  It was not until 1900, years after his death, that three other scientists, 
        working independently, rediscovered his work and recognized its significance.  The study of the pattern of inheritance that follows the laws formulated 
        by Mendel is often referred to as Mendelian Genetics. We will take a look 
        at Mendel's laws in a moment, but first lets look at some terminology.  You have probably used the term, gene . A gene is a 
        piece of DNA consisting of many nucleotides that codes for some gene product. 
        When passed on to progeny, genes represent hereditary information. Mendel 
        thought of them as "particles" or beads on chromosomes. His concept is 
        not so inaccurate because genes are located on specific portions of a 
        chromosome; however, they are not like beads on a string.  Remember that sexually reproducing organisms are diploid. Diploid cells 
        have two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from each parent. Therefore, 
        they have two chromosomes of each kind and two genes for each characteristic . 
        When gametes are produced by meiosis, reduction division occurs to reduce 
        the chromosome number to haploid and to produce cells (eggs, sperm) that 
        have one chromosome of each of the pairs that was in the diploid cell 
        that underwent meiosis.  Sexual reproduction implies the fertilization of a haploid egg cell 
        by a haploid sperm cell. Therefore, the resulting zygote has inherited 
        one gene of each type from both parents. The following diagram explains these relationships.  Once again, each diploid organism has two genes for each characteristic. 
        These two genes for the same trait or characteristic are referred to as alleles . The following diagram explains this idea 
        of alleles. There may be several alternative forms of each gene in a population.  Alleles are always located on a pair of chromosomes where one allele 
        is opposite the other at some same specific location or locus .  The genome is a set of all the genes necessary to specify 
        an organism's characteristics. The genotype of an organism 
        is a listing of the genes present in that organism. Since it consists 
        of the cell's DNA code, you cannot really see a genotype. It is probably 
        not possible to know the complete genotype of most organisms although 
        we are working on it for humans. It is certainly possible, however, to 
        know the genes present that determine a particular characteristic.  Look around at several of your classmate's earlobes. Some will have 
        the lobe attached to their head; others will have the lobe free. This 
        trait is inherited. Let's call the allele for free earlobes a capital 
        E. And, let's call the allele for attached earlobes a lowercase e.  Now consider the genotypic combinations of the two alleles possible 
        for an individual:   Could be EE; free earlobes  Could be Ee; also free earlobes  Could be ee; attached earlobes   The expression of one's genotype, such as EE, Ee or ee, is called one's phenotype .  For various reasons, certain genes may not express themselves. Sometimes, 
        the physical environment determines whether or not certain genes function. 
        An human example for this sort of thing would be freckles. While the gene 
        for freckles may be present, it will not be expressed unless the individual 
        is exposed to sunlight.  The expression of some genes is directly influenced by the presence 
        of other alleles in the organism. For any particular pair of alleles in 
        an individual, the two alleles from the two parents are either identical 
        or not identical.  The individual is homozygous for the trait when it 
        has two identical alleles. In the example above about earlobes, both the 
        EE and ee individuals are homozygous for the trait. The person with the 
        Ee genotype is heterozygous for the trait, in this case, 
        free earlobes. An individual is heterozygous for a trait when it has two 
        different allelic forms of a particular gene. The heterozygous individual 
        received one form of the gene from one parent and a different allele from 
        the other parent.  Often one gene expresses itself and the other does not. A dominant 
        allele expresses itself and masks the effect of the other trait. 
        The allele for free earlobes is dominant.  A recessive allele is one that, when present with another 
        allele, does not express itself; it is masked by the effect of the other 
        allele. If you have attached earlobes, you have two alleles for the trait.  Recessive genes are not less likely to be inherited. They must, however, 
        be present in a homozygous condition to be expressed.  Mendelian genetics involves the study of the transfer of genes from 
        one generation to another and the ways in which the genes received from 
        the parents influence the traits of offspring.  Let's return now to Mendel. Mendel concluded which of the traits that 
        he studied were dominant and which were recessive. What made his work 
        unique was that he studied only one trait at a time. What he found is 
        shown in the following table.    Characteristic  Alleles  Dominant  Recessive    Plant height  Tall and dwarf  Tall  Dwarf    Pod shape  Full and constricted  Full  Constricted    Pod color  Green and yellow  Green  Yellow    Seed surface  Round and wrinkled  Round  Wrinkled    Seed color  Yellow and green  Yellow  Green    Flower color  Purple and white  Purple  White     Previous investigators had tried to follow numerous traits at the same 
        time and became hopelessly muddled because a large set of characteristics 
        is cumbersome to work with. Mendel also used traits with clear-cut alternatives 
        such as purple or white flower color. He was also lucky to have chosen 
        pea plants because they self-pollinate. When self-pollination occurs, 
        it is possible to develop a population of plants that is homozygous for 
        a number of characteristics. Such a population is known as a pure 
        line .  Mendel took a pure line of pea plants having purple flowers, removed 
        the male parts (anthers) and discarded them so that they could not self-pollinate. 
        He then took anthers from a homozygous white flower pea plant and pollinated 
        the antherless purple flowers.  When the pollinated flowers produced seeds, Mendel collected them and 
        planted them. They eventually produced flowers and all of the flowers were purple.  This result collided with the prevailing notion of the day that would 
        have predicted the resulting flower color to have be a "blend" of white 
        and purple--a lighter purple. Another favored notion of the day was that 
        the resulting flowers should have been a mixture of white and purple flowers. 
        But all the flowers were purple.  Mendel repeated his experiments with homozygous strains for the other 
        traits in the table above. The results were the same: the offspring showed 
        the characteristic of one parent and not the other.  Next, Mendel crossed the offspring of the purple-white flower cross 
        (all of which had purple flowers) with each other to see what he would 
        get in a third generation of plants. Had the characteristic of the white 
        flowered parent been lost?  When the seeds produced by this cross were planted and the plants allowed 
        to flower, Mendel noted that three-fourths of them produced 
        purple flowers; one-fourth produced white flowers.  After Mendel analyzed his data, he came up with several findings which 
        have since become known as "laws."   Mendel's law of dominance  When an organism has two different allels for a trait, the allele 
          that is expressed, overshadowing the expression of the other allele,is 
          said to be dominant . The gene whose expression is overshadowed 
          is said to be recessive.  Mendel's law of segregation  When gametes are formed by a diploid organism, the alleles that control 
          a trait separate from one another into different gametes, retaining 
          their individuality.  Mendel's law of independent assortment  Members of one gene pair separate from each other independently of 
          the members of other pairs.   Keep in mind that biologists knew nothing of chromosomes or DNA or the 
        processes of mitosis and meiosis during Mendel's time. Mendel just assumed 
        that each gene was separate from other genes. It was indeed fortunate 
        for him that the characteristics he chose to study in pea plants are found 
        on separate chromosomes.  In order to study hereditary problems, you need to have a simple understanding 
        of probability. Probability is the chance that an event 
        will happen, and is often expressed as a percent or a fraction. It is 
        not the same as a possibility .  When you flip a coin, the probability of your getting a "heads" is 0.5 
        or 50% because there are only two sides to the coin. Probability can be 
        expressed as a fraction as follows:      So, the probability of cutting a deck of playing cards and getting the 
        ace of spades is 1/52.   What about just an ace, no matter the suit?   ? 1/100. 4/52 or 1/13. 1/200.    You can also determine the probability of two independent events that 
        occur together. This probability is the product of their individual probabilities. 
        For instance, if you throw a pair of dice, it is possible that both will 
        be fours. What is the probability? The probability of one die being a 
        four is 1/6. Therefore, the probability of throwing two fours is:      The first kind of heredity problem I will work out for you is the easiest 
        type; a single-factor cross. I will use the earlobes alleles as an example. 
        In humans, remember, the allele for free earlobes is dominant and the 
        allele for attached earlobes is recessive. If both parents are heterozygous 
        (have one allele for free earlobes and one allele for attached earlobes), 
        what is the probability that they can have a child with free earlobes? 
        with attached earlobes?  Here is how to solve this query.    Step 1: Assign a symbol for each allele. 
            Usually a capital letter is used for dominant allele and lower case 
            letter for recessive allele.        E = free earlobes    e = attached earlobes        Genotype    Phenotype    EE    free earlobes    Ee    free earlobes    ee    attached earlobes        Step 2: Determine the genotype of each 
            parent and indicate a mating, Since both parents are heterozygous, 
            the male genotype is Ee. The female genotype is also Ee. The X between 
            them indicates a mating.    Ee X Ee        Step 3: Determine all the possible kinds 
            of gametes each parent can produce. Remember that gametes are haploid; 
            therefore they can only have one allele instead of the two present 
            in the diploid parent cell.    Since the male has both the free earlobe allele and the attached-earlobe 
        allele, half of his gametes will contain the free-earlobe allele and the 
        other half will contain the attached-earlobe allele. The same is true 
        for the female since she has the same genotype.  Now put this information into a Punnett square, a box that allows you 
        to determine genotypes and phenotypes of offspring from a particular cross.     Looking at the allelic combinations, determine the phenotype of these possible 
      combinations. In the above box, three of the offspring EE, Ee, and Ee have 
      free earlobes. One offspring, ee, has attached earlobes. The probability 
      of having offspring with free earlobes then is 3/4; for attached earlobes, 
      it is 1/4.  Below is an interactive Punnett square generator. You may duplicate

The probability of one independent event does not affect the probability of another independent event, and the probability of two independent events occurring is the product of their probabilities.  Because both parents have unattached earlobes and their child has attached earlobes, we know that both parents must be heterozygous (Aa) for this trait; this wouldn't be possible any other way.  To find the probability that the couple's next child has attached earlobes, we need the probability of two (a) alleles coming together to form an (aa) zygote.  The probability of dad producing an (a) gamete is 1/2 because he can make either (A) or (a) gametes in equal numbers.  The probability of mom producing an (a) gamete is also 1/2 for the same reason.  Mom and dad producing gametes are independent events because whatever gametes one produces has absolutely no effect on the types of gametes the other produces.  Thus, to get the probability of two (a) gametes coming together to form an (aa) child, we multiply 1/2 by 1/2 to get 1/4.  The child has a 1/4 chance of having attached earlobes.  (You also could obtain this by doing a Punnett square and realizing that 1 out of 4 possible children has this genotype/phenotype.)  No matter what child we are talking about, the probability of having a child with attached earlobes is always 1/4 because the children are independent of each other.  The probability of the next child being a girl with attached earlobes is the product of two independent events:  being a girl, and having attached earlobes.  The probability of a child being a girl is 1/2, as boys and girls are equally likely to form.  (Like having attached earlobes, this can be determined by thinking about gametes from each parent, or by using a Punnett square.)  The probability of having attached earlobes is 1/4, as we already figured out.  Thus, the probability of being a girl AND having attached earlobes is 1/2 x 1/4 = 1/8.  Don't let the first child throw you off.  Unless they are handpicking which gametes come together to form their sibling, they have no bearing on the genotype and phenotype probabilities of the next offspring.  If the question asked about the probability of the next TWO children having attached earlobes, then you would have to multiply 1/4 by 1/4 to get 1/16, because the next two children both having attached earlobes are two independent events, but once again, the first child plays no role.

If two parents with unattached earlobes have a child with attached earlobes (aa), then both parents must have been heterozygotes (Aa).  Hence, each parent donated the recessive allele for attached earlobes to their offspring.  Based on the crossing between the two heterozygotes, you can conclude there was a 25% chance(1/4) of producing an offspring with attached earlobes.  To determine the probability that the next child will have attached earlobes, you merely multiply 1/4 by 1/4, which will give you 1/16.  Hence, the probability that the next child will have attached earlobes is 1/16.  For the second question, there is always a 50% chance that the offspring will be female, and a 50% chance that the offspring will be male.  This can be represented by the following cross:  (XX) x (XY): 50% (1/2) chance of producing an offspring that is female (XX) 50% chance of producing an offspring that is male (XY).

Genetics problems and Answers ! - Sunday, April 9th. Have fun studying .  1. A woman is heterozygous for Tay-Sachs (a recessive disorder).
What are the chances of her giving birth to a child with Tay-Sachs if the
father is normal (homozygous dominant?) What are the chances of giving birth
to a carrier?   Woman: Tt Man: TT No chance of child with disease; 50% chance of carrier   2. Both you and your sister have attached earlobes, yet
your parents have unattached ones. Unattached earlobes are dominant over
attached. Give the genotypes of you, your sister, and your parents.   Genotypes of you and sis ­ uu Genotypes of parents ­ Uu   3. Parents who are carriers for sickle-cell disease produce
a child who has sickle-cell disease. What are the chances that their next
child will have sickle-cell disease?   25% (1/4) chance of ss = sickle cell disease   4. A woman with PKU (kk) marries a man who is genotypically
normal (KK). Which best describes the chances that their child will: be
genotypically normal (KK), be a carrier for PKU (Kk), or have the disease
PKU (kk) ?   25% genotypically normal KK, 50% carrier
  Kk, 25% PKU kk   5. If both your parents have a continuous hairline (cc),
what best describes your possibilities for hairlines?   cc only possiblilty = continuous hairline   6. Both Dick and Jane have freckles (dominant) and attached
earlobes (recessive). Six of their children do not have freckles. What are
the chances that their next child will have freckles and attached earlobes?   Since 6 of their children do not have
  freckles (ff), the parents are heteros (Ff).  Since earlobes are recessive (ee), their
  kids will always have attached earlobes ­ so you can ignore
  this part of the problem (ie multiply by 1)  Chance of freckles = 3/4 x chance of
  attached earlobes = 1 = 3/4 chance   7. In a dihybrid cross of a heterozygous pea plant with
purple flowers and round seeds (PpRr), what is the probability that   Do a Punnitt square for each trait.  Purple = 3/4, white = 1/4; PP = 1/4,
  Pp = 1/2, pp = 1/4  Round seeds = 3/4, wrinkled = 1/4; RR
  = 1/4, Rr = 1/2, rr = 1/4  Then multiply fractions (every time you
  see the words "white flower" insert a 1/4, round seeds , insert
  a3/4 etc) . Note the 9:3:3:1 phenotype on a-d.    a) a white-flowered pea plant with round seeds will be
  produced? 1/4 x 3/4 = 3/16 b) a purple-flowered pea plant with round seeds will be produced? 3/4 x 3/4 = 9/16 c) a white-flowered pea plant with wrinkled seeds will be produced? 1/4 x 1/4 = 1/16 d) a purple-flowered pea plant with wrinkled seeds will be produced? 3/4 x 1/4 = 3/16 e) the genotype PpRr will result? 1/2
  x 1/2 = 1/4 f) the genotype ppRr will result? 1/4
  x 1/2 = 1/8 (does it make sense that there would be fewer of these? Think
  of the phenptype.) g) the genotype PpRR will result? 1/2
  x 1/4 = 1/8 h) the genotype ppRr will result? Oops
  ­ same thing as e!     8. In a trihybrid cross of a tall, purple-flowered pea
plant with round seeds (TtPpRr) with a tall, white-flowered pea plant with
wrinkled seeds (Ttpprr), what is the probability:   Do a Punnitt square for each trait. Different
  ratios this time because parents are not both heteros.  Tall = 3/4 tall, 1/4 short (dwarf)  Purple = 1/2, white = 1/2;  Round = 1/2, wrinkled = 1/2  Then multiply fractions (every time you
  see the words "white flower" insert a 1/2, tall , insert a 3/4
  etc) .   a) that a tall, white-flowered plant with wrinkled seeds
will be produced? 3/4 x 1/2 x 1/2 =
3/16 b) that a short, purple-flowered plant with round seeds will be produced? 1/4 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/16 c) that a short, white-flowered plant with wrinkled seeds will be produced? 1/4 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/16 d) that a tall, purple-flowered plant with round seeds will be produced? 3/4 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 3/16 e) that a tall, white-flowered plant with round seeds will be produced? 3/4 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 3/16    9. A woman is heterozygous for polydactyly and has 6 fingers
on each hand (polydactyly is a dominant trait). What are the chances of
her giving birth to a child with polydactyly if the father is normal (homozygous
recessive)?   Mom is Pp, dad is pp = 50% chance of polydactyly
  (Pp)   10. Both a husband and wife have normal vision but their
son is color blind. What are the likely genotypes of the boy's parents?
Of the boy?   Dad= XAY (normal) Mom = XAXa (recessive = colorblind allele; mom has normal vision due to
  XA) Boy = XaY (recessive from mom = colorblind son)   11. In Labrador retriever dogs, the gene B (dominant) produces
black coat color (black Labs), with the homozygous recessive condition (bb)
producing brown Labs. The dominant epistatic gene E controls the presence
of coat color. The homozygous recessive ee condition prevents the deposition
of coat color, resulting in a golden Lab. Give the probability of the following
crosses. In addition, list the gentoype(s) that would produce those phenotypes:  Again, do Punnitt squares for each trait   Cross 1:  Black Lab x Golden Lab  EeBb x eeBb  Cross 1 = Ee x ee = 1/2 coat color deposited,
  1/2 coat color not deposited (golden)  = Bb x Bb = 3/4 black (BB or Bb), 1/4
  brown (bb)  Probability of: Genotype(s):  Golden Lab: eeBB,
  eeBb, eebb  1/2 x 3/4 = 3/8 PLUS 1/2 x 1/4 = 1/8  total = 4/8 (or 1/2; 50%)  Black Lab: EeBB
  or EeBb  1/2 x 3/4 = 3/8  Brown Lab: Eebb  1/2 x 1/4 = 1/8  This litter will give 50% goldens (notice
  that there are 3 e alleles from parents) and almost as many blacks, an
  occasional chocolate   Cross 2:  Brown Lab x Golden Lab  Eebb eebb  Cross 2 = Ee x ee = 1/2 coat color deposited,
  1/2 coat color not deposited (golden)  = bb x bb = 4/4 brown (or 1) (bb)  Probability of: Genotype(s):  Golden Lab: eebb  1/2 x 1 = 1/2 (or 50%)  Black Lab: EeBB
  or EeBb  NO CHANCE  Brown Lab: Eebb  1/2 x 1 = 1/2  This litter will give 50% goldens and
  50% chocolates, no blacks     Home            Search Create Log in Sign up Log in Sign up  47 terms aricheyyy Chapter 10 STUDY PLAY Genetics is the study of inheritance. -------- can predict how genes may be passed on to future generations. Requires an understanding of How genes are organized on chromosomes How chromosomes are passed on during meiosis Gene A piece of DNA that has the necessary information to code for a protein and regulate its expression Found on a chromosome Related to a characteristic of an organism These characteristics result from the work of a particular protein. Eye color Flower color Pea shape What is an allele? One particular gene may exist in multiple forms. -A specific version of a gene Example: Earlobe-shaped gene There are two different alleles for this gene. Attached earlobe Free earlobe Different alleles code for different forms of the same protein. The different forms of the protein function differently. Result in different characteristics genome. The sum total of an organism's genes is called its diploid In sexually reproducing organisms, the genome is This means that they have two copies of every gene. The copies may not be identical, so one individual could have two different alleles. haploid Single-celled organisms and sex-cells are They only have one copy of each gene. They only have one allele. Sex cells -are sperm and egg. Sperm and egg only receive one set of that individual's genes. When haploid egg joins with haploid sperm (fertilization), a diploid zygote results. The zygote receives half of its genome from the sperm and half of its genome from the egg. Has a unique set of genes, different from the parents Meiosis is the process by which egg and sperm are made. Homologous chromosomes can carry different alleles. When the homologous chromosomes separate during meiosis, the alleles are delivered to different sex cells. Three questions allow us to predict how a trait will be inherited: What alleles do the parents have for that trait? What alleles will be present in the gametes that the parents produce? What is the likelihood that gametes with specific combinations of alleles will be fertilized? Diploid organisms have two copies of every gene. This means that one individual can have two different versions of a gene. The term allele is used to identify different versions of a gene. Genotype describes the combination of alleles present in the organism's cells. Phenotype describes the organism's appearance. This is a result of its genotype. Example: earlobe shape Phenotypes: free or attached Genotypes: EE (two alleles for free earlobes) Earlobes will be free ee (two alleles for attached earlobes) Earlobes will be attached Ee (one allele for free and one allele for attached) Earlobes will be free The free earlobe allele is dominant. It out-performs the attached earlobe allele. The attached earlobe allele is recessive. Masked by the dominant allele when present together Only expressed when two copies are present Homozygous Two copies of the same allele EE is homozygous dominant. ee is homozygous recessive. Heterozygous Two different alleles Ee individual with the dominant phenotype (Predicting Genotype from Phenotype) Could be homozygous dominant Could be heterozygous A person with free earlobes could be EE or Ee individual with the recessive phenotype (Predicting Genotype from Phenotype) Is always homozygous recessive A person with attached earlobes is ee. Law of Segregation (Predicting Gametes from Meiosis) Alleles will separate during meiosis. Each gamete will receive one allele. -An EE individual will make gametes that have E. -An ee individual will make gametes that have e. -An Ee individual will make gametes that have either E or e. Fertilization (Predicting Offspring from Fertilization) is the process of two haploid sex cells joining to form a diploid zygote. The genotype of the offspring will be determined by the alleles carried by the gametes. genetic cross is a planned mating between two organisms. Punnett square The outcome of a given cross is predicted monohybrid crosses Single-factor crosses track the inheritance of one trait. dihybrid crosses Double-factor crosses track the inheritance of two traits. Probability is the mathematical chance that an event will happen. Expressed as a percent, or a fraction Probability = the # of events that can produce a given outcome/the total # of possible outcomes. The probability of two or more events occurring simultaneously is the product of their individual probabilities. Probability vs. Possibility Possibility states that an event can happen; probability states how likely the event is to happen. Gregor Mendel The First Geneticist: Mendel was a monk who was the first to describe the basic patterns of inheritance. Studied inheritance in garden pea plants Studied several different phenotypes Identified the concepts of dominance and recessiveness Didn't know about genes or chromosomes Identified patterns by mathematical analysis of the data Mendel's Experiment Parental (P) generation A pure-breeding purple-flowered plant mated with a pure-breeding white-flowered plant. CC x cc First filial generation (F1) All offspring had purple flowers (Cc). They were allowed to self-pollinate. Cc x Cc Second filial generation (F2) ¾ of the offspring were purple ¼ of the offspring were white 3:1 ratio, purple: white Mendel saw this pattern with any of the traits he studied. Mendel's conclusions Organisms have two pieces of genetic information for each trait. We know these as alleles. The Law of Dominance Some alleles mask other alleles. Gametes fertilize randomly. The Law of Segregation Alleles separate into gametes during meiosis. Solving genetics problems: single-factor crosses The pod color of some pea plants is inherited so that green pods are dominant to yellow pods. A pea plant that is heterozygous for green pods is crossed to a pea plant that produces yellow pods. What proportion of the offspring will have green pods? Steps of solving Step I: Make a Gene Key Step 2: Identify Information in the Problem EX: A green plant is crossed with a yellow plant. The green pod plant is heterozygous. Gg The yellow pod plant is homozygous. gg The cross is Gg x gg. Step 3: Determine Possible Gametes from Each Parent EX: Heterozygous green pod parent (Gg) Could make gametes with G or g Homozygous yellow pod parent (gg) Could make gametes with g Step 4: Create a Punnett Square ex: Put the gametes from one parent on one side. Put the gametes from the other parent on the other side. Simulate random fertilization by crossing the possible gametes. This will determine offspring phenotypes. Step 5: Determine Offspring Phenotypes and Calculate Probability EX: Use the gene key to determine the phenotype of the offspring you predicted. Revisit the question to calculate the answer to the question. What proportion of offspring will produce green pods? The answer is 50%. Cross #2: PKU The normal condition is to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine. It is dominant over the condition for PKU. If both parents are heterozygous for PKU, what is the probability that they will have A child that is normal? A child with PKU? Double-factor crosses Dihybrid crosses track the inheritance of two traits. Mendel used dihybrid crosses to identify the law of independent assortment. States that alleles of one character separate independently of alleles of another character Only true when the genes for the two characters are on different chromosomes Solving double-factor crosses When solving a double-factor cross, you must obey the law of segregation and the law of independent assortment. Each gamete must receive only one copy of each gene. All combinations of alleles for A and B must be considered. Consider an individual whose genotype is AaBb. Gametes could receive AB, Ab, aB, or ab. A sample double-factor cross In humans the allele for free earlobes is dominant over the allele for attached earlobes. The allele for dark hair dominates the allele for light hair. If both parents are heterozygous for earlobe shape and hair color, what types of offspring can they produce, and what is the probability for each type? Modified mendelian patterns Some alleles have consistent dominant/recessive patterns like Mendel observed. However, many traits are not inherited following these patterns. Several other types of inheritance patterns exist. Codominance Some alleles are codominant. Both phenotypes are expressed together in a heterozygote. This will result in three phenotypes. Horse color DR DR is chestnut color DR DW is white color DW DW is palomino-colored (chestnut with white mane and tail) Incomplete Dominance Occurs when the phenotype of the heterozygote is intermediate between the two homozygotes Appears as if the heterozygotes are blends of the homozygotes Snapdragons FwFw=white flower FrFr=red flower FwFw=pink flower Multiple alleles Some traits have more than two possible alleles for a single trait. Each person can only have two alleles for a given trait because diploid organisms have only 2 copies of each gene. Example: ABO blood types 3 alleles for blood type antigens on red blood cells IA = blood type A antigens IB = blood type B antigens i = blood type O, neither type A or type B antigens Six possible genotypes; each individual can only have two alleles IAIA, IAi = Type A blood IBIB, IBi = Type B blood IBIA = Type AB blood Ii = Type O blood Polygenic Inheritance Some characteristics are determined by the interaction of several genes. A number of different pairs of alleles combine their efforts to determine a characteristic. Polygenic inheritance is common with characteristics that show great variety within the population. Height, eye color, intelligence, etc. Pleiotropy Some genes affect a variety of phenotypes. These genes are called pleiotropic. The disease PKU results from a mutation in one gene. The one defective protein leads to several phenotypes. Mental retardation, abnormal growth, pale skin pigmentation Linkage Genes that are on the same chromosome are linked. Linked genes are inherited together more often than would be predicted by probability. linkage group All of the genes on a given chromosome represent All of the genes in a linkage group will be inherited together. Crossing-over can separate linked genes and mix allele combinations. The closer genes are to one another on a chromosome, the less likely they will be separated by crossing-over, and the more likely they will be inherited together. Autosomal linkage Autosomes are the chromosomes that are not involved in sex determination. Of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, #1-22 are autosomes. Genes on the same autosomal chromosome are autosomally linked. #23 are sex chromosomes. Called X and Y Sex Determination he sex chromosomes, X and Y, are a homologous pair. This pair is unique because X and Y carry different sets of genes. The Y chromosome has genes that determine maleness. The X chromosome has a variety of genes on it, many of which are not involved in gender determination. Sex linkage Genes on the X or Y chromosomes are called sex-linked. Genes on the X chromosome are called X-linked. Males only have one X chromosome, so one copy of a recessive allele will result in the recessive phenotype in men. Women have two copies of X, so they can be heterozygous or carriers of a recessive trait without showing the phenotype. Hemophilia, color-blindness, muscular dystrophy X-Linked Inheritance Patterns In humans, the allele for normal color vision is dominant and the allele for color deficiency is recessive. Both alleles are X-linked. People who cannot detect the difference between certain colors such as green and red are described as having color-deficient vision. A male who has normal color vision mates with a female who is heterozygous for normal color vision. What type of children can they have in terms of these traits? What is the probability for each type? Other Influences on Phenotype Variable expressivity -Some dominant traits are not expressed equally in all individuals with the trait. -Polydactylism Environmental factors Can influence the expression of a trait Freckles and sunlight Diabetes and diet Advertisement Upgrade to remove ads Features Quizlet Live Quizlet Learn Diagrams Flashcards Mobile Help Sign up Help Center Honor Code Community Guidelines Students Teachers About Company Press Jobs Privacy Terms Follow us Language Deutsch English (UK) English (USA) Español Français (FR) Français (QC/CA) Bahasa Indonesia Italiano Nederlands polski Português (BR) Русский Türkçe Tiếng Việt 한국어 中文 (简体) 中文 (繁體) 日本語 © 2018 Quizlet Inc.

McDonald University of Delaware    Introduction  Arm folding  Asparagus urine  Attached earlobe  Beeturia  Bent pinkie  Cheek dimples  Cleft chin  Darwin's tubercle  Earwax  Eye color  Hair color  Hair whorl  Hand clasping  Hitchhiker's thumb  Mid-digital hair  PTC tasting  Toe length  Tongue rolling  Widow's peak    Attached earlobe: The myth  Some people have earlobes that curve up between the lowest point of the earlobe and the point where the ear joins the head; these are known as "free" or "unattached" earlobes, as shown in the upper left of the picture below. Other people have earlobes that blend in with the side of the head, known as "attached" or "adherent" earlobes, as shown in the lower right.  Attached vs. free earlobes are often used to illustrate basic genetics. The myth is that earlobes can be divided into into two clear categories, free and attached, and that a single gene controls the trait, with the allele for free earlobes being dominant. Neither part of the myth is true.     Earlobes ranging from unattached (upper left) to attached (lower right).    The reality  Earlobes as a character  Classroom exercises on earlobe genetics say that there are two distinct categories, free (F) and attached (A). However, many of the papers on earlobe genetics have pointed out that there are many people with intermediate earlobes (Quelprud 1934, Wiener 1937, Dutta and Ganguly 1965). El Kollali (2009) classified earlobes into three types, based on whether the attachment angle was acute, right, or obtuse. To make the picture above, I searched for pictures of professional bicyclists (because they have short hair), found 12 with their ears showing, and arranged them from free to attached. It doesn't look to me as if there are just two categories; instead, there is continuous variation in the height of the attachment point (the "otobasion inferius") relative to the lowest point on the earlobe (the "subaurale"). My own earlobes are exactly halfway in between the two extremes; I couldn't tell you whether my earlobes should be considered free or attached.  Family studies  Carrière (1922) and Hilden (1922) were among the first to study the genetics of earlobes, and they reached opposite conclusions. Carrière (1922) looked at 15 families and concluded that attached earlobes were dominant. However, all of the offspring of A x A matings had attached earlobes, and there were no F x F matings, so his data are consistent with either free or attached being dominant.  Powell and Whitney (1937) looked at one family and concluded that attached earlobes were recessive. Wiener (1937) responded by pointing out that the "arbitrary classification into two sharply defined types...gives a false picture, since all gradations between the two extremes are encountered." He divided earlobes into four arbitrary groups, from 0 (completely free) to 3 (completely attached). All possible matings, from completely 0 x 0 to 3 x 3, produced some intermediate earlobes. Wiener (1937) concluded that earlobes were determined by more than one gene, or by a singe gene with more than two alleles.  Lai and Walsh (1966) called earlobes in which the lowest point on the earlobe was the attachment point "attached," and they classified all other earlobes as "free." They recorded the following data on families in New Guinea:    Parents  F offspring  A offspring Percent F    F x F  12  22 35%    F x A  72  114 39%    A x A  37  90 29%    If the myth were true, two parents with attached earlobes could not have a child with a free earlobe. There are slightly more A offspring from A x A matings, but the large numbers of F offspring from A x A matings and A offspring from F x F matings indicate that this is not a one-locus, two-allele trait.  Mohanraju and Mukherjee (1973) performed a similar study in India and found similar results:    Parents  F offspring  A offspring Percent F    F x F  13  1 93%    F x A  7  7 50%    A x A  5  29 15%    They found a much stronger association between parents and offspring, but the five F offspring of A x A matings are inconsistent with the myth that this is a one-locus, two-allele trait.   Conclusion  Earlobes do not fall into two categories, "free" and "attached"; there is continuous variation in attachment point, from up near the ear cartilage to well below the ear. While there is probably some genetic influence on earlobe attachment point, family studies show that it does not fit the simple one-locus, two-allele myth. You should not use earlobe attachment to demonstrate basic genetics.   References  Carrière, R. 1922. Über erbliche Orhformen, insbesondere das angewachsene Ohrläppchen.

Donate Home Basic Genetics Observable Human Characteristics Observable Human Characteristics We are all unique. Even though we share some characteristics with our peers and our family members, every one of us 
has a unique combination of traits. Some traits are controlled by genes that pass from parent to child. Others are acquired through learning. But most 
are influenced by a combination of genes and environmental factors. Below are some examples of variable traits that 
are easy to observe. To learn more about traits see What are Traits? Earlobe attachment If earlobes hang free, they are detached. If they connect directly to the sides of the head, they are attached. Earlobe attachment is a continuous trait: while most earlobes can be neatly categorized as attached or unattached, some are in-between. Although some sources say that this trait is controlled by a single gene, with unattached earlobes being dominant over attached earlobes, no published studies support this view. Earlobe attachment and shape are inherited, but it is likely that many genes contribute to this trait. As such, its pattern of inheritance is difficult to predict. Tongue Rolling Some people can curl up the sides of their tongue to form a tube shape. In 1940, Alfred Sturtevant observed that about 70% of people of European ancestry could roll their tongues and the remaining 30% could not. Many sources state that tongue rolling is controlled by a single gene. However, as Sturtevant observed, people can learn to roll their tongue as they get older, suggesting that environmental factors—not just genes—influence the trait. Consistent with this view, just 70% of identical twins share the trait (if tongue rolling were influenced only by genes, then 100% of identical traits would share the trait).  Dimples  Dimples are small, natural indentations on the cheeks. They can appear on one or both sides, and they often change with age. Some people are born with dimples that disappear when they’re adults; others develop dimples later in childhood. Dimples are highly heritable, meaning that people who have dimples tend to have children with dimples—but not always. Because their inheritance isn&apos;t completely predictable, dimples are considered an “irregular” dominant trait. Having dimples is probably controlled mainly by one gene but also influenced by other genes.  Handedness  Handedness describes our preference for using either our left or right hand for activities such as writing and throwing a ball. Overall, about 10% of people are left-handed, but the number varies among cultures from 0.5% to 24%. Some have reported that handedness is controlled by just one or two genes, but this is not the case. Multiple studies present evidence that handedness is controlled by many genes—at least 30 and as many as 100—each with a small effect; many are linked to brain development. Environment also plays an important role: some cultures actively discourage left-handedness.  Freckles  Freckles are small, concentrated spots of a skin pigment called melanin. Most fair-skinned, red-haired people have them. Freckles are controlled primarily by the MC1R gene. Freckles show a dominant inheritance pattern: parents who have freckles tend to have children with freckles. Variations, also called alleles, of MC1R control freckle number. Other genes and the environment influence freckle size, color, and pattern. For example, sun exposure can temporarily cause more freckles to appear.  Curly hair  Round hair follicles make straight hair, flattened or c-shaped hair follicles make curly hair, and oval hair follicles make wavy hair. Hair texture is a continuous trait, meaning that hair can be straight or curly or anywhere in between. Curly hair is influenced by genes much more than by the environment. While curly hair runs in families—people with curly hair tend to have children with curly hair—its inheritance patterns are often unpredictable. Multiple genes control hair texture, and different variations in these genes are found in different populations. For instance, curly hair is common in African populations, rare in Asian populations, and in-between in Europeans. Straight hair in Asians is mostly caused by variations in two genes—different genes from the ones that influence hair texture in Europeans. And different genetic variations make hair curly in African and European populations.  Hand clasping  Without thinking about it, fold your hands together by interlocking your fingers. Which thumb is on top—your left or your right? One study found that 55% of people place their left thumb on top, 45% place their right thumb on top, and 1% have no preference. A study of identical twins concluded that hand clasping has a strong genetic basis (most twins share the trait), but it doesn’t fit a predictable inheritance pattern. It is likely affected by multiple genes as well as environmental factors.  Red/Green Colorblindness  Red-green colorblindness is caused by a single gene located on the X-chromosome. This gene codes for a protein in the eye that detects certain colors of light. When this gene is defective, the eye cannot differentiate between red and green. You need at least one working copy of the gene to be able to see red and green. Since boys have just one X-chromosome, which they receive from their mother, inheriting one defective copy of the gene will render them colorblind. Girls have two X-chromosomes; to be colorblind they must inherit two defective copies, one from each parent. Consequently, red-green colorblindness is much more frequent in boys (1 in 12) than in girls (1 in 250). Red-green color blindness follows a very predictable recessive, sex-linked inheritance pattern. A woman with one defective copy of the gene and one functional copy, even though she is not colorblind herself, is known as a "carrier." She has a 50% chance of passing the defective copy to each of her children. Half of her sons will be colorblind, and half of her daughters will be carriers.  Hairline shape  If your hairline forms a point at the center of the forehead, you have a widow&apos;s peak. If not, you have a straight hairline. While some sources say that widow’s peak is a dominant trait controlled by one gene, no scientific study supports this claim. Complicating the question of heritability is the fact that the trait is continuous: some people have just a slight suggestion of a peak. Widow&apos;s peak is likely controlled by genes rather than the environment. But while hairline shape tends to run in families, its pattern of inheritance is usually unpredictable, suggesting that multiple genes are involved.  PTC tasting  To about 75% of us, the chemical PTC (phenylthiocarbamide) tastes very bitter. For the other 25%, it is tasteless. The ability to taste PTC is controlled mainly by a single gene that codes for a bitter-taste receptor on the tongue. Different variations, or alleles, of this gene control whether PTC tastes bitter or not. PTC tasting follows a very predictable pattern of inheritance. Tasting is dominant, meaning that if you have at least one copy of the tasting version of the gene, you can taste PTC. Non-tasters have two copies of the non-tasting allele.

Why is that?        -An undergraduate from California   August 4, 2010  Sounds like you listened to your high school biology teacher about ear lobe genetics. Or did some research on your own.  Your teacher and just about everything on the web says that parents with attached earlobes can't have kids with unattached ones. And they're all wrong.  Most everyone presents ear lobe attachment as a very simple trait. (We've even fallen into this trap here .) But it's not. Even though ear lobe genetics hasn't been studied a whole lot, the little bit that has been done shows it is pretty complicated.  This means that it isn't uncommon for parents with attached earlobes to have kids with unattached lobes. Or even for parents to have kids with one attached and one unattached earlobe !  So what's going on here? Is there a vast conspiracy to make some people worry? Probably not.  There is a seed of truth to everything out there on the web. Early studies did create a model where parents with attached earlobes couldn't have kids with unattached ones. It is just that people probably didn't hear about the later studies that showed that this wasn't the case.  What I thought I'd do for the rest of the answer is go over the history of ear lobe genetics. I'll talk about why scientists thought what they did at first and then what caused them to reverse their thinking. To discuss all of this, we need to first step back and talk about dominant and recessive traits.   Genes Are Like Recipes  Most of us know that we get half our DNA from our mom and half from our dad. This DNA has long stretches in it called genes.  Each gene is a set of instructions for one small part of us. So all the genes in our DNA together have enough information to make an entire human being.  Now here's something interesting: we all have almost the exact same set of genes! Which might make you think that everyone should look identical. But we don't, of course. So what's going on?  Although we all have the same set of genes, we can have different versions of some of them. These different versions of the same gene are called alleles. And it is these different alleles that make each of us unique.  Imagine an oatmeal cookie recipe. Some people have a recipe for an oatmeal cookie with raisins and some people have one with chocolate chips. But they're both still oatmeal cookie recipes.  Same thing with genes. For example, there is a hair color gene that comes in two versions, red and not-red. Which alleles you get determine whether you'll have red hair or not. Just like which recipe you use determines if you'll have raisins or chocolate chips in your oatmeal cookie.   Gene Versions That Dominate  Remember, we get a copy of each gene from our mom and a copy from our dad. So our bodies take the two versions of every gene and follow each set of instructions.  Sometimes, the instructions go together and we can see the result of both. If you mix a recipe for oatmeal chocolate chip together with one for oatmeal raisin, you'll get oatmeal chocolate chip raisin cookies.  Sometimes, though, one allele of a gene dominates the other. This is just like when we mix a chocolate cupcake recipe together with a vanilla one and get a chocolate tasting cupcake. Even though both recipes were made, chocolate wins out.  The hidden gene version is called the recessive allele. So if you get a dominant allele of a gene from one parent and a recessive allele from the other, you'll only show the dominant trait. Even though the recessive one is still in there.  This is how earlobes were thought to work. Often the kids of one parent with attached and one parent with unattached earlobes will all have unattached earlobes. Because unattached was thought to be dominant.  But unlike cupcakes, the dominant version doesn't seem to always win. Sometimes you'll end up with a recessive trait even if one of your parents has a dominant one. Sometimes a chocolate and a vanilla make a vanilla.  To understand why this is, we need to remember that we have two copies of each of our genes. Sometimes someone with a dominant trait has a hidden recessive allele. If they pass that on (and the other parent does too), then the child will have the recessive trait.  So for earlobes, imagine a parent with an attached and an unattached allele. This parent will have unattached earlobes but could pass the attached allele to their child. That child might end up with attached earlobes. Click here to read more about how this works.  Of course, given all of this, two parents with a recessive trait can't have a child with a dominant one. So two parents with attached earlobes should not be able to have a child with unattached ones. Except that sometimes they do. Which means that earlobes are more complicated than is usually advertised.   Ear Lobe Studies  In one of the first earlobe studies , scientists concluded that unattached earlobes were dominant over attached ones. They based this on two families.  Everyone in the first family had attached earlobes and everyone in the second had unattached ones. When a man from the first family married a woman from the second, all six kids had unattached earlobes.  But in lots of follow up studies , this result didn't hold up anymore. Sometimes parents with attached earlobes had kids with unattached earlobes. So the scientists concluded that earlobe inheritance must be more complicated than they initially thought. And that it might even involve more than one gene.  Why the different results? There are at least a couple of reasons.  The first explanation is actually something you may already know -- things often happen by chance. If you flip a coin three times, the chances of them all being heads is high enough that you might bet on it. However, few people would bet on having 100 coin flips all be heads. This is because even though the chances of any one coin flip being heads is 50-50, the chances of 100 of them doing so are much less than this.  What if something similar is going on for earlobes? Imagine that earlobes often followed a simple dominant/recessive pattern. But not always. Maybe one in every 100 people would have unattached earlobes when his or her parents both have attached ones.  If we look at only a dozen people, we are likely to miss this. We might conclude that earlobe inheritance is simple and predictable based on genetic rules of dominance. And we'd be wrong.  The second issue with the initial studies is that they looked at only two families and the children from the marriage. People that live in the same regions of the world often share many of the same alleles. And members of the same family share even more.  So it could very well be that in the family they studied unattached earlobes were dominant because everyone shared the same set of alleles. But a more diverse set of people may follow a different pattern because they have different alleles.  It could also be that there are different ways to end up with attached and unattached earlobes. Sometimes they work in a simple dominant/recessive way and sometimes they don't. The scientists happened to study a couple of families where the simple explanation was right.   Exceptions to the Rules  So there you have it: it isn't actually surprising or uncommon for parents from families with attached earlobes to have a child with unattached earlobes. What is more surprising is that the old data has hung around for so long and that everyone has ignored the more recent data.  We simply do not yet understand how earlobe attachment is passed down. And we probably won't for a long time. This is not a problem keeping scientists up at night!  A word of caution though. Even if earlobe attachment were a simple dominant/recessive trait, there still would be rare exceptions. Nothing in genetics is 100%; things can and do change.

Some genes are like cookie recipes. If you mix them together, you get a combination of the two.  You can't tell that heads and tails are equally likely from just a few flips.

In some cases the lower lobe is connected to the side of the face. Since the earlobe does not contain cartilage [1] it has a large blood supply and may help to warm the ears and maintain balance. However, earlobes are not generally considered to have any major biological function. [2] The earlobe contains many nerve endings , and for some people is an erogenous zone .  The zoologist Desmond Morris in his book The Naked Ape (1967) conjectured that the lobes developed as an additional erogenous zone to facilitate the extended sexuality necessary in the evolution of human monogamous pair bonding.

[4] However this is not the case, in the surrounding tissue there are no somites – thus also there is no dermatome. In this area, the dermis is derived from cells of mesenchymal cells , whereas the mesenchyme is derived from the sclerotome and splanchnopleura located in the nearby regions of the torso . [5]  The earlobe as a body part arises and develops in the vicinity of auricular follicle, as a result of cascade induction: [6]   The first-level inductor is the central segment of Archenteron's roof , which induces the production of the Medulla oblongata (part of the Hindbrain ).  The second-level inductor is the Medulla oblongata , which induces the production of a pair of auricular follicles derived from the mesoderm .  The third-level inductor is the auricular follicle, which induces the production of the auditory bulla .   Genetics [ edit ]      Clint Eastwood , who has an extreme form of attached ear lobe.    Earlobes average about 2 centimeters long, and elongate slightly with age. [7] Although the "free" vs. "attached" appearance of earlobes is often presented as an example of a simple "one gene – two alleles" Mendelian trait in humans, earlobes do not all fall neatly into either category; there is a continuous range from one extreme to the other, suggesting the influence of several genes.

(1952) [12]    Clinical significance [ edit ]  Earlobes are normally smooth, but occasionally exhibit creases. Creased earlobes are sometimes associated with genetic disorders in children, including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome . [24] In some early studies, earlobe creases were thought to be associated with an increased risk of heart attack and coronary heart disease ; however, more recent studies have concluded that since earlobes become more creased with age, and older people are more likely to experience heart disease than younger people, age may account for the findings linking heart attack to earlobe creases. [24] The earlobe crease is also called Frank's Sign .  Society and culture [ edit ]     Stretched earlobe piercing, Ethiopia    Earlobe piercing and stretching [ edit ]  Piercing the earlobes is a commonplace activity in many cultures in many historical eras; no other location on the body is as commonly pierced. Consequently, injury to the earlobe due to the weight of heavy earrings is also common. [25] Some cultures practice earlobe stretching , using piercing ornaments to stretch and enlarge the earlobes to accommodate plugs .  Negative effects of wearing earrings [ edit ]  Some research has found that the most frequent complications connected with wearing earrings are: [26]   inflammation ,  keloids ,  loss of tissue by tearing, and  mechanical division of earlobes.   There was noticeable relationship between the piercing of young girls' earlobes and following development of allergy. [27] [28] [29] In the view of Professor Ewa Czarnobilska, the manager of the research team, the primary reason for the allergies connected to earrings is the presence of nickel , which is a common component of the alloys used in jewelry production. [28] [29] The symptom seen is generally eczema , and is often misdiagnosed as a food allergy , for instance to milk. The specific mechanism in allergies caused by earrings is the contact of nickel ions with the Lymphatic system . [28] [29]  The study noted that children who simply stopped wearing earrings did not see the disappearance of the allergic symptoms. The immune system remembers the presence of the nickel ions in the person's blood and lymph , so the child can still react to: [28] [29]   metal parts of wardrobe,  dental braces ,  dental prosthesis ,  orthotics ,  meals cooked in pots with addition of nickel,  margarine (nickel is a catalyst in hydrogenation of unsaturated fats),  coins,  chocolate,  nuts,  leguminous vegetables,  wine, and  beer.   Research by allergists has found that in a sample of 428 pupils of ages 7–8 and 16–17 years old: [28] [29]   30% of the research population showed an allergy to nickel, and  the allergy occurred in girls who had started wearing earrings in early childhood.   Other symptoms of allergy to nickel are recurring infections, Asthma attacks and chronic larynxis. [28] [29]  References [ edit ]    ^  Steinberg, Avraham (2003).

Subscriptions State Science Standards Learnalong Help! Science Videos Science Log               Ear Genes     This week's experiment is a result of me looking over the various state science standards to see where I have gaps in coverage.  One big gap turned up in genetics, so I began working on a couple of genetics videos.  I kept finding more and more interesting stuff, and could not wait to share some and let you in on the fun.  This time, we will take a quick look at dominant and recessive traits, to see what that really means.  To explore that, you will need:  - your ears - the ears of other family members  Friends, Romans, and countrymen.  Lend me your ears!  I only need them for a moment, just long enough to look at your ear lobes.  No, it does not matter if they are pierced or not.  We just want to see how they connect to your head.  For some people, the ear lobes are connected directly to the side of their head, all the way to the bottom of the lobe.  We will refer to those as attached ear lobes.  I have attached ear lobes.  For other people, the ear lobe hangs down beyond the point of attachment.  We will refer to those as free ear lobes.  OK, so why do some people have attached lobes and others have free lobes?  That is where the science of genetics comes in, because ear lobe attachment is an inherited trait.  That's right.  You got your ear lobes from your parents.  Inside most of the cells in your body (not red blood cells) there is a complete set of instructions for your body and how it develops.  These instructions are chemicals that fit together into very long molecules called DNA.  In a human cell, the DNA forms 46 strands, called chromosomes, which fit together to form 23 pairs.  Each pair of chromosomes fits together in a specific way.  Arranged along the chromosomes are sequences of chemicals that form genes.  Each gene is a part of the chromosome that contains some of the instructions for making you you.  Genes control the color of your hair, how tall you will be, the color of your eyes, the color of your skin, and many, many other characteristics, called traits.  Now, it gets even better.  Some genes control more than one trait, and some traits are controlled by several genes working together.  Some genes turn other genes on or off.  Some genes don't do anything that we can detect so far.  That does not mean that they are useless, just that we don't yet know what they do.  The connection of ear lobes seems to be controlled by a single gene.  I say "seems to be" because there is still a tremendous amount that we don't know about genes.  For example, many books list tongue rolling (the ability to roll up the sides of your tongue to form a tube) as a single gene trait, but recent studies suggest that it is not.  Recent studies in the genes that control attached and unattached ear lobes are starting to suggest that there may be more than one gene involved too.  So that must mean that you can look at your ears and tell whether you got the gene for your ear lobes from your father or your mother, right?  No.  Actually, you got an ear lobe gene from each of them.  Remember that I said your chromosomes form pairs that fit together in a specific way.  So, what happens if your father has attached ear lobes and your mother has free ear lobes?  Do you wind up with ears that don't match, one attached and one free?  Not usually, although it does happen for some people (which is why scientists are considering that there may be more than one gene involved).  Some genes are dominant, and others are recessive.  Dominant genes take priority.  In the case of ear lobes, free lobes are dominant and attached lobes are recessive.  Since you got one gene from each parent, and there are two options for each gene; there are four possible combinations.  1.  If you got a dominant, free lobe gene (we will label that E) from your father and a dominant, free lobe gene from your mother (E), then you have (EE), two dominant, free lobe genes, so your ears will have free lobes.  2.  If you got a recessive, attached lobe gene from your father (we will label that with a lower case e) and a dominant, free lobe gene from your mother (E), then you have (Ee), one dominant, free lobe gene and one recessive, attached lobe gene.  The dominant gene takes priority, so your ears will have free lobes.  3.  If you got a dominant, free lobe gene from your father (E) and a recessive, attached lobe gene from your mother (e), then you have (eE), one dominant, free lobe gene and one recessive, attached lobe gene.  The dominant gene takes priority, so, again, your ears will have free lobes.  4.  If you got a recessive, attached lobe gene from your father (e) and a recessive, attached lobe gene from your mother (e), then you have (ee), two recessive, attached lobe genes, so your ears will have attached lobes.  Now, if you are reading this and realizing that you have attached lobes and both of your parents have free lobes, don't start worrying that you are adopted.  Remember that each of your parents also has a pair of genes that control ear lobe attachment, and that you only get one from each parent.  If your father has (Ee), then you have a 50/50 chance of getting either an E (dominant, free lobe) or an e (recessive, attached lobe) gene.  The same is true for your mother, so if both are (Ee), they would both have free lobes, but there is a one in four chance that you could wind up with (ee), getting the recessive attached lobe gene from both parents.  When you add in more variables, it gets more difficult to predict the outcome.  For example, hair color depends on the interaction of several genes that control different amounts of different pigments, and it is also genetically connected to skin tone and eye color.   That is why it is much easier to deal with traits that are controlled by a single gene.  Next time, we will look at some other traits and learn a bit more about the wonders of genetics.

Other Traits          Back to Other Traits           English   Español       So, everyone in my family has attached earlobes yet I came out with unattached earlobes. Why is that?        -An undergraduate from California   August 4, 2010  Sounds like you listened to your high school biology teacher about ear lobe genetics. Or did some research on your own.  Your teacher and just about everything on the web says that parents with attached earlobes can't have kids with unattached ones. And they're all wrong.  Most everyone presents ear lobe attachment as a very simple trait. (We've even fallen into this trap here .) But it's not. Even though ear lobe genetics hasn't been studied a whole lot, the little bit that has been done shows it is pretty complicated.  This means that it isn't uncommon for parents with attached earlobes to have kids with unattached lobes. Or even for parents to have kids with one attached and one unattached earlobe !  So what's going on here? Is there a vast conspiracy to make some people worry? Probably not.  There is a seed of truth to everything out there on the web. Early studies did create a model where parents with attached earlobes couldn't have kids with unattached ones. It is just that people probably didn't hear about the later studies that showed that this wasn't the case.  What I thought I'd do for the rest of the answer is go over the history of ear lobe genetics. I'll talk about why scientists thought what they did at first and then what caused them to reverse their thinking. To discuss all of this, we need to first step back and talk about dominant and recessive traits.   Genes Are Like Recipes  Most of us know that we get half our DNA from our mom and half from our dad. This DNA has long stretches in it called genes.  Each gene is a set of instructions for one small part of us. So all the genes in our DNA together have enough information to make an entire human being.  Now here's something interesting: we all have almost the exact same set of genes! Which might make you think that everyone should look identical. But we don't, of course. So what's going on?  Although we all have the same set of genes, we can have different versions of some of them. These different versions of the same gene are called alleles. And it is these different alleles that make each of us unique.  Imagine an oatmeal cookie recipe. Some people have a recipe for an oatmeal cookie with raisins and some people have one with chocolate chips. But they're both still oatmeal cookie recipes.  Same thing with genes. For example, there is a hair color gene that comes in two versions, red and not-red. Which alleles you get determine whether you'll have red hair or not. Just like which recipe you use determines if you'll have raisins or chocolate chips in your oatmeal cookie.   Gene Versions That Dominate  Remember, we get a copy of each gene from our mom and a copy from our dad. So our bodies take the two versions of every gene and follow each set of instructions.  Sometimes, the instructions go together and we can see the result of both. If you mix a recipe for oatmeal chocolate chip together with one for oatmeal raisin, you'll get oatmeal chocolate chip raisin cookies.  Sometimes, though, one allele of a gene dominates the other. This is just like when we mix a chocolate cupcake recipe together with a vanilla one and get a chocolate tasting cupcake. Even though both recipes were made, chocolate wins out.  The hidden gene version is called the recessive allele. So if you get a dominant allele of a gene from one parent and a recessive allele from the other, you'll only show the dominant trait. Even though the recessive one is still in there.  This is how earlobes were thought to work. Often the kids of one parent with attached and one parent with unattached earlobes will all have unattached earlobes. Because unattached was thought to be dominant.  But unlike cupcakes, the dominant version doesn't seem to always win. Sometimes you'll end up with a recessive trait even if one of your parents has a dominant one. Sometimes a chocolate and a vanilla make a vanilla.  To understand why this is, we need to remember that we have two copies of each of our genes. Sometimes someone with a dominant trait has a hidden recessive allele. If they pass that on (and the other parent does too), then the child will have the recessive trait.  So for earlobes, imagine a parent with an attached and an unattached allele. This parent will have unattached earlobes but could pass the attached allele to their child. That child might end up with attached earlobes. Click here to read more about how this works.  Of course, given all of this, two parents with a recessive trait can't have a child with a dominant one. So two parents with attached earlobes should not be able to have a child with unattached ones. Except that sometimes they do. Which means that earlobes are more complicated than is usually advertised.   Ear Lobe Studies  In one of the first earlobe studies , scientists concluded that unattached earlobes were dominant over attached ones. They based this on two families.  Everyone in the first family had attached earlobes and everyone in the second had unattached ones. When a man from the first family married a woman from the second, all six kids had unattached earlobes.  But in lots of follow up studies , this result didn't hold up anymore. Sometimes parents with attached earlobes had kids with unattached earlobes. So the scientists concluded that earlobe inheritance must be more complicated than they initially thought. And that it might even involve more than one gene.  Why the different results? There are at least a couple of reasons.  The first explanation is actually something you may already know -- things often happen by chance. If you flip a coin three times, the chances of them all being heads is high enough that you might bet on it. However, few people would bet on having 100 coin flips all be heads. This is because even though the chances of any one coin flip being heads is 50-50, the chances of 100 of them doing so are much less than this.  What if something similar is going on for earlobes? Imagine that earlobes often followed a simple dominant/recessive pattern. But not always. Maybe one in every 100 people would have unattached earlobes when his or her parents both have attached ones.  If we look at only a dozen people, we are likely to miss this. We might conclude that earlobe inheritance is simple and predictable based on genetic rules of dominance. And we'd be wrong.  The second issue with the initial studies is that they looked at only two families and the children from the marriage. People that live in the same regions of the world often share many of the same alleles. And members of the same family share even more.  So it could very well be that in the family they studied unattached earlobes were dominant because everyone shared the same set of alleles. But a more diverse set of people may follow a different pattern because they have different alleles.  It could also be that there are different ways to end up with attached and unattached earlobes. Sometimes they work in a simple dominant/recessive way and sometimes they don't. The scientists happened to study a couple of families where the simple explanation was right.   Exceptions to the Rules  So there you have it: it isn't actually surprising or uncommon for parents from families with attached earlobes to have a child with unattached earlobes. What is more surprising is that the old data has hung around for so long and that everyone has ignored the more recent data.  We simply do not yet understand how earlobe attachment is passed down. And we probably won't for a long time. This is not a problem keeping scientists up at night!  A word of caution though. Even if earlobe attachment were a simple dominant/recessive trait, there still would be rare exceptions. Nothing in genetics is 100%; things can and do change. Click here for some of the ways these exceptions can work.     Diane Wu      More Information    Why some alleles are dominant and others recessive.

Some genes are like cookie recipes. If you mix them together, you get a combination of the two.  You can't tell that heads and tails are equally likely from just a few flips.

Privacy Policy  Disclaimer  Our Mission                                Fundamentals of Inheritance  In the 1860s, Gregor Mendel studied seven clearly defined traits in 
        pea plants, each of which occurred in one of two characteristic forms. 
        After eight years of rather painstaking study on how traits were passed 
        from one generation to another, Mendel presented his findings to an audience 
        unable to understand it or its significance.  Mendel lived in the 1800s. His contemporaries thought parent's "hereditary 
        fluids" mixed together in some unknown manner during the formation of 
        progeny and "blended" to produce offspring with a mixture of their parent's 
        characteristics.  It was not until 1900, years after his death, that three other scientists, 
        working independently, rediscovered his work and recognized its significance.  The study of the pattern of inheritance that follows the laws formulated 
        by Mendel is often referred to as Mendelian Genetics. We will take a look 
        at Mendel's laws in a moment, but first lets look at some terminology.  You have probably used the term, gene . A gene is a 
        piece of DNA consisting of many nucleotides that codes for some gene product. 
        When passed on to progeny, genes represent hereditary information. Mendel 
        thought of them as "particles" or beads on chromosomes. His concept is 
        not so inaccurate because genes are located on specific portions of a 
        chromosome; however, they are not like beads on a string.  Remember that sexually reproducing organisms are diploid. Diploid cells 
        have two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from each parent. Therefore, 
        they have two chromosomes of each kind and two genes for each characteristic . 
        When gametes are produced by meiosis, reduction division occurs to reduce 
        the chromosome number to haploid and to produce cells (eggs, sperm) that 
        have one chromosome of each of the pairs that was in the diploid cell 
        that underwent meiosis.  Sexual reproduction implies the fertilization of a haploid egg cell 
        by a haploid sperm cell. Therefore, the resulting zygote has inherited 
        one gene of each type from both parents. The following diagram explains these relationships.  Once again, each diploid organism has two genes for each characteristic. 
        These two genes for the same trait or characteristic are referred to as alleles . The following diagram explains this idea 
        of alleles. There may be several alternative forms of each gene in a population.  Alleles are always located on a pair of chromosomes where one allele 
        is opposite the other at some same specific location or locus .  The genome is a set of all the genes necessary to specify 
        an organism's characteristics. The genotype of an organism 
        is a listing of the genes present in that organism. Since it consists 
        of the cell's DNA code, you cannot really see a genotype. It is probably 
        not possible to know the complete genotype of most organisms although 
        we are working on it for humans. It is certainly possible, however, to 
        know the genes present that determine a particular characteristic.  Look around at several of your classmate's earlobes. Some will have 
        the lobe attached to their head; others will have the lobe free. This 
        trait is inherited. Let's call the allele for free earlobes a capital 
        E. And, let's call the allele for attached earlobes a lowercase e.  Now consider the genotypic combinations of the two alleles possible 
        for an individual:   Could be EE; free earlobes  Could be Ee; also free earlobes  Could be ee; attached earlobes   The expression of one's genotype, such as EE, Ee or ee, is called one's phenotype .  For various reasons, certain genes may not express themselves. Sometimes, 
        the physical environment determines whether or not certain genes function. 
        An human example for this sort of thing would be freckles. While the gene 
        for freckles may be present, it will not be expressed unless the individual 
        is exposed to sunlight.  The expression of some genes is directly influenced by the presence 
        of other alleles in the organism. For any particular pair of alleles in 
        an individual, the two alleles from the two parents are either identical 
        or not identical.  The individual is homozygous for the trait when it 
        has two identical alleles. In the example above about earlobes, both the 
        EE and ee individuals are homozygous for the trait. The person with the 
        Ee genotype is heterozygous for the trait, in this case, 
        free earlobes. An individual is heterozygous for a trait when it has two 
        different allelic forms of a particular gene. The heterozygous individual 
        received one form of the gene from one parent and a different allele from 
        the other parent.  Often one gene expresses itself and the other does not. A dominant 
        allele expresses itself and masks the effect of the other trait. 
        The allele for free earlobes is dominant.  A recessive allele is one that, when present with another 
        allele, does not express itself; it is masked by the effect of the other 
        allele. If you have attached earlobes, you have two alleles for the trait.  Recessive genes are not less likely to be inherited. They must, however, 
        be present in a homozygous condition to be expressed.  Mendelian genetics involves the study of the transfer of genes from 
        one generation to another and the ways in which the genes received from 
        the parents influence the traits of offspring.  Let's return now to Mendel. Mendel concluded which of the traits that 
        he studied were dominant and which were recessive. What made his work 
        unique was that he studied only one trait at a time. What he found is 
        shown in the following table.    Characteristic  Alleles  Dominant  Recessive    Plant height  Tall and dwarf  Tall  Dwarf    Pod shape  Full and constricted  Full  Constricted    Pod color  Green and yellow  Green  Yellow    Seed surface  Round and wrinkled  Round  Wrinkled    Seed color  Yellow and green  Yellow  Green    Flower color  Purple and white  Purple  White     Previous investigators had tried to follow numerous traits at the same 
        time and became hopelessly muddled because a large set of characteristics 
        is cumbersome to work with. Mendel also used traits with clear-cut alternatives 
        such as purple or white flower color. He was also lucky to have chosen 
        pea plants because they self-pollinate. When self-pollination occurs, 
        it is possible to develop a population of plants that is homozygous for 
        a number of characteristics. Such a population is known as a pure 
        line .  Mendel took a pure line of pea plants having purple flowers, removed 
        the male parts (anthers) and discarded them so that they could not self-pollinate. 
        He then took anthers from a homozygous white flower pea plant and pollinated 
        the antherless purple flowers.  When the pollinated flowers produced seeds, Mendel collected them and 
        planted them. They eventually produced flowers and all of the flowers were purple.  This result collided with the prevailing notion of the day that would 
        have predicted the resulting flower color to have be a "blend" of white 
        and purple--a lighter purple. Another favored notion of the day was that 
        the resulting flowers should have been a mixture of white and purple flowers. 
        But all the flowers were purple.  Mendel repeated his experiments with homozygous strains for the other 
        traits in the table above. The results were the same: the offspring showed 
        the characteristic of one parent and not the other.  Next, Mendel crossed the offspring of the purple-white flower cross 
        (all of which had purple flowers) with each other to see what he would 
        get in a third generation of plants. Had the characteristic of the white 
        flowered parent been lost?  When the seeds produced by this cross were planted and the plants allowed 
        to flower, Mendel noted that three-fourths of them produced 
        purple flowers; one-fourth produced white flowers.  After Mendel analyzed his data, he came up with several findings which 
        have since become known as "laws."   Mendel's law of dominance  When an organism has two different allels for a trait, the allele 
          that is expressed, overshadowing the expression of the other allele,is 
          said to be dominant . The gene whose expression is overshadowed 
          is said to be recessive.  Mendel's law of segregation  When gametes are formed by a diploid organism, the alleles that control 
          a trait separate from one another into different gametes, retaining 
          their individuality.  Mendel's law of independent assortment  Members of one gene pair separate from each other independently of 
          the members of other pairs.   Keep in mind that biologists knew nothing of chromosomes or DNA or the 
        processes of mitosis and meiosis during Mendel's time. Mendel just assumed 
        that each gene was separate from other genes. It was indeed fortunate 
        for him that the characteristics he chose to study in pea plants are found 
        on separate chromosomes.  In order to study hereditary problems, you need to have a simple understanding 
        of probability. Probability is the chance that an event 
        will happen, and is often expressed as a percent or a fraction. It is 
        not the same as a possibility .  When you flip a coin, the probability of your getting a "heads" is 0.5 
        or 50% because there are only two sides to the coin. Probability can be 
        expressed as a fraction as follows:      So, the probability of cutting a deck of playing cards and getting the 
        ace of spades is 1/52.   What about just an ace, no matter the suit?   ? 1/100. 4/52 or 1/13. 1/200.    You can also determine the probability of two independent events that 
        occur together. This probability is the product of their individual probabilities. 
        For instance, if you throw a pair of dice, it is possible that both will 
        be fours. What is the probability? The probability of one die being a 
        four is 1/6. Therefore, the probability of throwing two fours is:      The first kind of heredity problem I will work out for you is the easiest 
        type; a single-factor cross. I will use the earlobes alleles as an example. 
        In humans, remember, the allele for free earlobes is dominant and the 
        allele for attached earlobes is recessive. If both parents are heterozygous 
        (have one allele for free earlobes and one allele for attached earlobes), 
        what is the probability that they can have a child with free earlobes? 
        with attached earlobes?  Here is how to solve this query.    Step 1: Assign a symbol for each allele. 
            Usually a capital letter is used for dominant allele and lower case 
            letter for recessive allele.        E = free earlobes    e = attached earlobes        Genotype    Phenotype    EE    free earlobes    Ee    free earlobes    ee    attached earlobes        Step 2: Determine the genotype of each 
            parent and indicate a mating, Since both parents are heterozygous, 
            the male genotype is Ee. The female genotype is also Ee. The X between 
            them indicates a mating.    Ee X Ee        Step 3: Determine all the possible kinds 
            of gametes each parent can produce. Remember that gametes are haploid; 
            therefore they can only have one allele instead of the two present 
            in the diploid parent cell.    Since the male has both the free earlobe allele and the attached-earlobe 
        allele, half of his gametes will contain the free-earlobe allele and the 
        other half will contain the attached-earlobe allele. The same is true 
        for the female since she has the same genotype.  Now put this information into a Punnett square, a box that allows you 
        to determine genotypes and phenotypes of offspring from a particular cross.     Looking at the allelic combinations, determine the phenotype of these possible

The probability of one independent event does not affect the probability of another independent event, and the probability of two independent events occurring is the product of their probabilities.  Because both parents have unattached earlobes and their child has attached earlobes, we know that both parents must be heterozygous (Aa) for this trait; this wouldn't be possible any other way.  To find the probability that the couple's next child has attached earlobes, we need the probability of two (a) alleles coming together to form an (aa) zygote.  The probability of dad producing an (a) gamete is 1/2 because he can make either (A) or (a) gametes in equal numbers.  The probability of mom producing an (a) gamete is also 1/2 for the same reason.  Mom and dad producing gametes are independent events because whatever gametes one produces has absolutely no effect on the types of gametes the other produces.  Thus, to get the probability of two (a) gametes coming together to form an (aa) child, we multiply 1/2 by 1/2 to get 1/4.  The child has a 1/4 chance of having attached earlobes.  (You also could obtain this by doing a Punnett square and realizing that 1 out of 4 possible children has this genotype/phenotype.)  No matter what child we are talking about, the probability of having a child with attached earlobes is always 1/4 because the children are independent of each other.  The probability of the next child being a girl with attached earlobes is the product of two independent events:  being a girl, and having attached earlobes.  The probability of a child being a girl is 1/2, as boys and girls are equally likely to form.  (Like having attached earlobes, this can be determined by thinking about gametes from each parent, or by using a Punnett square.)  The probability of having attached earlobes is 1/4, as we already figured out.  Thus, the probability of being a girl AND having attached earlobes is 1/2 x 1/4 = 1/8.  Don't let the first child throw you off.  Unless they are handpicking which gametes come together to form their sibling, they have no bearing on the genotype and phenotype probabilities of the next offspring.  If the question asked about the probability of the next TWO children having attached earlobes, then you would have to multiply 1/4 by 1/4 to get 1/16, because the next two children both having attached earlobes are two independent events, but once again, the first child plays no role.

If two parents with unattached earlobes have a child with attached earlobes (aa), then both parents must have been heterozygotes (Aa).  Hence, each parent donated the recessive allele for attached earlobes to their offspring.  Based on the crossing between the two heterozygotes, you can conclude there was a 25% chance(1/4) of producing an offspring with attached earlobes.  To determine the probability that the next child will have attached earlobes, you merely multiply 1/4 by 1/4, which will give you 1/16.  Hence, the probability that the next child will have attached earlobes is 1/16.  For the second question, there is always a 50% chance that the offspring will be female, and a 50% chance that the offspring will be male.  This can be represented by the following cross:  (XX) x (XY): 50% (1/2) chance of producing an offspring that is female (XX) 50% chance of producing an offspring that is male (XY).

Genetics problems and Answers ! - Sunday, April 9th. Have fun studying .  1. A woman is heterozygous for Tay-Sachs (a recessive disorder).
What are the chances of her giving birth to a child with Tay-Sachs if the
father is normal (homozygous dominant?) What are the chances of giving birth
to a carrier?   Woman: Tt Man: TT No chance of child with disease; 50% chance of carrier   2. Both you and your sister have attached earlobes, yet
your parents have unattached ones. Unattached earlobes are dominant over
attached. Give the genotypes of you, your sister, and your parents.   Genotypes of you and sis ­ uu Genotypes of parents ­ Uu   3. Parents who are carriers for sickle-cell disease produce
a child who has sickle-cell disease. What are the chances that their next
child will have sickle-cell disease?   25% (1/4) chance of ss = sickle cell disease   4. A woman with PKU (kk) marries a man who is genotypically
normal (KK). Which best describes the chances that their child will: be
genotypically normal (KK), be a carrier for PKU (Kk), or have the disease
PKU (kk) ?   25% genotypically normal KK, 50% carrier
  Kk, 25% PKU kk   5. If both your parents have a continuous hairline (cc),
what best describes your possibilities for hairlines?   cc only possiblilty = continuous hairline   6. Both Dick and Jane have freckles (dominant) and attached
earlobes (recessive). Six of their children do not have freckles. What are
the chances that their next child will have freckles and attached earlobes?   Since 6 of their children do not have
  freckles (ff), the parents are heteros (Ff).  Since earlobes are recessive (ee), their
  kids will always have attached earlobes ­ so you can ignore
  this part of the problem (ie multiply by 1)  Chance of freckles = 3/4 x chance of
  attached earlobes = 1 = 3/4 chance   7. In a dihybrid cross of a heterozygous pea plant with
purple flowers and round seeds (PpRr), what is the probability that   Do a Punnitt square for each trait.  Purple = 3/4, white = 1/4; PP = 1/4,
  Pp = 1/2, pp = 1/4  Round seeds = 3/4, wrinkled = 1/4; RR
  = 1/4, Rr = 1/2, rr = 1/4  Then multiply fractions (every time you
  see the words "white flower" insert a 1/4, round seeds , insert
  a3/4 etc) . Note the 9:3:3:1 phenotype on a-d.    a) a white-flowered pea plant with round seeds will be
  produced? 1/4 x 3/4 = 3/16 b) a purple-flowered pea plant with round seeds will be produced? 3/4 x 3/4 = 9/16 c) a white-flowered pea plant with wrinkled seeds will be produced? 1/4 x 1/4 = 1/16 d) a purple-flowered pea plant with wrinkled seeds will be produced? 3/4 x 1/4 = 3/16 e) the genotype PpRr will result? 1/2
  x 1/2 = 1/4 f) the genotype ppRr will result? 1/4
  x 1/2 = 1/8 (does it make sense that there would be fewer of these? Think
  of the phenptype.) g) the genotype PpRR will result? 1/2
  x 1/4 = 1/8 h) the genotype ppRr will result? Oops
  ­ same thing as e!     8. In a trihybrid cross of a tall, purple-flowered pea
plant with round seeds (TtPpRr) with a tall, white-flowered pea plant with
wrinkled seeds (Ttpprr), what is the probability:   Do a Punnitt square for each trait. Different
  ratios this time because parents are not both heteros.  Tall = 3/4 tall, 1/4 short (dwarf)  Purple = 1/2, white = 1/2;  Round = 1/2, wrinkled = 1/2  Then multiply fractions (every time you
  see the words "white flower" insert a 1/2, tall , insert a 3/4
  etc) .   a) that a tall, white-flowered plant with wrinkled seeds
will be produced? 3/4 x 1/2 x 1/2 =
3/16 b) that a short, purple-flowered plant with round seeds will be produced? 1/4 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/16 c) that a short, white-flowered plant with wrinkled seeds will be produced? 1/4 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/16 d) that a tall, purple-flowered plant with round seeds will be produced? 3/4 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 3/16 e) that a tall, white-flowered plant with round seeds will be produced? 3/4 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 3/16    9. A woman is heterozygous for polydactyly and has 6 fingers
on each hand (polydactyly is a dominant trait). What are the chances of
her giving birth to a child with polydactyly if the father is normal (homozygous
recessive)?   Mom is Pp, dad is pp = 50% chance of polydactyly
  (Pp)   10. Both a husband and wife have normal vision but their
son is color blind. What are the likely genotypes of the boy's parents?
Of the boy?   Dad= XAY (normal) Mom = XAXa (recessive = colorblind allele; mom has normal vision due to
  XA) Boy = XaY (recessive from mom = colorblind son)   11. In Labrador retriever dogs, the gene B (dominant) produces
black coat color (black Labs), with the homozygous recessive condition (bb)
producing brown Labs. The dominant epistatic gene E controls the presence
of coat color. The homozygous recessive ee condition prevents the deposition
of coat color, resulting in a golden Lab. Give the probability of the following
crosses. In addition, list the gentoype(s) that would produce those phenotypes:  Again, do Punnitt squares for each trait   Cross 1:  Black Lab x Golden Lab  EeBb x eeBb  Cross 1 = Ee x ee = 1/2 coat color deposited,
  1/2 coat color not deposited (golden)  = Bb x Bb = 3/4 black (BB or Bb), 1/4
  brown (bb)  Probability of: Genotype(s):  Golden Lab: eeBB,
  eeBb, eebb  1/2 x 3/4 = 3/8 PLUS 1/2 x 1/4 = 1/8  total = 4/8 (or 1/2; 50%)  Black Lab: EeBB
  or EeBb  1/2 x 3/4 = 3/8  Brown Lab: Eebb  1/2 x 1/4 = 1/8  This litter will give 50% goldens (notice
  that there are 3 e alleles from parents) and almost as many blacks, an
  occasional chocolate   Cross 2:  Brown Lab x Golden Lab  Eebb eebb  Cross 2 = Ee x ee = 1/2 coat color deposited,
  1/2 coat color not deposited (golden)  = bb x bb = 4/4 brown (or 1) (bb)  Probability of: Genotype(s):  Golden Lab: eebb  1/2 x 1 = 1/2 (or 50%)  Black Lab: EeBB

Requires an understanding of How genes are organized on chromosomes How chromosomes are passed on during meiosis Gene A piece of DNA that has the necessary information to code for a protein and regulate its expression Found on a chromosome Related to a characteristic of an organism These characteristics result from the work of a particular protein. Eye color Flower color Pea shape What is an allele? One particular gene may exist in multiple forms. -A specific version of a gene Example: Earlobe-shaped gene There are two different alleles for this gene. Attached earlobe Free earlobe Different alleles code for different forms of the same protein. The different forms of the protein function differently. Result in different characteristics genome. The sum total of an organism's genes is called its diploid In sexually reproducing organisms, the genome is This means that they have two copies of every gene. The copies may not be identical, so one individual could have two different alleles. haploid Single-celled organisms and sex-cells are They only have one copy of each gene. They only have one allele. Sex cells -are sperm and egg. Sperm and egg only receive one set of that individual's genes. When haploid egg joins with haploid sperm (fertilization), a diploid zygote results. The zygote receives half of its genome from the sperm and half of its genome from the egg. Has a unique set of genes, different from the parents Meiosis is the process by which egg and sperm are made. Homologous chromosomes can carry different alleles. When the homologous chromosomes separate during meiosis, the alleles are delivered to different sex cells. Three questions allow us to predict how a trait will be inherited: What alleles do the parents have for that trait? What alleles will be present in the gametes that the parents produce? What is the likelihood that gametes with specific combinations of alleles will be fertilized? Diploid organisms have two copies of every gene. This means that one individual can have two different versions of a gene. The term allele is used to identify different versions of a gene. Genotype describes the combination of alleles present in the organism's cells. Phenotype describes the organism's appearance. This is a result of its genotype. Example: earlobe shape Phenotypes: free or attached Genotypes: EE (two alleles for free earlobes) Earlobes will be free ee (two alleles for attached earlobes) Earlobes will be attached Ee (one allele for free and one allele for attached) Earlobes will be free The free earlobe allele is dominant. It out-performs the attached earlobe allele. The attached earlobe allele is recessive. Masked by the dominant allele when present together Only expressed when two copies are present Homozygous Two copies of the same allele EE is homozygous dominant. ee is homozygous recessive. Heterozygous Two different alleles Ee individual with the dominant phenotype (Predicting Genotype from Phenotype) Could be homozygous dominant Could be heterozygous A person with free earlobes could be EE or Ee individual with the recessive phenotype (Predicting Genotype from Phenotype) Is always homozygous recessive A person with attached earlobes is ee. Law of Segregation (Predicting Gametes from Meiosis) Alleles will separate during meiosis. Each gamete will receive one allele. -An EE individual will make gametes that have E. -An ee individual will make gametes that have e. -An Ee individual will make gametes that have either E or e. Fertilization (Predicting Offspring from Fertilization) is the process of two haploid sex cells joining to form a diploid zygote. The genotype of the offspring will be determined by the alleles carried by the gametes. genetic cross is a planned mating between two organisms. Punnett square The outcome of a given cross is predicted monohybrid crosses Single-factor crosses track the inheritance of one trait. dihybrid crosses Double-factor crosses track the inheritance of two traits. Probability is the mathematical chance that an event will happen. Expressed as a percent, or a fraction Probability = the # of events that can produce a given outcome/the total # of possible outcomes. The probability of two or more events occurring simultaneously is the product of their individual probabilities. Probability vs. Possibility Possibility states that an event can happen; probability states how likely the event is to happen. Gregor Mendel The First Geneticist: Mendel was a monk who was the first to describe the basic patterns of inheritance. Studied inheritance in garden pea plants Studied several different phenotypes Identified the concepts of dominance and recessiveness Didn't know about genes or chromosomes Identified patterns by mathematical analysis of the data Mendel's Experiment Parental (P) generation A pure-breeding purple-flowered plant mated with a pure-breeding white-flowered plant. CC x cc First filial generation (F1) All offspring had purple flowers (Cc). They were allowed to self-pollinate. Cc x Cc Second filial generation (F2) ¾ of the offspring were purple ¼ of the offspring were white 3:1 ratio, purple: white Mendel saw this pattern with any of the traits he studied. Mendel's conclusions Organisms have two pieces of genetic information for each trait. We know these as alleles. The Law of Dominance Some alleles mask other alleles. Gametes fertilize randomly. The Law of Segregation Alleles separate into gametes during meiosis. Solving genetics problems: single-factor crosses The pod color of some pea plants is inherited so that green pods are dominant to yellow pods. A pea plant that is heterozygous for green pods is crossed to a pea plant that produces yellow pods. What proportion of the offspring will have green pods? Steps of solving Step I: Make a Gene Key Step 2: Identify Information in the Problem EX: A green plant is crossed with a yellow plant. The green pod plant is heterozygous. Gg The yellow pod plant is homozygous. gg The cross is Gg x gg. Step 3: Determine Possible Gametes from Each Parent EX: Heterozygous green pod parent (Gg) Could make gametes with G or g Homozygous yellow pod parent (gg) Could make gametes with g Step 4: Create a Punnett Square ex: Put the gametes from one parent on one side. Put the gametes from the other parent on the other side. Simulate random fertilization by crossing the possible gametes. This will determine offspring phenotypes. Step 5: Determine Offspring Phenotypes and Calculate Probability EX: Use the gene key to determine the phenotype of the offspring you predicted. Revisit the question to calculate the answer to the question. What proportion of offspring will produce green pods? The answer is 50%. Cross #2: PKU The normal condition is to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine. It is dominant over the condition for PKU. If both parents are heterozygous for PKU, what is the probability that they will have A child that is normal? A child with PKU? Double-factor crosses Dihybrid crosses track the inheritance of two traits. Mendel used dihybrid crosses to identify the law of independent assortment. States that alleles of one character separate independently of alleles of another character Only true when the genes for the two characters are on different chromosomes Solving double-factor crosses When solving a double-factor cross, you must obey the law of segregation and the law of independent assortment. Each gamete must receive only one copy of each gene. All combinations of alleles for A and B must be considered. Consider an individual whose genotype is AaBb. Gametes could receive AB, Ab, aB, or ab. A sample double-factor cross In humans the allele for free earlobes is dominant over the allele for attached earlobes. The allele for dark hair dominates the allele for light hair. If both parents are heterozygous for earlobe shape and hair color, what types of offspring can they produce, and what is the probability for each type? Modified mendelian patterns Some alleles have consistent dominant/recessive patterns like Mendel observed. However, many traits are not inherited following these patterns. Several other types of inheritance patterns exist. Codominance Some alleles are codominant. Both phenotypes are expressed together in a heterozygote. This will result in three phenotypes. Horse color DR DR is chestnut color DR DW is white color DW DW is palomino-colored (chestnut with white mane and tail) Incomplete Dominance Occurs when the phenotype of the heterozygote is intermediate between the two homozygotes Appears as if the heterozygotes are blends of the homozygotes Snapdragons FwFw=white flower FrFr=red flower FwFw=pink flower Multiple alleles Some traits have more than two possible alleles for a single trait. Each person can only have two alleles for a given trait because diploid organisms have only 2 copies of each gene. Example: ABO blood types 3 alleles for blood type antigens on red blood cells IA = blood type A antigens IB = blood type B antigens i = blood type O, neither type A or type B antigens Six possible genotypes; each individual can only have two alleles IAIA, IAi = Type A blood IBIB, IBi = Type B blood IBIA = Type AB blood Ii = Type O blood Polygenic Inheritance Some characteristics are determined by the interaction of several genes. A number of different pairs of alleles combine their efforts to determine a characteristic. Polygenic inheritance is common with characteristics that show great variety within the population. Height, eye color, intelligence, etc. Pleiotropy Some genes affect a variety of phenotypes. These genes are called pleiotropic. The disease PKU results from a mutation in one gene. The one defective protein leads to several phenotypes. Mental retardation, abnormal growth, pale skin pigmentation Linkage Genes that are on the same chromosome are linked. Linked genes are inherited together more often than would be predicted by probability. linkage group All of the genes on a given chromosome represent All of the genes in a linkage group will be inherited together. Crossing-over can separate linked genes and mix allele combinations. The closer genes are to one another on a chromosome, the less likely they will be separated by crossing-over, and the more likely they will be inherited together. Autosomal linkage Autosomes are the chromosomes that are not involved in sex determination. Of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, #1-22 are autosomes. Genes on the same autosomal chromosome are autosomally linked. #23 are sex chromosomes. Called X and Y Sex Determination he sex chromosomes, X and Y, are a homologous pair. This pair is unique because X and Y carry different sets of genes. The Y chromosome has genes that determine maleness. The X chromosome has a variety of genes on it, many of which are not involved in gender determination. Sex linkage Genes on the X or Y chromosomes are called sex-linked. Genes on the X chromosome are called X-linked. Males only have one X chromosome, so one copy of a recessive allele will result in the recessive phenotype in men. Women have two copies of X, so they can be heterozygous or carriers of a recessive trait without showing the phenotype. Hemophilia, color-blindness, muscular dystrophy X-Linked Inheritance Patterns In humans, the allele for normal color vision is dominant and the allele for color deficiency is recessive. Both alleles are X-linked. People who cannot detect the difference between certain colors such as green and red are described as having color-deficient vision. A male who has normal color vision mates with a female who is heterozygous for normal color vision. What type of children can they have in terms of these traits?

The seeds of all of the offspring are yellow. Why? The yellow allele is dominant to the green allele A purebred plant that produces yellow seeds is crossed with a purebred plant that produces green seeds. The F1 plants have yellow seeds. What is the expected phenotypic ratio of seed color of the offspring of an F1 x F1 cross? 3:1 According to Mendel's law of segregation gametes have one allele copy for each gene Attached earlobes are recessive to free earlobes. What genotypic ratio is expected when an individual with attached earlobes mates with an individual heterozygous for free earlobes? 1:1 Mendel crossed purebred purple-flowered plants with purebred white-flowered plants, and all of the resulting offspring produced purple flowers. The offspring are all ________, and the allele for purple flowers is ________. heterozygotes...dominant Attached earlobes are recessive to free earlobes. What is the probability of having a child with attached earlobes when an individual with attached earlobes mates with an individual heterozygous for free earlobes? 50% In humans, the presence or absence of dimples is a trait controlled by a single gene. What is the genotype of an individual who is heterozygous for dimples? Dd An individual who is homozygous ________. carries two copies of the same allele for a gene Which of these crosses will produce only heterozygous offspring? AA x aa What name is given to the specific location of a gene on a chromosome? locus Round seeds (R) are dominant to wrinkled seeds (r), and yellow seeds (Y) are dominant to green seeds (y). What is the expected phenotypic ratio of a cross between an RrYy and an rryy individual? 1:1:1:1 An individual with the genotype AaBb produces four different gametes in equal proportions. This is a demonstration of ________. Mendel's law of independent assortment To determine the phenotype of an individual who expresses a dominant trait, you would cross that individual with an individual who ________. is homozygous recessive for that trait A couple has two female children. What is the probability that their next child will be male? 50% In humans, free earlobes (E) are dominant to attached earlobes (e) and the presence of freckles (F) is dominant to the absence of freckles (f). If an individual heterozygous for both of these traits were to mate with an individual with attached earlobes and no freckles, what is the probability of having a child with attached earlobes and freckles? 25% What data or test would you seek to determine whether or not a trait is sex linked? pedigree The ________ is most commonly found in nature wild-type trait An individual heterozygous for cystic fibrosis ________. is a carrier Achondroplasia is a form of dwarfism caused by a dominant allele. The homozygous dominant genotype causes death, so individuals who have this condition are all heterozygotes. If a person with achondroplasia mates with a person who does not have achondroplasia, what percentage of their children would be expected to have achondroplasia? 50% Which of the following techniques is used to collect fetal cells during pregnancy for genetic testing? amniocentesis What is the key to the recognition of incomplete dominance? The phenotype of the heterozygote falls between the phenotypes of the homozygotes. An individual with (naturally) curly hair and an individual with (naturally) straight hair mate; all of their offspring have (naturally) wavy hair. What is the relationship between the alleles for hair texture? incomplete dominance An individual with (naturally) curly hair and an individual with (naturally) straight hair mate; all of their offspring have (naturally) wavy hair. If an individual with wavy hair mates with an individual with straight hair, what is the probability that their child will have curly hair? 0% What is the key to the recognition of codominance?

Lab Notes Home Page  Genetics   I). Mendel   A). Gregor Mendel:  father of genetics.  B). inheritance was believed to be::    1). a blending  2). inheritance of acquired characteristics .    C). Mendel established:    Law of Dominance and
      Recessive    When certain genes, come in 2 forms (alleles), one trait
    will be expressed over the other.           Law of Segregation    A recessive allele that is masked for generations
    can  segregate from the dominate factor and be expressed in its original state.  The Law of Independent Assortment     Involves the alleles of multiple genes   Alleles of one gene separate and sort themselves
    independent of alleles of another gene.            D). Definitions     Gene:     Allele:     Genotype :     Phenotype:   II). Probability vs. Possibility vs.
Certainty  A). Probability is the chance     # of events that can produce a given
      outcome  _____________________________________  Total number of possible outcomes       B) . Possibility means it can   C). Certainty means it will happen.    III). Punnett Square  A). A Punnett Square: determine the probability of obtaining each of the genotypes  B). Creating a Punnett Square:   Step 1). Assign a letter each gene   b). dominant  allele:  c). recessive allele    ie. E,e ear lobe attachment   E = free earlobes  e= attached earlobes      Step 2). Determine each parent’s
    genotype   Look at the parents phenotype and if necessary
    their parents phenotype.    EE or Ee . Step 3) .possible gametes that the parents  can
    produce are determined  Each gamete is haploid  the offspring is diploid    Each gamete can contain only one allele for each gene but it
    carries an allele for a variety of genes .     The gamete would carry all of the possible
            combinations:     Step 4). Set up the Punnett
    square        E   e    E          e        Step 5: Determine all of the
    possible allele combinations          E   e    E  EE  Ee    e  Ee  ee  Step 6: Determine the phenotype of each combination . Step 7: Determine the probability of an offspring
    having a given trait .         E   e    E  EE  Ee    e  Ee  ee     3 out of 4 possibilities have free earlobes     3:4 or 3/4 or 75%    1 out of 4 possibilities have attached
                earlobes    1:4 or 1/4 or 25%  IV). Single Trait Cross    Monohybrid Cross   P= Parents   f 1= first generation offspring  f 2 = second generation
