Premio M&E           Update on the Zika Virus in Costa Rica – March 24th, 2017 You are here: Home Blog Update on the Zika Virus…                      This post is proposed to help travelers to learn about the condition of the Zika Virus in Costa Rica, learn about the risks and to give notice on the protections to evade Zika.   The interest surrounding Zika has been focused on the suspected link connecting the virus and a critical birth defect known as microcephaly .  Understanding How Zika Virus Can Affect Your Trip  Zika virus  A key way for travelers to manage their risk concerning Zika is in understanding that the virus is primarily transmitted to people via mosquito bites, which is why the following information is important:  The CDC offers a wealth of information on Zika as well as prevention at this link .  The CDC also reports instances of Zika being transmitted sexually and provides information on sexual transmission and prevention at this link .  Favorably, CDC also reports, “Zika virus usually remains in the blood of an infected person for only a few days to a week. The virus will not cause infections in an infant that is conceived after the virus is cleared from the blood. There is currently no evidence that Zika virus infection poses a risk of birth defects in future pregnancies. ”                 Update on the number of cases per region  Central Pacific 141cases Guanacaste Province 35cases Central Valley 0cases Caribbean Coast 209cases    Data from Social Security Ministry of Costa Rica       For most travelers, the CDC reports that “ About 1 in 5 people infected with Zika will get sick . For people who get sick, the illness is usually mild. For this reason, many people might not realize they have been infected…The most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes). The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. Severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon… ”  For pregnant women the situation is different, “ Until more is known, CDC recommends special precautions for pregnant women and women trying to become pregnant,” which one can read at this link .          What is Costa Rica doing about Zika?     Costa Rica has developed a strong campaign to eliminate the possible mosquito sources, and up until March 15th, there were 697,871 possible mosquito breeding areas. Out of these: 230,879 were completely eliminated, and 466,871 were treated.             (Treated mosquito breeding areas means, for instance, aquatic plants, ponds, fountains, and similar breeding spots that cannot be eliminated totally but are cleaned)  Visiting a total of 145,873 houses, the spraying of mosquitoes is a continuous government and community efforts that complement a sound media campaign to get rid of any possible breeding areas.  If you see the October update, numbers were much higher. Besides the government control, the sunny season dries up the majority of the breeding areas)  Education Programs  On the other hand, in Costa Rica, everything is done through the schools. And this is not the exception. The Zika Virus situation is discussed and supported by the Costa Rican elementary schools and children usually end up teaching their parents about getting rid of the mosquitos hatcheries.

Who is the population at risk?  1) Pregnant Women  If you are pregnant yes. Consider postponing your trip to Zika-affected or countries at risk (Costa Rica and the others ). Through 2015, pediatric neurologists in Brazil started to see that some pregnant women infected with Zika gave birth to babies with an awful birth defect called microcephaly, which is described by a contracted head and incomplete brain development.  As Zika reached Brazil in the April of 2015, more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly have been stated in newborns born to mothers with Zika virus.  Scientists are still researching how many of these birth congenital disorders were really caused by the virus, and if the link is real (i.e., whether it’s Zika and not an interaction with other environmental factors causing the harm to fetuses).  In the meantime, as a precaution measure, the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention is recommending pregnant women to avoid areas with the virus. You can  see this list for countries that presently have Zika travel advisories and expect that the CDC will keep adding more to the list as the virus extends. And if you do cancel because of Zika, your airline may be posting a refund or credit, so make sure to ask about that.  2) Women trying to get pregnant  Please be careful. The CDC recommends consulting your doctor before traveling and following steps to prevent mosquito bites during the trip .  3) Women who want to get pregnant  No need to worry. Zika virus does not seem to risk of birth defects for future pregnancies. As best researchers can tell, the virus clears itself from the body pretty quickly, remaining in the blood for only about a week after infection .  4) Men with a partner who is trying to become pregnant  It’s likely that a man who travels to an infected region and gets bitten by a mosquito carrying Zika could later conduct the virus through sexual intercourse . There have been two studies in the medical literature that suggest this is a risk.

Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

Most Recent Update: ( more updates )  Health Agencies have downgraded Zika in the Americas from an emergency to a chronic disease … read more …    Zika, Dengue, Chikungunya transmitting A. albopictus mosquito potential distribution from scientists at Oxford University, University, University of California Davis, and the U.S. CDC and NIH in the journal Life Sciences  What I Found Was Surprising  If you are trying to escape the Aedes mosquitoes that can transmit the zika virus you should leave New York, Chicago, Atlanta…in fact the entire United States east of the Rockies and much of California and southern Canada.  The map shown above is based on “the most up-to-date data on the known locations of the species combined with information on environmental conditions across the globe.” and remarkably but clearly shows a less appropriate habitat in Costa Rica than much of the U.S. for the Ae. Albopictus species mosquito. Ae. aegypti also transmits zika in the Americas and has a similar distribution map but a more southerly range .  The map does not show where the mosquitoes are , or where Zika is , just where the habitat is appropriate for the mosquitoes that carry it.  Another map shows where traps have captured them across the U.S.   While it indicates that some areas of the mid-west and north-east may not have Aedes mosquito populations they have been found as far north as New Hampshire and are surprisingly common in extremely dry areas like New Mexico, Arizona and California.  Zika is a serious health problem for fetuses especially in the first trimester but extremely low risk for healthy infants, children, adults or seniors.  You should consult your health professional and check out the CDC , WHO , BBC and other scientific facts before making your decision when and where to travel and how to protect yourself at home in the U.S. or Europe.  My family and I had a fantastic vacation and no-one caught anything.   UPDATE December 2, 2016 – Health agencies have downgraded Zika in the Americas from an emergency to a chronic disease.  As the rainy season draws to a close in Costa Rica the Zika threat never really materialized.  A total of a couple of hundred mild cases in a year were massively overshadowed by tens of thousands of cases of Dengue.  UPDATE October 19, 2016 – Asian Tiger Mosquitoes have reached the UK . These are the first mosquitoes capable of transmitting Zika found in the U.K.  UPDATE September 19, 2016 – Miami’s Wynwood district the U.S. ground zero for mosquito transmission of Zika declared virus free.  UPDATE August 29, 2016 – A potential breakthrough for the treatment of Zika infections and prevention of microcephaly was reported today in one of the worlds leading scientific journals . Scientists from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Johns Hopkins University and Florida State University reported discovering two existing drugs/compounds “ that can both stop Zika from replicating in the body and from damaging the crucial fetal brain cells that lead to birth defects in newborns ” in Nature: medicine.  One of the most exciting aspects of this discovery is that it’s possible it may lead to a viable treatment quite soon because one of the compounds is already approved and could shortcut the sometimes years long FDA approval process. According to FSU “ One of the identified compounds is the basis for a drug called Nicolsamide, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drug that showed no danger to pregnant women in animal studies. It is commonly used to treat tapeworm. This could theoretically be prescribed by a doctor today, though tests are still needed to determine a specific treatment regimen for the infection.”  UPDATE August 22, 2016 – A report in the Journal Stem Cell reports that “ Zika Virus Infects Neural Progenitors in the Adult Mouse Brain and Alters Proliferation. ” Some extremely irresponsible social media and “news” reports are suggesting that – this is proof of Zika causing brain damage in adult humans – which is false.   UPDATE August 16, 2016 – A baby with microcephaly was born in Costa Rica to a Nicaraguan mother who contracted Zika in Nicaragua before moving to Costa Rica. This has generated headlines like “Microcephaly in Costa Rica” which are misleading to say the least.  UPDATE July 29, 2016 – Cases of mosquito transmission have been reported in Miami Florida. The U.K. has issued an advisory for British citizens considering travel to the southern U.S. “Pregnant women are advised to consider postponing non-essential travel until after pregnancy.”   UPDATE July 10, 2016 – Still good news. The numbers of individuals infected so far in the rainy season has been much lower than many predictions.  A North Dakota man was confirmed as the second case of U.S. tourist contracting Zika in Costa Rica out of approximately a million visitors since the outbreak began.   Zika cases detected in all of Costa Rica for each week for the first half of 2016  A total of 159 cases were detected in Costa Rica in the first half of 2016 including 6 pregnant women. Zero cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, zero cases of any neurological complications and zero cases with any indication of microcephaly have been reported.   In the U.S. a total of 1,133 cases of Zika have been detected. Five cases of associated Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported but no evidence of microcephaly has been seen.  UPDATE June 17, 2016 – Some good news.  News reports indicate that the number of new cases of Zika in Central American countries has decreased over the past month indicating that even though the rainy season has arrived in the region the mosquito control efforts seem to be having a big positive impact in controlling the spread of the disease.  The Costa Rican Ministry of Health reports a total of about 100 cases in 2016.  UPDATE May 30, 2016 – The Costa Rican Ministry of Health updated the total number of cases of Zika transmission to 58.  44 new cases in Jacó were added to the previously known 5 in San José and 9 on the Nicoya Peninsula.  Mosquito eradication efforts are being increased but cases are expected to continue to rise as the Pacific and central mountain rainy season begins.  The number of travel related cases detected in the U.S. is up to 503 ( see current CDC map ).  Over 150 pregnant women have tested positive for Zika in the U.S.  Congress has now reversed course from blocking funding for Zika prevention and treatment in late 2015 to now recommending $1.1 billion in new funding.   UPDATE May 1, 2016 – The BBC published an announcement that there may be risks of other brain injuries to fetuses exposed to Zika.   UPDATE April 25, 2016 – Canada announced the first case of Zika and New York announced a $21 million plan to fight mosquitoes and the virus.  UPDATE April 13, 2016 – The CDC (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has cited a New England Journal of Medicine article stating “ we suggest that sufficient evidence has accumulated to infer a causal relationship between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly ” to add Zika to the list of causes which previously included other infections during pregnancy, such as rubella, toxoplasmosis, or cytomegalovirus, alcohol or drug abuse, and malnutrition.   In other words the CDC has stated that Zika infections during pregnancy can be a cause of microcephaly .  The CDC has not changed any of their recommendations based on this conclusion.  UPDATE April 12, 2016 – The CDC (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) reports 346 cases across 41 states in the U.S. and active mosquito borne transmission in every country from Mexico south through the Caribbean and Central America to Ecuador, Columbia and Brazil in South America.  Republicans in Congress blocked 1.6 billion dollars in funding to fight Aedes mosquitoes and Zika and the White House announced that they would redirect $589 million in funds for Zika from existing Ebola funding.   The CDC says the data from their studies in Latin America should be analyzed by May 2016.  UPDATE April 10, 2016 – The CDC has changed it’s recommendation for pregnant women from “consider postponing” to “should not travel.”  “Zika virus can be spread from a pregnant woman to her fetus and has been linked to a serious birth defect of the brain called microcephaly in babies of mothers who had Zika virus while pregnant. Other problems have been detected among fetuses and infants infected with Zika virus before birth, such as absent or poorly developed brain structures, defects of the eye, hearing deficits, and impaired growth.  CDC recommends special precautions for pregnant women. Women who are pregnant should not travel to areas with Zika. If you must travel to one of these areas, talk to your healthcare provider first and strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during your trip.”   UPDATE March 25, 2016 – A baby in Panama is thought to be the first detected outside of Brazil with microcephaly and traces of zika “in the baby’s umbilical cord.” There was no evidence that Zika was present 7-9 months earlier in the first trimester when it’s theorized the virus might impact brain development and no evidence that Zika caused the microcephaly.  UPDATE March 15, 2016 – A retrospective statistical analysis in the British Medical journal the Lancet may have found 8 cases in the Polynesian outbreak of 2013  UPDATE February 28, 2016 – In a press release the U.S. government stated “As spring and summer approach, bringing with them larger and more active mosquito populations, we must be fully prepared to mitigate and quickly address local transmission within the continental U.S., particularly in the Southern United States.”  Millions of dollars are being spent to eliminate mosquitoes and prepare the health system for the inevitable increase in U.S. cases.  As of February 2016 two cases of sexual transmission had been detected in the U.S.  The first was in 2008 and the second in Dallas Texas in 2016.  There have also been more than 50 recent imported cases in the U.S. (caught zika in Brazil or elsewhere and got sick after returning home).  Recommendations For Avoiding Mosquito Bites At Home or When Traveling  The best time to visit Costa Rica to minimize your exposure to mosquitoes is the Pacific side dry season from January to April or the Caribbean side dry months of October and November.  Depending on where you’re coming from the risk of Zika may be lower in Costa Rica than it is where you live but that doesn’t mean you should be careless when you travel.  Of course we follow and strongly recommend the same preventative measures as the CDC, WHO and other health organizations.   Choose a hotel or lodging with air conditioning or screens on windows and doors.  Use a tested insect repellent like DEET or Picaridin and reapply as needed. Apply sunscreen first and repellent second.  Most natural repellents (citronella oil, cedar oil, geranium oil, peppermint and peppermint oil) have never been proven effective.  Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants in areas where mosquitoes are present.  Mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing. Treat clothes with permethrin or another Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insecticide for extra protection   If you’re concerned that the situation may worsen or that you may change your mind and cancel an upcoming trip we recommend investigating travel insurance. Although most travel insurance policies do not accept “I changed my mind” as justification for cancelling some do. However, airlines, hotels, resorts. tours and travel services almost never provide refunds.  Other Medical & Scientific Information on Zika  Mosquitoes are the deadliest animals on earth. Over a million people die every year from diseases carried by mosquitoes including Malaria , Chikungunya , Dengue , Yellow Fever, Encephalitis, and West Nile Virus. The diseases are not limited to the tropics – West Nile Virus ranges as far north as central Canada and has killed over 1,500 people in the U.S. alone. Despite the dramatic impact of photos of infants with microcephaly, the dangers of Zika pale in comparison to other mosquito transmitted diseases.   Four out of five people who contract zika are asymptomatic – in other words 80% of the people who catch it never even know they have it.  Zika is considered a very mild disease. Symptoms (when present at all) are mild headache, slight fever and sometimes red swollen eyes and lids, a rash, or joint pain.  No vaccine or preventative drug is available  Zika has been spreading since it was first seen in African monkeys in 1947 and has been recognized as a pandemic since 2007.  According to the CDC , WHO, and several scientific publications, zika will almost certainly spread in transmission clusters across much of the U.S. in the summer of 2016 when the mosquito activity increases.  Zika has been detected in six other species of mosquitoes but most of them are found only in Africa  Guillain–Barré syndrome is a very rare autoimmune disease that usually causes temporary numbness and muscle weakness. Guillain–Barré may be triggered by the flu, influenza vaccines, respiratory or gastrointestinal bacterial infections. According to the WHO Zika also triggers Guillain–Barré syndrome in rare cases.   Recent History & the Micro-Cephaly Connection to Zika  In 2015 a connection between infant microcephaly and zika in expectant mothers was proposed by a Brazilian Government Minister and widely popularized by news outlets and social media.  Increases in microcephaly were not associated with the millions of people who’ve had the disease outside Brazil. According to the BBC “ In the seven decades since Zika was first discovered, such horrific complications have never before been observed . ”  Outbreaks in Africa and Asia infected up to three fourths of the populations of some regions without evidence of links to microcepahly.  In the current outbreak in another country, Colombia, over 6,300 pregnant women have been diagnosed with the Zika virus but after careful screening there have been zero cases of fetal microcephaly found .  Fernando Ruiz, Colombia’s vice minister of health said at the end of February “You’d still expect that by now we would have at least had some cases — even just a few cases — of babies born with microcephaly or of signs of birth defects showing up on the ultrasounds.”  Why the Huge Disparity in Brazil?  Several theories have been proposed to explain why microcephaly seemed to be a major crisis in Brazil but not elsewhere.  Simple hysteria and human nature were definitely part of it.  Consequences as severe as microcephaly are frightening no matter how small the chance and it was found that many health care providers overestimated the possibility “just in case.”  The perception that by avoiding certain areas pregnant women could avoid the risk were initially a strong motivation for “getting the word out” until Zika cases started to increase in the U.S. and elsewhere outside Brazil.  A lot of the overestimation of the danger was simply due to errors.  The British Medical Journal The Lancet published an article showing that the original criteria used by the Brazilian Ministry of Health to define microcephaly was basically wrong . Initially Brazil ignored the gestational age and sex of the infants to estimate over 600,000 annual cases of microcephaly.  Using InterGrowth criteria  instead reduced the number of suspected cases by 99%.  InterGrowth is consistent with the World Health Organization global standards and when applied showed that Brazil was reporting 99 normal babies as microcephaly cases for every actual case.  An M.D. studying the numbers suggests four other explanations why microcephaly seemed to be such a big problem in Brazil but nearly undetected elsewhere.  The scientific community generally agrees that microcephaly is extremely rare whether Zika is present or not.  The very small number of cases is one of the factors making it difficult to estimate  real risks.  Another Possibility  Another possible culprit has been suggested by a group of doctors and researchers.  Pyriproxyfen is a juvenile hormone analog that prevents mosquito larvae from developing normally.  Pyriproxyfen is a hormonal growth inhibitor which has been widely used as a pesticide in Brazil  Around the time that Zika started to become a problem in Brazil the government initiated a widespread eradication campaign adding pyriproxyfen to drinking water supplies.  In the opinion of the doctors “Malformations detected in thousands of children from pregnant women living in areas where the Brazilian state added Pyriproxyfen to drinking water are not a coincidence, even though the Ministry of Health places a direct blame on the Zika virus for this damage.”  The ministry of health has responded by pointing to one area where Pyriproxyfen was used but no microcephaly was found.  Although Zika was confirmed as one cause of microcephaly in April of 2016 Pyriproxyfen has not been ruled out as a possible contributor to the elevated number of cases in Brazil or elsewhere.

March 10, 2017  Costa Rica is well known for its magnificent nature, epic waterfalls, exotic animals, paradise beaches, and much more! However, the word “Zika” buzzed all over various media outlets and the internet for months creating worry for travelers who wished to head to this remarkable country for a much needed vacation or extended stay. Coverage and panic over the virus seemed to spread like wildfire throughout the United States but all seemed pretty quiet and calm down here in Costa Rica! As a currently 8 month pregnant expat, who has lived here for over a year and half now, I was getting many questions from friends and potential visitors about the prevalence of the virus down here. Educating yourself on the facts of the virus along with ways that you can protect yourself often can help provide the answer if you are wondering if you should stay clear of Costa Rica because of the Zika virus .  Before deciding to postpone your trip, it may help to look at the facts of the Zika virus.    1. This is Not a New Virus!  Zika has been around for at least 70 years that we know of! This particular virus is a mosquito born virus that can be found in the Americas along with dengue , chikungunya , malaria , and yellow fever . It is uniquely different from other mosquito born viruses in that it can be transmitted sexually. If using the correct precautions to protect yourself from the virus as you would with other diseases that can also be transmitted this way, you can significantly reduce your risk and worry.    2. The Symptoms are Extremely Mild  The symptoms of Zika can hardly compare to what goes around doing flu season in the North Americas! Most who contract this virus are not aware of it and do not fall ill. The most common symptom of this virus is, none! If any symptoms are displayed, they include a headache, slight fever, possible rash, and joint pain. These may only last for the duration of a few days to a week.    3. There is No Real Danger to the Average Traveler  This virus poses no real threat or danger to a typical healthy traveler. Due to its zero to extremely mild side effects, travelers do not need to feel urged to change their plans. Individuals have traveled throughout the Americas for countless years while taking precautions to malaria, dengue, and chikungunya, which have also existed in these areas. The biggest danger that Zika poses is to pregnant women or those who wish to become pregnant. In this case, it is always urged to speak with a doctor, view CDC recommendations , and make your own decision on what you feel is best.  (As a side note! I have been living in Costa Rica throughout the entire duration of my pregnancy since August  2016 and I am expecting a healthy baby in May!)    *How to Proactively Protect Yourself  If you’re still nervous about traveling to Costa Rica or another area that has reported cases of Zika, (which is almost all of the Americas now) there are tons of ways that you can be proactive and drastically reduce your risk of getting the virus!   Bring EPA registered insect repellent  Cover exposed skin  Sleep in rooms with screens or windows  Use condoms as contraceptive protection  Hang a mosquito net over sleeping area if no screens available or if sleeping outside  Visit Costa Rica during dry seasons   Pacific: Early January - late April  Caribbean: Late September - early November       Talk of the virus has seemed to have left the media in the more recent months and more travelers are taking the time to look at the facts and still enjoy short or lengthy vacations to these areas. Don’t allow media hype to cause you to miss out on a vacation, yoga retreat, or grand adventure to Costa Rica!  A part of being a smart traveler is doing your own research and taking all necessary precautions you see fit. Look at the facts and bring your repellent! Costa Rica is NOT a country you want to miss out on visiting!  Pura Vida!

Take meticulous anti-mosquito bite measures during the daytime. Pregnant travellers should postpone travel to this country. For the latest information on Zika virus outbreaks please go to: ProMED-mail. Zika virus (02): Americas, Europe, research, observations. ProMED-mail 2018; January 16: 20180116.5563987. < ProMED-mail > . Accessed on January 17, 2018. Description  Zika Virus infection is caused by the Zika Virus (ZIKV) belonging to the Flaviviridae family. The virus is primarily transmitted by infected daytime biting female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes which are typically active from dawn to dusk. There is evidence that Zika Virus is also transmitted by other mosquitoes belonging to the Aedes genus. The virus can be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Human transmission can also occur through unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex. In some patients, researchers have found that the virus can be shed through saliva and urine. Risk Zika Virus is present in Mexico, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, tropical areas of Southeast Asia, Oceania, and parts of Africa. All travellers are at risk. Long-term travellers and aid or missionary workers going to areas where Zika Virus is endemic are at greater risk. Information about the virus is continuously evolving. However, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika Virus causes neurological complications: Guillain-Barré syndrome (progressive muscle weakness that can lead to temporary paralysis) and microcephaly (decreased head size which may lead to developmental delays) in infants born to pregnant women infected with the virus. Symptoms In the majority of cases, Zika Virus infection is asymptomatic – persons do not exhibit symptoms. Those with symptoms usually get ill 3-12 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms include mild fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, and general malaise. The illness is characterized by pink eye (inflammation of the conjunctiva), a skin rash with red spots on the face, neck, trunk, and upper arms which can spread to the palms or soles, and sensitivity to light. Some may also have a lack of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, and dizziness. Most people fully recover from the illness within 7 days. Treatment includes supportive care of symptoms. There is no antiviral treatment available. The Zika Virus is related to Dengue , Yellow Fever , West Nile Virus , and Japanese Encephalitis . It may be misdiagnosed for Dengue and Chikungunya . Prevention Travellers going to areas with Zika Virus should take meticulous measures to prevent mosquito bites during the daytime. There is currently no preventive medication or vaccine against Zika Virus.  Use a repellent containing 20%-30% DEET or 20% Picaridin on exposed skin. Re-apply according to manufacturer's directions.  Wear neutral-coloured (beige, light grey) clothing. If possible, wear long-sleeved, breathable garments.  If available, pre-soak or spray outer layer clothing and gear with permethrin.  Get rid of water containers around dwellings and ensure that door and window screens work properly.  Apply sunscreen first followed by the repellent (preferably 20 minutes later).  More details on insect bite prevention .     Pregnancy and Zika Virus  Travellers who are pregnant or considering pregnancy should postpone travel to areas with Zika Virus transmission.  To avoid sexual transmission of the virus to a pregnant partner , travellers who have been in areas with risk of Zika Virus transmission should practice safe sex for the duration of the pregnancy.  All travellers, particularly partners considering pregnancy , should practice safe sex or abstinence for at least 6 months if one or both partners have travelled to an area with risk of Zika Virus transmission. Practicing safe sex is recommended even if you or your partner do not have symptoms. Most Zika Virus infections are asymptomatic (show no signs or symptoms), but transmission of the virus to another person can still occur.  If you travel to or live in an area with risk of Zika virus transmission, follow meticulous mosquito bite prevention measures during the daytime.

News Travel  Zika Virus in Costa Rica: What You Need To Know Before You Travel   By  Rico -   5 December 2016  0      Facebook    Twitter    Google+    Pinterest    WhatsApp             Costa Rica has 1,518 confirmed cases of the Zika virus (as at November 30, 2016)  Q TRAVEL – The holiday travel season is here and Costa Rica is a very popular destination for many from around the world. Should you be worred about the Zika Virus?  The ZIKA VIRUS IS SCARY because it targets the most vulnerable among us — its sudden, rapid spread across the Americas would not have been recognized by the general public had it not been linked to birth defects like microcephaly in unborn babies.  Because of this horrific side effect to the otherwise fairly mild virus, travelers have good reason to be concerned when they travel. But a lot of the panic has been unnecessary, and often, the true risk of Zika has been overstated. To try and fight panic and inform travelers, we’ve created this resource page to try and break everything down for you.  The Zika Virus in Costa Rica  What is the current situation? The Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud) Epidemiological Bulletin No. 40-2016 on Zika, Chikungunya and Dengue ( November 30, 2016 ), there are 1,518 confirmed cases of Zika (534 men / 984 women), the majority of cases (208) in the Punaternas canton (county).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Costa Rica says mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at elevations above 6,500 feet (2,000 metres) because of environmental conditions. Travelers whose itineraries are limited to areas above this elevation are at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito.  The following map shows areas of Costa Rica above and below 6,500 feet.     The following is a great resource article from the Matador Network . A great read.  What is Zika?  Zika is a mosquito-borne virus that is related to dengue, West Nile, and yellow fever. The virus was first discovered in the Ugandan Zika forest in the late 1940’s, and for about 60 years, it remained in the equatorial regions of Africa in Asia. In 2007, it started spreading across the Pacific Islands, and in April 2015, it had its first outbreak in Brazil. Shortly after this outbreak, public health experts noticed a rise in cases of microcephaly (a birth defect which can results in an underdeveloped brain) among newborns and a rise in cases Guillain–Barré syndrome (an immune disorder) in adults in the areas most affected by Zika. Further research was done, and in 2016, Zika was definitively linked to both of these conditions.   What are the symptoms?  For most people, Zika is not a very severe illness. That is why, in fact, it hadn’t been extensively researched prior to 2016: it was not considered a severe enough illness to merit attention when other much more severe mosquito-borne diseases, like malaria, yellow fever, and dengue, where out in the world.  Only one in five people who get Zika will develop symptoms. Those symptoms aren’t particularly pleasant — they include fever, rash, headaches, joint pain, muscle pain, and red eyes.  Zika’s scariest aspect is that it may be linked to microcephaly in babies. Microcephaly is abnormal brain development that can cause a disproportionately small head in the child, which may, in some circumstances, lead to death. There is also growing evidence of what’s being called Congenital Zika Syndrome, which is a pattern of certain other birth defects in children exposed to Zika in the womb. These birth defects include, according to the CDC :    Severe microcephaly where the skull has partially collapsed  Decreased brain tissue with a specific pattern of brain damage  Damage to the back of the eye  Joints with limited range of motion, such as clubfoot  Too much muscle tone restricting body movement soon after birth    A small percentage of adults who get infected with Zika may develop Guillain-Barré syndrome, or GBS. This is a rare condition where the immune system attacks the nervous system, causing weakness and sometimes paralysis. Most people fully recover from GBS, and few ever die. Usually, it lasts for a few weeks to a few months. The CDC has not discovered a direct link between Zika and GBS, but it does say they are strongly associated.  Who should be worried?  The largest danger is to pregnant women, and as such, if you are pregnant or are trying to become pregnant, then you should avoid going to the countries or areas where Zika outbreaks are currently occurring. Because the virus is mosquito-borne, the level at which it spreads depends heavily on the seasons. So while it will likely spread further north into the United States at some point, it will be likely to naturally spread during the summer months.  The virus is still mostly transmitted through mosquitoes, but it can also be sexually transmitted. If a man were to get Zika and then have unprotected sex with a pregnant woman in a Zika-free country, he could pass it to her and infect the baby.  Should I change my travel plans?  If you are pregnant (or are trying to get pregnant) and are planning on traveling to those countries, the safest option is probably to cancel your plans. If the travel is unavoidable, or if you live in a place where the outbreak is happening, don’t panic: just try to avoid mosquito bites, and remember that Zika may be linked to microcephaly: it is not an inevitability. The CDC is simply advocating caution, certainly not panic.  If you are a woman, are not pregnant, and you get Zika, don’t worry: the virus typically leaves the system after a week, meaning it won’t infect future babies you may have.  If you are a man and are trying to get pregnant with a partner, or if you are a woman who is trying to get pregnant, you can still travel to a country with Zika, but you should take precautions to avoid infection (we’ll discuss those below), and you should put off trying to get pregnant for a period of time. Here’s what the CDC suggests:   If you are a woman:   If exposed to Zika through travel to an area with Zika, or sex with someone who has traveled to an area with Zika, wait 8 weeks after exposure to start trying to get pregnant.  If positively diagnosed with Zika, wait 8 weeks after symptoms start.    If you are a man:   If exposed to Zika through travel to an area with Zika, or sex with someone who has traveled to an area with Zika, wait 6 months after exposure to start trying to get pregnant. This extra time is because Zika can last longer in semen than it can in the rest of the body.  If positively diagnosed with Zika, wait 6 months after exposure to start trying to get pregnant.     If you went to an area with Zika and experience no symptoms for a few weeks after the trip, there’s an okay chance you never contracted Zika. That said, most people who get Zika do not experience symptoms. And as of yet, the only tests for the virus are positive tests — meaning that they can prove that you have it. There are no tests that can prove that you don’t have it. So while you likely don’t, there is no way to prove it.  It’s also worth pointing out that scientists are not yet sure what percentage of infected newborns develop microcephaly — current ranges estimate between 1 and 13 percent of fetuses exposed in the first trimester will develop microcephaly. But we’re not sure yet.  Ultimately, if you’re trying to get pregnant and want to travel to (or possibly live in) an area with Zika, you should talk to your doctor. If you are not trying to get pregnant, travel away — just protect yourself against mosquito bites and practice safe sex or abstinence.  What should travelers do to avoid Zika  Since Zika is mosquito-borne, prevention largely comes down to avoiding mosquito bites. The mosquito that carries Zika is the female Aedes Aegypti , and it is most active during the day. This means that mosquito nets are less effective than they are with diseases like malaria, which are carried by more nocturnally active mosquitoes. This isn’t to say that if you have a mosquito net that you shouldn’t use it: it’s just to say you should take further steps as well. Those steps are:   Wear long sleeve shirts and pants, preferably made of thick material.  Use mosquito repellent that contains deet.  Stay indoors as much as possible.   There is, as yet, no vaccine against Zika. Doctors have developed successful vaccines for similar diseases in the past, but vaccines take a long time to develop. If you do get Zika, there’s also no medicine for treatment. Doctors suggest getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and taking acetominophen or paracetomol (NOT aspirin) for any aches, pains, or fevers. Most importantly, if you do get it, make sure you still work to prevent further mosquito bites. If you get bitten while infected, the mosquito can then infect others.  A second precaution, if you’ve traveled to Zika-prone countries, is to practice safe sex. Men, this does not fall exclusively on women: It lasts far longer in male semen (up to 6 months) than it does in a woman’s body, and it’s much easier to transmit from male-to-female than it is female-to-male. So this responsibility should fall on men, to a large extent.  An important note  Most travel insurance policies will not cover cancellations for Zika . As such, if you’re worried you’ll need to cancel your trip, you may want to spring for Cancel for Any Reason travel insurance. It’s a bit more expensive, but may be worth it in this case.  For a while, several airlines were offering refunds for travel that had to be canceled because of the virus. The deadlines for these have passed for the most part, but it may be worth checking the airline’s cancellation policies prior to booking.  Where is Zika?  At this point, Zika can be found through a lot of the world. Here’s where you need to be careful.  It’s important to note that the vast majority of the cases shown on this map were cases resulting from travel , not from local transmission. As of November 30, 2016, 185 cases have been transmitted locally in the United States. 184 have been in Florida , and most of these in Southern Florida. The CDC suggests pregnant women do not travel to Miami Beach . Cases in the United States. Via The CDC  Worldwide      Countries with active Zika transmission. Via the CDC.   This is obviously not a very specific map — Alaska, for example, while part of the US, does not have active mosquito transmission. The same is true for many other countries. The CDC suggests pregnant women not travel to any active transmission zones. They have a specific country-by-country guide here .  Resources  Here are some useful sites, if you’d like to know more:   The Center for Disease Control’s Zika resource page.  Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus from the New York Times.  The World Health Organization’s Zika resource page.   Ultimately, we recommend the following attitude towards Zika: inform yourself, but don’t panic. For the vast majority of people, it is not a reason to stop traveling.

The growth in dengue cases in Puntarenas has been tracked since mid-September, when the cases nearly doubled from one week to the next, going from 60 to 108. In Guanacaste, the patients increased from 81 to 147 in July. The total number of dengue cases in the country is 12,496. This is a 12% increase over last year.     Chikungunya arrived in mid-May of 2014 and had a sharp rise in the end of that year. In the two weeks ending on November 14th the chikungunya figures increased sevenfold. There are 3,020 patients this year, a 2,000% increase over 2014.     The Ministry of Health expects that, because of the cyclical nature of the diseases, there will be an epidemic in 2016.     As always, take care to eliminate mosquito breeding sites, those which are dark or where water accumulates.

Re: Zika virus threat in Costa Rica?   Jan 17, 2016, 7:06 PM      Hi,This is a post to Estella C. I am an Ob/Gyn in the US. Your post is very helpful. The increase in the mosquito-born diseases that are carried by the same breed of mosquito that carry the Zika virus is very worrisome. My question is about the tracking of the Zika Virus. Do you feel it may be underreported since it is my understanding that the symptoms (more flu-like) are so much less severe than those of the other viruses? I will follow the CDC reccomendations at this point, but discuss the risk of having a severely neurologically impaired, microcephalic child.

Here, the latest reports and travel recommendations.   By Lauren Mazzo  |  Jun 15, 2017 Topics: women's health conditions , cdc      It's been almost a year since the height of the Zika frenzy—the number of cases was skyrocketing, the list of ways the virus could spread was growing, and the possible health effects were getting scarier and scarier. And this was all just before the summer Olympics in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, a hot spot for Zika-carrying mosquitoes. (Obv, inducing panic for some Olympians, who decided to skip the Games altogether in the name of staying safe.) The Bad News: Zika-Related Birth Defects A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that 5 percent of women in U.S. territories who had a confirmed Zika virus infection during their pregnancy had a baby or fetus with Zika-related defects. These include microcephaly (an abnormally small head), brain and eye damage, restricted movement due to abnormal muscle or joint growth, and a rare nervous system disease called Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). As of late May 2017, the current count of pregnant women with Zika in U.S. territories reached 3,916, and there were 72 infants born with Zika-related birth defects from the 1,579 completed pregnancies. Women infected during their first trimester had the greatest risk—1 in 12—of their fetus or baby having Zika-associated defects. According to the CDC's report, about 8 percent of first-trimester infections, 5 percent of second-trimester infections, and 4 percent of third-trimester infections resulted in Zika-associated defects. The Good News: Current Zika Alert Level The epidemic may be officially on its way out. Puerto Rico's governor announced recently that the Zika virus epidemic is officially over for the island, according to Reuters . Though Puerto Rico has had more than 40K outbreaks in total, there have only been 10 newly reported cases since the end of April. That doesn't mean Zika has magically disappeared from PR, though. The CDC still recommends a Level 2 yellow "cautionary" travel alert for the area and that people "practice enhanced precautions." Also, the Level 2 travel warnings for Brazil and the Miami area have officially been lifted, meaning that, while sporadic cases may still occur, the risk of transmission is likely relatively low. But don't get your luggage out quite yet. The CDC still considers many other countries to pose a Level 2 travel risk, including Mexico, Argentina, Barbados, Aruba, Costa Rica, and many more countries in the Caribbean, South and Central America, Asia, and Africa. Brownsville, TX, a town right by the Mexican border, is the only area in the U.S. that still has a Level 2 warning. (View the full list of CDC Zika travel recommendations and alerts right here , plus guidance on safe Zika practices in Level 2 areas and areas where Level 2 designations have been lifted .) What That Means About Your Zika Risk You can take a deep breath. We're no longer in the midst of crazy Zika panic. However, the virus isn't totally wiped out, so you should still take precautions—and especially if you're pregnant. First, brush up on these need-to-know Zika virus facts . A lot more is understood about the virus now than when it first popped up, including the fact that it can be spread as an STD , can live in your eyes , and may even have detrimental effects on the adult brain . If you're traveling to a country that still has a Level 2 warning or where one was recently lifted, you should still be taking care to prevent mosquito bites and practice safe sex . (Which you should be doing anyway, TBH.)

Premio M&E           Update on the Zika Virus in Costa Rica – March 24th, 2017 You are here: Home Blog Update on the Zika Virus…                      This post is proposed to help travelers to learn about the condition of the Zika Virus in Costa Rica, learn about the risks and to give notice on the protections to evade Zika.   The interest surrounding Zika has been focused on the suspected link connecting the virus and a critical birth defect known as microcephaly .  Understanding How Zika Virus Can Affect Your Trip  Zika virus  A key way for travelers to manage their risk concerning Zika is in understanding that the virus is primarily transmitted to people via mosquito bites, which is why the following information is important:  The CDC offers a wealth of information on Zika as well as prevention at this link .  The CDC also reports instances of Zika being transmitted sexually and provides information on sexual transmission and prevention at this link .  Favorably, CDC also reports, “Zika virus usually remains in the blood of an infected person for only a few days to a week. The virus will not cause infections in an infant that is conceived after the virus is cleared from the blood. There is currently no evidence that Zika virus infection poses a risk of birth defects in future pregnancies. ”                 Update on the number of cases per region  Central Pacific 141cases Guanacaste Province 35cases Central Valley 0cases Caribbean Coast 209cases    Data from Social Security Ministry of Costa Rica       For most travelers, the CDC reports that “ About 1 in 5 people infected with Zika will get sick . For people who get sick, the illness is usually mild. For this reason, many people might not realize they have been infected…The most common symptoms of Zika virus disease are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes). The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. Severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon… ”  For pregnant women the situation is different, “ Until more is known, CDC recommends special precautions for pregnant women and women trying to become pregnant,” which one can read at this link .          What is Costa Rica doing about Zika?     Costa Rica has developed a strong campaign to eliminate the possible mosquito sources, and up until March 15th, there were 697,871 possible mosquito breeding areas. Out of these: 230,879 were completely eliminated, and 466,871 were treated.             (Treated mosquito breeding areas means, for instance, aquatic plants, ponds, fountains, and similar breeding spots that cannot be eliminated totally but are cleaned)  Visiting a total of 145,873 houses, the spraying of mosquitoes is a continuous government and community efforts that complement a sound media campaign to get rid of any possible breeding areas.  If you see the October update, numbers were much higher. Besides the government control, the sunny season dries up the majority of the breeding areas)  Education Programs  On the other hand, in Costa Rica, everything is done through the schools. And this is not the exception. The Zika Virus situation is discussed and supported by the Costa Rican elementary schools and children usually end up teaching their parents about getting rid of the mosquitos hatcheries.  Find here (In Spanish) some of the documents given to the children and put in all public areas in the communities in risk:           What is zika?

Who is the population at risk?  1) Pregnant Women  If you are pregnant yes. Consider postponing your trip to Zika-affected or countries at risk (Costa Rica and the others ). Through 2015, pediatric neurologists in Brazil started to see that some pregnant women infected with Zika gave birth to babies with an awful birth defect called microcephaly, which is described by a contracted head and incomplete brain development.  As Zika reached Brazil in the April of 2015, more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly have been stated in newborns born to mothers with Zika virus.  Scientists are still researching how many of these birth congenital disorders were really caused by the virus, and if the link is real (i.e., whether it’s Zika and not an interaction with other environmental factors causing the harm to fetuses).  In the meantime, as a precaution measure, the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention is recommending pregnant women to avoid areas with the virus. You can  see this list for countries that presently have Zika travel advisories and expect that the CDC will keep adding more to the list as the virus extends. And if you do cancel because of Zika, your airline may be posting a refund or credit, so make sure to ask about that.  2) Women trying to get pregnant  Please be careful. The CDC recommends consulting your doctor before traveling and following steps to prevent mosquito bites during the trip .  3) Women who want to get pregnant  No need to worry. Zika virus does not seem to risk of birth defects for future pregnancies. As best researchers can tell, the virus clears itself from the body pretty quickly, remaining in the blood for only about a week after infection .  4) Men with a partner who is trying to become pregnant  It’s likely that a man who travels to an infected region and gets bitten by a mosquito carrying Zika could later conduct the virus through sexual intercourse . There have been two studies in the medical literature that suggest this is a risk.

Infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects. Zika can spread through mosquito bites and sex. CDC recommends special precautions for the following groups:   Women who are pregnant:   Should not travel to any area of a country with risk of Zika below 6,500 feet ( see map ).  If you have a partner who lives in or has traveled to a country with risk of Zika, either use condoms or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers who have a pregnant partner:   Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex for the rest of the pregnancy.    Travelers considering pregnancy:   Before you or your partner travel, talk to your doctor about your plans to become pregnant and the risk of Zika.  Consider waiting before trying to conceive.  6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a man or a couple traveling together  2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms) if you are a woman and your male partner does not travel        There is a risk of Zika virus (Zika) in the country you have selected. This means that mosquitoes there may be infected with Zika and spreading it to people.  Note: The mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at altitudes above 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) because of environmental conditions. Check the map of areas with risk of Zika to see if your destination is above the altitude of 6,500 feet because you may be at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito if you will only be in areas of high altitude.  About Zika  Many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms. However, infection during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects. Because there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, travelers should take steps to prevent getting Zika during travel. They should also take steps to prevent spreading it when they return home.  Read more about Zika below, or learn about other health and safety precautions at your next destination .  How is Zika virus spread?  Zika can spread several ways, including:   Through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on (bite) a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.  From a pregnant woman to her developing fetus, or at the time of birth, if the mother is infected with Zika during pregnancy.  Through sex with a person who is infected with Zika . Zika can be sexually transmitted from an infected man or woman. But Zika can stay in a man’s semen longer than in a woman’s body fluids. Zika can stay in a man’s semen for months after infection and be transmitted through sex during that time.   See How Zika Spreads . Even if people with Zika do not have symptoms, they can still spread the virus.  What can travelers do to prevent Zika?   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika. This is because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  All travelers  to areas with risk of Zika should (1) prevent mosquito bites and (2) use condoms or not have sex to protect against Zika during travel. They should continue to take these precautions after their trip to stop the spread of Zika to others back home. See below for more information.    Special Precautions for Specific Groups  CDC recommends special precautions for (1) pregnant women , (2) the partners of pregnant women , and (3) those considering pregnancy :  1. Pregnant women   Pregnant women should NOT travel to areas with risk of Zika because Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects.  However, if you must travel:  Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider before you travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Strictly follow steps to prevent sexual transmission during your trip.  See your doctor after your return, even if you do not have symptoms.  Tell your doctor about possible Zika exposure at each prenatal care visit.    If your partner travels:  Use condoms every time you have sex – or do not have sex – for the rest of the pregnancy, even if your partner does not have symptoms or feel sick.     >> More Zika information for pregnant women  2. Travelers who have a pregnant partner   Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  Use condoms every time you have sex—or do not have sex— for the rest of the pregnancy , even if you do not have symptoms or feel sick.   >> More information about protecting against Zika during pregnancy  3. Travelers considering pregnancy   Talk to your healthcare provider about your pregnancy plans and possible Zika risk before travel.  Strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after your return.  If you’re a couple traveling together or a man (traveling without your partner): Consider waiting at least 6 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if the man develops symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.  If you’re a woman (and your male partner does not travel): Consider waiting at least 2 months after you return (or from the start of symptoms, if you develop symptoms) before trying to conceive. During that time, use condoms or do not have sex to prevent passing Zika to your partner.   Men are advised to consider waiting longer because Zika can stay in semen longer than in other body fluids and can be transmitted to partners during that time.  >> More Zika information for those considering pregnancy   During Travel: Protect Yourself   Prevent mosquito bites:   Use EPA-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone. Always use as directed.  Cover exposed skin: Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants  Stay in places with air conditioning, with window and door screens, or sleep under a mosquito bed net.  For extended stays there are steps you can take to control mosquitoes inside and outside, like removing standing water. [ See more ]    Prevent sexual transmission :   Use condoms every time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex – or do not have sex – if you are concerned about getting or passing Zika through sex. This is especially important if you or your partner is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. [ See more ]     After Travel: Protect Others   Continue using mosquito repellent for 3 weeks after your return, even if you do not feel sick. This will help prevent spreading Zika to uninfected mosquitoes that can spread the virus to other people.  To protect your partners, use condoms - or do not have sex -  for at least 6 months after travel if you are a man, and for at least 2 months after travel if you are a woman. If you and your partner travel together, use condoms for at least 6 months after your return. If your partner is pregnant, use condoms for the rest of her pregnancy.   If you feel sick and think you may have Zika   Talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider if you develop common symptoms of Zika, including fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes, or muscle pain.  Tell your doctor about your travel.  Take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain.  Do not take aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dengue is another disease transmitted by mosquitoes that causes symptoms similar to Zika and can cause internal bleeding.  If you are taking medicine for another condition or if you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before taking additional medication.  A blood or urine test can identify Zika infection.

Most Recent Update: ( more updates )  Health Agencies have downgraded Zika in the Americas from an emergency to a chronic disease … read more …    Zika, Dengue, Chikungunya transmitting A. albopictus mosquito potential distribution from scientists at Oxford University, University, University of California Davis, and the U.S. CDC and NIH in the journal Life Sciences  What I Found Was Surprising  If you are trying to escape the Aedes mosquitoes that can transmit the zika virus you should leave New York, Chicago, Atlanta…in fact the entire United States east of the Rockies and much of California and southern Canada.  The map shown above is based on “the most up-to-date data on the known locations of the species combined with information on environmental conditions across the globe.” and remarkably but clearly shows a less appropriate habitat in Costa Rica than much of the U.S. for the Ae. Albopictus species mosquito. Ae. aegypti also transmits zika in the Americas and has a similar distribution map but a more southerly range .  The map does not show where the mosquitoes are , or where Zika is , just where the habitat is appropriate for the mosquitoes that carry it.  Another map shows where traps have captured them across the U.S.   While it indicates that some areas of the mid-west and north-east may not have Aedes mosquito populations they have been found as far north as New Hampshire and are surprisingly common in extremely dry areas like New Mexico, Arizona and California.  Zika is a serious health problem for fetuses especially in the first trimester but extremely low risk for healthy infants, children, adults or seniors.  You should consult your health professional and check out the CDC , WHO , BBC and other scientific facts before making your decision when and where to travel and how to protect yourself at home in the U.S. or Europe.  My family and I had a fantastic vacation and no-one caught anything.   UPDATE December 2, 2016 – Health agencies have downgraded Zika in the Americas from an emergency to a chronic disease.  As the rainy season draws to a close in Costa Rica the Zika threat never really materialized.  A total of a couple of hundred mild cases in a year were massively overshadowed by tens of thousands of cases of Dengue.  UPDATE October 19, 2016 – Asian Tiger Mosquitoes have reached the UK . These are the first mosquitoes capable of transmitting Zika found in the U.K.  UPDATE September 19, 2016 – Miami’s Wynwood district the U.S. ground zero for mosquito transmission of Zika declared virus free.  UPDATE August 29, 2016 – A potential breakthrough for the treatment of Zika infections and prevention of microcephaly was reported today in one of the worlds leading scientific journals . Scientists from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Johns Hopkins University and Florida State University reported discovering two existing drugs/compounds “ that can both stop Zika from replicating in the body and from damaging the crucial fetal brain cells that lead to birth defects in newborns ” in Nature: medicine.  One of the most exciting aspects of this discovery is that it’s possible it may lead to a viable treatment quite soon because one of the compounds is already approved and could shortcut the sometimes years long FDA approval process. According to FSU “ One of the identified compounds is the basis for a drug called Nicolsamide, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drug that showed no danger to pregnant women in animal studies. It is commonly used to treat tapeworm. This could theoretically be prescribed by a doctor today, though tests are still needed to determine a specific treatment regimen for the infection.”  UPDATE August 22, 2016 – A report in the Journal Stem Cell reports that “ Zika Virus Infects Neural Progenitors in the Adult Mouse Brain and Alters Proliferation. ” Some extremely irresponsible social media and “news” reports are suggesting that – this is proof of Zika causing brain damage in adult humans – which is false.   UPDATE August 16, 2016 – A baby with microcephaly was born in Costa Rica to a Nicaraguan mother who contracted Zika in Nicaragua before moving to Costa Rica. This has generated headlines like “Microcephaly in Costa Rica” which are misleading to say the least.  UPDATE July 29, 2016 – Cases of mosquito transmission have been reported in Miami Florida. The U.K. has issued an advisory for British citizens considering travel to the southern U.S. “Pregnant women are advised to consider postponing non-essential travel until after pregnancy.”   UPDATE July 10, 2016 – Still good news. The numbers of individuals infected so far in the rainy season has been much lower than many predictions.  A North Dakota man was confirmed as the second case of U.S. tourist contracting Zika in Costa Rica out of approximately a million visitors since the outbreak began.   Zika cases detected in all of Costa Rica for each week for the first half of 2016  A total of 159 cases were detected in Costa Rica in the first half of 2016 including 6 pregnant women. Zero cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, zero cases of any neurological complications and zero cases with any indication of microcephaly have been reported.   In the U.S. a total of 1,133 cases of Zika have been detected. Five cases of associated Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported but no evidence of microcephaly has been seen.  UPDATE June 17, 2016 – Some good news.  News reports indicate that the number of new cases of Zika in Central American countries has decreased over the past month indicating that even though the rainy season has arrived in the region the mosquito control efforts seem to be having a big positive impact in controlling the spread of the disease.  The Costa Rican Ministry of Health reports a total of about 100 cases in 2016.  UPDATE May 30, 2016 – The Costa Rican Ministry of Health updated the total number of cases of Zika transmission to 58.  44 new cases in Jacó were added to the previously known 5 in San José and 9 on the Nicoya Peninsula.  Mosquito eradication efforts are being increased but cases are expected to continue to rise as the Pacific and central mountain rainy season begins.  The number of travel related cases detected in the U.S. is up to 503 ( see current CDC map ).  Over 150 pregnant women have tested positive for Zika in the U.S.  Congress has now reversed course from blocking funding for Zika prevention and treatment in late 2015 to now recommending $1.1 billion in new funding.   UPDATE May 1, 2016 – The BBC published an announcement that there may be risks of other brain injuries to fetuses exposed to Zika.   UPDATE April 25, 2016 – Canada announced the first case of Zika and New York announced a $21 million plan to fight mosquitoes and the virus.  UPDATE April 13, 2016 – The CDC (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has cited a New England Journal of Medicine article stating “ we suggest that sufficient evidence has accumulated to infer a causal relationship between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly ” to add Zika to the list of causes which previously included other infections during pregnancy, such as rubella, toxoplasmosis, or cytomegalovirus, alcohol or drug abuse, and malnutrition.   In other words the CDC has stated that Zika infections during pregnancy can be a cause of microcephaly .  The CDC has not changed any of their recommendations based on this conclusion.  UPDATE April 12, 2016 – The CDC (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) reports 346 cases across 41 states in the U.S. and active mosquito borne transmission in every country from Mexico south through the Caribbean and Central America to Ecuador, Columbia and Brazil in South America.  Republicans in Congress blocked 1.6 billion dollars in funding to fight Aedes mosquitoes and Zika and the White House announced that they would redirect $589 million in funds for Zika from existing Ebola funding.   The CDC says the data from their studies in Latin America should be analyzed by May 2016.  UPDATE April 10, 2016 – The CDC has changed it’s recommendation for pregnant women from “consider postponing” to “should not travel.”  “Zika virus can be spread from a pregnant woman to her fetus and has been linked to a serious birth defect of the brain called microcephaly in babies of mothers who had Zika virus while pregnant. Other problems have been detected among fetuses and infants infected with Zika virus before birth, such as absent or poorly developed brain structures, defects of the eye, hearing deficits, and impaired growth.  CDC recommends special precautions for pregnant women. Women who are pregnant should not travel to areas with Zika. If you must travel to one of these areas, talk to your healthcare provider first and strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during your trip.”   UPDATE March 25, 2016 – A baby in Panama is thought to be the first detected outside of Brazil with microcephaly and traces of zika “in the baby’s umbilical cord.” There was no evidence that Zika was present 7-9 months earlier in the first trimester when it’s theorized the virus might impact brain development and no evidence that Zika caused the microcephaly.  UPDATE March 15, 2016 – A retrospective statistical analysis in the British Medical journal the Lancet may have found 8 cases in the Polynesian outbreak of 2013  UPDATE February 28, 2016 – In a press release the U.S. government stated “As spring and summer approach, bringing with them larger and more active mosquito populations, we must be fully prepared to mitigate and quickly address local transmission within the continental U.S., particularly in the Southern United States.”  Millions of dollars are being spent to eliminate mosquitoes and prepare the health system for the inevitable increase in U.S. cases.  As of February 2016 two cases of sexual transmission had been detected in the U.S.  The first was in 2008 and the second in Dallas Texas in 2016.  There have also been more than 50 recent imported cases in the U.S. (caught zika in Brazil or elsewhere and got sick after returning home).  Recommendations For Avoiding Mosquito Bites At Home or When Traveling  The best time to visit Costa Rica to minimize your exposure to mosquitoes is the Pacific side dry season from January to April or the Caribbean side dry months of October and November.  Depending on where you’re coming from the risk of Zika may be lower in Costa Rica than it is where you live but that doesn’t mean you should be careless when you travel.  Of course we follow and strongly recommend the same preventative measures as the CDC, WHO and other health organizations.   Choose a hotel or lodging with air conditioning or screens on windows and doors.  Use a tested insect repellent like DEET or Picaridin and reapply as needed. Apply sunscreen first and repellent second.  Most natural repellents (citronella oil, cedar oil, geranium oil, peppermint and peppermint oil) have never been proven effective.  Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants in areas where mosquitoes are present.  Mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing. Treat clothes with permethrin or another Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insecticide for extra protection   If you’re concerned that the situation may worsen or that you may change your mind and cancel an upcoming trip we recommend investigating travel insurance. Although most travel insurance policies do not accept “I changed my mind” as justification for cancelling some do. However, airlines, hotels, resorts. tours and travel services almost never provide refunds.  Other Medical & Scientific Information on Zika  Mosquitoes are the deadliest animals on earth. Over a million people die every year from diseases carried by mosquitoes including Malaria , Chikungunya , Dengue , Yellow Fever, Encephalitis, and West Nile Virus. The diseases are not limited to the tropics – West Nile Virus ranges as far north as central Canada and has killed over 1,500 people in the U.S. alone. Despite the dramatic impact of photos of infants with microcephaly, the dangers of Zika pale in comparison to other mosquito transmitted diseases.   Four out of five people who contract zika are asymptomatic – in other words 80% of the people who catch it never even know they have it.  Zika is considered a very mild disease. Symptoms (when present at all) are mild headache, slight fever and sometimes red swollen eyes and lids, a rash, or joint pain.  No vaccine or preventative drug is available  Zika has been spreading since it was first seen in African monkeys in 1947 and has been recognized as a pandemic since 2007.  According to the CDC , WHO, and several scientific publications, zika will almost certainly spread in transmission clusters across much of the U.S. in the summer of 2016 when the mosquito activity increases.  Zika has been detected in six other species of mosquitoes but most of them are found only in Africa  Guillain–Barré syndrome is a very rare autoimmune disease that usually causes temporary numbness and muscle weakness. Guillain–Barré may be triggered by the flu, influenza vaccines, respiratory or gastrointestinal bacterial infections. According to the WHO Zika also triggers Guillain–Barré syndrome in rare cases.   Recent History & the Micro-Cephaly Connection to Zika  In 2015 a connection between infant microcephaly and zika in expectant mothers was proposed by a Brazilian Government Minister and widely popularized by news outlets and social media.  Increases in microcephaly were not associated with the millions of people who’ve had the disease outside Brazil. According to the BBC “ In the seven decades since Zika was first discovered, such horrific complications have never before been observed . ”  Outbreaks in Africa and Asia infected up to three fourths of the populations of some regions without evidence of links to microcepahly.  In the current outbreak in another country, Colombia, over 6,300 pregnant women have been diagnosed with the Zika virus but after careful screening there have been zero cases of fetal microcephaly found .  Fernando Ruiz, Colombia’s vice minister of health said at the end of February “You’d still expect that by now we would have at least had some cases — even just a few cases — of babies born with microcephaly or of signs of birth defects showing up on the ultrasounds.”  Why the Huge Disparity in Brazil?  Several theories have been proposed to explain why microcephaly seemed to be a major crisis in Brazil but not elsewhere.  Simple hysteria and human nature were definitely part of it.  Consequences as severe as microcephaly are frightening no matter how small the chance and it was found that many health care providers overestimated the possibility “just in case.”  The perception that by avoiding certain areas pregnant women could avoid the risk were initially a strong motivation for “getting the word out” until Zika cases started to increase in the U.S. and elsewhere outside Brazil.  A lot of the overestimation of the danger was simply due to errors.  The British Medical Journal The Lancet published an article showing that the original criteria used by the Brazilian Ministry of Health to define microcephaly was basically wrong . Initially Brazil ignored the gestational age and sex of the infants to estimate over 600,000 annual cases of microcephaly.  Using InterGrowth criteria  instead reduced the number of suspected cases by 99%.  InterGrowth is consistent with the World Health Organization global standards and when applied showed that Brazil was reporting 99 normal babies as microcephaly cases for every actual case.  An M.D. studying the numbers suggests four other explanations why microcephaly seemed to be such a big problem in Brazil but nearly undetected elsewhere.  The scientific community generally agrees that microcephaly is extremely rare whether Zika is present or not.  The very small number of cases is one of the factors making it difficult to estimate  real risks.  Another Possibility  Another possible culprit has been suggested by a group of doctors and researchers.  Pyriproxyfen is a juvenile hormone analog that prevents mosquito larvae from developing normally.  Pyriproxyfen is a hormonal growth inhibitor which has been widely used as a pesticide in Brazil  Around the time that Zika started to become a problem in Brazil the government initiated a widespread eradication campaign adding pyriproxyfen to drinking water supplies.  In the opinion of the doctors “Malformations detected in thousands of children from pregnant women living in areas where the Brazilian state added Pyriproxyfen to drinking water are not a coincidence, even though the Ministry of Health places a direct blame on the Zika virus for this damage.”  The ministry of health has responded by pointing to one area where Pyriproxyfen was used but no microcephaly was found.  Although Zika was confirmed as one cause of microcephaly in April of 2016 Pyriproxyfen has not been ruled out as a possible contributor to the elevated number of cases in Brazil or elsewhere.

March 10, 2017  Costa Rica is well known for its magnificent nature, epic waterfalls, exotic animals, paradise beaches, and much more! However, the word “Zika” buzzed all over various media outlets and the internet for months creating worry for travelers who wished to head to this remarkable country for a much needed vacation or extended stay. Coverage and panic over the virus seemed to spread like wildfire throughout the United States but all seemed pretty quiet and calm down here in Costa Rica! As a currently 8 month pregnant expat, who has lived here for over a year and half now, I was getting many questions from friends and potential visitors about the prevalence of the virus down here. Educating yourself on the facts of the virus along with ways that you can protect yourself often can help provide the answer if you are wondering if you should stay clear of Costa Rica because of the Zika virus .  Before deciding to postpone your trip, it may help to look at the facts of the Zika virus.    1. This is Not a New Virus!  Zika has been around for at least 70 years that we know of! This particular virus is a mosquito born virus that can be found in the Americas along with dengue , chikungunya , malaria , and yellow fever . It is uniquely different from other mosquito born viruses in that it can be transmitted sexually. If using the correct precautions to protect yourself from the virus as you would with other diseases that can also be transmitted this way, you can significantly reduce your risk and worry.    2. The Symptoms are Extremely Mild  The symptoms of Zika can hardly compare to what goes around doing flu season in the North Americas! Most who contract this virus are not aware of it and do not fall ill. The most common symptom of this virus is, none! If any symptoms are displayed, they include a headache, slight fever, possible rash, and joint pain. These may only last for the duration of a few days to a week.    3. There is No Real Danger to the Average Traveler  This virus poses no real threat or danger to a typical healthy traveler. Due to its zero to extremely mild side effects, travelers do not need to feel urged to change their plans. Individuals have traveled throughout the Americas for countless years while taking precautions to malaria, dengue, and chikungunya, which have also existed in these areas. The biggest danger that Zika poses is to pregnant women or those who wish to become pregnant. In this case, it is always urged to speak with a doctor, view CDC recommendations , and make your own decision on what you feel is best.  (As a side note! I have been living in Costa Rica throughout the entire duration of my pregnancy since August  2016 and I am expecting a healthy baby in May!)    *How to Proactively Protect Yourself  If you’re still nervous about traveling to Costa Rica or another area that has reported cases of Zika, (which is almost all of the Americas now) there are tons of ways that you can be proactive and drastically reduce your risk of getting the virus!   Bring EPA registered insect repellent  Cover exposed skin  Sleep in rooms with screens or windows  Use condoms as contraceptive protection  Hang a mosquito net over sleeping area if no screens available or if sleeping outside  Visit Costa Rica during dry seasons   Pacific: Early January - late April  Caribbean: Late September - early November       Talk of the virus has seemed to have left the media in the more recent months and more travelers are taking the time to look at the facts and still enjoy short or lengthy vacations to these areas. Don’t allow media hype to cause you to miss out on a vacation, yoga retreat, or grand adventure to Costa Rica!  A part of being a smart traveler is doing your own research and taking all necessary precautions you see fit. Look at the facts and bring your repellent! Costa Rica is NOT a country you want to miss out on visiting!  Pura Vida!

Take meticulous anti-mosquito bite measures during the daytime. Pregnant travellers should postpone travel to this country. For the latest information on Zika virus outbreaks please go to: ProMED-mail. Zika virus (02): Americas, Europe, research, observations. ProMED-mail 2018; January 16: 20180116.5563987. < ProMED-mail > . Accessed on January 17, 2018. Description  Zika Virus infection is caused by the Zika Virus (ZIKV) belonging to the Flaviviridae family. The virus is primarily transmitted by infected daytime biting female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes which are typically active from dawn to dusk. There is evidence that Zika Virus is also transmitted by other mosquitoes belonging to the Aedes genus. The virus can be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Human transmission can also occur through unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex. In some patients, researchers have found that the virus can be shed through saliva and urine. Risk Zika Virus is present in Mexico, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, tropical areas of Southeast Asia, Oceania, and parts of Africa. All travellers are at risk. Long-term travellers and aid or missionary workers going to areas where Zika Virus is endemic are at greater risk. Information about the virus is continuously evolving. However, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika Virus causes neurological complications: Guillain-Barré syndrome (progressive muscle weakness that can lead to temporary paralysis) and microcephaly (decreased head size which may lead to developmental delays) in infants born to pregnant women infected with the virus. Symptoms In the majority of cases, Zika Virus infection is asymptomatic – persons do not exhibit symptoms. Those with symptoms usually get ill 3-12 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms include mild fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, and general malaise. The illness is characterized by pink eye (inflammation of the conjunctiva), a skin rash with red spots on the face, neck, trunk, and upper arms which can spread to the palms or soles, and sensitivity to light. Some may also have a lack of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, and dizziness. Most people fully recover from the illness within 7 days. Treatment includes supportive care of symptoms. There is no antiviral treatment available. The Zika Virus is related to Dengue , Yellow Fever , West Nile Virus , and Japanese Encephalitis . It may be misdiagnosed for Dengue and Chikungunya . Prevention Travellers going to areas with Zika Virus should take meticulous measures to prevent mosquito bites during the daytime. There is currently no preventive medication or vaccine against Zika Virus.  Use a repellent containing 20%-30% DEET or 20% Picaridin on exposed skin. Re-apply according to manufacturer's directions.  Wear neutral-coloured (beige, light grey) clothing. If possible, wear long-sleeved, breathable garments.  If available, pre-soak or spray outer layer clothing and gear with permethrin.  Get rid of water containers around dwellings and ensure that door and window screens work properly.  Apply sunscreen first followed by the repellent (preferably 20 minutes later).  More details on insect bite prevention .     Pregnancy and Zika Virus  Travellers who are pregnant or considering pregnancy should postpone travel to areas with Zika Virus transmission.  To avoid sexual transmission of the virus to a pregnant partner , travellers who have been in areas with risk of Zika Virus transmission should practice safe sex for the duration of the pregnancy.  All travellers, particularly partners considering pregnancy , should practice safe sex or abstinence for at least 6 months if one or both partners have travelled to an area with risk of Zika Virus transmission. Practicing safe sex is recommended even if you or your partner do not have symptoms. Most Zika Virus infections are asymptomatic (show no signs or symptoms), but transmission of the virus to another person can still occur.  If you travel to or live in an area with risk of Zika virus transmission, follow meticulous mosquito bite prevention measures during the daytime.

Should you be worred about the Zika Virus?  The ZIKA VIRUS IS SCARY because it targets the most vulnerable among us — its sudden, rapid spread across the Americas would not have been recognized by the general public had it not been linked to birth defects like microcephaly in unborn babies.  Because of this horrific side effect to the otherwise fairly mild virus, travelers have good reason to be concerned when they travel. But a lot of the panic has been unnecessary, and often, the true risk of Zika has been overstated. To try and fight panic and inform travelers, we’ve created this resource page to try and break everything down for you.  The Zika Virus in Costa Rica  What is the current situation? The Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud) Epidemiological Bulletin No. 40-2016 on Zika, Chikungunya and Dengue ( November 30, 2016 ), there are 1,518 confirmed cases of Zika (534 men / 984 women), the majority of cases (208) in the Punaternas canton (county). Click here for the Salud bulletins.       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Costa Rica says mosquitoes that spread Zika usually do not live at elevations above 6,500 feet (2,000 metres) because of environmental conditions. Travelers whose itineraries are limited to areas above this elevation are at minimal risk of getting Zika from a mosquito.  The following map shows areas of Costa Rica above and below 6,500 feet.     The following is a great resource article from the Matador Network . A great read.  What is Zika?  Zika is a mosquito-borne virus that is related to dengue, West Nile, and yellow fever. The virus was first discovered in the Ugandan Zika forest in the late 1940’s, and for about 60 years, it remained in the equatorial regions of Africa in Asia. In 2007, it started spreading across the Pacific Islands, and in April 2015, it had its first outbreak in Brazil. Shortly after this outbreak, public health experts noticed a rise in cases of microcephaly (a birth defect which can results in an underdeveloped brain) among newborns and a rise in cases Guillain–Barré syndrome (an immune disorder) in adults in the areas most affected by Zika. Further research was done, and in 2016, Zika was definitively linked to both of these conditions.   What are the symptoms?  For most people, Zika is not a very severe illness. That is why, in fact, it hadn’t been extensively researched prior to 2016: it was not considered a severe enough illness to merit attention when other much more severe mosquito-borne diseases, like malaria, yellow fever, and dengue, where out in the world.  Only one in five people who get Zika will develop symptoms. Those symptoms aren’t particularly pleasant — they include fever, rash, headaches, joint pain, muscle pain, and red eyes.  Zika’s scariest aspect is that it may be linked to microcephaly in babies. Microcephaly is abnormal brain development that can cause a disproportionately small head in the child, which may, in some circumstances, lead to death. There is also growing evidence of what’s being called Congenital Zika Syndrome, which is a pattern of certain other birth defects in children exposed to Zika in the womb. These birth defects include, according to the CDC :    Severe microcephaly where the skull has partially collapsed  Decreased brain tissue with a specific pattern of brain damage  Damage to the back of the eye  Joints with limited range of motion, such as clubfoot  Too much muscle tone restricting body movement soon after birth    A small percentage of adults who get infected with Zika may develop Guillain-Barré syndrome, or GBS. This is a rare condition where the immune system attacks the nervous system, causing weakness and sometimes paralysis. Most people fully recover from GBS, and few ever die. Usually, it lasts for a few weeks to a few months. The CDC has not discovered a direct link between Zika and GBS, but it does say they are strongly associated.  Who should be worried?  The largest danger is to pregnant women, and as such, if you are pregnant or are trying to become pregnant, then you should avoid going to the countries or areas where Zika outbreaks are currently occurring. Because the virus is mosquito-borne, the level at which it spreads depends heavily on the seasons. So while it will likely spread further north into the United States at some point, it will be likely to naturally spread during the summer months.  The virus is still mostly transmitted through mosquitoes, but it can also be sexually transmitted. If a man were to get Zika and then have unprotected sex with a pregnant woman in a Zika-free country, he could pass it to her and infect the baby.  Should I change my travel plans?  If you are pregnant (or are trying to get pregnant) and are planning on traveling to those countries, the safest option is probably to cancel your plans. If the travel is unavoidable, or if you live in a place where the outbreak is happening, don’t panic: just try to avoid mosquito bites, and remember that Zika may be linked to microcephaly: it is not an inevitability. The CDC is simply advocating caution, certainly not panic.  If you are a woman, are not pregnant, and you get Zika, don’t worry: the virus typically leaves the system after a week, meaning it won’t infect future babies you may have.  If you are a man and are trying to get pregnant with a partner, or if you are a woman who is trying to get pregnant, you can still travel to a country with Zika, but you should take precautions to avoid infection (we’ll discuss those below), and you should put off trying to get pregnant for a period of time. Here’s what the CDC suggests:   If you are a woman:   If exposed to Zika through travel to an area with Zika, or sex with someone who has traveled to an area with Zika, wait 8 weeks after exposure to start trying to get pregnant.  If positively diagnosed with Zika, wait 8 weeks after symptoms start.    If you are a man:   If exposed to Zika through travel to an area with Zika, or sex with someone who has traveled to an area with Zika, wait 6 months after exposure to start trying to get pregnant. This extra time is because Zika can last longer in semen than it can in the rest of the body.  If positively diagnosed with Zika, wait 6 months after exposure to start trying to get pregnant.     If you went to an area with Zika and experience no symptoms for a few weeks after the trip, there’s an okay chance you never contracted Zika. That said, most people who get Zika do not experience symptoms. And as of yet, the only tests for the virus are positive tests — meaning that they can prove that you have it. There are no tests that can prove that you don’t have it. So while you likely don’t, there is no way to prove it.  It’s also worth pointing out that scientists are not yet sure what percentage of infected newborns develop microcephaly — current ranges estimate between 1 and 13 percent of fetuses exposed in the first trimester will develop microcephaly. But we’re not sure yet.  Ultimately, if you’re trying to get pregnant and want to travel to (or possibly live in) an area with Zika, you should talk to your doctor. If you are not trying to get pregnant, travel away — just protect yourself against mosquito bites and practice safe sex or abstinence.  What should travelers do to avoid Zika  Since Zika is mosquito-borne, prevention largely comes down to avoiding mosquito bites. The mosquito that carries Zika is the female Aedes Aegypti , and it is most active during the day. This means that mosquito nets are less effective than they are with diseases like malaria, which are carried by more nocturnally active mosquitoes. This isn’t to say that if you have a mosquito net that you shouldn’t use it: it’s just to say you should take further steps as well. Those steps are:   Wear long sleeve shirts and pants, preferably made of thick material.  Use mosquito repellent that contains deet.  Stay indoors as much as possible.   There is, as yet, no vaccine against Zika. Doctors have developed successful vaccines for similar diseases in the past, but vaccines take a long time to develop. If you do get Zika, there’s also no medicine for treatment. Doctors suggest getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and taking acetominophen or paracetomol (NOT aspirin) for any aches, pains, or fevers. Most importantly, if you do get it, make sure you still work to prevent further mosquito bites. If you get bitten while infected, the mosquito can then infect others.  A second precaution, if you’ve traveled to Zika-prone countries, is to practice safe sex. Men, this does not fall exclusively on women: It lasts far longer in male semen (up to 6 months) than it does in a woman’s body, and it’s much easier to transmit from male-to-female than it is female-to-male. So this responsibility should fall on men, to a large extent.  An important note  Most travel insurance policies will not cover cancellations for Zika . As such, if you’re worried you’ll need to cancel your trip, you may want to spring for Cancel for Any Reason travel insurance. It’s a bit more expensive, but may be worth it in this case.  For a while, several airlines were offering refunds for travel that had to be canceled because of the virus. The deadlines for these have passed for the most part, but it may be worth checking the airline’s cancellation policies prior to booking.  Where is Zika?  At this point, Zika can be found through a lot of the world. Here’s where you need to be careful.  It’s important to note that the vast majority of the cases shown on this map were cases resulting from travel , not from local transmission. As of November 30, 2016, 185 cases have been transmitted locally in the United States. 184 have been in Florida , and most of these in Southern Florida. The CDC suggests pregnant women do not travel to Miami Beach . Cases in the United States. Via The CDC  Worldwide      Countries with active Zika transmission. Via the CDC.   This is obviously not a very specific map — Alaska, for example, while part of the US, does not have active mosquito transmission. The same is true for many other countries. The CDC suggests pregnant women not travel to any active transmission zones. They have a specific country-by-country guide here .  Resources  Here are some useful sites, if you’d like to know more:   The Center for Disease Control’s Zika resource page.  Short Answers to Hard Questions About Zika Virus from the New York Times.

Re: Zika virus threat in Costa Rica?   Jan 17, 2016, 4:15 AM      Dengue, Chikungunya & Zika Viruses Increasing in Costa Rica   Costa Rica News Uncategorized2015/12/02   Costa Rica News – Puntarenas and Guanacaste are suffering a significant increase in dengue and chikungunya patients.          dengue mosquitoBoth of those viruses, as well as the Zika virus, are transmitted by the same type of mosquitos.     The growth in dengue cases in Puntarenas has been tracked since mid-September, when the cases nearly doubled from one week to the next, going from 60 to 108. In Guanacaste, the patients increased from 81 to 147 in July. The total number of dengue cases in the country is 12,496. This is a 12% increase over last year.     Chikungunya arrived in mid-May of 2014 and had a sharp rise in the end of that year. In the two weeks ending on November 14th the chikungunya figures increased sevenfold. There are 3,020 patients this year, a 2,000% increase over 2014.     The Ministry of Health expects that, because of the cyclical nature of the diseases, there will be an epidemic in 2016.     As always, take care to eliminate mosquito breeding sites, those which are dark or where water accumulates.

Our situation is a bit more immediate, as well leave in 2 weeks and my gf will be 5 and a half months pregnant, really stressful, as one of our accommodations has a no refund policy if we don't cancel by next Saturday. I'll check with my travel insurance at work to see if they would cover the cost of our flights if we cancel but I assume that until Costa Rica specified on the CDC list of countries that there is nothing we can do.

Re: Zika virus threat in Costa Rica?   Jan 17, 2016, 7:06 PM      Hi,This is a post to Estella C. I am an Ob/Gyn in the US. Your post is very helpful. The increase in the mosquito-born diseases that are carried by the same breed of mosquito that carry the Zika virus is very worrisome. My question is about the tracking of the Zika Virus. Do you feel it may be underreported since it is my understanding that the symptoms (more flu-like) are so much less severe than those of the other viruses? I will follow the CDC reccomendations at this point, but discuss the risk of having a severely neurologically impaired, microcephalic child.

Here, the latest reports and travel recommendations.   By Lauren Mazzo  |  Jun 15, 2017 Topics: women's health conditions , cdc      It's been almost a year since the height of the Zika frenzy—the number of cases was skyrocketing, the list of ways the virus could spread was growing, and the possible health effects were getting scarier and scarier. And this was all just before the summer Olympics in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, a hot spot for Zika-carrying mosquitoes. (Obv, inducing panic for some Olympians, who decided to skip the Games altogether in the name of staying safe.) The Bad News: Zika-Related Birth Defects A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that 5 percent of women in U.S. territories who had a confirmed Zika virus infection during their pregnancy had a baby or fetus with Zika-related defects. These include microcephaly (an abnormally small head), brain and eye damage, restricted movement due to abnormal muscle or joint growth, and a rare nervous system disease called Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). As of late May 2017, the current count of pregnant women with Zika in U.S. territories reached 3,916, and there were 72 infants born with Zika-related birth defects from the 1,579 completed pregnancies. Women infected during their first trimester had the greatest risk—1 in 12—of their fetus or baby having Zika-associated defects. According to the CDC's report, about 8 percent of first-trimester infections, 5 percent of second-trimester infections, and 4 percent of third-trimester infections resulted in Zika-associated defects. The Good News: Current Zika Alert Level The epidemic may be officially on its way out. Puerto Rico's governor announced recently that the Zika virus epidemic is officially over for the island, according to Reuters . Though Puerto Rico has had more than 40K outbreaks in total, there have only been 10 newly reported cases since the end of April. That doesn't mean Zika has magically disappeared from PR, though. The CDC still recommends a Level 2 yellow "cautionary" travel alert for the area and that people "practice enhanced precautions." Also, the Level 2 travel warnings for Brazil and the Miami area have officially been lifted, meaning that, while sporadic cases may still occur, the risk of transmission is likely relatively low. But don't get your luggage out quite yet. The CDC still considers many other countries to pose a Level 2 travel risk, including Mexico, Argentina, Barbados, Aruba, Costa Rica, and many more countries in the Caribbean, South and Central America, Asia, and Africa. Brownsville, TX, a town right by the Mexican border, is the only area in the U.S. that still has a Level 2 warning. (View the full list of CDC Zika travel recommendations and alerts right here , plus guidance on safe Zika practices in Level 2 areas and areas where Level 2 designations have been lifted .) What That Means About Your Zika Risk You can take a deep breath. We're no longer in the midst of crazy Zika panic. However, the virus isn't totally wiped out, so you should still take precautions—and especially if you're pregnant. First, brush up on these need-to-know Zika virus facts . A lot more is understood about the virus now than when it first popped up, including the fact that it can be spread as an STD , can live in your eyes , and may even have detrimental effects on the adult brain . If you're traveling to a country that still has a Level 2 warning or where one was recently lifted, you should still be taking care to prevent mosquito bites and practice safe sex . (Which you should be doing anyway, TBH.)
