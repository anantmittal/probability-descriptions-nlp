Musicaldudepeter Profile  Broadway Star joined:3/18/10  Broadway Star joined: 3/18/10      CAREER ADVICE REQUIRED! - Is Broadway just a pipe dream?? #1 Posted: 2/5/11 at 11:14pm   Im from Ireland and am trying to do some community theatre while Im in college. I hope to study acting at a drama college in the next few years, because I want to be actor-who-sings, and do plays/musicals. I aspire to be on the Broadway stage. I have the burning desire; the passion. But then I think to myself  Whats the point?  I mean really, so many people like me  millions, have tried and probably failed  where are the other Irish people like me with dreams who have ended up on the West End or Broadway stage and have stayed there?  Is there any point to keep this dream?  I mean, I dont even want to tour with a show from this country that may play Broadway and then just come back home and forget about that experience, etc I have been getting proper, professional singing training from a young age, and want to continue doing so, and I want to get proper training in acting too. Technique and training is very important to me, and as I said I have the passion as well.  Does anyone understand where Im coming from?  What should I do? Is this purely a pipe dream??   tazber Profile  Broadway Legend joined:5/10/05  Broadway Legend joined: 5/10/05      CAREER ADVICE REQUIRED! - Is Broadway just a pipe dream?? #2 Posted: 2/5/11 at 11:26pm   If your dream is to be on Broadway then yes, the odds are that it won't come true.

Most actors don't make it to Broadway, and those that do usually do so only once or twice during the course of a lifelong career. When entering the business, one's goal should be simply to make a living, with Broadway as a "wouldn't that be nice" sort of secondary goal.

Don't expect it. Hope for it.  Don't beat yourself up over factors that you can't control. At the end of the day, be satisfied that you did all you could do.  "The Spectacle has, indeed, an emotional attraction of its own, but, of all the parts, it is the least artistic, and connected least with the art of poetry. For the power of Tragedy, we may be sure, is felt even apart from representation and actors. Besides, the production of spectacular effects depends more on the art of the stage machinist than on that of the poet." --Aristotle ACL2006 Profile  Broadway Legend joined:2/11/06  Broadway Legend joined: 2/11/06      CAREER ADVICE REQUIRED! - Is Broadway just a pipe dream?? #4 Posted: 2/6/11 at 12:16am   It's a nice dream to get going for.

(No matter which medium in which you hope to work.) It's got to be the work that you love, not the possible stardom.  At some point in your journey, others will start asking you if it's time to "try something else" or "move on" or even time to "get your head out of the clouds". Only YOU can decide you've tried long enough. Some people can hold on for many years, waiting and trying. Others much less. YOU will know when it's the right time to give up (if it comes to that.)  Dream big, live realistically.   If we're not having fun, then why are we doing it?

But then I saw too many times exactly what people can lose - I've seen many wonderful young people, with terrific optimism and joy and positive energy, become dark, depressed, and bitter, because they felt that they had failed.  Now I say - if you can think of anything else at all that would make you happy, do that. The chances are astronomically against you that you'll even be able to make a modest living at performing - even that modest achievement is reached by only a tiny fraction of those who try to make it.  The Disney philosophy, while charming, has done a great disservice to multitudes.

It's rejection after rejection after rejection. Acting makes you feel like you're going to trip. It's a trip in which you're going to be humiliated, get your feelings hurt, mocked, made fun of. People are going to trample on your feelings and they are going to reject you. Unless you have rhinoceros skin, it's a kind of business that can crush the life out of you. You have to be very, very tough.  I also don't think that actors have the best seat at the table. If you really want to have the power, you have to be a huge star and then you see what happens. They go into producing, directing, they open their own production companies, because that's where the power is. Long after your smile, your million dollar looks, and beautiful voice have faded, you keep a place at the table because of the other things you bring to your worknot the acting, the other auxiliary stuff. If you're clever enough, or talented enough I should say, to be a writer, or a director or producer, any of those things, you are set for life. But if you have to keep auditioning for your work, day after day, week after week, your whole life through, you're always in line for a job or never assured. Unless you're in a repertory company, which these days is very rare, you're never assured for work. You're always pushing. Imagine if someone was working in a business, an office, a factory, anywhere, having to audition for their job every week; having to go to a new boss every week, sit down, and tell them their capabilities and qualifications for their work. It's soul destroying.  I don't say things that young actors want to hear, because I'm telling them the truth about how damn hard it is to get ahead in the business. But you know something? If they are so powerfully motivated, they do it anyway. If people are burning with that hot flame to be actors, I think that's great. But I also say don't be just an actor. You've got the talent to make your mark as an actor, that's great, look at the other actors around you who did lots of other things as well as acting. You will see that that's a way to choreograph your life, so that you're not just acting. You have other quivers to your bow, more bullets in your gun, to keep you going when the acting jobs start to dry up."  "There is no problem so big that it cannot be run away from."

Schulz hmpeterson  Featured Actor joined:6/19/08  Featured Actor joined: 6/19/08      CAREER ADVICE REQUIRED! - Is Broadway just a pipe dream?? #18 Posted: 2/8/11 at 6:59pm   Your best bet is to go on American Idol or become a pop/rock star. Seriously. Look who is making it to Broadway...Constantine Maroulis, Ace Young, Tamyra Gray, Diana DeGarmo, Melissa Etheridge. Even Billie Joe Armstrong is on Broadway!! Granted that's a little different considering the show. But still.  Unfortunately it seems like Broadway would rather have "name" people these days to sell shows which give the hard working theater actor and even bigger disadvantage.  In all seriousness, I've always been a person to say, if you have a dream and you think you have the talent, the guts, and the drive...go for it! You will never know unless you try. Wouldn't you rather have someone tell you no 20 times then possibly never know if you could have gotten a yes?

In reality, even most of the top 2% of people are fortunate to be employed on Broadway half the time.  It's actually kind of funny--I went to one of the top high schools for performing talent in the state (a regular, public high school, but we were consistently nominated for/won awards at the state-wide theater awards). All the consistent leads in the shows realized it was just a fun hobby, went on to college for science, law, and economics, and they are now making successful livings as engineers, bankers, consultants, and lawyers. The chorus members, who didn't get the leads, all majored in musical theater or acting, and are all now working hourly, repetitive jobs, with the occasional Disney cruise ship for the lucky ones. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with a service-based hourly job, but most of these people are either longing for college where they were guaranteed a part in every show and/or wishing they had focused on a career and continued with theater as a hobby that might work out if they were lucky.  So I guess my moral/advice is contain your expectations, use your drive to make yourself better, but always see a professional performance career as a lucky, fortunate outcome, not the end-all goal. You may decrease your chances of success slightly by hedging your bets and focusing on a career as well instead of throwing yourself 100% into theater, but on average you will be much happier.

If in five years she was able to sustain herself as an actress, meaning acting provided her primary source of income, then she would feel as if she had made it. If not she would have thrown in the towel and moved on with her life.  And may I add thank god she achieved that (and more). It would be hard to imagine what life would be like without her making us laugh.

However, as I look at all the audition requirements I noticed that a dance section is part of the audition.  I have been doing theater for five years now and have never claimed to be a dancer. I have never taken dance classes and my only dance experience is from musicals and showchoir. I am just worried that my lack of dance experience will hurt my chances of acceptance into these programs. How much do schools take the dance portion into account? What kind of dancing do auditions consist of? What level of difficulty would the dancing be? Do I even have a shot of getting accepted with my lack of dance experience?  Without the dance portion I'd say I would have an excellent chance of being accepted into many of the programs I'm applying to, but the dance audition has me worried. Any answers you could provide to these questions, or any advice you could give would be most appreciated.  Thanks, Jason  "I seem to have wandered into the BRAIN load-out thread...

The only really tough college audition I had was for FSU, which had a complete ballet combination as the dance section. I would suggest to start taking dance lessons as soon as you can because it can only make you more marketable in the future. Best of luck!   iluvtheatertrash  Broadway Legend joined:11/9/04  Broadway Legend joined: 11/9/04      re: Question about Musical Theater Major #2 Posted: 5/14/05 at 2:04pm   I've been through the process twice.  A lot of times, the dance audition is actually just PLACEMENT. If you're accepted to the school, the dance audition is good for them to figure out what dance class you'll belong in. Beginner, Advanced, etc.  "I know now that theatre saved my life." - Susan Stroman dry2olives Profile  Broadway Star joined:9/30/03  Broadway Star joined: 9/30/03      re: Question about Musical Theater Major #3 Posted: 5/14/05 at 2:05pm   Just a guess, but I would think that any school with a musical theatre program would take into consideration that reletively few students will be equally skilled at acting, singing and dancing. They probably get quite a few dancers who don't sing well and good singers and dancers who need improvement with their acting. It's always a good idea for a singing actor to have some basic dance knowledge, but I wouldn't worry about being rejected solely on the basis of not being a good dancer.

It is very helpful to actually hear from people who have already been through the entire audition process.

CCM you must dance. NYU (Cap 21) you must dance. U of Michigan you must dance. They will not consider you without a dance audition.    Ignorance is temporary. Stupidity last forever.

They know that people are at all sorts of levels of dancing talent. Blow them away with your vocal and acting talents and it won't be too much of a problem. Although looking into taking some basic movement classes before your audition might not be a bad idea. :) Good luck!  Come see "Travis Tanner"!! This year at Fringe NYC 2005! :)

The want you to show a strong suit in either Singing, Acting, or Dancing, and talent-though not necessarily A LOT--in the other.  Which is funny cuz my singing audition was good, my acting mediocre and my dancing horrible and the still took me!

It's harder when you have to learn the steps and the combination at the same time, so taking a class to learn the steps will help you. You'll probably one need just the one class too, you don't necessarily need years of dance lessons......

Not to mention, you will be a lot more marketable if you can dance, sing, and act.

(Except me). I was so lost for that portion of the audition and they rejected me, telling me to go get more dance training. I say if you have time before your audition, go sign up for some dance classes just so you can get a bit of practice beforehand. I was simply not ready for it.

Carnegie Mellon, on the other hand, gave me the impression their dance auditions were tough and they were part of acceptance to the program, not just for placement.

Tisch does not require a dance audition as part of its artistic review process. If you're an experienced dancer, you can schedule your audition with the advanced dance included but otherwise there's no dance in the audition, just monologues and songs. And as others have said, as a male, you have a definite advantage. Good luck!     « Back to the Message Board        Hot Stories      Review Roundup: Did the Critics Think MEAN GIRLS Was Fetch?

Lost every day for Hamilton since Feb day 1; recently stopped due to being too busy to remember to check personal email at 4pm every day. Took me forever to win American In Paris and unfortunately not before Robbie left. Won On Your Feet! in Jan (first or second try?) but was in a meeting and couldn't pay in time. Lost a couple of times after that -- lost interest. Never tried for Aladdin/Wicked/Lion King -- no interest in seeing again.  Haven't tried Cats yet. In general, winning for me seems to come in streaks as well, cross-platform (like I might win a combo of Jujamcyn, Telecharge, and TodayTix in the same month, then total dry spell for months). I typically either win within 3 tries, or it takes several weeks/months of entering every day to win (or locked out completely, show closes). So I'm surprised when people complain they've "entered 5 times already and lost." I gotta roll my eyes so hard. It's why it's called a lottery...

I won for Cats about two weeks back, and I've even gotten into Hamilton. However, to echo a sentiment that I'm seeing throughout this thread, I have that one lottery that I just can't seem to win. I've been entering Something Rotten 's drawing on and off since last summer, and I am just having no luck with it.

Like for "Hamilton", there are 21 tickets. Does the system go through all of the entries and fill in if needed (say, there were 9 pairs and 3 singles)? Or does it do pairs first and then a single for the last spot, which in that case, singles are at a disadvantage?  I remember for TodayTix, when I won lotto for a show a while ago, they actually called me to confirm how many tickets I wanted (I could keep the two or go down to a single). I don't know if they do that anymore, though.   slumdogdelaware Profile  Leading Actor joined:1/7/16  Leading Actor joined: 1/7/16      Broadway Direct Lotteries #24 Posted: 8/10/16 at 4:58pm   I always do 1 because a.) I hate winning a lotto and then the other person bails, and b.) if there is an algorithm, a person asking for 1 ticket has a better chance at being selected than 2. For example, if the theatre has an odd number of available seats for the lotto, then you're more likely to win since it'll skip over anyone asking for 2 when it comes to it.

It could mean you are in an ensemble role, it could mean you have a supporting role, it could mean you got a lead, or it could mean you didn't get cast at all. You can never read too much into these things, it'll only stress you out and make the wait for the cast list more difficult.   haterobics Profile  Broadway Legend joined:3/29/14  Broadway Legend joined: 3/29/14      What do callbacks mean? #4 Posted: 11/7/15 at 11:31pm   But after a while I caught on...

It could mean many things, but it most likely  means you are no luck get being considered for major roles.  You might have been placed in a smaller role, chorus, or not cast.  Feeling confident in your audition is great, but you might not be what they are looking for for any variety of reasons.  MY callbacks are usually about being "good enough", but determining if one is RIGHT enough.  I have never cast a MAJOR role to someone that did not get a call back... even if I'm fairly certain on a part....they also need to be seen with other actors to be sure the fit is right.   If we're not having fun, then why are we doing it?

"  Way back when I was in High School I had done professional regional and stock shows and was always under the impression that if you didn't get a callback you weren't cast in the show at all. Whether it was for a lead or chorus and when doing school shows I assumed it was the same.  I had a pretty big ego being young and naive and My freshman and Sophomore year in HS I was cast as pretty major supporting characters in my school show. Being a [male] dancer though, I knew I would always get a dance role even if I fought for or was right for a lead. So when my junior year rolled around and my school was doing a big dance heavy show I assumed I would absolutely get the role I wanted and had practiced the song for callbacks for weeks before the audition. The callback list came out and my name wasn't on the list at all and I was devastated, pissed, and stunned.  I stayed at school the day off callbacks and as soon as they ended I went and talked to the director and music director to calmly and nicely ask why I wasn't called back. Turns out they didn't call me back because they figured they were just going to offer me that role and didn't need to see me at callbacks. However, during the callback process they realized there was a senior they could use in that role and it didn't have to be a dance heavy role and another  supporting character needed to be a dancer. So they offered him the role and gave me the other role..... The show was 42nd street and the role I wanted was Billy, but ended up getting Andy the choreographer.  I guess my point is that sometimes you can be considered the right person for a role and the creative team decide they don't need to see you at callbacks. But in my case, not getting the callback didn't allow me the chance to read and sing for the role and prove I was the right person. If they had called me back and I still was offered Andy-- that is another story. Or even if they chose to lie to me and tell me they already knew I was going to be cast as Andy I would have accepted that.  So it does happen..... However, as a director even if I think I know who is going to be a specific role and that I don't need callbacks for that person, I absolutely will still call them back because of that experience in HS.

I have a really important audition coming up. It's an EPA. I'm currently non-union but I have been waiting forever for this show to hold auditions. I've been the lead in non-professional productions of this particular show twice, and I have the experience and the familiarity with this show to really give this one hell of a shot. On the other hand, I know how EPAs work, and I am bracing myself for disappointment. I know my chances of even being seen are very slim since I am currently non-union, and will be auditioning as a future member.  Has anyone done this before? Any tips or tricks to get them to look at my resume' and notice that I've got the chops they need? Any advice? Aside from 'get there early and look great'. Any tips you have are so appreciated. Thanks!  temms  Broadway Star joined:7/21/04  Broadway Star joined: 7/21/04      Non-Union Attending a Union Audition #2 Posted: 6/28/12 at 1:47pm   EPAs are a total crapshoot turnout-wise. If it's for a Broadway production and this is the first round, odds are they will be pretty full. If it's a required call or something that's not directly going to Broadway, it may be very light. But you honestly never know. I've done EPAs that were wall-to-wall people from start to finish and I've done others where we'd see three or four people an hour and just sit around reading the rest of the time. Lots of non-eqs get seen on those days.  There's nothing wrong with highlighting the productions of the show you've done on your resume, so the casting folk will notice. But that's all I'd do. Just have your resume exactly as it is, and literally just use a highlighter to highlight the title of the show and the role to make sure they see you've done it. That's it, just very simple, and it's not a bad idea at all. I see people underline or highlight specific things on resumes all the time if it's relevant to that specific show.  So give it a try. Once you're in front of the casting director, whether you're union or non-union, done the show before or not, none of it matters. It's all about what you do in the room. The biggest mistake auditioners make is that they push too hard and they bring their stress and desperation into the room with them. The casting people just want to see you perform and connect to your material.  Break a leg.

The tip about the highlighting on the resume' was great. I'll definitely use that. And thanks for the advice. I only mention my experience with the show because I feel so at ease about this audition--I am feeling pretty confident. I just hope I get the chance to perform in front of them so they can see what I can do. Thanks again for the tips! I appreciate it SO much! :)  dramamama611  Broadway Legend joined:12/4/07  Broadway Legend joined: 12/4/07      Non-Union Attending a Union Audition #3 Posted: 6/29/12 at 11:17am   That is NOT always a selling point. To some directors/casting agents, they might look at that as someone that will come to the role with pre-conceived notions that might not be willing/able to be directed, or be able to grow.  Is there any way to know the difference? Of course not -- and all auditions are a crap shoot.  If we're not having fun, then why are we doing it?

Find the directors phone number. Or email. But phone works best. Do not leave a message. Keep calling til you get him/or her. Also try facebook if the phone doesn't pan out.  Call him up and say "I hate to bother you at home but I have done this show many times non union and I know I would be an assett to your production. Would it be possible to set up an audtion as I am non union.    This is your best shot. It takes guts but what the hell.  A director was once in your shoes. He is your best shot and he can get you on the audition list with a phone call or an email.  You have nothing to lose. You are already not getting seen.  sopranobiz Profile  Stand-by joined:4/13/06  Stand-by joined: 4/13/06      Non-Union Attending a Union Audition #5 Posted: 7/1/12 at 7:34pm   DO NOT take Goldenboy's advice! Please.  I used to intern at a casting office a few years ago and I'd hear stories of people doing stuff like that. Sorry but we'd make fun of crazy actors. NEVER call the office or director.  Leave your headshot at the EPA and hope they are looking. The office I interned for would call non-union actors based on their headshots all the time if they needed to.

I've had remarkable luck as a non-union actor being seen at EPAs and ECCs, and if you don't show up, you definitely won't be seen. The last two ECCs I attended had 50-60 women TOTAL show up. I was one of the last to be seen at the last one, which was a 10am call for ladies, and the monitor and I were on the same elevator out of the building by like 11:30. Apparently a lot of people are out of town for summer stock right now? Or scared away by rain? I don't know, and I don't want to promise you'll be seen, as there's always a chance you won't be, but at the very least, show up.  perfectlymarvelous Profile  Broadway Legend joined:5/21/07  Broadway Legend joined: 5/21/07      Non-Union Attending a Union Audition #9 Posted: 7/2/12 at 2:26am   There's always a chance you won't be seen, but I've had pretty good luck as a non-union actor getting seen at union auditions. Bring your headshot and resume and be prepared to sit there for a while. I've also been to calls where they say they will be seeing non-Eq people but to come back at a certain time (after lunch, for example), so I usually go sit in Starbucks or something when that happens. Also, potentially be prepared to cut your song down...it doesn't always happen but I've been to auditions where they only allow non-union to sing 16 bars when they asked for 32 bars on the breakdown (I've also seen it go down to 8 from there).  And please for the love of god do not take goldenboy's advice.  goldenboy Profile  Broadway Legend joined:7/15/05  Broadway Legend joined: 7/15/05      Non-Union Attending a Union Audition #10 Posted: 7/2/12 at 3:20am   Funny.

Do not call their offices. They are gate keepers. Their job is to only allow in people they know and whose work they know. They are paid to keep the perceived "not talented" out so the directors and producers don't have to waste time seeing the riff raff of talent.  Do try to get seen at the union audition. But if that doesn't work and its a part you know you have done in the past and you know you are right for... what do you have to lose by making a phone call? Or better yet have a manager do it for you? That's a managers job. There is a fine line between being persistent and being annoying. Be careful.  It's the casting assistants job to answer the phone and dissuade you from getting an audition. They pick up the phone and say "casting". Usually they are non working actor or someone who has given up acting who love telling other actors "no." It validates their failure. It's what they experienced so it gives them pleasure to say no to you as well. They will deny this.  They love to say " the role has been cast." "we are not seeing anyone else for this." "we are only seeing people through agents and managers."  As mentioned above by a former intern:they will snigger as you just try to get an audition. Casting offices are alternately wonderful if they are on your side and alternately hard to break into.   It is the casting directors job to get the right actor for the role. By getting seen for something you are right for, you are ultimately helping them out.  Good luck.

In any case, obviously the picture you are painting of a casting office is absolutely, completely wrong.  You have it completely backwards. The casting people are the ones who want to see new people, find new blood, and give as many options to the director as possible. They're the ones who are going to Senior Showcases and Fringe productions and NYMF productions and absolutely every place they can to find new actors. They specialize in being able to see possibilities.  Directors are usually the small-minded ones. If you can't get the casting director interested, odds are you won't get the director interested. Directors are involved in many, many other things beyond the casting of one particular show, so no, they have no desire to hear from an actor who can't get seen by the casting people who just "Knows they're right for it!!!" The whole point of having a casting director is to not have to deal with that.  I'm not saying casting people are cheery rays of sunshine 100% of the time - nobody could sit through endless hours of auditions and still maintain that outlook, but they are the actors' allies. The idea that they're gleefully keeping people out of auditions as payback because they're failed performers themselves is an absolutely ludicrous statement with no basis in any sort of reality.  Just as it is the poor mechanic who blames his tools, it is the actor who is not as good as he/she thinks they are who blames the casting director.  dramamama611  Broadway Legend joined:12/4/07  Broadway Legend joined: 12/4/07      Non-Union Attending a Union Audition #14 Posted: 7/2/12 at 7:36am   Goldenboy sounds like a bitter actor himself.

In that case, call away. Or have your agent/manager let the casting folks know.  You can send a submission to the casting office and write a cover letter mentioning that you've played the role before. And definitely go to the EPA with the role/theatre highlighted.  Goldenboy, no one is sniggering at you unless you sound like a crazy person when you call the office. If they don't know who you are that's one thing, and if they're casting through offers, etc, that's another. People would call my old office all the time and respectfully (and sanely) ask if they could be considered; I would encourage them to send in a formal submission via email or snail mail. Only if someone called repeatedly and sounded delusional did anyone snigger. Then you're fair game.

Seeing as how in your first post you basically advocated stalking the director you really should just stop giving advice now (giving you the benefit of the doubt of not trolling/trying to be facetious).  No director in their right mind is going to want to see an actor who has tracked down their personal info and then is calling incessantly without leaving a message, as you also advised. You're more likely to end up with a restraining order than an audition.  Did you know that every day Mexican gays cross our borders and unplug our brain-dead ladies?

It's a long, hard road to the top! See if you could make it!                                     1   How long have you been performing?        I've LOVED it ALL MY LIFE! (7+ years)      I JUST started... (less than 1 year)      I've been doing it for a while (4-6 years)      I've been doing it for a little, but not seriously (2-3 years)           2   What kind of theatre have you done?        A few plays at a local theatre camp      A couple Christmas pageants, a few school plays...      Off-Broadway, U.S. Tours, Regional theatre      A LOT of community theatre           3   You audition for a local play and you don't make it. How do you react?        I could really care less. I didn't want to try out anyway.      I say, "Ugh!" And then I make an excuse as to why I didn't get the part.      I say, "Oh well, there's always next time," and then I move on.      I SCREAM AND CRY AND FREAK OUT!           4   You get into a play that rehearses for 7 hours 6 days of the week for 12 weeks. How do you feel and what do you do?        I try to push through but I have a little trouble with my stamina.      I complain ALL THE TIME and I don't try hard at all.      I feel full of regret and just AWFUL and I decide to just ditch it. UGH!      I love to perform! I look at the big picture and see how it's all worth it. I power through!           5   What do you want to do when you graduate high school?        NOT become an actor/actress.      Get into a highly respected theatre school, graduate with honors, and star on Broadway.      Get into college and try to get on Broadway      Get an apartment in NYC and START auditioning for Broadway!           6   Your parents tell you that you can't be an actor/actress. How do you react?        I cry. I beg. I argue. I scream. Then I move on.      I show them why acting is worth doing and how they'll regret not letting me act.      I throw a big fit and then try to become a performer just to annoy them.      Whatever. I don't even want to perform anyway.           7   If you could be anything OTHER than an performer, what would you be and why?        NO NO NO! I WILL be a performer! (throws a hysteric fit)      I would be a Broadway director. I would still want to be the center of the Broadway buzz.      I'd be happy with ANYTHING under THOSE circumstances. I hate performing.      I would be a psychologist. That's just my second choice.           8   Which Broadway actress do you most look up to?        Sutton Foster: Pure talent!      Naomi Watts (Wait- she's NOT on Broadway? Huh?)      Jennifer Westfeldt (I personally thought she was GREAT on Broadway)      Nobody. Actresses are BORING           9   Which Broadway actor do you most look up to?        Ramin Karimloo! He's fantastic!      Ooooh! I know! Sam Smith! (What? Was he not on Broadway? Is he even an ACTOR?)      I could SERIOUSLY care less.      Peter Joback... really, really. I am entitled to my opinion.           10   What Broadway CELEB do you most look up to?        Matheew Broadrik (Wait, did I spell it wrong?) Oops! I mean Matthew Brodrick      IDK. What are celebs?      Um, let me think about that...      IDINA MENZEL! BROADWAY'S BIGGEST STAR!           11   Do take acting, singing, or dancing?        No, no, and no.      Yeah, I do! I take chorus at school, I dance a little, and I do theatre camp.      YES! I have been taking acting, voice, and dance lessons all my life!      I sing in the shower, I make faces in the mirror, and I dance in my sleep! Does that count?           12   How do you enter an audition?        I walk in. Duh.      I don't.      I walk in, grin a little, and tell everyone that I'm sick so I can't sing that well.      I enter with a pretty smile and excellent posture!           13   How would you describe yourself in theatre.?        I'm terrified of being on stage, singing a solo, and public speaking. AGH!      I'm very emotional and demonstrative. But I'm not afraid to show off.      I'm SUPER loud and outgoing! I like to overpower EVERYBODY!      I don't like theatre.           14   What do you think is the most important part of theatre?        Showing off and getting lots of attention!      Nothing.      Working hard and being let down. And repeating that over again EVERY DAY.      Sharing your emotions with the audience and doing what I LOVE!:)           15   You just got a phone call that you got on Broadway! How do you react!        I flip out because I DON'T want to be on Broadway!      I scream and then I go and tell EVERYONE!      I scream and laugh and smile and cry tears of pure joy! This is my dream come true!      I get really excited but then start worrying about all the consequences of being on Broadway.

                applying to auditions!    Backstage Guides  How to Get Cast on Broadway  By Casey Mink | Posted Sept. 25, 2017, 10:30 a.m.    Share:                           advice  Backstage Experts  BACKSTAGE GUIDES  Broadway  musical theater  NEW YORK-SPECIFIC  plays      Photo Source: Jesse Balgley   Broadway is an entity, a state of mind, a goal held by so many and attained by so few. Whether you have dreams of seeing your name in lights atop a marquee or inside a Broadway program amongst the names that comprise a robust ensemble, you have a long journey ahead towards the Great White Way. Fortunately, you’ve got a friend in us! From how to obtain your Equity card to the all-important terms and creative forces you need to know, here is the Backstage Guide for how to get cast on Broadway.    What do I need to get started?   Headshot/résumé/reel  Backstage  Branded social media   What should I know about the Actors’ Equity Association?   What is AEA?  Do I have to be an AEA member to perform on Broadway?  How do I become a member?   How do I audition for Broadway?   Equity Principal Auditions  Equity Chorus Calls  Straight offers   Who are the big Broadway casting directors?  What are the different Broadway gigs?   Swing  Standby  Understudy  Ensemble  Principal   What are the actual theaters (and who owns them)?  Do I need an agent?  What terms should I know?  What are the best schools for breeding Broadway talent?  Who are the composers, book writers, and playwrights I need to know today?   What do I need to get started?  The materials you’ll need to get cast on Broadway will probably not be new to you. Still, you know what they say about making assumptions, so we’ll break them down below.  Headshot/résumé/reel: These are the materials that you will, unequivocally, need for every single acting job you want to obtain throughout your career. Check out our headshot archives for everything you need to know about what to wear, how to find a photographer, posing tips, and more.  Next, head over to our résumé section for thorough guidance on formatting, what does and does not belong, special skills, and more.  The only difference in these tools for Broadway is, if you’re hoping to break into the musical realm, your reel will need musical excerpts as well as acting. Here , Backstage Expert Tim Grady advises you on how to “recreate the energy and atmosphere of an actual audition” for your musical-theater reel and here expands on the subject by giving his five most useful pointers for your best MT reel.  Backstage: Many, many Broadway stars used Backstage in the early stages of their careers (and beyond). Rachel Bay Jones , who just won a 2017 Tony Award for her role in “Dear Evan Hansen,” says she “lived by Backstage religiously when I first moved to the city.” Broadway icon Beth Leavel also used Backstage at the onset of her New York tenure and tells us she “felt like I was a part of the club when I had my Backstage in my hand.” Veteran theater actor Brian d’Arcy James , most recently seen in “Hamilton,” also says he feels “like it was yesterday when I was going to open calls and looking at all the columns in Backstage.” And this doesn’t just apply to Broadway vets. Anthony Rosenthal , the young actor who starred in last season’s Tony-nominated “Falsettos” revival, also used Backstage when he was getting started. In short: It worked for them!  Branded social media: This is the only supply on this list that may be a little new or surprising. While a strong digital presence and brand certainly aren’t actual requirements to perform on Broadway, in the year 2017, they are instrumentally helpful. Even if a curated social-media presence doesn’t land you a starring role on Broadway, it may very well catch the attention of someone in the industry: a writer, a director, an all-important casting director. That could make your headshot stand out in the pile of submissions on the desk, help you get in the room, and that could, in fact, help get your name on the boards. But building your digital brand is easier said than done, of course, which is why we have an entire guide on that subject alone right here .  WATCH   What should I know about the Actors’ Equity Association?  Let’s start at the beginning, which, when it comes to Broadway, means the Actors’ Equity Association (AEA). Maybe you’re a member, maybe you’ve spent years trying to become one, or maybe you have no idea what the organization even is. Whatever the case may be, we’re here to provide a tell-all explanation.  What is AEA?  Actors’ Equity Association (referred to most commonly in the biz as “Equity”) is the U.S. labor union that represents upwards of 50,000 actors, as well as stage managers. Founded in 1913, it intends to “foster the art of live theater as an essential component of society,” as well as provide its members with benefits such as healthcare and pension plans, fair working hours and conditions, and leverage for negotiating wages. Members receive their Equity card upon initiation, which serves as proof of membership and is used for many purposes, primarily at Equity Principal Auditions and Equity Chorus Calls (which we will delve into deeper later in this guide).  A slight digression but an important distinction to make is that the actors’ union in the United Kingdom is similarly called simply Equity. Apart from the fact that Equity and Actors’ Equity Association are both affiliated with the International Federation of Actors, however, the two are entirely separate entities.  Actor Kate Shindle, who is in the midst of starring as big Alison in the “Fun Home” national tour, is the currently serving president of AEA. You can learn more about Actors’ Equity Association via their full website here .  Do I have to be an AEA member to perform on Broadway?  We won’t mince words. Yes, you have to be a member of AEA to perform on Broadway. There is virtually no exception. Every single performer you have ever seen on Broadway has been represented by AEA. There are, however, many, many different paths to gaining membership, which brings us to...  How do I become a member?  It’s a tale as old as, well, as old as the AEA. How does one become a member? As previously mentioned, there are different ways to get that coveted card in hand. Luckily for you, Backstage has already taken an extensive dive into the subject . Apart from the unicorn scenario where the creative team hands a Broadway contract to a non-union actor and thus has his or her Equity membership pushed through (unsurprisingly, this happens mainly with stars of film and television), there are three primary ways to get your card. They’re broken down below:   Get an Equity Contract While it may seem obvious, getting that first Equity contract can prove tricky. Depending on a variety of factors such as size of the house, budget, and ticket price, theaters may be operating with a limited number of Equity contracts per show or season. Those contracts are likely to go to actors who are members already, but not always. When a union contract is left over with no union member to fill it, it’s bestowed upon a qualified non-union actor. That actor is now paid union wages and, more importantly, is eligible to join during his or her term of employment. Hired as non-union but interested in joining? Particularly with larger companies, it may be worth asking for one or two contracted weeks as part of your negotiation process.    The Equity Membership Candidate Program  The EMC program is a great way to work towards union membership while gaining valuable early career experience. Mimicking an age-old theatrical apprenticeship model, Equity gives candidates the opportunity to earn their eligibility through 50 weeks of work in participating theaters. Once enrolled in the program, candidates earn one point for every eligible week worked; 50 points (and 50 weeks) later, EMC actors are welcomed into the union.  Join Through a Sister Union Another route to an Equity card? After a year’s membership, actors can buy into one of Equity’s sister unions with at least one principal contract or three background contracts worked. Eligible unions include SAG-AFTRA, AGMA (the American Guild of Musical Artists), AGVA (the American Guild of Variety Artists), and GIAA (the Guild of Italian-American Actors). Actors wishing to join through a sister union must provide proof of membership (and good standing), evidence of jobs worked within that one-year time frame, and at least $400 towards the Equity initiation fee—which currently stands at $1,100.   As with SAG-AFTRA , joining Equity is a big decision and a big commitment! Equity actors are barred from taking non-union contracts, so non-union tours, certain Off-Off Broadway companies, and some small regional theaters may be off limits to members. On the brighter side, Equity actors enjoy tons of perks like salary protections and healthcare—and don’t forget access to EPAs and ECCs—alongside a community of 50,000 talented fellow members.   RELATED:   How to Become a Musical Theater Actor   WATCH   How do I audition for Broadway?  You knew it was coming, and now, here it is. Chances are, you won’t book a Broadway gig without auditioning first. Here’s what you should know about the three prominent types of Broadway audition, before stepping into the room.  Equity Principal Auditions Every production with a negotiated Equity contract is required to hold EPAs wherein Equity actors can show up to these somewhat open calls and audition with or without representation. Naturally, your first few EPAs in particular may be intimidating. To take some of the pressure off, Backstage compiled nine important things to know before stepping into the room .  1.  Bring your ID Equity members and Equity Membership Candidates (EMCs) need to bring their paid-up cards in order to sign up for Equity calls. If you are not yet in the union, there’s still a chance you might be seen; future members can often sign up on a separate list (creative team permitting) and are seen on a first-come-first-served basis once the equity members are done. Non-union actors should also come prepared with an ID and expect a longer wait time at most auditions .  2. Go to the right call Do you know the difference between an EPA and an ECC? If not, do a little reading on the Actors’ Equity website before attending your first call to determine which audition is really right for you. Generally, the EPA is seeking leading (principal) roles in plays and musicals, while the ECC (Equity Chorus Call) is seeking ensemble members for larger-scale musicals and separates singers from dancers in two separate calls.  3. Know what you’re auditioning for While many actors see EPAs as a way to “get on the radar” of certain casting teams , you need to know what you’re auditioning for before spending a day in the Actors’ Equity center. Backstage and AEA offer breakdowns for all EPA calls, and it’s important to read those character descriptions before attending a call. Don’t see a role you’re right for in that regional theater’s winter play? Best to sit this one out and wait for an audition that you can nail.  4. Know your 20 Actors’ Equity assigns six actors to every 20-minute time slot with any remaining time at the end of the block given to Equity Alternates, EMCs, and (often) non-union performers. Actors are grouped in those 20-minute intervals and lined up according to sign-up order when they’ve reached their assigned time. If you’re lucky enough to have that secure time slot, you must be present, ready, and prepared when your name is called.  5. Know when you’d like to audition If you attend an EPA as a union member, you’ll be presented with the chance to choose your own time slot. If the time you’d like is not available (but other appointments are), you may sign up on “Alternate List B” to stand by for an earlier spot. If you arrive after all of the appointments have been booked, the monitor will place you on “Alternate List A” and will call off names one by one at the end of each 20-minute group.  6. Be early When it comes to EPAs, the earlier the better. The AEA audition monitor arrives one hour before a call’s start time and signs up actors by order of arrival. During New York’s prime audition season, actors may line up several hours before that monitor arrives (even before the building has opened), meaning that all time slots are filled by very early morning. If it’s a hot project with numerous roles, expect a heavy turnout and arrange your schedule accordingly. Additionally, if you do receive a slot, you must check in at least 10 minutes early. If an actor is not present when the AEA monitor reads off his  name, he or she will sacrifice his audition time to an alternate, EMC, or non-union actor on standby.  7. Be patient—and have plenty of time With their (often) large crowds and uncertain timing, EPAs can feel like a pretty big chore. It’s important to remain calm, polite, and friendly, and to remember why you’re there; the love of performing can always squash a frustrating commute or a long day spent waiting. That said, attending an EPA can often take several hours and should be thought of as an all-day activity. Set the time aside in advance (if possible), and it will be easier to brush off those hours spent in the waiting room.  8. Find great material EPA breakdowns usually request a two-minute monologue , a 32-bar song , or some combination of shorter song and/or monologue. The rules state that actors get at least one minute per audition, so you’ll have, at minimum, 60 seconds to show off what you do best. This is your chance to prove yourself to a new creative team and remind casting fans of your chops. Spend real time looking for a variety of material that suits your type and bring it to the EPA well practiced and polished.  9. Keep a journal Once you start attending EPAs on the reg, you’ll start seeing familiar faces on the other side of the table. Equity posts the ITR (in the room) personnel so you can easily see who was present at your audition. Take notes on this information from week to week, along with what you wore, what you performed, and how it was received by the casting team. In no time at all, you will have a who’s who of local theater casting directors and other important contacts.  Equity Chorus Calls: There are two different types of Equity Chorus Call: those for singing and those for dancing. The designated type will be detailed in the audition listing, however , the most prepared actors will have their given materials (their book, dance clothes, etc.) on hand for either, as performers are oftentimes asked to stay and dance and/or sing even if it was not described in the listing. For a detailed procedural breakdown of ECCs, we direct you again to the Actors’ Equity’s official website , which has all the information you need.  Straight offers: Straight offers don’t fall under the audition category per se, however, they are prominent in Broadway casting and thus must be discussed. Like so many aspects of show business, there is no uniform method for how a person gets to Broadway, and that is exemplified no clearer than with straight offers.  Here is an example: The actor Olivia Wilde made her Broadway debut recently in the stage adaptation of George Orwell’s “1984.” It is a safe assumption that, as an established actor of a different medium (or as it is often referred to in the biz, “a name”) Wilde did not have to attend an EPA to book her role, despite the fact she did not yet have her Equity card.  In a similar vein, Equity actors who may not be “names” in the traditional sense but who have an existing relationship with a given member of a creative team or who simply have a positive reputation and established type in the industry may also receive a straight offer.  RELATED:   How Broadway Shows Get Cast   WATCH   Who are the big Broadway casting directors?  The two names synonymous with Broadway casting that you need to know are Bernard “Bernie” Telsey and Tara Rubin. In its more than 20 years in the industry, the former’s Telsey + Co has cast everything from “Rent” to “Wicked” to a little show called “Hamilton.” Rubin is right on Telsey’s heels, though, having cast this season’s Tony-winning best musical “Dear Evan Hansen,” as well as the ever-running “The Phantom of the Opera.” In addition to these two powerhouses, the third name gaining rapid notoriety in the industry is Jim Carnahan, whose Carnahan Casting is responsible for filling roles in all of the prestigious Roundabout Theatre Company’s musicals and plays.  What’s important to understand about Broadway’s casting directors is the continuity between shows; it is unsurprising to see actors cast repeatedly in the different shows of the same casting director. Take two of Rubin’s most prominent titles: “Indecent,” which bowed on Broadway this past spring, and “The Band’s Visit,” which will play the Great White Way this coming fall. Both of those shows starred/will star Katrina Lenk. Similarly, all three of the roles originated on Broadway by Idina Menzel were cast by Telsey.

RELATED:   Broadway’s Bernie Telsey, Tara Rubin + Thomas Schumacher on What Theater Can Learn About Diversity From TV   WATCH   What are the different Broadway gigs?   Swing: Frequently regarded as the most challenging gig on Broadway, swing actors are not actually in the cast onstage for most performances. Rather, they cover multiple tracks in a show. That means a swing learns several different principal or ensemble roles and, in the event that an actor is out of a performance, he or she is able to step in at a moment’s notice.    Standby: Similar to swings, standby performers are not actually in the onstage cast when the entire lineup of performers is present. Standbys are there to do just that: They standby in case an actor is out of a show. Generally, standbys are only for the meatiest roles where a traditional understudy may not suffice, and they only cover one role in the show. “Wicked,” for example, has standbys for both witches.    Understudy: Speaking of understudies, you probably know at least vaguely what they are. What separates understudies from swings is that understudies are in the show, however, they also understudy a bigger or more principal role in the event that the actor playing it is out. (From there, a swing will likely step into that understudy’s usual role.)    Ensemble: The ensemble, less politically correctly referred to as “the chorus,” is the onstage performers and dancers who, for lack of a better word, support for the principal cast. They are also similar to background actors in television and film. They fill scenes and dance numbers and serve as a literal chorus in musical numbers.    Principal: Finally, principal actors are those who play characters with names and whose headshots are on the main page of the show’s program. They play the lead and supporting roles and, if they are well-known to the public, may even see their name above the title on the theater’s marquee. A note: If a performer’s name is above the title, they will automatically be considered in the leading role category when it comes to awards consideration unless otherwise campaigned for by the creative team.   WATCH   What are the actual theaters (and who owns them)?  Broadway is defined entirely by its houses. Did you know that what renders a theater a Broadway theater is not in fact its adjacency to the actual avenue, but the number of seats it contains? Five hundred seats or more, and the theater is Broadway; 100 or more, and it’s Off-Broadway; and, if it contains under 100 seats, it’s usually considered Off-Off-Broadway.  It probably sounds a bit strange conceptually, but Broadway theaters require rent to be paid in order to be occupied. And just like all New York City rents, the costs are exponentially high. For this reason, theater rental is one of the utmost financial considerations when it comes to funding as well as the decision to keep a show open or close it. So, who are these “theater landlords,” if you will?  When it comes to Broadway houses, there are three names you need to know: Shubert, Nederlander, and Jujamycyn. These three entities alone own the vast majority of Broadway’s now-41 theaters. (That number is thanks to the addition of this year’s re-opened Hudson Theatre).  The Nederlander Organization owns nine Broadway houses, including the Brooks Atkinson (“Waitress”), the Minskoff (“The Lion King”), and the Richard Rodgers (“Hamilton”).  The Shubert Organization boasts an impressive 18-theater roster including the Music Box (“Dear Evan Hansen”), the Gerald Schoenfeld (“Come From Away”), and the Cort (the incoming “M. Butterfly”).  The newest of the big three is Jujamcyn (pronounced joo-jam-sin), which has five theaters with several major hits, including the Eugene O’Neill (“The Book of Mormon”), the Al Hirschfeld (“Kinky Boots”), and the St. James (which will host the sure-to-be-massive “Frozen” adaptation next spring).  These three house owners do not account for every Broadway house, though. In addition, there are smaller, subscriber-based entities including the Roundabout Theatre Company (which owns the American Airlines Theatre as well as Studio 54), Manhattan Theatre Club (the Samuel J. Friedman), and of course, Lincoln Center, which boasts one Broadway theater way up at the actual Lincoln Center, the Vivian Beaumont. (Lincoln Center does get involved in producing other shows from time to time, including last season’s “Falsettos.”)  Do I need an agent?  There may be no question asked with more frequency than that of whether or not actors in all corners of the industry need an agent to get cast. Therefore, it’s unsurprising that we at Backstage have already done tons of hearty investigation in order to thoroughly and honestly answer it.  And that answer is, well, no, you do not need an agent to get cast on Broadway—but it helps! Of course, you can scour casting notices (hey, Backstage has lots of those!) and, if you’re Equity, you can show up to ECCs or try to submit for EPAs. But an agent increases your likelihood of getting seen by a large margin. Additionally, many Broadway gigs will not be publicly broadcasted anyway and will be filtered exclusively through agent submissions.  Similarly, though it’s a bit of a catch-22, just having an agent increases your industry cachet and standing, and that alone makes you a more desirable candidate for any Broadway gig.  To understand why exactly agents are so vital and how they help you in the casting process, Backstage Expert Gwyn Gilliss explains what they really do:  1. Submit you for an audition. An agent sends a casting director an email, an electronic submission, a hard-copy headshot and resume, your website link, IMDb page, or other website with your work. You need to provide excellent marketing tools so he or she can submit you.  2. Pitch you to industry leaders. An agent spends a lot of time on the phone and can talk about you—and your talent—with casting directors, directors, and producers in order to get you an appointment, meeting, or audition. You need to let your agent know what you can really do and what you book the most, as well as any unique qualities and talents you may have.  3. Follow up. Agents will follow up for you when you have a callback and you need to arrange the time and place. You need to be available, eager, passionate, prepared, aggressively competitive, and show up 100 percent.  4. Negotiate higher pay. Agents can get you higher-than-minimum pay when you book a job. They go over the details of your contract including salary, travel arrangements, billing, and other special arrangements of any kind. These could include: specific wardrobe designer or clothing style, hair or makeup artist request, special diet specifications, etc.—all things that might be accepted especially when you’re an established star. You need to communicate clearly what you want or require so there are no problems once the contract is signed and you’re miles away on location. Research and knowledge is essential on your part.  5. Re-negotiate contracts. When your contract is up for re-negotiation for a TV show, Broadway show, or network commercial extension, you agent can negotiate an increase in pay. You need to understand the commitment and the possibility of having to turn down a larger, more lucrative offer for a competitive show or project. You need to take responsibility for the results once you sign or re-sign a contract.  Again, though, just because your chances are higher of finding and booking a gig with an agent than without one, that doesn’t mean it’s not possible. “Some actors will tell you that it’s not worth your time to go to an EPA or Open Call, that we’re not really looking, or only seriously seeing agent/manager submissions,” says JV Mercanti , a Backstage Expert and head of acting for the musical theater program at Pace University’s School of the Arts. “I can tell you that when casting the Broadway production of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ‘The Woman in White’ many years ago that seven of our ensemble members came from the EPA. Musicals and shows requiring younger people (think “Spring Awakening”) especially use these calls to find young, unrepresented talent. For plays, understudy roles can often be cast from these calls.”  Ultimately, if you do decide an agent is the right path for you and your career to move forward, actually getting one will be a feat all its own. Lucky for you, we’ve already devoted an entire guide (similar to this one!) to how to get an acting agent .  Read:   6 Ways to Find the Best Agent for You   WATCH   What terms should I know?  Do you know what it means to go up on your lines or to be off-book? What about the difference between a production stage manager and an assistant stage manager (neither of which should be confused with the production assistant)? Are you going to understand what’s required when your sitzprobe is scheduled, or what a 10 out of 12 will entail?  It’s OK if you answered “no” to any of the above—for now. However, Broadway specifically has a ton of lingo that may sound foreign to someone not in the know and, if you plan to be on Broadway, you need to know it. We’ve got you covered below.   60+ Theater Terms Every Actor Should Know    23 Must-Know Musical Theater Audition Terms   WATCH   What are the best schools for breeding Broadway talent?  Just like having an agent, graduating from one of the “top” schools for breeding Broadway talent may help give you a leg up, but it’s hardly impossible to get cast without it. Additionally, graduating from one of these institutions in no way guarantees you a spot onstage. Still, it’s helpful to know the major schools, as well as some of the successful alums who’ve emerged from them. On the Broadway circuit, the “big three” when it comes to collegiate training are:  Carnegie Mellon University: Considered by many to be the top dog for Broadway training, CMU’s School of Drama emphasizes established practices integrated with innovation in order to produce artists that are both timeless and forward thinking. Additionally, musical theater actors are required to take the same acting classes as dramatic actors in order to ensure a roundedness. Alumni include “Wicked” and “Smash” star Megan Hilty, two-time Tony winner Christian Borle, “Hamilton” star Leslie Odom, Jr., “Book of Mormon” and “Frozen” star Josh Gad, and “Kinky Boots” Tony winner Billy Porter.  College Conservatory of Music: The oldest musical theater program in the entire country, CCM is widely recognized for its triple-threat approach to training and unsurprisingly has produced tons of talent that has gone on to Broadway. Currently on the boards, alumna Betsy Wolfe is playing the title role in “Waitress,” and Christy Altomare is also playing the title role in “Anastasia.” Faith Prince and Aaron Lazar are graduates as well, as are “Hamiton” stars Karen Olivo and Andrew Chappelle.  University of Michigan: Michigan’s department of theater and dance places importance on balance: Academic excellence and training are focused on equally. Darren Criss of “Glee” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” stardom is a 2009 alum, and Gavin Creel, who just won a 2017 Tony Award for his work in “Hello, Dolly!” is also a Michigan-degree carrier.  RELATED:   7 Schools Where Tony Winners Got Their Start   Who are the composers, book writers, and playwrights I need to know today?  In the same way that art is subjective and will speak to every viewer differently, there is no definitive ranking of creatives working on Broadway that you need to know. A playwright who has been seminal in your artistic drive since elementary school could be entirely obscure to a fellow actor. The same goes for composers and musical book writers. That being said, if you don’t have a very basic knowledge of the below artists and their corresponding legacies, well, good luck making small talk at your next ECC.  Lin-Manuel Miranda, composer and book writer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Hamilton”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Hamilton,” “In the Heights”   Stephen Sondheim, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sunday in the Park with George” revival starring Annaleigh Ashford and Jake Gyllenhaal  Most prominent Broadway work: “Sweeney Todd,” “Into the Woods,” “West Side Story”   Jeanine Tesori, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Fun Home”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Thoroughly Modern Millie,” “Caroline, or Change”   Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, composing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “Dear Evan Hansen”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Dear Evan Hansen,” “A Christmas Story”   Lynn Nottage, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sweat” (Broadway debut)   Andrew Lloyd Webber, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “School of Rock,” “The Phantom of the Opera”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Evita”   Paula Vogel, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Indecent” (Broadway debut)   Joshua Harmon, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Significant Other” (Broadway debut)   David Yazbek, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,” “The Band’s Visit” (upcoming)  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Full Monty”   Bobby Lopez, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “The Book of Mormon”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Book of Mormon,” “Avenue Q”   Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, composing/book writing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “If/Then”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Next to Normal”   Liesl Tommy, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Eclipsed” (Broadway debut)   Stephen Karam, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: Modern adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s “The Cherry Orchard,” “The Humans”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Humans”   RELATED:   How to Get Cast on Broadway by Terrence McNally   WATCH   Head over to Backstage’s casting calls to see our hosting opportunities!

Whether you have dreams of seeing your name in lights atop a marquee or inside a Broadway program amongst the names that comprise a robust ensemble, you have a long journey ahead towards the Great White Way. Fortunately, you’ve got a friend in us! From how to obtain your Equity card to the all-important terms and creative forces you need to know, here is the Backstage Guide for how to get cast on Broadway.    What do I need to get started?   Headshot/résumé/reel  Backstage  Branded social media   What should I know about the Actors’ Equity Association?   What is AEA?  Do I have to be an AEA member to perform on Broadway?  How do I become a member?   How do I audition for Broadway?   Equity Principal Auditions  Equity Chorus Calls  Straight offers   Who are the big Broadway casting directors?  What are the different Broadway gigs?   Swing  Standby  Understudy  Ensemble  Principal   What are the actual theaters (and who owns them)?  Do I need an agent?  What terms should I know?  What are the best schools for breeding Broadway talent?  Who are the composers, book writers, and playwrights I need to know today?   What do I need to get started?  The materials you’ll need to get cast on Broadway will probably not be new to you. Still, you know what they say about making assumptions, so we’ll break them down below.  Headshot/résumé/reel: These are the materials that you will, unequivocally, need for every single acting job you want to obtain throughout your career. Check out our headshot archives for everything you need to know about what to wear, how to find a photographer, posing tips, and more.  Next, head over to our résumé section for thorough guidance on formatting, what does and does not belong, special skills, and more.  The only difference in these tools for Broadway is, if you’re hoping to break into the musical realm, your reel will need musical excerpts as well as acting. Here , Backstage Expert Tim Grady advises you on how to “recreate the energy and atmosphere of an actual audition” for your musical-theater reel and here expands on the subject by giving his five most useful pointers for your best MT reel.  Backstage: Many, many Broadway stars used Backstage in the early stages of their careers (and beyond). Rachel Bay Jones , who just won a 2017 Tony Award for her role in “Dear Evan Hansen,” says she “lived by Backstage religiously when I first moved to the city.” Broadway icon Beth Leavel also used Backstage at the onset of her New York tenure and tells us she “felt like I was a part of the club when I had my Backstage in my hand.” Veteran theater actor Brian d’Arcy James , most recently seen in “Hamilton,” also says he feels “like it was yesterday when I was going to open calls and looking at all the columns in Backstage.” And this doesn’t just apply to Broadway vets. Anthony Rosenthal , the young actor who starred in last season’s Tony-nominated “Falsettos” revival, also used Backstage when he was getting started. In short: It worked for them!  Branded social media: This is the only supply on this list that may be a little new or surprising. While a strong digital presence and brand certainly aren’t actual requirements to perform on Broadway, in the year 2017, they are instrumentally helpful. Even if a curated social-media presence doesn’t land you a starring role on Broadway, it may very well catch the attention of someone in the industry: a writer, a director, an all-important casting director. That could make your headshot stand out in the pile of submissions on the desk, help you get in the room, and that could, in fact, help get your name on the boards. But building your digital brand is easier said than done, of course, which is why we have an entire guide on that subject alone right here .  WATCH   What should I know about the Actors’ Equity Association?  Let’s start at the beginning, which, when it comes to Broadway, means the Actors’ Equity Association (AEA). Maybe you’re a member, maybe you’ve spent years trying to become one, or maybe you have no idea what the organization even is. Whatever the case may be, we’re here to provide a tell-all explanation.  What is AEA?  Actors’ Equity Association (referred to most commonly in the biz as “Equity”) is the U.S. labor union that represents upwards of 50,000 actors, as well as stage managers. Founded in 1913, it intends to “foster the art of live theater as an essential component of society,” as well as provide its members with benefits such as healthcare and pension plans, fair working hours and conditions, and leverage for negotiating wages. Members receive their Equity card upon initiation, which serves as proof of membership and is used for many purposes, primarily at Equity Principal Auditions and Equity Chorus Calls (which we will delve into deeper later in this guide).  A slight digression but an important distinction to make is that the actors’ union in the United Kingdom is similarly called simply Equity. Apart from the fact that Equity and Actors’ Equity Association are both affiliated with the International Federation of Actors, however, the two are entirely separate entities.  Actor Kate Shindle, who is in the midst of starring as big Alison in the “Fun Home” national tour, is the currently serving president of AEA. You can learn more about Actors’ Equity Association via their full website here .  Do I have to be an AEA member to perform on Broadway?  We won’t mince words. Yes, you have to be a member of AEA to perform on Broadway. There is virtually no exception. Every single performer you have ever seen on Broadway has been represented by AEA. There are, however, many, many different paths to gaining membership, which brings us to...  How do I become a member?  It’s a tale as old as, well, as old as the AEA. How does one become a member? As previously mentioned, there are different ways to get that coveted card in hand. Luckily for you, Backstage has already taken an extensive dive into the subject . Apart from the unicorn scenario where the creative team hands a Broadway contract to a non-union actor and thus has his or her Equity membership pushed through (unsurprisingly, this happens mainly with stars of film and television), there are three primary ways to get your card. They’re broken down below:   Get an Equity Contract While it may seem obvious, getting that first Equity contract can prove tricky. Depending on a variety of factors such as size of the house, budget, and ticket price, theaters may be operating with a limited number of Equity contracts per show or season. Those contracts are likely to go to actors who are members already, but not always. When a union contract is left over with no union member to fill it, it’s bestowed upon a qualified non-union actor. That actor is now paid union wages and, more importantly, is eligible to join during his or her term of employment. Hired as non-union but interested in joining? Particularly with larger companies, it may be worth asking for one or two contracted weeks as part of your negotiation process.    The Equity Membership Candidate Program  The EMC program is a great way to work towards union membership while gaining valuable early career experience. Mimicking an age-old theatrical apprenticeship model, Equity gives candidates the opportunity to earn their eligibility through 50 weeks of work in participating theaters. Once enrolled in the program, candidates earn one point for every eligible week worked; 50 points (and 50 weeks) later, EMC actors are welcomed into the union.  Join Through a Sister Union Another route to an Equity card? After a year’s membership, actors can buy into one of Equity’s sister unions with at least one principal contract or three background contracts worked. Eligible unions include SAG-AFTRA, AGMA (the American Guild of Musical Artists), AGVA (the American Guild of Variety Artists), and GIAA (the Guild of Italian-American Actors). Actors wishing to join through a sister union must provide proof of membership (and good standing), evidence of jobs worked within that one-year time frame, and at least $400 towards the Equity initiation fee—which currently stands at $1,100.   As with SAG-AFTRA , joining Equity is a big decision and a big commitment! Equity actors are barred from taking non-union contracts, so non-union tours, certain Off-Off Broadway companies, and some small regional theaters may be off limits to members. On the brighter side, Equity actors enjoy tons of perks like salary protections and healthcare—and don’t forget access to EPAs and ECCs—alongside a community of 50,000 talented fellow members.   RELATED:   How to Become a Musical Theater Actor   WATCH   How do I audition for Broadway?  You knew it was coming, and now, here it is. Chances are, you won’t book a Broadway gig without auditioning first. Here’s what you should know about the three prominent types of Broadway audition, before stepping into the room.  Equity Principal Auditions Every production with a negotiated Equity contract is required to hold EPAs wherein Equity actors can show up to these somewhat open calls and audition with or without representation. Naturally, your first few EPAs in particular may be intimidating. To take some of the pressure off, Backstage compiled nine important things to know before stepping into the room .  1.  Bring your ID Equity members and Equity Membership Candidates (EMCs) need to bring their paid-up cards in order to sign up for Equity calls. If you are not yet in the union, there’s still a chance you might be seen; future members can often sign up on a separate list (creative team permitting) and are seen on a first-come-first-served basis once the equity members are done. Non-union actors should also come prepared with an ID and expect a longer wait time at most auditions .  2. Go to the right call Do you know the difference between an EPA and an ECC? If not, do a little reading on the Actors’ Equity website before attending your first call to determine which audition is really right for you. Generally, the EPA is seeking leading (principal) roles in plays and musicals, while the ECC (Equity Chorus Call) is seeking ensemble members for larger-scale musicals and separates singers from dancers in two separate calls.  3. Know what you’re auditioning for While many actors see EPAs as a way to “get on the radar” of certain casting teams , you need to know what you’re auditioning for before spending a day in the Actors’ Equity center. Backstage and AEA offer breakdowns for all EPA calls, and it’s important to read those character descriptions before attending a call. Don’t see a role you’re right for in that regional theater’s winter play? Best to sit this one out and wait for an audition that you can nail.  4. Know your 20 Actors’ Equity assigns six actors to every 20-minute time slot with any remaining time at the end of the block given to Equity Alternates, EMCs, and (often) non-union performers. Actors are grouped in those 20-minute intervals and lined up according to sign-up order when they’ve reached their assigned time. If you’re lucky enough to have that secure time slot, you must be present, ready, and prepared when your name is called.  5. Know when you’d like to audition If you attend an EPA as a union member, you’ll be presented with the chance to choose your own time slot. If the time you’d like is not available (but other appointments are), you may sign up on “Alternate List B” to stand by for an earlier spot. If you arrive after all of the appointments have been booked, the monitor will place you on “Alternate List A” and will call off names one by one at the end of each 20-minute group.  6. Be early When it comes to EPAs, the earlier the better. The AEA audition monitor arrives one hour before a call’s start time and signs up actors by order of arrival. During New York’s prime audition season, actors may line up several hours before that monitor arrives (even before the building has opened), meaning that all time slots are filled by very early morning. If it’s a hot project with numerous roles, expect a heavy turnout and arrange your schedule accordingly. Additionally, if you do receive a slot, you must check in at least 10 minutes early. If an actor is not present when the AEA monitor reads off his  name, he or she will sacrifice his audition time to an alternate, EMC, or non-union actor on standby.  7. Be patient—and have plenty of time With their (often) large crowds and uncertain timing, EPAs can feel like a pretty big chore. It’s important to remain calm, polite, and friendly, and to remember why you’re there; the love of performing can always squash a frustrating commute or a long day spent waiting. That said, attending an EPA can often take several hours and should be thought of as an all-day activity. Set the time aside in advance (if possible), and it will be easier to brush off those hours spent in the waiting room.  8. Find great material EPA breakdowns usually request a two-minute monologue , a 32-bar song , or some combination of shorter song and/or monologue. The rules state that actors get at least one minute per audition, so you’ll have, at minimum, 60 seconds to show off what you do best. This is your chance to prove yourself to a new creative team and remind casting fans of your chops. Spend real time looking for a variety of material that suits your type and bring it to the EPA well practiced and polished.  9. Keep a journal Once you start attending EPAs on the reg, you’ll start seeing familiar faces on the other side of the table. Equity posts the ITR (in the room) personnel so you can easily see who was present at your audition. Take notes on this information from week to week, along with what you wore, what you performed, and how it was received by the casting team. In no time at all, you will have a who’s who of local theater casting directors and other important contacts.  Equity Chorus Calls: There are two different types of Equity Chorus Call: those for singing and those for dancing. The designated type will be detailed in the audition listing, however , the most prepared actors will have their given materials (their book, dance clothes, etc.) on hand for either, as performers are oftentimes asked to stay and dance and/or sing even if it was not described in the listing. For a detailed procedural breakdown of ECCs, we direct you again to the Actors’ Equity’s official website , which has all the information you need.  Straight offers: Straight offers don’t fall under the audition category per se, however, they are prominent in Broadway casting and thus must be discussed. Like so many aspects of show business, there is no uniform method for how a person gets to Broadway, and that is exemplified no clearer than with straight offers.  Here is an example: The actor Olivia Wilde made her Broadway debut recently in the stage adaptation of George Orwell’s “1984.” It is a safe assumption that, as an established actor of a different medium (or as it is often referred to in the biz, “a name”) Wilde did not have to attend an EPA to book her role, despite the fact she did not yet have her Equity card.  In a similar vein, Equity actors who may not be “names” in the traditional sense but who have an existing relationship with a given member of a creative team or who simply have a positive reputation and established type in the industry may also receive a straight offer.  RELATED:   How Broadway Shows Get Cast   WATCH   Who are the big Broadway casting directors?  The two names synonymous with Broadway casting that you need to know are Bernard “Bernie” Telsey and Tara Rubin. In its more than 20 years in the industry, the former’s Telsey + Co has cast everything from “Rent” to “Wicked” to a little show called “Hamilton.” Rubin is right on Telsey’s heels, though, having cast this season’s Tony-winning best musical “Dear Evan Hansen,” as well as the ever-running “The Phantom of the Opera.” In addition to these two powerhouses, the third name gaining rapid notoriety in the industry is Jim Carnahan, whose Carnahan Casting is responsible for filling roles in all of the prestigious Roundabout Theatre Company’s musicals and plays.  What’s important to understand about Broadway’s casting directors is the continuity between shows; it is unsurprising to see actors cast repeatedly in the different shows of the same casting director. Take two of Rubin’s most prominent titles: “Indecent,” which bowed on Broadway this past spring, and “The Band’s Visit,” which will play the Great White Way this coming fall. Both of those shows starred/will star Katrina Lenk. Similarly, all three of the roles originated on Broadway by Idina Menzel were cast by Telsey.

RELATED:   Broadway’s Bernie Telsey, Tara Rubin + Thomas Schumacher on What Theater Can Learn About Diversity From TV   WATCH   What are the different Broadway gigs?   Swing: Frequently regarded as the most challenging gig on Broadway, swing actors are not actually in the cast onstage for most performances. Rather, they cover multiple tracks in a show. That means a swing learns several different principal or ensemble roles and, in the event that an actor is out of a performance, he or she is able to step in at a moment’s notice.    Standby: Similar to swings, standby performers are not actually in the onstage cast when the entire lineup of performers is present. Standbys are there to do just that: They standby in case an actor is out of a show. Generally, standbys are only for the meatiest roles where a traditional understudy may not suffice, and they only cover one role in the show. “Wicked,” for example, has standbys for both witches.    Understudy: Speaking of understudies, you probably know at least vaguely what they are. What separates understudies from swings is that understudies are in the show, however, they also understudy a bigger or more principal role in the event that the actor playing it is out. (From there, a swing will likely step into that understudy’s usual role.)    Ensemble: The ensemble, less politically correctly referred to as “the chorus,” is the onstage performers and dancers who, for lack of a better word, support for the principal cast. They are also similar to background actors in television and film. They fill scenes and dance numbers and serve as a literal chorus in musical numbers.    Principal: Finally, principal actors are those who play characters with names and whose headshots are on the main page of the show’s program. They play the lead and supporting roles and, if they are well-known to the public, may even see their name above the title on the theater’s marquee. A note: If a performer’s name is above the title, they will automatically be considered in the leading role category when it comes to awards consideration unless otherwise campaigned for by the creative team.   WATCH   What are the actual theaters (and who owns them)?  Broadway is defined entirely by its houses. Did you know that what renders a theater a Broadway theater is not in fact its adjacency to the actual avenue, but the number of seats it contains? Five hundred seats or more, and the theater is Broadway; 100 or more, and it’s Off-Broadway; and, if it contains under 100 seats, it’s usually considered Off-Off-Broadway.  It probably sounds a bit strange conceptually, but Broadway theaters require rent to be paid in order to be occupied. And just like all New York City rents, the costs are exponentially high. For this reason, theater rental is one of the utmost financial considerations when it comes to funding as well as the decision to keep a show open or close it. So, who are these “theater landlords,” if you will?  When it comes to Broadway houses, there are three names you need to know: Shubert, Nederlander, and Jujamycyn. These three entities alone own the vast majority of Broadway’s now-41 theaters. (That number is thanks to the addition of this year’s re-opened Hudson Theatre).  The Nederlander Organization owns nine Broadway houses, including the Brooks Atkinson (“Waitress”), the Minskoff (“The Lion King”), and the Richard Rodgers (“Hamilton”).  The Shubert Organization boasts an impressive 18-theater roster including the Music Box (“Dear Evan Hansen”), the Gerald Schoenfeld (“Come From Away”), and the Cort (the incoming “M. Butterfly”).  The newest of the big three is Jujamcyn (pronounced joo-jam-sin), which has five theaters with several major hits, including the Eugene O’Neill (“The Book of Mormon”), the Al Hirschfeld (“Kinky Boots”), and the St. James (which will host the sure-to-be-massive “Frozen” adaptation next spring).  These three house owners do not account for every Broadway house, though. In addition, there are smaller, subscriber-based entities including the Roundabout Theatre Company (which owns the American Airlines Theatre as well as Studio 54), Manhattan Theatre Club (the Samuel J. Friedman), and of course, Lincoln Center, which boasts one Broadway theater way up at the actual Lincoln Center, the Vivian Beaumont. (Lincoln Center does get involved in producing other shows from time to time, including last season’s “Falsettos.”)  Do I need an agent?  There may be no question asked with more frequency than that of whether or not actors in all corners of the industry need an agent to get cast. Therefore, it’s unsurprising that we at Backstage have already done tons of hearty investigation in order to thoroughly and honestly answer it.  And that answer is, well, no, you do not need an agent to get cast on Broadway—but it helps! Of course, you can scour casting notices (hey, Backstage has lots of those!) and, if you’re Equity, you can show up to ECCs or try to submit for EPAs. But an agent increases your likelihood of getting seen by a large margin. Additionally, many Broadway gigs will not be publicly broadcasted anyway and will be filtered exclusively through agent submissions.  Similarly, though it’s a bit of a catch-22, just having an agent increases your industry cachet and standing, and that alone makes you a more desirable candidate for any Broadway gig.  To understand why exactly agents are so vital and how they help you in the casting process, Backstage Expert Gwyn Gilliss explains what they really do:  1. Submit you for an audition. An agent sends a casting director an email, an electronic submission, a hard-copy headshot and resume, your website link, IMDb page, or other website with your work. You need to provide excellent marketing tools so he or she can submit you.  2. Pitch you to industry leaders. An agent spends a lot of time on the phone and can talk about you—and your talent—with casting directors, directors, and producers in order to get you an appointment, meeting, or audition. You need to let your agent know what you can really do and what you book the most, as well as any unique qualities and talents you may have.  3. Follow up. Agents will follow up for you when you have a callback and you need to arrange the time and place. You need to be available, eager, passionate, prepared, aggressively competitive, and show up 100 percent.  4. Negotiate higher pay. Agents can get you higher-than-minimum pay when you book a job. They go over the details of your contract including salary, travel arrangements, billing, and other special arrangements of any kind. These could include: specific wardrobe designer or clothing style, hair or makeup artist request, special diet specifications, etc.—all things that might be accepted especially when you’re an established star. You need to communicate clearly what you want or require so there are no problems once the contract is signed and you’re miles away on location. Research and knowledge is essential on your part.  5. Re-negotiate contracts. When your contract is up for re-negotiation for a TV show, Broadway show, or network commercial extension, you agent can negotiate an increase in pay. You need to understand the commitment and the possibility of having to turn down a larger, more lucrative offer for a competitive show or project. You need to take responsibility for the results once you sign or re-sign a contract.  Again, though, just because your chances are higher of finding and booking a gig with an agent than without one, that doesn’t mean it’s not possible. “Some actors will tell you that it’s not worth your time to go to an EPA or Open Call, that we’re not really looking, or only seriously seeing agent/manager submissions,” says JV Mercanti , a Backstage Expert and head of acting for the musical theater program at Pace University’s School of the Arts. “I can tell you that when casting the Broadway production of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ‘The Woman in White’ many years ago that seven of our ensemble members came from the EPA. Musicals and shows requiring younger people (think “Spring Awakening”) especially use these calls to find young, unrepresented talent. For plays, understudy roles can often be cast from these calls.”  Ultimately, if you do decide an agent is the right path for you and your career to move forward, actually getting one will be a feat all its own. Lucky for you, we’ve already devoted an entire guide (similar to this one!) to how to get an acting agent .  Read:   6 Ways to Find the Best Agent for You   WATCH   What terms should I know?  Do you know what it means to go up on your lines or to be off-book? What about the difference between a production stage manager and an assistant stage manager (neither of which should be confused with the production assistant)? Are you going to understand what’s required when your sitzprobe is scheduled, or what a 10 out of 12 will entail?  It’s OK if you answered “no” to any of the above—for now. However, Broadway specifically has a ton of lingo that may sound foreign to someone not in the know and, if you plan to be on Broadway, you need to know it. We’ve got you covered below.   60+ Theater Terms Every Actor Should Know    23 Must-Know Musical Theater Audition Terms   WATCH   What are the best schools for breeding Broadway talent?  Just like having an agent, graduating from one of the “top” schools for breeding Broadway talent may help give you a leg up, but it’s hardly impossible to get cast without it. Additionally, graduating from one of these institutions in no way guarantees you a spot onstage. Still, it’s helpful to know the major schools, as well as some of the successful alums who’ve emerged from them. On the Broadway circuit, the “big three” when it comes to collegiate training are:  Carnegie Mellon University: Considered by many to be the top dog for Broadway training, CMU’s School of Drama emphasizes established practices integrated with innovation in order to produce artists that are both timeless and forward thinking. Additionally, musical theater actors are required to take the same acting classes as dramatic actors in order to ensure a roundedness. Alumni include “Wicked” and “Smash” star Megan Hilty, two-time Tony winner Christian Borle, “Hamilton” star Leslie Odom, Jr., “Book of Mormon” and “Frozen” star Josh Gad, and “Kinky Boots” Tony winner Billy Porter.  College Conservatory of Music: The oldest musical theater program in the entire country, CCM is widely recognized for its triple-threat approach to training and unsurprisingly has produced tons of talent that has gone on to Broadway. Currently on the boards, alumna Betsy Wolfe is playing the title role in “Waitress,” and Christy Altomare is also playing the title role in “Anastasia.” Faith Prince and Aaron Lazar are graduates as well, as are “Hamiton” stars Karen Olivo and Andrew Chappelle.  University of Michigan: Michigan’s department of theater and dance places importance on balance: Academic excellence and training are focused on equally. Darren Criss of “Glee” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” stardom is a 2009 alum, and Gavin Creel, who just won a 2017 Tony Award for his work in “Hello, Dolly!” is also a Michigan-degree carrier.  RELATED:   7 Schools Where Tony Winners Got Their Start   Who are the composers, book writers, and playwrights I need to know today?  In the same way that art is subjective and will speak to every viewer differently, there is no definitive ranking of creatives working on Broadway that you need to know. A playwright who has been seminal in your artistic drive since elementary school could be entirely obscure to a fellow actor. The same goes for composers and musical book writers. That being said, if you don’t have a very basic knowledge of the below artists and their corresponding legacies, well, good luck making small talk at your next ECC.  Lin-Manuel Miranda, composer and book writer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Hamilton”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Hamilton,” “In the Heights”   Stephen Sondheim, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sunday in the Park with George” revival starring Annaleigh Ashford and Jake Gyllenhaal  Most prominent Broadway work: “Sweeney Todd,” “Into the Woods,” “West Side Story”   Jeanine Tesori, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Fun Home”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Thoroughly Modern Millie,” “Caroline, or Change”   Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, composing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “Dear Evan Hansen”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Dear Evan Hansen,” “A Christmas Story”   Lynn Nottage, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sweat” (Broadway debut)   Andrew Lloyd Webber, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “School of Rock,” “The Phantom of the Opera”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Evita”   Paula Vogel, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Indecent” (Broadway debut)   Joshua Harmon, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Significant Other” (Broadway debut)   David Yazbek, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,” “The Band’s Visit” (upcoming)  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Full Monty”   Bobby Lopez, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “The Book of Mormon”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Book of Mormon,” “Avenue Q”   Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, composing/book writing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “If/Then”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Next to Normal”   Liesl Tommy, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Eclipsed” (Broadway debut)   Stephen Karam, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: Modern adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s “The Cherry Orchard,” “The Humans”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Humans”   RELATED:   How to Get Cast on Broadway by Terrence McNally   WATCH   Head over to Backstage’s casting calls to see our hosting opportunities!

Whether you have dreams of seeing your name in lights atop a marquee or inside a Broadway program amongst the names that comprise a robust ensemble, you have a long journey ahead towards the Great White Way. Fortunately, you’ve got a friend in us! From how to obtain your Equity card to the all-important terms and creative forces you need to know, here is the Backstage Guide for how to get cast on Broadway.    What do I need to get started?   Headshot/résumé/reel  Backstage  Branded social media   What should I know about the Actors’ Equity Association?   What is AEA?  Do I have to be an AEA member to perform on Broadway?  How do I become a member?   How do I audition for Broadway?   Equity Principal Auditions  Equity Chorus Calls  Straight offers   Who are the big Broadway casting directors?

What are the best schools for breeding Broadway talent?  Who are the composers, book writers, and playwrights I need to know today?   What do I need to get started?  The materials you’ll need to get cast on Broadway will probably not be new to you. Still, you know what they say about making assumptions, so we’ll break them down below.  Headshot/résumé/reel: These are the materials that you will, unequivocally, need for every single acting job you want to obtain throughout your career. Check out our headshot archives for everything you need to know about what to wear, how to find a photographer, posing tips, and more.  Next, head over to our résumé section for thorough guidance on formatting, what does and does not belong, special skills, and more.  The only difference in these tools for Broadway is, if you’re hoping to break into the musical realm, your reel will need musical excerpts as well as acting. Here , Backstage Expert Tim Grady advises you on how to “recreate the energy and atmosphere of an actual audition” for your musical-theater reel and here expands on the subject by giving his five most useful pointers for your best MT reel.  Backstage: Many, many Broadway stars used Backstage in the early stages of their careers (and beyond). Rachel Bay Jones , who just won a 2017 Tony Award for her role in “Dear Evan Hansen,” says she “lived by Backstage religiously when I first moved to the city.” Broadway icon Beth Leavel also used Backstage at the onset of her New York tenure and tells us she “felt like I was a part of the club when I had my Backstage in my hand.” Veteran theater actor Brian d’Arcy James , most recently seen in “Hamilton,” also says he feels “like it was yesterday when I was going to open calls and looking at all the columns in Backstage.” And this doesn’t just apply to Broadway vets. Anthony Rosenthal , the young actor who starred in last season’s Tony-nominated “Falsettos” revival, also used Backstage when he was getting started. In short: It worked for them!  Branded social media: This is the only supply on this list that may be a little new or surprising. While a strong digital presence and brand certainly aren’t actual requirements to perform on Broadway, in the year 2017, they are instrumentally helpful. Even if a curated social-media presence doesn’t land you a starring role on Broadway, it may very well catch the attention of someone in the industry: a writer, a director, an all-important casting director. That could make your headshot stand out in the pile of submissions on the desk, help you get in the room, and that could, in fact, help get your name on the boards. But building your digital brand is easier said than done, of course, which is why we have an entire guide on that subject alone right here .  WATCH   What should I know about the Actors’ Equity Association?  Let’s start at the beginning, which, when it comes to Broadway, means the Actors’ Equity Association (AEA). Maybe you’re a member, maybe you’ve spent years trying to become one, or maybe you have no idea what the organization even is. Whatever the case may be, we’re here to provide a tell-all explanation.  What is AEA?  Actors’ Equity Association (referred to most commonly in the biz as “Equity”) is the U.S. labor union that represents upwards of 50,000 actors, as well as stage managers. Founded in 1913, it intends to “foster the art of live theater as an essential component of society,” as well as provide its members with benefits such as healthcare and pension plans, fair working hours and conditions, and leverage for negotiating wages. Members receive their Equity card upon initiation, which serves as proof of membership and is used for many purposes, primarily at Equity Principal Auditions and Equity Chorus Calls (which we will delve into deeper later in this guide).  A slight digression but an important distinction to make is that the actors’ union in the United Kingdom is similarly called simply Equity. Apart from the fact that Equity and Actors’ Equity Association are both affiliated with the International Federation of Actors, however, the two are entirely separate entities.  Actor Kate Shindle, who is in the midst of starring as big Alison in the “Fun Home” national tour, is the currently serving president of AEA. You can learn more about Actors’ Equity Association via their full website here .  Do I have to be an AEA member to perform on Broadway?  We won’t mince words. Yes, you have to be a member of AEA to perform on Broadway. There is virtually no exception. Every single performer you have ever seen on Broadway has been represented by AEA. There are, however, many, many different paths to gaining membership, which brings us to...  How do I become a member?  It’s a tale as old as, well, as old as the AEA. How does one become a member? As previously mentioned, there are different ways to get that coveted card in hand. Luckily for you, Backstage has already taken an extensive dive into the subject . Apart from the unicorn scenario where the creative team hands a Broadway contract to a non-union actor and thus has his or her Equity membership pushed through (unsurprisingly, this happens mainly with stars of film and television), there are three primary ways to get your card. They’re broken down below:   Get an Equity Contract While it may seem obvious, getting that first Equity contract can prove tricky. Depending on a variety of factors such as size of the house, budget, and ticket price, theaters may be operating with a limited number of Equity contracts per show or season. Those contracts are likely to go to actors who are members already, but not always. When a union contract is left over with no union member to fill it, it’s bestowed upon a qualified non-union actor. That actor is now paid union wages and, more importantly, is eligible to join during his or her term of employment. Hired as non-union but interested in joining? Particularly with larger companies, it may be worth asking for one or two contracted weeks as part of your negotiation process.    The Equity Membership Candidate Program  The EMC program is a great way to work towards union membership while gaining valuable early career experience. Mimicking an age-old theatrical apprenticeship model, Equity gives candidates the opportunity to earn their eligibility through 50 weeks of work in participating theaters. Once enrolled in the program, candidates earn one point for every eligible week worked; 50 points (and 50 weeks) later, EMC actors are welcomed into the union.  Join Through a Sister Union Another route to an Equity card? After a year’s membership, actors can buy into one of Equity’s sister unions with at least one principal contract or three background contracts worked. Eligible unions include SAG-AFTRA, AGMA (the American Guild of Musical Artists), AGVA (the American Guild of Variety Artists), and GIAA (the Guild of Italian-American Actors). Actors wishing to join through a sister union must provide proof of membership (and good standing), evidence of jobs worked within that one-year time frame, and at least $400 towards the Equity initiation fee—which currently stands at $1,100.   As with SAG-AFTRA , joining Equity is a big decision and a big commitment! Equity actors are barred from taking non-union contracts, so non-union tours, certain Off-Off Broadway companies, and some small regional theaters may be off limits to members. On the brighter side, Equity actors enjoy tons of perks like salary protections and healthcare—and don’t forget access to EPAs and ECCs—alongside a community of 50,000 talented fellow members.   RELATED:   How to Become a Musical Theater Actor   WATCH   How do I audition for Broadway?  You knew it was coming, and now, here it is. Chances are, you won’t book a Broadway gig without auditioning first. Here’s what you should know about the three prominent types of Broadway audition, before stepping into the room.  Equity Principal Auditions Every production with a negotiated Equity contract is required to hold EPAs wherein Equity actors can show up to these somewhat open calls and audition with or without representation. Naturally, your first few EPAs in particular may be intimidating. To take some of the pressure off, Backstage compiled nine important things to know before stepping into the room .  1.  Bring your ID Equity members and Equity Membership Candidates (EMCs) need to bring their paid-up cards in order to sign up for Equity calls. If you are not yet in the union, there’s still a chance you might be seen; future members can often sign up on a separate list (creative team permitting) and are seen on a first-come-first-served basis once the equity members are done. Non-union actors should also come prepared with an ID and expect a longer wait time at most auditions .  2. Go to the right call Do you know the difference between an EPA and an ECC? If not, do a little reading on the Actors’ Equity website before attending your first call to determine which audition is really right for you. Generally, the EPA is seeking leading (principal) roles in plays and musicals, while the ECC (Equity Chorus Call) is seeking ensemble members for larger-scale musicals and separates singers from dancers in two separate calls.  3. Know what you’re auditioning for While many actors see EPAs as a way to “get on the radar” of certain casting teams , you need to know what you’re auditioning for before spending a day in the Actors’ Equity center. Backstage and AEA offer breakdowns for all EPA calls, and it’s important to read those character descriptions before attending a call. Don’t see a role you’re right for in that regional theater’s winter play? Best to sit this one out and wait for an audition that you can nail.  4. Know your 20 Actors’ Equity assigns six actors to every 20-minute time slot with any remaining time at the end of the block given to Equity Alternates, EMCs, and (often) non-union performers. Actors are grouped in those 20-minute intervals and lined up according to sign-up order when they’ve reached their assigned time. If you’re lucky enough to have that secure time slot, you must be present, ready, and prepared when your name is called.  5. Know when you’d like to audition If you attend an EPA as a union member, you’ll be presented with the chance to choose your own time slot. If the time you’d like is not available (but other appointments are), you may sign up on “Alternate List B” to stand by for an earlier spot. If you arrive after all of the appointments have been booked, the monitor will place you on “Alternate List A” and will call off names one by one at the end of each 20-minute group.  6. Be early When it comes to EPAs, the earlier the better. The AEA audition monitor arrives one hour before a call’s start time and signs up actors by order of arrival. During New York’s prime audition season, actors may line up several hours before that monitor arrives (even before the building has opened), meaning that all time slots are filled by very early morning. If it’s a hot project with numerous roles, expect a heavy turnout and arrange your schedule accordingly. Additionally, if you do receive a slot, you must check in at least 10 minutes early. If an actor is not present when the AEA monitor reads off his  name, he or she will sacrifice his audition time to an alternate, EMC, or non-union actor on standby.  7. Be patient—and have plenty of time With their (often) large crowds and uncertain timing, EPAs can feel like a pretty big chore. It’s important to remain calm, polite, and friendly, and to remember why you’re there; the love of performing can always squash a frustrating commute or a long day spent waiting. That said, attending an EPA can often take several hours and should be thought of as an all-day activity. Set the time aside in advance (if possible), and it will be easier to brush off those hours spent in the waiting room.  8. Find great material EPA breakdowns usually request a two-minute monologue , a 32-bar song , or some combination of shorter song and/or monologue. The rules state that actors get at least one minute per audition, so you’ll have, at minimum, 60 seconds to show off what you do best. This is your chance to prove yourself to a new creative team and remind casting fans of your chops. Spend real time looking for a variety of material that suits your type and bring it to the EPA well practiced and polished.  9. Keep a journal Once you start attending EPAs on the reg, you’ll start seeing familiar faces on the other side of the table. Equity posts the ITR (in the room) personnel so you can easily see who was present at your audition. Take notes on this information from week to week, along with what you wore, what you performed, and how it was received by the casting team. In no time at all, you will have a who’s who of local theater casting directors and other important contacts.  Equity Chorus Calls: There are two different types of Equity Chorus Call: those for singing and those for dancing. The designated type will be detailed in the audition listing, however , the most prepared actors will have their given materials (their book, dance clothes, etc.) on hand for either, as performers are oftentimes asked to stay and dance and/or sing even if it was not described in the listing. For a detailed procedural breakdown of ECCs, we direct you again to the Actors’ Equity’s official website , which has all the information you need.  Straight offers: Straight offers don’t fall under the audition category per se, however, they are prominent in Broadway casting and thus must be discussed. Like so many aspects of show business, there is no uniform method for how a person gets to Broadway, and that is exemplified no clearer than with straight offers.  Here is an example: The actor Olivia Wilde made her Broadway debut recently in the stage adaptation of George Orwell’s “1984.” It is a safe assumption that, as an established actor of a different medium (or as it is often referred to in the biz, “a name”) Wilde did not have to attend an EPA to book her role, despite the fact she did not yet have her Equity card.  In a similar vein, Equity actors who may not be “names” in the traditional sense but who have an existing relationship with a given member of a creative team or who simply have a positive reputation and established type in the industry may also receive a straight offer.  RELATED:   How Broadway Shows Get Cast   WATCH   Who are the big Broadway casting directors?  The two names synonymous with Broadway casting that you need to know are Bernard “Bernie” Telsey and Tara Rubin. In its more than 20 years in the industry, the former’s Telsey + Co has cast everything from “Rent” to “Wicked” to a little show called “Hamilton.” Rubin is right on Telsey’s heels, though, having cast this season’s Tony-winning best musical “Dear Evan Hansen,” as well as the ever-running “The Phantom of the Opera.” In addition to these two powerhouses, the third name gaining rapid notoriety in the industry is Jim Carnahan, whose Carnahan Casting is responsible for filling roles in all of the prestigious Roundabout Theatre Company’s musicals and plays.  What’s important to understand about Broadway’s casting directors is the continuity between shows; it is unsurprising to see actors cast repeatedly in the different shows of the same casting director. Take two of Rubin’s most prominent titles: “Indecent,” which bowed on Broadway this past spring, and “The Band’s Visit,” which will play the Great White Way this coming fall. Both of those shows starred/will star Katrina Lenk. Similarly, all three of the roles originated on Broadway by Idina Menzel were cast by Telsey.

RELATED:   Broadway’s Bernie Telsey, Tara Rubin + Thomas Schumacher on What Theater Can Learn About Diversity From TV   WATCH   What are the different Broadway gigs?   Swing: Frequently regarded as the most challenging gig on Broadway, swing actors are not actually in the cast onstage for most performances. Rather, they cover multiple tracks in a show. That means a swing learns several different principal or ensemble roles and, in the event that an actor is out of a performance, he or she is able to step in at a moment’s notice.    Standby: Similar to swings, standby performers are not actually in the onstage cast when the entire lineup of performers is present. Standbys are there to do just that: They standby in case an actor is out of a show. Generally, standbys are only for the meatiest roles where a traditional understudy may not suffice, and they only cover one role in the show. “Wicked,” for example, has standbys for both witches.    Understudy: Speaking of understudies, you probably know at least vaguely what they are. What separates understudies from swings is that understudies are in the show, however, they also understudy a bigger or more principal role in the event that the actor playing it is out. (From there, a swing will likely step into that understudy’s usual role.)    Ensemble: The ensemble, less politically correctly referred to as “the chorus,” is the onstage performers and dancers who, for lack of a better word, support for the principal cast. They are also similar to background actors in television and film. They fill scenes and dance numbers and serve as a literal chorus in musical numbers.    Principal: Finally, principal actors are those who play characters with names and whose headshots are on the main page of the show’s program. They play the lead and supporting roles and, if they are well-known to the public, may even see their name above the title on the theater’s marquee. A note: If a performer’s name is above the title, they will automatically be considered in the leading role category when it comes to awards consideration unless otherwise campaigned for by the creative team.   WATCH   What are the actual theaters (and who owns them)?  Broadway is defined entirely by its houses. Did you know that what renders a theater a Broadway theater is not in fact its adjacency to the actual avenue, but the number of seats it contains? Five hundred seats or more, and the theater is Broadway; 100 or more, and it’s Off-Broadway; and, if it contains under 100 seats, it’s usually considered Off-Off-Broadway.  It probably sounds a bit strange conceptually, but Broadway theaters require rent to be paid in order to be occupied. And just like all New York City rents, the costs are exponentially high. For this reason, theater rental is one of the utmost financial considerations when it comes to funding as well as the decision to keep a show open or close it. So, who are these “theater landlords,” if you will?  When it comes to Broadway houses, there are three names you need to know: Shubert, Nederlander, and Jujamycyn. These three entities alone own the vast majority of Broadway’s now-41 theaters. (That number is thanks to the addition of this year’s re-opened Hudson Theatre).  The Nederlander Organization owns nine Broadway houses, including the Brooks Atkinson (“Waitress”), the Minskoff (“The Lion King”), and the Richard Rodgers (“Hamilton”).  The Shubert Organization boasts an impressive 18-theater roster including the Music Box (“Dear Evan Hansen”), the Gerald Schoenfeld (“Come From Away”), and the Cort (the incoming “M. Butterfly”).  The newest of the big three is Jujamcyn (pronounced joo-jam-sin), which has five theaters with several major hits, including the Eugene O’Neill (“The Book of Mormon”), the Al Hirschfeld (“Kinky Boots”), and the St. James (which will host the sure-to-be-massive “Frozen” adaptation next spring).  These three house owners do not account for every Broadway house, though. In addition, there are smaller, subscriber-based entities including the Roundabout Theatre Company (which owns the American Airlines Theatre as well as Studio 54), Manhattan Theatre Club (the Samuel J. Friedman), and of course, Lincoln Center, which boasts one Broadway theater way up at the actual Lincoln Center, the Vivian Beaumont. (Lincoln Center does get involved in producing other shows from time to time, including last season’s “Falsettos.”)  Do I need an agent?  There may be no question asked with more frequency than that of whether or not actors in all corners of the industry need an agent to get cast. Therefore, it’s unsurprising that we at Backstage have already done tons of hearty investigation in order to thoroughly and honestly answer it.  And that answer is, well, no, you do not need an agent to get cast on Broadway—but it helps! Of course, you can scour casting notices (hey, Backstage has lots of those!) and, if you’re Equity, you can show up to ECCs or try to submit for EPAs. But an agent increases your likelihood of getting seen by a large margin. Additionally, many Broadway gigs will not be publicly broadcasted anyway and will be filtered exclusively through agent submissions.  Similarly, though it’s a bit of a catch-22, just having an agent increases your industry cachet and standing, and that alone makes you a more desirable candidate for any Broadway gig.  To understand why exactly agents are so vital and how they help you in the casting process, Backstage Expert Gwyn Gilliss explains what they really do:  1. Submit you for an audition. An agent sends a casting director an email, an electronic submission, a hard-copy headshot and resume, your website link, IMDb page, or other website with your work. You need to provide excellent marketing tools so he or she can submit you.  2. Pitch you to industry leaders. An agent spends a lot of time on the phone and can talk about you—and your talent—with casting directors, directors, and producers in order to get you an appointment, meeting, or audition. You need to let your agent know what you can really do and what you book the most, as well as any unique qualities and talents you may have.  3. Follow up. Agents will follow up for you when you have a callback and you need to arrange the time and place. You need to be available, eager, passionate, prepared, aggressively competitive, and show up 100 percent.  4. Negotiate higher pay. Agents can get you higher-than-minimum pay when you book a job. They go over the details of your contract including salary, travel arrangements, billing, and other special arrangements of any kind. These could include: specific wardrobe designer or clothing style, hair or makeup artist request, special diet specifications, etc.—all things that might be accepted especially when you’re an established star. You need to communicate clearly what you want or require so there are no problems once the contract is signed and you’re miles away on location. Research and knowledge is essential on your part.  5. Re-negotiate contracts. When your contract is up for re-negotiation for a TV show, Broadway show, or network commercial extension, you agent can negotiate an increase in pay. You need to understand the commitment and the possibility of having to turn down a larger, more lucrative offer for a competitive show or project. You need to take responsibility for the results once you sign or re-sign a contract.  Again, though, just because your chances are higher of finding and booking a gig with an agent than without one, that doesn’t mean it’s not possible. “Some actors will tell you that it’s not worth your time to go to an EPA or Open Call, that we’re not really looking, or only seriously seeing agent/manager submissions,” says JV Mercanti , a Backstage Expert and head of acting for the musical theater program at Pace University’s School of the Arts. “I can tell you that when casting the Broadway production of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ‘The Woman in White’ many years ago that seven of our ensemble members came from the EPA. Musicals and shows requiring younger people (think “Spring Awakening”) especially use these calls to find young, unrepresented talent. For plays, understudy roles can often be cast from these calls.”  Ultimately, if you do decide an agent is the right path for you and your career to move forward, actually getting one will be a feat all its own. Lucky for you, we’ve already devoted an entire guide (similar to this one!) to how to get an acting agent .  Read:   6 Ways to Find the Best Agent for You   WATCH   What terms should I know?  Do you know what it means to go up on your lines or to be off-book? What about the difference between a production stage manager and an assistant stage manager (neither of which should be confused with the production assistant)? Are you going to understand what’s required when your sitzprobe is scheduled, or what a 10 out of 12 will entail?  It’s OK if you answered “no” to any of the above—for now. However, Broadway specifically has a ton of lingo that may sound foreign to someone not in the know and, if you plan to be on Broadway, you need to know it. We’ve got you covered below.   60+ Theater Terms Every Actor Should Know    23 Must-Know Musical Theater Audition Terms   WATCH   What are the best schools for breeding Broadway talent?  Just like having an agent, graduating from one of the “top” schools for breeding Broadway talent may help give you a leg up, but it’s hardly impossible to get cast without it. Additionally, graduating from one of these institutions in no way guarantees you a spot onstage. Still, it’s helpful to know the major schools, as well as some of the successful alums who’ve emerged from them. On the Broadway circuit, the “big three” when it comes to collegiate training are:  Carnegie Mellon University: Considered by many to be the top dog for Broadway training, CMU’s School of Drama emphasizes established practices integrated with innovation in order to produce artists that are both timeless and forward thinking. Additionally, musical theater actors are required to take the same acting classes as dramatic actors in order to ensure a roundedness. Alumni include “Wicked” and “Smash” star Megan Hilty, two-time Tony winner Christian Borle, “Hamilton” star Leslie Odom, Jr., “Book of Mormon” and “Frozen” star Josh Gad, and “Kinky Boots” Tony winner Billy Porter.  College Conservatory of Music: The oldest musical theater program in the entire country, CCM is widely recognized for its triple-threat approach to training and unsurprisingly has produced tons of talent that has gone on to Broadway. Currently on the boards, alumna Betsy Wolfe is playing the title role in “Waitress,” and Christy Altomare is also playing the title role in “Anastasia.” Faith Prince and Aaron Lazar are graduates as well, as are “Hamiton” stars Karen Olivo and Andrew Chappelle.  University of Michigan: Michigan’s department of theater and dance places importance on balance: Academic excellence and training are focused on equally. Darren Criss of “Glee” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” stardom is a 2009 alum, and Gavin Creel, who just won a 2017 Tony Award for his work in “Hello, Dolly!” is also a Michigan-degree carrier.  RELATED:   7 Schools Where Tony Winners Got Their Start   Who are the composers, book writers, and playwrights I need to know today?  In the same way that art is subjective and will speak to every viewer differently, there is no definitive ranking of creatives working on Broadway that you need to know. A playwright who has been seminal in your artistic drive since elementary school could be entirely obscure to a fellow actor. The same goes for composers and musical book writers. That being said, if you don’t have a very basic knowledge of the below artists and their corresponding legacies, well, good luck making small talk at your next ECC.  Lin-Manuel Miranda, composer and book writer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Hamilton”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Hamilton,” “In the Heights”   Stephen Sondheim, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sunday in the Park with George” revival starring Annaleigh Ashford and Jake Gyllenhaal  Most prominent Broadway work: “Sweeney Todd,” “Into the Woods,” “West Side Story”   Jeanine Tesori, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Fun Home”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Thoroughly Modern Millie,” “Caroline, or Change”   Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, composing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “Dear Evan Hansen”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Dear Evan Hansen,” “A Christmas Story”   Lynn Nottage, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sweat” (Broadway debut)   Andrew Lloyd Webber, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “School of Rock,” “The Phantom of the Opera”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Evita”   Paula Vogel, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Indecent” (Broadway debut)   Joshua Harmon, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Significant Other” (Broadway debut)   David Yazbek, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,” “The Band’s Visit” (upcoming)  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Full Monty”   Bobby Lopez, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “The Book of Mormon”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Book of Mormon,” “Avenue Q”   Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, composing/book writing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “If/Then”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Next to Normal”   Liesl Tommy, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Eclipsed” (Broadway debut)   Stephen Karam, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: Modern adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s “The Cherry Orchard,” “The Humans”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Humans”   RELATED:   How to Get Cast on Broadway by Terrence McNally   WATCH   Head over to Backstage’s casting calls to see our hosting opportunities!

Backstage Guides  How to Get Cast on Broadway  By Casey Mink | Posted Sept. 25, 2017, 10:30 a.m.    Share:                           advice  Backstage Experts  BACKSTAGE GUIDES  Broadway  musical theater  NEW YORK-SPECIFIC  plays      Photo Source: Jesse Balgley   Broadway is an entity, a state of mind, a goal held by so many and attained by so few. Whether you have dreams of seeing your name in lights atop a marquee or inside a Broadway program amongst the names that comprise a robust ensemble, you have a long journey ahead towards the Great White Way. Fortunately, you’ve got a friend in us! From how to obtain your Equity card to the all-important terms and creative forces you need to know, here is the Backstage Guide for how to get cast on Broadway.    What do I need to get started?   Headshot/résumé/reel  Backstage  Branded social media   What should I know about the Actors’ Equity Association?   What is AEA?  Do I have to be an AEA member to perform on Broadway?  How do I become a member?   How do I audition for Broadway?   Equity Principal Auditions  Equity Chorus Calls  Straight offers   Who are the big Broadway casting directors?

What are the best schools for breeding Broadway talent?  Who are the composers, book writers, and playwrights I need to know today?   What do I need to get started?  The materials you’ll need to get cast on Broadway will probably not be new to you. Still, you know what they say about making assumptions, so we’ll break them down below.  Headshot/résumé/reel: These are the materials that you will, unequivocally, need for every single acting job you want to obtain throughout your career. Check out our headshot archives for everything you need to know about what to wear, how to find a photographer, posing tips, and more.  Next, head over to our résumé section for thorough guidance on formatting, what does and does not belong, special skills, and more.  The only difference in these tools for Broadway is, if you’re hoping to break into the musical realm, your reel will need musical excerpts as well as acting. Here , Backstage Expert Tim Grady advises you on how to “recreate the energy and atmosphere of an actual audition” for your musical-theater reel and here expands on the subject by giving his five most useful pointers for your best MT reel.  Backstage: Many, many Broadway stars used Backstage in the early stages of their careers (and beyond). Rachel Bay Jones , who just won a 2017 Tony Award for her role in “Dear Evan Hansen,” says she “lived by Backstage religiously when I first moved to the city.” Broadway icon Beth Leavel also used Backstage at the onset of her New York tenure and tells us she “felt like I was a part of the club when I had my Backstage in my hand.” Veteran theater actor Brian d’Arcy James , most recently seen in “Hamilton,” also says he feels “like it was yesterday when I was going to open calls and looking at all the columns in Backstage.” And this doesn’t just apply to Broadway vets. Anthony Rosenthal , the young actor who starred in last season’s Tony-nominated “Falsettos” revival, also used Backstage when he was getting started. In short: It worked for them!  Branded social media: This is the only supply on this list that may be a little new or surprising. While a strong digital presence and brand certainly aren’t actual requirements to perform on Broadway, in the year 2017, they are instrumentally helpful. Even if a curated social-media presence doesn’t land you a starring role on Broadway, it may very well catch the attention of someone in the industry: a writer, a director, an all-important casting director. That could make your headshot stand out in the pile of submissions on the desk, help you get in the room, and that could, in fact, help get your name on the boards. But building your digital brand is easier said than done, of course, which is why we have an entire guide on that subject alone right here .  WATCH   What should I know about the Actors’ Equity Association?  Let’s start at the beginning, which, when it comes to Broadway, means the Actors’ Equity Association (AEA). Maybe you’re a member, maybe you’ve spent years trying to become one, or maybe you have no idea what the organization even is. Whatever the case may be, we’re here to provide a tell-all explanation.  What is AEA?  Actors’ Equity Association (referred to most commonly in the biz as “Equity”) is the U.S. labor union that represents upwards of 50,000 actors, as well as stage managers. Founded in 1913, it intends to “foster the art of live theater as an essential component of society,” as well as provide its members with benefits such as healthcare and pension plans, fair working hours and conditions, and leverage for negotiating wages. Members receive their Equity card upon initiation, which serves as proof of membership and is used for many purposes, primarily at Equity Principal Auditions and Equity Chorus Calls (which we will delve into deeper later in this guide).  A slight digression but an important distinction to make is that the actors’ union in the United Kingdom is similarly called simply Equity. Apart from the fact that Equity and Actors’ Equity Association are both affiliated with the International Federation of Actors, however, the two are entirely separate entities.  Actor Kate Shindle, who is in the midst of starring as big Alison in the “Fun Home” national tour, is the currently serving president of AEA. You can learn more about Actors’ Equity Association via their full website here .  Do I have to be an AEA member to perform on Broadway?  We won’t mince words. Yes, you have to be a member of AEA to perform on Broadway. There is virtually no exception. Every single performer you have ever seen on Broadway has been represented by AEA. There are, however, many, many different paths to gaining membership, which brings us to...  How do I become a member?  It’s a tale as old as, well, as old as the AEA. How does one become a member? As previously mentioned, there are different ways to get that coveted card in hand. Luckily for you, Backstage has already taken an extensive dive into the subject . Apart from the unicorn scenario where the creative team hands a Broadway contract to a non-union actor and thus has his or her Equity membership pushed through (unsurprisingly, this happens mainly with stars of film and television), there are three primary ways to get your card. They’re broken down below:   Get an Equity Contract While it may seem obvious, getting that first Equity contract can prove tricky. Depending on a variety of factors such as size of the house, budget, and ticket price, theaters may be operating with a limited number of Equity contracts per show or season. Those contracts are likely to go to actors who are members already, but not always. When a union contract is left over with no union member to fill it, it’s bestowed upon a qualified non-union actor. That actor is now paid union wages and, more importantly, is eligible to join during his or her term of employment. Hired as non-union but interested in joining? Particularly with larger companies, it may be worth asking for one or two contracted weeks as part of your negotiation process.    The Equity Membership Candidate Program  The EMC program is a great way to work towards union membership while gaining valuable early career experience. Mimicking an age-old theatrical apprenticeship model, Equity gives candidates the opportunity to earn their eligibility through 50 weeks of work in participating theaters. Once enrolled in the program, candidates earn one point for every eligible week worked; 50 points (and 50 weeks) later, EMC actors are welcomed into the union.  Join Through a Sister Union Another route to an Equity card? After a year’s membership, actors can buy into one of Equity’s sister unions with at least one principal contract or three background contracts worked. Eligible unions include SAG-AFTRA, AGMA (the American Guild of Musical Artists), AGVA (the American Guild of Variety Artists), and GIAA (the Guild of Italian-American Actors). Actors wishing to join through a sister union must provide proof of membership (and good standing), evidence of jobs worked within that one-year time frame, and at least $400 towards the Equity initiation fee—which currently stands at $1,100.   As with SAG-AFTRA , joining Equity is a big decision and a big commitment! Equity actors are barred from taking non-union contracts, so non-union tours, certain Off-Off Broadway companies, and some small regional theaters may be off limits to members. On the brighter side, Equity actors enjoy tons of perks like salary protections and healthcare—and don’t forget access to EPAs and ECCs—alongside a community of 50,000 talented fellow members.   RELATED:   How to Become a Musical Theater Actor   WATCH   How do I audition for Broadway?  You knew it was coming, and now, here it is. Chances are, you won’t book a Broadway gig without auditioning first. Here’s what you should know about the three prominent types of Broadway audition, before stepping into the room.  Equity Principal Auditions Every production with a negotiated Equity contract is required to hold EPAs wherein Equity actors can show up to these somewhat open calls and audition with or without representation. Naturally, your first few EPAs in particular may be intimidating. To take some of the pressure off, Backstage compiled nine important things to know before stepping into the room .  1.  Bring your ID Equity members and Equity Membership Candidates (EMCs) need to bring their paid-up cards in order to sign up for Equity calls. If you are not yet in the union, there’s still a chance you might be seen; future members can often sign up on a separate list (creative team permitting) and are seen on a first-come-first-served basis once the equity members are done. Non-union actors should also come prepared with an ID and expect a longer wait time at most auditions .  2. Go to the right call Do you know the difference between an EPA and an ECC? If not, do a little reading on the Actors’ Equity website before attending your first call to determine which audition is really right for you. Generally, the EPA is seeking leading (principal) roles in plays and musicals, while the ECC (Equity Chorus Call) is seeking ensemble members for larger-scale musicals and separates singers from dancers in two separate calls.  3. Know what you’re auditioning for While many actors see EPAs as a way to “get on the radar” of certain casting teams , you need to know what you’re auditioning for before spending a day in the Actors’ Equity center. Backstage and AEA offer breakdowns for all EPA calls, and it’s important to read those character descriptions before attending a call. Don’t see a role you’re right for in that regional theater’s winter play? Best to sit this one out and wait for an audition that you can nail.  4. Know your 20 Actors’ Equity assigns six actors to every 20-minute time slot with any remaining time at the end of the block given to Equity Alternates, EMCs, and (often) non-union performers. Actors are grouped in those 20-minute intervals and lined up according to sign-up order when they’ve reached their assigned time. If you’re lucky enough to have that secure time slot, you must be present, ready, and prepared when your name is called.  5. Know when you’d like to audition If you attend an EPA as a union member, you’ll be presented with the chance to choose your own time slot. If the time you’d like is not available (but other appointments are), you may sign up on “Alternate List B” to stand by for an earlier spot. If you arrive after all of the appointments have been booked, the monitor will place you on “Alternate List A” and will call off names one by one at the end of each 20-minute group.  6. Be early When it comes to EPAs, the earlier the better. The AEA audition monitor arrives one hour before a call’s start time and signs up actors by order of arrival. During New York’s prime audition season, actors may line up several hours before that monitor arrives (even before the building has opened), meaning that all time slots are filled by very early morning. If it’s a hot project with numerous roles, expect a heavy turnout and arrange your schedule accordingly. Additionally, if you do receive a slot, you must check in at least 10 minutes early. If an actor is not present when the AEA monitor reads off his  name, he or she will sacrifice his audition time to an alternate, EMC, or non-union actor on standby.  7. Be patient—and have plenty of time With their (often) large crowds and uncertain timing, EPAs can feel like a pretty big chore. It’s important to remain calm, polite, and friendly, and to remember why you’re there; the love of performing can always squash a frustrating commute or a long day spent waiting. That said, attending an EPA can often take several hours and should be thought of as an all-day activity. Set the time aside in advance (if possible), and it will be easier to brush off those hours spent in the waiting room.  8. Find great material EPA breakdowns usually request a two-minute monologue , a 32-bar song , or some combination of shorter song and/or monologue. The rules state that actors get at least one minute per audition, so you’ll have, at minimum, 60 seconds to show off what you do best. This is your chance to prove yourself to a new creative team and remind casting fans of your chops. Spend real time looking for a variety of material that suits your type and bring it to the EPA well practiced and polished.  9. Keep a journal Once you start attending EPAs on the reg, you’ll start seeing familiar faces on the other side of the table. Equity posts the ITR (in the room) personnel so you can easily see who was present at your audition. Take notes on this information from week to week, along with what you wore, what you performed, and how it was received by the casting team. In no time at all, you will have a who’s who of local theater casting directors and other important contacts.  Equity Chorus Calls: There are two different types of Equity Chorus Call: those for singing and those for dancing. The designated type will be detailed in the audition listing, however , the most prepared actors will have their given materials (their book, dance clothes, etc.) on hand for either, as performers are oftentimes asked to stay and dance and/or sing even if it was not described in the listing. For a detailed procedural breakdown of ECCs, we direct you again to the Actors’ Equity’s official website , which has all the information you need.  Straight offers: Straight offers don’t fall under the audition category per se, however, they are prominent in Broadway casting and thus must be discussed. Like so many aspects of show business, there is no uniform method for how a person gets to Broadway, and that is exemplified no clearer than with straight offers.  Here is an example: The actor Olivia Wilde made her Broadway debut recently in the stage adaptation of George Orwell’s “1984.” It is a safe assumption that, as an established actor of a different medium (or as it is often referred to in the biz, “a name”) Wilde did not have to attend an EPA to book her role, despite the fact she did not yet have her Equity card.  In a similar vein, Equity actors who may not be “names” in the traditional sense but who have an existing relationship with a given member of a creative team or who simply have a positive reputation and established type in the industry may also receive a straight offer.  RELATED:   How Broadway Shows Get Cast   WATCH   Who are the big Broadway casting directors?  The two names synonymous with Broadway casting that you need to know are Bernard “Bernie” Telsey and Tara Rubin. In its more than 20 years in the industry, the former’s Telsey + Co has cast everything from “Rent” to “Wicked” to a little show called “Hamilton.” Rubin is right on Telsey’s heels, though, having cast this season’s Tony-winning best musical “Dear Evan Hansen,” as well as the ever-running “The Phantom of the Opera.” In addition to these two powerhouses, the third name gaining rapid notoriety in the industry is Jim Carnahan, whose Carnahan Casting is responsible for filling roles in all of the prestigious Roundabout Theatre Company’s musicals and plays.  What’s important to understand about Broadway’s casting directors is the continuity between shows; it is unsurprising to see actors cast repeatedly in the different shows of the same casting director. Take two of Rubin’s most prominent titles: “Indecent,” which bowed on Broadway this past spring, and “The Band’s Visit,” which will play the Great White Way this coming fall. Both of those shows starred/will star Katrina Lenk. Similarly, all three of the roles originated on Broadway by Idina Menzel were cast by Telsey.

RELATED:   Broadway’s Bernie Telsey, Tara Rubin + Thomas Schumacher on What Theater Can Learn About Diversity From TV   WATCH   What are the different Broadway gigs?   Swing: Frequently regarded as the most challenging gig on Broadway, swing actors are not actually in the cast onstage for most performances. Rather, they cover multiple tracks in a show. That means a swing learns several different principal or ensemble roles and, in the event that an actor is out of a performance, he or she is able to step in at a moment’s notice.    Standby: Similar to swings, standby performers are not actually in the onstage cast when the entire lineup of performers is present. Standbys are there to do just that: They standby in case an actor is out of a show. Generally, standbys are only for the meatiest roles where a traditional understudy may not suffice, and they only cover one role in the show. “Wicked,” for example, has standbys for both witches.    Understudy: Speaking of understudies, you probably know at least vaguely what they are. What separates understudies from swings is that understudies are in the show, however, they also understudy a bigger or more principal role in the event that the actor playing it is out. (From there, a swing will likely step into that understudy’s usual role.)    Ensemble: The ensemble, less politically correctly referred to as “the chorus,” is the onstage performers and dancers who, for lack of a better word, support for the principal cast. They are also similar to background actors in television and film. They fill scenes and dance numbers and serve as a literal chorus in musical numbers.    Principal: Finally, principal actors are those who play characters with names and whose headshots are on the main page of the show’s program. They play the lead and supporting roles and, if they are well-known to the public, may even see their name above the title on the theater’s marquee. A note: If a performer’s name is above the title, they will automatically be considered in the leading role category when it comes to awards consideration unless otherwise campaigned for by the creative team.   WATCH   What are the actual theaters (and who owns them)?  Broadway is defined entirely by its houses. Did you know that what renders a theater a Broadway theater is not in fact its adjacency to the actual avenue, but the number of seats it contains? Five hundred seats or more, and the theater is Broadway; 100 or more, and it’s Off-Broadway; and, if it contains under 100 seats, it’s usually considered Off-Off-Broadway.  It probably sounds a bit strange conceptually, but Broadway theaters require rent to be paid in order to be occupied. And just like all New York City rents, the costs are exponentially high. For this reason, theater rental is one of the utmost financial considerations when it comes to funding as well as the decision to keep a show open or close it. So, who are these “theater landlords,” if you will?  When it comes to Broadway houses, there are three names you need to know: Shubert, Nederlander, and Jujamycyn. These three entities alone own the vast majority of Broadway’s now-41 theaters. (That number is thanks to the addition of this year’s re-opened Hudson Theatre).  The Nederlander Organization owns nine Broadway houses, including the Brooks Atkinson (“Waitress”), the Minskoff (“The Lion King”), and the Richard Rodgers (“Hamilton”).  The Shubert Organization boasts an impressive 18-theater roster including the Music Box (“Dear Evan Hansen”), the Gerald Schoenfeld (“Come From Away”), and the Cort (the incoming “M. Butterfly”).  The newest of the big three is Jujamcyn (pronounced joo-jam-sin), which has five theaters with several major hits, including the Eugene O’Neill (“The Book of Mormon”), the Al Hirschfeld (“Kinky Boots”), and the St. James (which will host the sure-to-be-massive “Frozen” adaptation next spring).  These three house owners do not account for every Broadway house, though. In addition, there are smaller, subscriber-based entities including the Roundabout Theatre Company (which owns the American Airlines Theatre as well as Studio 54), Manhattan Theatre Club (the Samuel J. Friedman), and of course, Lincoln Center, which boasts one Broadway theater way up at the actual Lincoln Center, the Vivian Beaumont. (Lincoln Center does get involved in producing other shows from time to time, including last season’s “Falsettos.”)  Do I need an agent?  There may be no question asked with more frequency than that of whether or not actors in all corners of the industry need an agent to get cast. Therefore, it’s unsurprising that we at Backstage have already done tons of hearty investigation in order to thoroughly and honestly answer it.  And that answer is, well, no, you do not need an agent to get cast on Broadway—but it helps! Of course, you can scour casting notices (hey, Backstage has lots of those!) and, if you’re Equity, you can show up to ECCs or try to submit for EPAs. But an agent increases your likelihood of getting seen by a large margin. Additionally, many Broadway gigs will not be publicly broadcasted anyway and will be filtered exclusively through agent submissions.  Similarly, though it’s a bit of a catch-22, just having an agent increases your industry cachet and standing, and that alone makes you a more desirable candidate for any Broadway gig.  To understand why exactly agents are so vital and how they help you in the casting process, Backstage Expert Gwyn Gilliss explains what they really do:  1. Submit you for an audition. An agent sends a casting director an email, an electronic submission, a hard-copy headshot and resume, your website link, IMDb page, or other website with your work. You need to provide excellent marketing tools so he or she can submit you.  2. Pitch you to industry leaders. An agent spends a lot of time on the phone and can talk about you—and your talent—with casting directors, directors, and producers in order to get you an appointment, meeting, or audition. You need to let your agent know what you can really do and what you book the most, as well as any unique qualities and talents you may have.  3. Follow up. Agents will follow up for you when you have a callback and you need to arrange the time and place. You need to be available, eager, passionate, prepared, aggressively competitive, and show up 100 percent.  4. Negotiate higher pay. Agents can get you higher-than-minimum pay when you book a job. They go over the details of your contract including salary, travel arrangements, billing, and other special arrangements of any kind. These could include: specific wardrobe designer or clothing style, hair or makeup artist request, special diet specifications, etc.—all things that might be accepted especially when you’re an established star. You need to communicate clearly what you want or require so there are no problems once the contract is signed and you’re miles away on location. Research and knowledge is essential on your part.  5. Re-negotiate contracts. When your contract is up for re-negotiation for a TV show, Broadway show, or network commercial extension, you agent can negotiate an increase in pay. You need to understand the commitment and the possibility of having to turn down a larger, more lucrative offer for a competitive show or project. You need to take responsibility for the results once you sign or re-sign a contract.  Again, though, just because your chances are higher of finding and booking a gig with an agent than without one, that doesn’t mean it’s not possible. “Some actors will tell you that it’s not worth your time to go to an EPA or Open Call, that we’re not really looking, or only seriously seeing agent/manager submissions,” says JV Mercanti , a Backstage Expert and head of acting for the musical theater program at Pace University’s School of the Arts. “I can tell you that when casting the Broadway production of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ‘The Woman in White’ many years ago that seven of our ensemble members came from the EPA. Musicals and shows requiring younger people (think “Spring Awakening”) especially use these calls to find young, unrepresented talent. For plays, understudy roles can often be cast from these calls.”  Ultimately, if you do decide an agent is the right path for you and your career to move forward, actually getting one will be a feat all its own.

Do you know what it means to go up on your lines or to be off-book? What about the difference between a production stage manager and an assistant stage manager (neither of which should be confused with the production assistant)? Are you going to understand what’s required when your sitzprobe is scheduled, or what a 10 out of 12 will entail?  It’s OK if you answered “no” to any of the above—for now. However, Broadway specifically has a ton of lingo that may sound foreign to someone not in the know and, if you plan to be on Broadway, you need to know it. We’ve got you covered below.   60+ Theater Terms Every Actor Should Know    23 Must-Know Musical Theater Audition Terms   WATCH   What are the best schools for breeding Broadway talent?  Just like having an agent, graduating from one of the “top” schools for breeding Broadway talent may help give you a leg up, but it’s hardly impossible to get cast without it. Additionally, graduating from one of these institutions in no way guarantees you a spot onstage. Still, it’s helpful to know the major schools, as well as some of the successful alums who’ve emerged from them. On the Broadway circuit, the “big three” when it comes to collegiate training are:  Carnegie Mellon University: Considered by many to be the top dog for Broadway training, CMU’s School of Drama emphasizes established practices integrated with innovation in order to produce artists that are both timeless and forward thinking. Additionally, musical theater actors are required to take the same acting classes as dramatic actors in order to ensure a roundedness. Alumni include “Wicked” and “Smash” star Megan Hilty, two-time Tony winner Christian Borle, “Hamilton” star Leslie Odom, Jr., “Book of Mormon” and “Frozen” star Josh Gad, and “Kinky Boots” Tony winner Billy Porter.  College Conservatory of Music: The oldest musical theater program in the entire country, CCM is widely recognized for its triple-threat approach to training and unsurprisingly has produced tons of talent that has gone on to Broadway. Currently on the boards, alumna Betsy Wolfe is playing the title role in “Waitress,” and Christy Altomare is also playing the title role in “Anastasia.” Faith Prince and Aaron Lazar are graduates as well, as are “Hamiton” stars Karen Olivo and Andrew Chappelle.  University of Michigan: Michigan’s department of theater and dance places importance on balance: Academic excellence and training are focused on equally. Darren Criss of “Glee” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” stardom is a 2009 alum, and Gavin Creel, who just won a 2017 Tony Award for his work in “Hello, Dolly!” is also a Michigan-degree carrier.  RELATED:   7 Schools Where Tony Winners Got Their Start   Who are the composers, book writers, and playwrights I need to know today?  In the same way that art is subjective and will speak to every viewer differently, there is no definitive ranking of creatives working on Broadway that you need to know. A playwright who has been seminal in your artistic drive since elementary school could be entirely obscure to a fellow actor. The same goes for composers and musical book writers. That being said, if you don’t have a very basic knowledge of the below artists and their corresponding legacies, well, good luck making small talk at your next ECC.  Lin-Manuel Miranda, composer and book writer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Hamilton”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Hamilton,” “In the Heights”   Stephen Sondheim, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sunday in the Park with George” revival starring Annaleigh Ashford and Jake Gyllenhaal  Most prominent Broadway work: “Sweeney Todd,” “Into the Woods,” “West Side Story”   Jeanine Tesori, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Fun Home”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Thoroughly Modern Millie,” “Caroline, or Change”   Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, composing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “Dear Evan Hansen”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Dear Evan Hansen,” “A Christmas Story”   Lynn Nottage, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sweat” (Broadway debut)   Andrew Lloyd Webber, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “School of Rock,” “The Phantom of the Opera”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Evita”   Paula Vogel, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Indecent” (Broadway debut)   Joshua Harmon, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Significant Other” (Broadway debut)   David Yazbek, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,” “The Band’s Visit” (upcoming)  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Full Monty”   Bobby Lopez, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “The Book of Mormon”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Book of Mormon,” “Avenue Q”   Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, composing/book writing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “If/Then”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Next to Normal”   Liesl Tommy, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Eclipsed” (Broadway debut)   Stephen Karam, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: Modern adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s “The Cherry Orchard,” “The Humans”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Humans”   RELATED:   How to Get Cast on Broadway by Terrence McNally   WATCH   Head over to Backstage’s casting calls to see our hosting opportunities!

I get a lot of emails from folks telling me that it’s their dream to work on Broadway.  Some want to be General Managers.  Some want to be Casting Directors.  Some don’t have a clue as to what they want to do, but they know they want . . . well . . . to be a part of it, New York, New York.  Some have finished school.  Some have even been through graduate school.  And quite a few through law school, actually.  Some haven’t even finished high school.  But they all know they want to do what I have been so blessed to have been able to do . . . work in an industry that they love.  Since I was one of those people who dreamed about working on Broadway, I’ve come up with some tips for folks looking to land that theater job . . . and keep it.  And while, sure, these tips are focused on the NY scene, they are easily applied to wherever you may be.  So if you’re looking to work on the Broadway, here are five tips to help you out:  1.  Got an interview?  Get tickets.  One of the first questions I ask people who sit in front of me looking for a job is, “What shows have you seen lately?”  And then I ask, “ Have you seen mine? ”  I can’t tell you how many people say no.  Does it count them out?  Not 100%.  But the people that say yes?  Oooohhh, they vault to the top of the leader board.  It’s not about kissing a$$, or putting some bucks in my till.  It’s about a gesture that says, “I’m interested in seeing the work that goes on here, so I can show you how I can contribute to making it even better.”  I know, theater tickets are expensive.  But they’ll be a lot easier to pay for if you have a job that pays you a salary.  Make an investment in your search, and people will invest in you.  2.  Get in the right room.  There’s no question that Broadway is a very closed-door industry.  And it’s hard to get that open, no matter how hard you knock.  Here’s the good news.  Once you do get the door open and you get in the room, the door usually shuts and we don’t let you out.  You’re ours!  Bahahahahaha.  Jobs are the best way to get entry into the room, but there’s the catch 22 , right?  So how else can you get potential employers to know who you are?  Emails rarely work.  Cold phone calls?  Forget it.  So, attend Galas.  Go to conferences (like my annual Super Conference !).   Get to opening nights.  Invest.  Do whatever you can do to put your face in front of employers.  I’ve hired at least three people who grabbed me for an intro after listening to me speak on a panel.  A face-to-face intro is a zillion times more “impressive” than an electronic one.  3.  Be prepared to start at the bottom.  I have a lot of respect for people who have earned MBA’s, JD’s, MD’s, or any advanced degree that cost six figures and took several years.  But that doesn’t mean you get to start at the middle.  Broadway is a niche industry which requires a lot of specialized knowledge that isn’t taught in any curriculum (except it’s all on The Producer’s Perspective PRO! ).  So that means anyone looking to get a job in the biz has to start where everyone else does . . . at the bottom. Fortunately, the bottom is a little better now than when I first started out in this industry 20 years ago!  It means having a “can-do” attitude! My staff knows that no task is too small (we have spring cleaning each year and everyone pitches in), and no project too large. It’s all about teamwork, collaboration, and a positive attitude.  But do what’s required with a smile on your face, and you’ll rise to the top quicker than you can say “I went to graduate school for this?”  4.  We don’t punch clocks.  At the end of every interview, I always ask if the job candidate has any questions.  (Tip:  Have a question or two . . . it’ll keep you in the room longer and create a stronger impression.)  The questions they ask me, teach me more about their personality than any other part of the interview.  And the one question I hate the most?  “What are the hours?”  This is indicative that they aren’t prepared for #3 above.  Office hours may be 10am-6pm, but everyone does the work for the love of it. If you love what you do, then you won’t be watching the clock. And I only want to work with people who truly love what they do.  Need an example of these type of employees? Stop by my office sometime and meet anyone on my staff.  5. Remember JFK .  I’ve saved my favorite tip for last . . .  When going in for an interview, remember these words:  “Ask not what your company can do for you, ask what you can do for your company.”  Remembering that mantra will get you in the perfect frame of mind to seem like the perfect employee.  _ _ _ _  Want to hear what it really takes to get in the room from Broadway insiders?

I just wanted to tell you that this article encouraged me a lot. My dream is to become a stage manager for musicals. I don’t think I would be able to work on Broadway since it’s too far from here and my English is not very good. I hope I can get a backstage job for musicals or dramas here in Japan. Now I know I have to start at the bottom, and I’m ready to do whatever I can do. I think your tips are true and useful not just in New York, but also in any other places. Thanks a lot for the wonderful advice!  Reply        Katie  says:   September 19, 2014 at 11:25 pm   I am a high school student in a small town, I am in love with theatre, and I have a passion for music. Now that I am a senior that needs to figure out what I really want to do in life I ask myself “what would I really love to do?” and I think theatre. For a lot of people that is unfortunate to hear and it is a hard thing to love because it “doesn’t pay the bills”. I just wish I had more encouragement because it is what I love.  Reply        Kati  says:   December 10, 2014 at 10:32 pm   Katie my mantra is “don’t take life too seriously, it’s not like we’re getting out alive” follow those big dreams right out of your small town! Make it big and who cares if you “pay the bills” if Broadway is what you want go get it! Kick butt and take names that’s what I always say.  Reply          Don Carlson  says:   March 12, 2015 at 3:17 am   I’ve been singing undiscovered for almost two decades and have won at  the one variety show and one karaoke contest I competed in, as well as had a minor hit song on a movie soundtrack-  but have not had any formal voice training and am not exactly sure what the Broadway vocal sound is these days. It’s something I *can* mimic it at a loud volume, but kind of fear “the belt” as it sounds traditionally. Is shouting musically an absolute requirement, or is a strong mix just as acceptable if it sounds good and is well projected with shimmering vibrato?  Best Wishes,  Don C.

I am only fourteen, but it is my life long dream to be in Broadway. My parents bug me and say that I would struggle if I don’t have a good salary and the average Broadway actor doesn’t have a salary that is satisfactory for New York. In spite of their comments I am determined to do what I really want. and that is to be on Broadway. I am gifted and have been told that by many people, so I will push and push until I have achieved what I want. Also, I have a very good sense of self- motivation.

I love theatre and I’ve been part of stage crew for numerous shows for the past three years. I want to get into the Broadway scene, and I want to get in early, since, as you said, it’s a very closed-door industry. I would like to get a job over the summer, and I’m seriously considering a job on Broadway if at all possible. I just would like to ask, how old does one have to be to get a job on Broadway? Also, what jobs, if any, would be available for a 16-17 year old? It doesn’t have to be stage crew, I don’t expect to be able to get directly involved like that right away at all.

Really loved what you wrote it answered pretty much all my questions about what it is like and what it takes, but I do have 2 more question. 1.I understand in this inderusy you will probably get rejected a lot. But say you are an average person, with an average singing, dancing and acting abilities who are passionate about Broadway. How many auditions do you think it will take before they get a role? (big or small) 2. This question is mainly based on auditions in new york, how many people on an average audition, for example, the Ensemble. Also sorry for the long comment I just want to know as much as I can so I thrive and actually have some idea of what I’m doing. From Maddie Cariss  Reply        Piper Grace  says:   September 26, 2017 at 10:28 am   I really appreciated that advice! I am fourteen years old and have had a passion for Broadway since I was seven when I got the starring role in the school play. I love to work hard and pour my heart into musical theatre. There are a few complications though. First, my parents don’t want me to pursue acting. They want me to be an engineer. Second, I live in New Mexico. There isn’t much “pre Broadway” theatres here. I’ve been doing shows at the community college since I was nine. I need some advice on how to pursue my dreams. I plan to go to college in New York or Boston. So should I just keep working harder than ever and audition when I get there? I love the atmosphere of the theater so much that I am willing to just bring coffee to the actors or go and get them lunch. I would even be willing to work in the ticket office for goodness sake. I have been taking dance lessons since I could walk and singing and acting lessons since I was ten. Tap dancing is my passion and I am part of a professional tap company based out of Phoenix, Arizona called tap 24.7. Once I again when I am older I would love to help the theater in anyway possible.

My name is Gwyneth, i am 15 years old and by the end of this 2017, i need to be ready and know what i want to do and what i want to be. Which is theater. I am very late but sadly i just knew what i really want and passionate in and it is performing. I love performing ever since i was a kid but i never know my love being on stage, creating and acting that play could mean so much to me. I live in Indonesia and indonesia here there is no such thing as theater or performing arts, plays, drama. IT IS VERY RARE and only the professionals can apply for the job like a 17 year old girl who have been doing ballet ever since she was a baby. Me? As i say again, i just knew that i am passionate at this section and i really want to make this a dream come true. I’ve been taking dancing lessons but im not a big pro yet, i also suck at singing but im taking lessons and my dad doesnt allow me to pursuit my dream as he think i suck at it (well yeah obviously because i never actually have a big experience on theater only dance performances yeah) and i am only allowed to go there if i am able to recieve a scholarship. My dad wishes me to stay here and learn on interior design which i don’t really want to because it is kinda boring to have as a carrer. Im commenting here because i need help, i have no basic or skill or knowledge of to be a great theater player, it would be nice if someone could suggest me like an online teaching about the steps and basics to become a great theater person. My school grades aren’t that great and I just want to be a great performer that’s all, i can be really committed if i want to and yeah i want to, so please help me and reply back to my email:) ill be waiting☺️!!

Credit Robert Stolarik for The New York Times     Michael Rodgers came from California to New York City last month  to defy the odds of making a living as an actor, not to defy death by pedaling a secondhand bicycle through Midtown traffic. But, like so many aspiring actors taking a crack at the nation’s theater capital, Mr. Rodgers has been trying to save money any way he can. He is now looking for his third temporary home in three months, having exhausted what he called “the deal of the century”  — $100 for two weeks in the East Side apartment of a friend of a friend of a friend. To get around town, he bought a bike for $75 from “this fellow, Carlos” he met on the street. For weeks he rode it through traffic every day to join a small company of performers in what amounted to a master class on the sacrifices actors will make to get onstage in Manhattan. On a limited budget the group pulled together a two-week test run of a complicated, three-act play, “Epitaph for George Dillon,” with the hope that a producer might want to stage it. There was barely enough money to rent a small, shabby theater and buy costumes at consignment shops. For the director and the actors, some of whom had left behind jobs and families in California, there were no salaries and no reimbursement of expenses.

Denise Crosby left her husband and 9-year-old son in Pacific Palisades and talked her way into a temporary apartment in Harlem. Anna Garduño, the lead actress, has been sleeping on a fold-out couch in the Greenwich Village home office of some friends.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       In many ways it is that most common of theater stories — illustrating the struggles and sacrifices that hundreds, if not thousands, of aspiring performers make every year to get a new show, and a new career, off the ground in New York. “There’s this whole underground where you all help each other in the theater,” Ms. Garduño said, after she and two of her fellow actors spent the morning repainting walls in the 45th Street Theater. They had rented the theater earlier this month  for $3,500 a week to stage 14 performances as a showcase, a temporary run intended to draw attention to the actors and, in this case, a play that was last on Broadway almost 50 years ago. “Epitaph for George Dillon,” which the British playwright John Osborne wrote with Anthony Creighton, was  Mr. Osborne’s first notable work.      He is best remembered for his  next play,  “Look Back in Anger,” which was staged before “Epitaph for George Dillon.”   Under the rules of Actors Equity, the union, the maximum amount that can be spent on a showcase is $20,000,  a pittance compared with the millions it costs to stage a full-blown Broadway production. Ms. Garduño, who secured the rights to the play from Mr. Osborne’s estate, raised much of the money from friends and found ways to cut costs at every turn. When she learned that it would cost $1,000 to rent a curtain for the theater, she had one made for $200. Rather than pay $75 a night to have the theater provide a fire marshal, she convinced the assistant stage manager, Elle Aghabala, to go to Brooklyn and take the fire department’s test that qualified her to guard against a fire backstage. Within an hour of the final curtain call, a crew member dashed off to return the rented computer that had provided sound for the show, to avoid another day’s rental fee. The ad hoc troupe expended all of this effort and sacrifice on the long shot that somebody would be inspired to produce the play. At least, they hoped, it would lead to more work, preferably of the sort that pays. “It’s all a gamble,” Mr. Rodgers said of the pursuit of a career onstage. “I never thought I was a gambler, but I’m almost 40 and I’m still gambling at it.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He sold his 14-year-old Mercedes and other possessions for $4,000 before leaving Los Angeles and has been sleeping on a friend’s futon in the East Village next to a duffel bag that holds everything he owns, he said.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   “I have no idea where I’m going to be next month,” said Mr. Martin, who is 32. “I’m going day by day. I’m not thinking about the instability and all that stuff. I’m just grateful to be doing this.” Like the rest of the cast, Mr. Martin received no pay for the first 12 performances. But after that, Equity rules mandate that the players be paid $10 each per show. So each cast member got a check for $20 at the end of the run, or about 50 cents for each hour of performance. (The play ran for 2 hours and 45 minutes.). That meant that the actors collected less than the stage manager and his assistant, who each earned $100 and a Metrocard worth $81, but still more than the director, Larry Moss. Mr. Moss, who is also an acting coach, said he worked on the play because it had haunted him since he first read it about 30 years ago. He has assigned scenes from it to his students in acting workshops for years and has always wanted to revive it. “I never wanted to do plays that were already done  —  except for this play,” Mr. Moss said. “I’m getting nothing. But I’m getting everything. I’m getting to do the play.” Ms. Crosby and John Cirigliano, another cast member who lives in Southern California, said they had gladly dipped into their savings to finance their appearances in the showcase. “I can say now that I’ve done theater in New York, which gives you some credibility,” said Ms. Crosby, who spent time one weekend trying to drum up interest in the play at a sci-fi convention in Midtown. She was recognized there for having played Tasha Yar on “Star Trek: The Next Generation.” “If there’s anything worth saving for, it’s this,” Mr. Cirigliano, 60, said as he gestured toward the cluttered stage an hour before showtime one evening. “If nothing else happens with this production, it will be very satisfying. But we all hope it will move to a larger venue, so we can get paid.”   A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: The Odds Are as Big As Their Dreams.

The steps to get there can seem long and hard, but if you are willing to put in the work, you just may see your name in lights. Train hard, work hard and put your name out there at auditions and on the stage in New York City.         Steps    Part 1   Training to be a Broadway Actor           1   Take acting classes. Even if you think you are born with the natural talent to be an actor, you will need some legitimate training to list on your resume and help you get jobs. Find classes in your area to increase and practice your skills. This is also a great way to meet other professionals and aspiring actors. [1]   Consider a degree in theater from your local college or seek out classes at your local theater.  Colleges with highly respected acting programs in New York include Juilliard, Columbia and NYU.  Training programs are also available throughout New York City. Some respected companies are HB Studios and Atlantic Theater Company School.            2   Learn to dance. Most of the shows on Broadway are musicals. This means that not only must you be a good actor, but you will need skills in singing and dancing. Find a dance school which offers training in all of the different styles of dance used on Broadway, including ballet, tap, and jazz.  The more well-rounded your dance abilities are, the better you will be able to adapt to the style of any show.  Keep up with your dance practice. You can begin to lose strength and flexibility if you don’t dance and stretch regularly.           3   Find a voice coach. Once you can sing, dance and act, the theater world will deem you a “triple threat.” You will be able to provide everything required of a Broadway actor. The best way to train your voice is the personal attention of a vocal coach, who can find your range and fine tune your skills.  Look for coaches at your local colleges.  Consider asking a music director to work with you personally.           4   Perform at your local theaters before moving to New York. This will help you gain experience and build your resume. Gaining experience onstage is important to growing as a performer, as well as creating a name for yourself. If you are available for a role, take it and perform to the best of your ability, no matter the size of the part.         5   Take direction well. The director is there to help you and the other actors come together to tell the story. Listen to what the director says and perform your part. Learn from every experience no matter how small the role may be.  If the director is not giving much feedback on your performance. Ask specifically for input. Explore your role and ask questions about your character and performance.                 Part 2   Promoting Yourself as an Actor          1   Buy professional headshots. Headshots are photographs of your head and shoulders. Actors are required to have both a headshot and resume when submitting for a role. Headshot used to be black and white, but the current expectation is that headshots are full-color.  Make sure the picture is current and looks like you. If you age or change your hairstyle, you will need to get new headshots. [2]   Bring several different clothing options to the photoshoot and have pictures taken wearing different shirts. Don’t wear distracting patterns or colors. Keep your outfit simple so the focus is on your face. [3]            2   Build an acting resume. An acting resume should include your contact information, body specifications, experience, training, and special skills. List your most recent roles first and work your way backward. [4]   Your name should be at the top of the resume and in the largest font.  If you are a member of an acting union list the abbreviation for the union after your name.  If you have an agent, they will give you a stamp to add to your resume to replace your personal contact information.  List your height, weight, hair and eye color, and make sure that it is accurate.  Never lie on your resume. Only list work you have actually completed.           3   Go to auditions. Find the auditions in your area and go to any which are offering a role you would fit. Auditioning itself is a good way to continue working on your skills. It is an opportunity to perform for influential casting directors and artistic directors. You can find auditions through postings like backstage.com, on the “call board” at the AEA office, or your agent can search and submit on your behalf.  Be prepared to deal with a lot of rejection. There are any number of reasons you may not be the best fit for a particular role, and there are a lot of other actors looking to make it on Broadway. The competition is abundant and you will audition many times without being offered a role. [5]   Treat every audition seriously. Even if you are not a perfect match for this role you are auditioning for, you can impress the casting agent or artistic director who may then call you in for another role in the future.           4   Perform in plays and musicals. The best way for Broadway producers to see what you are capable of is to see you in action. Perform onstage off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway on your way to Broadway. Start making a name for yourself as a performer to get closer to Broadway.         5   Write a bio for play programs. A bio, or biography, should consist of about four of five sentences and highlight your past work as an actor. It is a little blurb which allows the audience to learn more about you and your career. If you have a lot of acting credits, choose four or five of the top performances or roles, and mention that the ones listed are some of your favorite roles to date. [6]   Although you will be writing the bio yourself, you should use third person vernacular like “he” and “she.”  List your achievements, credits and performance history using full sentences rather than a literal list.  You can include your training, and some personal information to endear yourself to the reader.  You can also list film and television credits in a theatrical bio.            Part 3   Becoming a Professional          1   Make the move to New York City. You may be able to audition for a Broadway show if you live in a major city which is hosting auditions, but if you really want to make it on Broadway, you should live in New York. You will be more available to your agent and have many more auditions available to you. [7]   New York can be very expensive. Be sure that you have savings to last you for several months once you arrive. The average monthly rent on a 900 square foot unit in New York City is $2815. Add utilities and the higher cost of food, and you can plan on needing at least $3500 per month.  Many people live on the outskirts of the city in Queens or Brooklyn, and some even live across the river in New Jersey. These can be cheaper options than living in Manhattan, and the public transit system makes the commute quick, easy and cheap.           2   Join Actor’s Equity Association. Actor’s Equity Association, also referred to as Equity and AEA, is a union for actors in America. It’s purpose is to provide protection for the professional actor and enforce guidelines regarding pay, breaks, insurance and other professional needs. On the other hand, many professional theater companies will only use Equity actors, especially in leading roles, as a way to weed out actors with less experience. [8]   In order to join you must first be eligible. You may be able to join if you are cast in a production under an Equity contract.  You may be allowed to join Equity if you are a member of one of their sister unions, SAG-AFTRA, AGMA, AGVA, or GIAA. You must have been a member for at least a year, remain in good standing and have performed a significant role under their jurisdiction.  You can register as an Equity Membership Candidate, or EMC, to earn credit toward membership by working at an Equity theater. The cost to register is $100, and you must work at least 50 weeks in an Equity house to become eligible to apply for membership.           3   Acquire a talent agent. Broadway stages often only work with talent agencies when they are looking to cast important roles for a Broadway show. Using a talent agent helps streamline their process, since the agent will knows their actors and can submit only the people who they know could fit the role. Having a talent agent is going to be necessary to getting in the door of a Broadway audition if you want a lead role.  Submit your headshot and resume to agents in New York City along with a cover letter.  Ask other actors which agent they use and if you can use that actor as a reference in your cover letter.  Invite agents to come see you perform when you are in a show.           4   Work hard and get along with your directors and fellow actors. Your performance onstage is very important, but your behavior off-stage is just as important if not more important. Broadway professionals and casting agents all work in the same circles. It is likely that someone who has not worked with you will consult others asking about their experience working with you before they offer you a role. [9]   Protect your reputation by being on time, following direction, and being respectful to everyone on the cast and crew.  Emotions are a large part of theatrical work. Do your best to keep the emotions in the performance and stay logical and collected when you are dealing with others off-stage.

But you miss every single shot you don't make, and Broadway is no exception! Start from the bottom: school productions, community plays, and work your way up.

The steps to get there can seem long and hard, but if you are willing to put in the work, you just may see your name in lights. Train hard, work hard and put your name out there at auditions and on the stage in New York City.         Steps    Part 1   Training to be a Broadway Actor           1   Take acting classes. Even if you think you are born with the natural talent to be an actor, you will need some legitimate training to list on your resume and help you get jobs. Find classes in your area to increase and practice your skills. This is also a great way to meet other professionals and aspiring actors. [1]   Consider a degree in theater from your local college or seek out classes at your local theater.  Colleges with highly respected acting programs in New York include Juilliard, Columbia and NYU.  Training programs are also available throughout New York City. Some respected companies are HB Studios and Atlantic Theater Company School.            2   Learn to dance. Most of the shows on Broadway are musicals. This means that not only must you be a good actor, but you will need skills in singing and dancing. Find a dance school which offers training in all of the different styles of dance used on Broadway, including ballet, tap, and jazz.  The more well-rounded your dance abilities are, the better you will be able to adapt to the style of any show.  Keep up with your dance practice. You can begin to lose strength and flexibility if you don’t dance and stretch regularly.           3   Find a voice coach. Once you can sing, dance and act, the theater world will deem you a “triple threat.” You will be able to provide everything required of a Broadway actor. The best way to train your voice is the personal attention of a vocal coach, who can find your range and fine tune your skills.  Look for coaches at your local colleges.  Consider asking a music director to work with you personally.           4   Perform at your local theaters before moving to New York. This will help you gain experience and build your resume. Gaining experience onstage is important to growing as a performer, as well as creating a name for yourself. If you are available for a role, take it and perform to the best of your ability, no matter the size of the part.         5   Take direction well. The director is there to help you and the other actors come together to tell the story. Listen to what the director says and perform your part. Learn from every experience no matter how small the role may be.  If the director is not giving much feedback on your performance. Ask specifically for input. Explore your role and ask questions about your character and performance.                 Part 2   Promoting Yourself as an Actor          1   Buy professional headshots. Headshots are photographs of your head and shoulders. Actors are required to have both a headshot and resume when submitting for a role. Headshot used to be black and white, but the current expectation is that headshots are full-color.  Make sure the picture is current and looks like you.

An acting resume should include your contact information, body specifications, experience, training, and special skills. List your most recent roles first and work your way backward. [4]   Your name should be at the top of the resume and in the largest font.  If you are a member of an acting union list the abbreviation for the union after your name.  If you have an agent, they will give you a stamp to add to your resume to replace your personal contact information.  List your height, weight, hair and eye color, and make sure that it is accurate.  Never lie on your resume. Only list work you have actually completed.           3   Go to auditions. Find the auditions in your area and go to any which are offering a role you would fit. Auditioning itself is a good way to continue working on your skills. It is an opportunity to perform for influential casting directors and artistic directors. You can find auditions through postings like backstage.com, on the “call board” at the AEA office, or your agent can search and submit on your behalf.  Be prepared to deal with a lot of rejection. There are any number of reasons you may not be the best fit for a particular role, and there are a lot of other actors looking to make it on Broadway.

Start making a name for yourself as a performer to get closer to Broadway.         5   Write a bio for play programs. A bio, or biography, should consist of about four of five sentences and highlight your past work as an actor. It is a little blurb which allows the audience to learn more about you and your career. If you have a lot of acting credits, choose four or five of the top performances or roles, and mention that the ones listed are some of your favorite roles to date. [6]   Although you will be writing the bio yourself, you should use third person vernacular like “he” and “she.”  List your achievements, credits and performance history using full sentences rather than a literal list.  You can include your training, and some personal information to endear yourself to the reader.  You can also list film and television credits in a theatrical bio.            Part 3   Becoming a Professional          1   Make the move to New York City. You may be able to audition for a Broadway show if you live in a major city which is hosting auditions, but if you really want to make it on Broadway, you should live in New York. You will be more available to your agent and have many more auditions available to you. [7]   New York can be very expensive. Be sure that you have savings to last you for several months once you arrive. The average monthly rent on a 900 square foot unit in New York City is $2815. Add utilities and the higher cost of food, and you can plan on needing at least $3500 per month.

These can be cheaper options than living in Manhattan, and the public transit system makes the commute quick, easy and cheap.           2   Join Actor’s Equity Association. Actor’s Equity Association, also referred to as Equity and AEA, is a union for actors in America. It’s purpose is to provide protection for the professional actor and enforce guidelines regarding pay, breaks, insurance and other professional needs. On the other hand, many professional theater companies will only use Equity actors, especially in leading roles, as a way to weed out actors with less experience. [8]   In order to join you must first be eligible. You may be able to join if you are cast in a production under an Equity contract.  You may be allowed to join Equity if you are a member of one of their sister unions, SAG-AFTRA, AGMA, AGVA, or GIAA. You must have been a member for at least a year, remain in good standing and have performed a significant role under their jurisdiction.  You can register as an Equity Membership Candidate, or EMC, to earn credit toward membership by working at an Equity theater. The cost to register is $100, and you must work at least 50 weeks in an Equity house to become eligible to apply for membership.           3   Acquire a talent agent. Broadway stages often only work with talent agencies when they are looking to cast important roles for a Broadway show. Using a talent agent helps streamline their process, since the agent will knows their actors and can submit only the people who they know could fit the role.

It is likely that someone who has not worked with you will consult others asking about their experience working with you before they offer you a role.

She may be able to help you along the way.  Dress professionally when going to rehearsals/auditions  A lot of people say that you will make it "eventually." The honest truth is this: a lot of people will not make it. And no matter how hard you try, you could be one of the ones who doesn't make it. But you miss every single shot you don't make, and Broadway is no exception! Start from the bottom: school productions, community plays, and work your way up.  When in doubt, always prepare a song and monologue for an audition.

Like those at the top of their game in any profession, it’s easy to be inspired by those on The Great White Way, but like other professions, you don’t start out as the CEO of a company or an olympic athlete. You start at the bottom and with a lot of hard work, determination and luck, might get a shot if you take every opportunity that comes your way.  There are basics that every single person who has made it has taken. Though their paths have all been different, here are the things you can do to begin your path to Broadway:  Train, Train, Train  There is nothing natural about standing in front of large groups of strangers, speaking someone else’s words or singing someone else’s songs, while turning partially away from the person to whom you’re talking.  Whether your training takes place in a high school classroom, in a well-established theatre conservatory, under the tutelage of a great teacher in a weekly class, or in each and every show you can get into, you can learn both from the critique you receive directly, and from watching others and listening to the critique they get.  Take acting classes, dance classes, voice classes (whether you’re looking to do musicals or not), get a voice teacher – and do things that seemingly have nothing to do with theatre…  Those who played an instrument had an upper hand in casting for the recent revival of Sweeney Todd; those who were cheerleaders got a leg up in Lysistrata Jones; ballroom dancers have gotten huge legs up in numerous shows. If you’re passionate about anything – continue to train there as well, you’ll never know if it might help you – and if nothing more, you’ll have something else that gives you joy, make you a healthier, more rounded person and expose you to more of the world and more of the incredible people you might one day play.  Network  Connections are a huge portion of this industry. The biggest legs up happen when someone you’ve worked with before recommends you. As much as the diva personality circulates as the norm in this industry, it’s unlikely to ever help you – divas get cast despite their eccentric nature. If you work hard, are fun to work with and are you – directors, writers, stage managers and producers will want to work with you again and might bring you in for consideration in their next project, or suggest you to a friend who’s looking for X for their next project.  Always Say Yes  If you’re asked to do a reading, to meet with someone for a quick lunch, to sing in a cabaret, to do an interview with Seth Rudetsky, anything – say yes. You’ll never know who will be in the audience, whether that writer may go on to become the next David Mamet, or be meeting with him later that afternoon.  See as Much Theatre as You Can  See as many shows as you can – both directly in your chosen area and outside of it. You can learn by watching others, noting what works and what doesn’t and trying to dig in to discover just what it was that made a performance work so wonderfully. And don’t just see Broadway shows, get Off-Broadway, Off-Off-Off-Off Broadway, see West End productions, dance productions, experimental art pieces, the show your cousin is doing at some summerstock theatre upstate. Then sit back and think about what worked and what didn’t and why.  Take Care of Yourself So You Look and Feel Good  And get to the gym – yes, everyone has as much trouble as you do getting there – but if you’re going to become an actor, your looks are part of your package, so tone it and get into the best shape you can.  Also take care of your skin and learn how to apply makeup, invest in clothing and shoes that look good on you, is comfortable and allows you to move.  As much as everyone would like to believe that looks are only a part of the equation — they are a big part and form your first impression. If you look good, hold yourself well and walk into a room feeling good about yourself, you have a leg up over at least half of your competition.  Show Up and Move On  You will be rejected over and over again. You will spend months preparing for an audition and not get a callback. You will not even be considered for a role you know you are perfect for because they decided they want a veteran actress playing it, or producers think Adele will bring in more ticket sales. You might be an inch taller than the man they want to cast as the male lead and so miss out. Or it may be some reason even more inane – the director just ended a relationship with someone who looks like you or he really wants someone with freckles  Most of the time you’ll never know and you’ll never hear back. You’ll have poured out your heart and soul and will be told “we’ll be in touch” and left in the dark.  But your job if you really want to work in this industry is to grow a thick skin, shake it off, and show up for the next audition. To again pour out your heart and soul – to invest every ounce of your being in the next one, most likely to be rejected once again.  Everyone has different techniques for dealing with this – one actress figured out that she would get a callback for every 18 auditions she did, so she would keep track. For every rejection she got, she would put a big “X” and think – I’m one rejection closer to a callback!  It’s an incredibly hard thing to do but it’s part of the job – no matter how famous, how talented, how successful, every actor faces rejection every time they step into a room or submit themselves for a part. But you’ll never get anywhere if you don’t show up first.  Work Hard  After you’ve celebrated when you do get a callback and the incredible day you get cast, hit the ground running – start your research, learn your lines and throw yourself head-first into the role.  During rehearsals, listen to your director, be nice to your stage manager, learn from and work with your fellow actors and soak it all up. Try to stay away from gossip, stay humble and be kind – hopefully you’ll work with some of these same people again in the future. Don’t make the reason you don’t get cast the next time that you snapped at the stage manager during the run of this show.  It’s a hard life and everyone says that if you can imagine yourself doing anything else you should do that instead. Just keep training, networking, saying yes, seeing theatre, taking care of yourself, showing up and working hard — because you know, like everyone in this industry, it’s worth all the heartache and effort, because there’s nothing like the moment the curtain rises and you open your mouth to say or sing your first word.  Advice Directly from the Pros:  Betty Buckley : Study, study, study. Practice, practice, practice. : )  Constantine Maroulis : Do everything u can…community theater to school plays, work hard respect the craft and be good to all – never know who they become.  Nick Adams : Find a great acting teacher. Take as many classes as you can in all disciplines. Train. See everything!  Natalie Hill : Study & train & take classes from casting directors then go to open calls & nail it!  Diana DeGarmo : Be a sponge & take everything in-educate yourself! Music, shows, directors,  choreographers, dance, etc – all of it! & have FUN! 🙂  Erin Wilson : Get ready to work like you never have before. Research, be prepared, know your type, be kind, find an outside hobby – sanity!  Howard Sherman : You don’t become a “Broadway actor.” You become an actor and then, perhaps, you get cast in a Broadway show.  Nicole Tori : Lots of hard work, persistence, training, networking and LUCK!  Lexi Lawson : Pray! JK – my advice is to make sure you are fully prepared (though I always have a tendency of always messing up my dialogue) but I go in prepared. And go in loving what it is. The creative team will see if the passion in you pour out if it’s a project you absolutely love and want to be a part of. Good luck to my musical munchkins.  What’s Your Advice?

You can all go home. Sorry for getting your hopes up like that. The truth is, you have a better chance of being hit by a satellite than by fame. And just so we're all on the same page, fame is exactly the point of all this. Any ambition to act for the sake of artistic satisfaction was run down and sucked into the wheel wells under the sports car of fame long ago, because fame makes more money and it's just cooler.   "We just wanted to stop for a minute and say, 'You're welcome.'"    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     Now most of you probably don't believe me, and that's fine. You've heard that the odds of success are slim, but you're different from all those other people, you have been singled out by providence for this. Parents, teachers and community theater directors have told you your entire life that you are gifted -- that you are born to make emotions with your face under camera and stage lights, a face that was too optimistic or too young to devastate with brutal honesty. Well, I can't see your faces, and I have some bad news. Here are five good reasons your career path will make you absolutely miserable.  Advertisement   5 You Aren't Building a Real Skill Set   When your dream is to be an actor, you don't have the luxury of simultaneously perusing a fallback dream. That's why you'll never see a struggling actor holding down a full-time job as a marine biologist. Acting is a jealous and needy career that doesn't like the thought of you keeping your options open. You'll need a job that allows you to leave at a moment's notice for auditions, usually for two or three hours at a time. Or, assuming you are fortunate enough to be cast in anything, you need a job that allows you to miss work for a week at the very least. The logical solution is to work at night at a restaurant or bar. The trouble, however, is that most of these jobs were never intended to be careers. They have high turnover rates and offer little in terms of personal satisfaction. And that will all seem fine at first -- great, even -- for building that romantic sense of humility you intend to wear once you're famous. Taking orders from customers and folding napkin fans in wine glasses is just part of the struggle that you will remember fondly while masturbating poolside to your own biography.   "Ooh yeah. Keep toiling, right there."  That is, until your friends outside of the entertainment industry start developing actual skill sets that lead to raises, promotions and the general advancement of their careers. Everyone who entered the work force along with you will gradually move into better jobs because they've built up experience and because that's how nearly every other profession is designed to function. Meanwhile, there's no guarantee that you will book a role,   ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement       ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement       ever . All the experience you'll be racking up will just be preparing you for a life in the service industry. Sure, you will still be honing your skills as an actor through classes and auditions, but until your acting resume includes more than school plays and student films, it won't help you get a job, because ... 4 Most Roles Have Nothing to Do With Acting   Here is an innocuous commercial for Listerine:    There are three people featured for about four seconds apiece in that commercial. Each one of them is an actor who had to audition for that role. That may not sound like much, but take a minute to consider exactly what that entails: All three of them, without a doubt, started with dreams of being respected actors. They likely struggled for weeks if not months to find an agent, and paid upwards of $500 to have headshots taken and printed. Then they drove to an audition in the middle of a workweek and waited in a waiting room for an hour with 20 to 30 other people who looked exactly like them before being wrangled into a small room four or five at a time to say their names and, finally, to swish. They stood there for a few seconds pretending to swish mouthwash around their mouths. That's it. That's 80 percent of all the auditions you will go to. Now consider the hundreds of people who also auditioned and didn't get that part. All of that energy, time and money amounted to 10 seconds of moving their cheeks around for a casting director who had already seen scores of other eager young actors do the exact same thing.   "Yeah, I get it. You're doing like a crazy thing. Really nice work, there."    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement        ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     Those three actors weren't hired for that commercial based on their acting ability or really anything that they could control. They were hired because they had a look that a Listerine ad sales department thought might sell more bottles, so the purpose of all those auditions was only to be sure that everyone actually looked like their headshots and that they were capable of ballooning their cheeks. But surely that's just a commercial, right? Actors also audition for meaty roles in movies and television, acting must be the deciding factor there. Well actually, no. 3 You Will Never Be Considered for Roles That Require Acting   Any struggling actors who have never had a significant role before are not members of the Screen Actors Guild. SAG was designed as a union to ensure that actors were paid fair wages for their work. Nearly every movie and television show has to operate within the guidelines of SAG, which means that they can only hire SAG actors or else they have to   ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     pay a hefty fine to cast someone outside the union. Naturally, studios will cast SAG members over nonmembers every time. So how do you become a member? Well, that's where things get completely absurd. The rules of SAG state, "Performers are eligible to join Screen Actors Guild after working on a SAG film in a principal role." So just to clarify, no one will cast you unless you are already in the union, and you can't get into the union until you are cast. A director has to like you so much that he or she is willing to trust you with a primary role despite the fact that you have no previous experience in film and be willing to pay a fine just to have you in that role. Now remember before when I mentioned that there are hundreds of other people who look exactly like you auditioning? At least 50 of them will already have their SAG cards.   "Good luck!"  That still leaves you with non-SAG or   ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement       ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     Ultra-Low Budget SAG productions. The only trouble there is ...   2 Your Faith Will Be Exploited   Acting requires about as much faith as religious fanaticism. Performers rely on directors and editors like zealots rely on God; both of them are just doing their best and hoping that the higher powers don't make them look like an idiot in the end. Actress Rosalind Russell once said, "Acting is standing up naked and turning around very slowly." The point being, actors have to play pretend so earnestly that an audience is willing to forget that it's really just someone standing in front of a green screen, reacting to a water weenie.    That's Faith.  As an actor, you also have to trust implicitly that writers, directors and editors have your best interest at heart. And generally speaking, they don't. Actors have an arguably deserved reputation for being kind of shitty people. Anyone making a movie, particularly a low-budget or non-union film, will try to interact with the talent as little as possible for fear that they'll   ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement       ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     want something . In addition, a director has a thousand other things to worry about than whether or not an actor looks completely ridiculous. The consequence, however, is far more severe for you than anyone else. You are the one immortalized on camera with a crying face that looks eerily similar to a pooping face, or while wearing nothing but a dress that is subtly but irrefutably see-through under set lights. Even if you luck into a film, commercial or show that does well and of which you are proud to be a part, the saddest truth of all is still to come ... 1 You Won't Make Enough Money to Live On   Among the miniscule number of actors who actually book jobs, there is an even tinier fraction of people who manage to make a living doing it. First, there is the matter of digging yourself out of a hole of expenses. The costs surrounding a struggling actor can seem almost like a malicious scheme to take money from naive, handsome people. I've already mentioned that headshots cost hundreds of dollars, but you'll need one for commercials, and one for dramas, and one for vampire movies, and one for sports stories. Ultimately, you will have around five different headshots of which you will need to print hundreds. On top of that, you can expect to do the whole process over again in three years when you no longer look like the person in the picture. You can also prepare to sink around $60 a week into parking tickets. This will obviously vary from city to city, but in Los Angeles, there isn't a reliable public transportation system to get you everywhere you need to go for auditions. Driving is the only option, and metered parking is ubiquitous. An audition can take anywhere from 10 minutes to two hours, so you never really know how much time you'll need, and you can't run out in the middle of an audition to feed the meter. So be prepared to collect at least one parking ticket a week.    "Hahaha. Fuck you for following your dreams."  Lastly, when you do finally get a job that pays you actual money, you will owe around 15 percent of that to a manager and 10 percent of it to an agent, all before taxes. These are the people responsible for getting you auditions and, ironically, ensuring that you aren't screwed over once you book a job. Add actual taxes to that and your take is less than 50 percent of whatever dollar amount appears in the contract. So, assuming you are doing a SAG Ultra-Low Budget shoot because you aren't a member of the union yet, you will probably be paid around $100 a day, of which you will actually take home about $40, or roughly the price of a Greyhound ticket back home.

I hope to study acting at a drama college in the next few years, because I want to be actor-who-sings, and do plays/musicals. I aspire to be on the Broadway stage. I have the burning desire; the passion. But then I think to myself  Whats the point?  I mean really, so many people like me  millions, have tried and probably failed  where are the other Irish people like me with dreams who have ended up on the West End or Broadway stage and have stayed there?  Is there any point to keep this dream?  I mean, I dont even want to tour with a show from this country that may play Broadway and then just come back home and forget about that experience, etc I have been getting proper, professional singing training from a young age, and want to continue doing so, and I want to get proper training in acting too. Technique and training is very important to me, and as I said I have the passion as well.  Does anyone understand where Im coming from?  What should I do?

Most actors don't make it to Broadway, and those that do usually do so only once or twice during the course of a lifelong career. When entering the business, one's goal should be simply to make a living, with Broadway as a "wouldn't that be nice" sort of secondary goal.

"The Spectacle has, indeed, an emotional attraction of its own, but, of all the parts, it is the least artistic, and connected least with the art of poetry. For the power of Tragedy, we may be sure, is felt even apart from representation and actors.

(No matter which medium in which you hope to work.) It's got to be the work that you love, not the possible stardom.  At some point in your journey, others will start asking you if it's time to "try something else" or "move on" or even time to "get your head out of the clouds". Only YOU can decide you've tried long enough. Some people can hold on for many years, waiting and trying. Others much less. YOU will know when it's the right time to give up (if it comes to that.)  Dream big, live realistically.   If we're not having fun, then why are we doing it?

But then I saw too many times exactly what people can lose - I've seen many wonderful young people, with terrific optimism and joy and positive energy, become dark, depressed, and bitter, because they felt that they had failed.  Now I say - if you can think of anything else at all that would make you happy, do that. The chances are astronomically against you that you'll even be able to make a modest living at performing - even that modest achievement is reached by only a tiny fraction of those who try to make it.

It's rejection after rejection after rejection. Acting makes you feel like you're going to trip. It's a trip in which you're going to be humiliated, get your feelings hurt, mocked, made fun of. People are going to trample on your feelings and they are going to reject you. Unless you have rhinoceros skin, it's a kind of business that can crush the life out of you. You have to be very, very tough.  I also don't think that actors have the best seat at the table. If you really want to have the power, you have to be a huge star and then you see what happens. They go into producing, directing, they open their own production companies, because that's where the power is. Long after your smile, your million dollar looks, and beautiful voice have faded, you keep a place at the table because of the other things you bring to your worknot the acting, the other auxiliary stuff. If you're clever enough, or talented enough I should say, to be a writer, or a director or producer, any of those things, you are set for life. But if you have to keep auditioning for your work, day after day, week after week, your whole life through, you're always in line for a job or never assured. Unless you're in a repertory company, which these days is very rare, you're never assured for work. You're always pushing. Imagine if someone was working in a business, an office, a factory, anywhere, having to audition for their job every week; having to go to a new boss every week, sit down, and tell them their capabilities and qualifications for their work. It's soul destroying.  I don't say things that young actors want to hear, because I'm telling them the truth about how damn hard it is to get ahead in the business. But you know something? If they are so powerfully motivated, they do it anyway. If people are burning with that hot flame to be actors, I think that's great. But I also say don't be just an actor. You've got the talent to make your mark as an actor, that's great, look at the other actors around you who did lots of other things as well as acting. You will see that that's a way to choreograph your life, so that you're not just acting. You have other quivers to your bow, more bullets in your gun, to keep you going when the acting jobs start to dry up."  "There is no problem so big that it cannot be run away from."

Schulz hmpeterson  Featured Actor joined:6/19/08  Featured Actor joined: 6/19/08      CAREER ADVICE REQUIRED! - Is Broadway just a pipe dream?? #18 Posted: 2/8/11 at 6:59pm   Your best bet is to go on American Idol or become a pop/rock star. Seriously. Look who is making it to Broadway...Constantine Maroulis, Ace Young, Tamyra Gray, Diana DeGarmo, Melissa Etheridge. Even Billie Joe Armstrong is on Broadway!! Granted that's a little different considering the show. But still.  Unfortunately it seems like Broadway would rather have "name" people these days to sell shows which give the hard working theater actor and even bigger disadvantage.  In all seriousness, I've always been a person to say, if you have a dream and you think you have the talent, the guts, and the drive...go for it! You will never know unless you try. Wouldn't you rather have someone tell you no 20 times then possibly never know if you could have gotten a yes?

It's actually kind of funny--I went to one of the top high schools for performing talent in the state (a regular, public high school, but we were consistently nominated for/won awards at the state-wide theater awards). All the consistent leads in the shows realized it was just a fun hobby, went on to college for science, law, and economics, and they are now making successful livings as engineers, bankers, consultants, and lawyers. The chorus members, who didn't get the leads, all majored in musical theater or acting, and are all now working hourly, repetitive jobs, with the occasional Disney cruise ship for the lucky ones. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with a service-based hourly job, but most of these people are either longing for college where they were guaranteed a part in every show and/or wishing they had focused on a career and continued with theater as a hobby that might work out if they were lucky.  So I guess my moral/advice is contain your expectations, use your drive to make yourself better, but always see a professional performance career as a lucky, fortunate outcome, not the end-all goal. You may decrease your chances of success slightly by hedging your bets and focusing on a career as well instead of throwing yourself 100% into theater, but on average you will be much happier.

If in five years she was able to sustain herself as an actress, meaning acting provided her primary source of income, then she would feel as if she had made it. If not she would have thrown in the towel and moved on with her life.  And may I add thank god she achieved that (and more). It would be hard to imagine what life would be like without her making us laugh.

However, as I look at all the audition requirements I noticed that a dance section is part of the audition.  I have been doing theater for five years now and have never claimed to be a dancer. I have never taken dance classes and my only dance experience is from musicals and showchoir. I am just worried that my lack of dance experience will hurt my chances of acceptance into these programs. How much do schools take the dance portion into account? What kind of dancing do auditions consist of? What level of difficulty would the dancing be? Do I even have a shot of getting accepted with my lack of dance experience?  Without the dance portion I'd say I would have an excellent chance of being accepted into many of the programs I'm applying to, but the dance audition has me worried. Any answers you could provide to these questions, or any advice you could give would be most appreciated.  Thanks, Jason  "I seem to have wandered into the BRAIN load-out thread...

The only really tough college audition I had was for FSU, which had a complete ballet combination as the dance section. I would suggest to start taking dance lessons as soon as you can because it can only make you more marketable in the future. Best of luck!   iluvtheatertrash  Broadway Legend joined:11/9/04  Broadway Legend joined: 11/9/04      re: Question about Musical Theater Major #2 Posted: 5/14/05 at 2:04pm   I've been through the process twice.  A lot of times, the dance audition is actually just PLACEMENT. If you're accepted to the school, the dance audition is good for them to figure out what dance class you'll belong in. Beginner, Advanced, etc.  "I know now that theatre saved my life." - Susan Stroman dry2olives Profile  Broadway Star joined:9/30/03  Broadway Star joined: 9/30/03      re: Question about Musical Theater Major #3 Posted: 5/14/05 at 2:05pm   Just a guess, but I would think that any school with a musical theatre program would take into consideration that reletively few students will be equally skilled at acting, singing and dancing. They probably get quite a few dancers who don't sing well and good singers and dancers who need improvement with their acting. It's always a good idea for a singing actor to have some basic dance knowledge, but I wouldn't worry about being rejected solely on the basis of not being a good dancer.

It is very helpful to actually hear from people who have already been through the entire audition process.

CCM you must dance. NYU (Cap 21) you must dance. U of Michigan you must dance. They will not consider you without a dance audition.    Ignorance is temporary. Stupidity last forever.

They know that people are at all sorts of levels of dancing talent. Blow them away with your vocal and acting talents and it won't be too much of a problem. Although looking into taking some basic movement classes before your audition might not be a bad idea. :) Good luck!  Come see "Travis Tanner"!! This year at Fringe NYC 2005! :)

The want you to show a strong suit in either Singing, Acting, or Dancing, and talent-though not necessarily A LOT--in the other.  Which is funny cuz my singing audition was good, my acting mediocre and my dancing horrible and the still took me!

It's harder when you have to learn the steps and the combination at the same time, so taking a class to learn the steps will help you. You'll probably one need just the one class too, you don't necessarily need years of dance lessons......

Not to mention, you will be a lot more marketable if you can dance, sing, and act.

(Except me). I was so lost for that portion of the audition and they rejected me, telling me to go get more dance training. I say if you have time before your audition, go sign up for some dance classes just so you can get a bit of practice beforehand. I was simply not ready for it.

Carnegie Mellon, on the other hand, gave me the impression their dance auditions were tough and they were part of acceptance to the program, not just for placement.

Tisch does not require a dance audition as part of its artistic review process. If you're an experienced dancer, you can schedule your audition with the advanced dance included but otherwise there's no dance in the audition, just monologues and songs. And as others have said, as a male, you have a definite advantage. Good luck!     « Back to the Message Board        Hot Stories      Review Roundup: Did the Critics Think MEAN GIRLS Was Fetch?

Lost every day for Hamilton since Feb day 1; recently stopped due to being too busy to remember to check personal email at 4pm every day. Took me forever to win American In Paris and unfortunately not before Robbie left. Won On Your Feet! in Jan (first or second try?) but was in a meeting and couldn't pay in time. Lost a couple of times after that -- lost interest. Never tried for Aladdin/Wicked/Lion King -- no interest in seeing again.  Haven't tried Cats yet. In general, winning for me seems to come in streaks as well, cross-platform (like I might win a combo of Jujamcyn, Telecharge, and TodayTix in the same month, then total dry spell for months). I typically either win within 3 tries, or it takes several weeks/months of entering every day to win (or locked out completely, show closes). So I'm surprised when people complain they've "entered 5 times already and lost." I gotta roll my eyes so hard. It's why it's called a lottery...

I won for Cats about two weeks back, and I've even gotten into Hamilton. However, to echo a sentiment that I'm seeing throughout this thread, I have that one lottery that I just can't seem to win. I've been entering Something Rotten 's drawing on and off since last summer, and I am just having no luck with it.

I also a couple other telecharge lotteries and have not won either. I've got to say I'm jealous for all the people who have won a lot of these Broadway direct and telecharge lotteries.

"The choice may have been mistaken, the choosing was not." sorano916  Broadway Star joined:8/6/08  Broadway Star joined: 8/6/08      Broadway Direct Lotteries #23 Posted: 8/10/16 at 4:54pm   I know that there's probably some sort of algorithm but are your chances greater based on how many tickets you put down?  Like for "Hamilton", there are 21 tickets. Does the system go through all of the entries and fill in if needed (say, there were 9 pairs and 3 singles)? Or does it do pairs first and then a single for the last spot, which in that case, singles are at a disadvantage?  I remember for TodayTix, when I won lotto for a show a while ago, they actually called me to confirm how many tickets I wanted (I could keep the two or go down to a single). I don't know if they do that anymore, though.   slumdogdelaware Profile  Leading Actor joined:1/7/16  Leading Actor joined: 1/7/16      Broadway Direct Lotteries #24 Posted: 8/10/16 at 4:58pm   I always do 1 because a.) I hate winning a lotto and then the other person bails, and b.) if there is an algorithm, a person asking for 1 ticket has a better chance at being selected than 2. For example, if the theatre has an odd number of available seats for the lotto, then you're more likely to win since it'll skip over anyone asking for 2 when it comes to it.

There's no skill involved, no rhyme or reason. It's a lottery. Keep trying! Thats like my Grandmother entering the Powerball for 42 years everyday and never winning and saying she's "not good at it."

It could mean you are in an ensemble role, it could mean you have a supporting role, it could mean you got a lead, or it could mean you didn't get cast at all. You can never read too much into these things, it'll only stress you out and make the wait for the cast list more difficult.   haterobics Profile  Broadway Legend joined:3/29/14  Broadway Legend joined: 3/29/14      What do callbacks mean? #4 Posted: 11/7/15 at 11:31pm   But after a while I caught on...

It could mean many things, but it most likely  means you are no luck get being considered for major roles.  You might have been placed in a smaller role, chorus, or not cast.  Feeling confident in your audition is great, but you might not be what they are looking for for any variety of reasons.  MY callbacks are usually about being "good enough", but determining if one is RIGHT enough.  I have never cast a MAJOR role to someone that did not get a call back... even if I'm fairly certain on a part....they also need to be seen with other actors to be sure the fit is right.   If we're not having fun, then why are we doing it?

"MY callbacks are usually about being "good enough", but determining if one is RIGHT enough.  I have never cast a MAJOR role to someone that did not get a call back... even if I'm fairly certain on a part....they also need to be seen with other actors to be sure the fit is right. "  Way back when I was in High School I had done professional regional and stock shows and was always under the impression that if you didn't get a callback you weren't cast in the show at all. Whether it was for a lead or chorus and when doing school shows I assumed it was the same.  I had a pretty big ego being young and naive and My freshman and Sophomore year in HS I was cast as pretty major supporting characters in my school show. Being a [male] dancer though, I knew I would always get a dance role even if I fought for or was right for a lead. So when my junior year rolled around and my school was doing a big dance heavy show I assumed I would absolutely get the role I wanted and had practiced the song for callbacks for weeks before the audition. The callback list came out and my name wasn't on the list at all and I was devastated, pissed, and stunned.  I stayed at school the day off callbacks and as soon as they ended I went and talked to the director and music director to calmly and nicely ask why I wasn't called back. Turns out they didn't call me back because they figured they were just going to offer me that role and didn't need to see me at callbacks. However, during the callback process they realized there was a senior they could use in that role and it didn't have to be a dance heavy role and another  supporting character needed to be a dancer. So they offered him the role and gave me the other role..... The show was 42nd street and the role I wanted was Billy, but ended up getting Andy the choreographer.  I guess my point is that sometimes you can be considered the right person for a role and the creative team decide they don't need to see you at callbacks. But in my case, not getting the callback didn't allow me the chance to read and sing for the role and prove I was the right person. If they had called me back and I still was offered Andy-- that is another story. Or even if they chose to lie to me and tell me they already knew I was going to be cast as Andy I would have accepted that.  So it does happen..... However, as a director even if I think I know who is going to be a specific role and that I don't need callbacks for that person, I absolutely will still call them back because of that experience in HS.

I have a really important audition coming up. It's an EPA. I'm currently non-union but I have been waiting forever for this show to hold auditions. I've been the lead in non-professional productions of this particular show twice, and I have the experience and the familiarity with this show to really give this one hell of a shot. On the other hand, I know how EPAs work, and I am bracing myself for disappointment. I know my chances of even being seen are very slim since I am currently non-union, and will be auditioning as a future member.  Has anyone done this before? Any tips or tricks to get them to look at my resume' and notice that I've got the chops they need? Any advice? Aside from 'get there early and look great'. Any tips you have are so appreciated. Thanks!  temms  Broadway Star joined:7/21/04  Broadway Star joined: 7/21/04      Non-Union Attending a Union Audition #2 Posted: 6/28/12 at 1:47pm   EPAs are a total crapshoot turnout-wise. If it's for a Broadway production and this is the first round, odds are they will be pretty full. If it's a required call or something that's not directly going to Broadway, it may be very light. But you honestly never know. I've done EPAs that were wall-to-wall people from start to finish and I've done others where we'd see three or four people an hour and just sit around reading the rest of the time. Lots of non-eqs get seen on those days.  There's nothing wrong with highlighting the productions of the show you've done on your resume, so the casting folk will notice. But that's all I'd do. Just have your resume exactly as it is, and literally just use a highlighter to highlight the title of the show and the role to make sure they see you've done it. That's it, just very simple, and it's not a bad idea at all. I see people underline or highlight specific things on resumes all the time if it's relevant to that specific show.  So give it a try. Once you're in front of the casting director, whether you're union or non-union, done the show before or not, none of it matters. It's all about what you do in the room. The biggest mistake auditioners make is that they push too hard and they bring their stress and desperation into the room with them. The casting people just want to see you perform and connect to your material.  Break a leg.

To some directors/casting agents, they might look at that as someone that will come to the role with pre-conceived notions that might not be willing/able to be directed, or be able to grow.  Is there any way to know the difference? Of course not -- and all auditions are a crap shoot.  If we're not having fun, then why are we doing it?

Find the directors phone number. Or email. But phone works best. Do not leave a message. Keep calling til you get him/or her. Also try facebook if the phone doesn't pan out.  Call him up and say "I hate to bother you at home but I have done this show many times non union and I know I would be an assett to your production. Would it be possible to set up an audtion as I am non union.    This is your best shot. It takes guts but what the hell.  A director was once in your shoes. He is your best shot and he can get you on the audition list with a phone call or an email.  You have nothing to lose.

Please.  I used to intern at a casting office a few years ago and I'd hear stories of people doing stuff like that. Sorry but we'd make fun of crazy actors. NEVER call the office or director.  Leave your headshot at the EPA and hope they are looking. The office I interned for would call non-union actors based on their headshots all the time if they needed to.

I was one of the last to be seen at the last one, which was a 10am call for ladies, and the monitor and I were on the same elevator out of the building by like 11:30.

Bring your headshot and resume and be prepared to sit there for a while. I've also been to calls where they say they will be seeing non-Eq people but to come back at a certain time (after lunch, for example), so I usually go sit in Starbucks or something when that happens. Also, potentially be prepared to cut your song down...it doesn't always happen but I've been to auditions where they only allow non-union to sing 16 bars when they asked for 32 bars on the breakdown (I've also seen it go down to 8 from there).

Do not call their offices. They are gate keepers. Their job is to only allow in people they know and whose work they know. They are paid to keep the perceived "not talented" out so the directors and producers don't have to waste time seeing the riff raff of talent.  Do try to get seen at the union audition. But if that doesn't work and its a part you know you have done in the past and you know you are right for... what do you have to lose by making a phone call? Or better yet have a manager do it for you? That's a managers job. There is a fine line between being persistent and being annoying. Be careful.  It's the casting assistants job to answer the phone and dissuade you from getting an audition. They pick up the phone and say "casting". Usually they are non working actor or someone who has given up acting who love telling other actors "no." It validates their failure. It's what they experienced so it gives them pleasure to say no to you as well. They will deny this.  They love to say " the role has been cast." "we are not seeing anyone else for this." "we are only seeing people through agents and managers."  As mentioned above by a former intern:they will snigger as you just try to get an audition. Casting offices are alternately wonderful if they are on your side and alternately hard to break into.   It is the casting directors job to get the right actor for the role. By getting seen for something you are right for, you are ultimately helping them out.  Good luck.

In any case, obviously the picture you are painting of a casting office is absolutely, completely wrong.  You have it completely backwards. The casting people are the ones who want to see new people, find new blood, and give as many options to the director as possible. They're the ones who are going to Senior Showcases and Fringe productions and NYMF productions and absolutely every place they can to find new actors. They specialize in being able to see possibilities.  Directors are usually the small-minded ones. If you can't get the casting director interested, odds are you won't get the director interested. Directors are involved in many, many other things beyond the casting of one particular show, so no, they have no desire to hear from an actor who can't get seen by the casting people who just "Knows they're right for it!!!" The whole point of having a casting director is to not have to deal with that.  I'm not saying casting people are cheery rays of sunshine 100% of the time - nobody could sit through endless hours of auditions and still maintain that outlook, but they are the actors' allies. The idea that they're gleefully keeping people out of auditions as payback because they're failed performers themselves is an absolutely ludicrous statement with no basis in any sort of reality.  Just as it is the poor mechanic who blames his tools, it is the actor who is not as good as he/she thinks they are who blames the casting director.  dramamama611  Broadway Legend joined:12/4/07  Broadway Legend joined: 12/4/07      Non-Union Attending a Union Audition #14 Posted: 7/2/12 at 7:36am   Goldenboy sounds like a bitter actor himself.

In that case, call away. Or have your agent/manager let the casting folks know.  You can send a submission to the casting office and write a cover letter mentioning that you've played the role before. And definitely go to the EPA with the role/theatre highlighted.  Goldenboy, no one is sniggering at you unless you sound like a crazy person when you call the office. If they don't know who you are that's one thing, and if they're casting through offers, etc, that's another. People would call my old office all the time and respectfully (and sanely) ask if they could be considered; I would encourage them to send in a formal submission via email or snail mail. Only if someone called repeatedly and sounded delusional did anyone snigger. Then you're fair game.

Seeing as how in your first post you basically advocated stalking the director you really should just stop giving advice now (giving you the benefit of the doubt of not trolling/trying to be facetious).  No director in their right mind is going to want to see an actor who has tracked down their personal info and then is calling incessantly without leaving a message, as you also advised. You're more likely to end up with a restraining order than an audition.  Did you know that every day Mexican gays cross our borders and unplug our brain-dead ladies?

Could YOU make it on Broadway?      15 Questions - Developed by: Isabel-Marie - Developed on: 2015-03-12 - 55.364 taken - 6 people like it   FIND OUT! Could YOU be on Broadway? Could YOU star? It's a long, hard road to the top! See if you could make it!                                     1   How long have you been performing?        I've been doing it for a while (4-6 years)      I JUST started... (less than 1 year)      I've LOVED it ALL MY LIFE! (7+ years)      I've been doing it for a little, but not seriously (2-3 years)           2   What kind of theatre have you done?        A couple Christmas pageants, a few school plays...      Off-Broadway, U.S. Tours, Regional theatre      A few plays at a local theatre camp      A LOT of community theatre           3   You audition for a local play and you don't make it. How do you react?        I could really care less. I didn't want to try out anyway.      I say, "Oh well, there's always next time," and then I move on.      I say, "Ugh!" And then I make an excuse as to why I didn't get the part.      I SCREAM AND CRY AND FREAK OUT!           4   You get into a play that rehearses for 7 hours 6 days of the week for 12 weeks. How do you feel and what do you do?        I feel full of regret and just AWFUL and I decide to just ditch it. UGH!      I love to perform! I look at the big picture and see how it's all worth it. I power through!      I try to push through but I have a little trouble with my stamina.      I complain ALL THE TIME and I don't try hard at all.           5   What do you want to do when you graduate high school?        Get into a highly respected theatre school, graduate with honors, and star on Broadway.      Get an apartment in NYC and START auditioning for Broadway!      Get into college and try to get on Broadway      NOT become an actor/actress.           6   Your parents tell you that you can't be an actor/actress. How do you react?        I show them why acting is worth doing and how they'll regret not letting me act.      Whatever. I don't even want to perform anyway.      I throw a big fit and then try to become a performer just to annoy them.      I cry. I beg. I argue. I scream. Then I move on.           7   If you could be anything OTHER than an performer, what would you be and why?        I would be a psychologist. That's just my second choice.      I'd be happy with ANYTHING under THOSE circumstances. I hate performing.      NO NO NO! I WILL be a performer! (throws a hysteric fit)      I would be a Broadway director. I would still want to be the center of the Broadway buzz.           8   Which Broadway actress do you most look up to?        Nobody. Actresses are BORING      Naomi Watts (Wait- she's NOT on Broadway? Huh?)      Jennifer Westfeldt (I personally thought she was GREAT on Broadway)      Sutton Foster: Pure talent!           9   Which Broadway actor do you most look up to?        Peter Joback... really, really. I am entitled to my opinion.      Ramin Karimloo! He's fantastic!      I could SERIOUSLY care less.      Ooooh! I know! Sam Smith! (What? Was he not on Broadway? Is he even an ACTOR?)           10   What Broadway CELEB do you most look up to?        Matheew Broadrik (Wait, did I spell it wrong?) Oops! I mean Matthew Brodrick      IDK. What are celebs?      Um, let me think about that...      IDINA MENZEL! BROADWAY'S BIGGEST STAR!           11   Do take acting, singing, or dancing?        Yeah, I do! I take chorus at school, I dance a little, and I do theatre camp.      No, no, and no.      I sing in the shower, I make faces in the mirror, and I dance in my sleep! Does that count?      YES! I have been taking acting, voice, and dance lessons all my life!           12   How do you enter an audition?        I walk in, grin a little, and tell everyone that I'm sick so I can't sing that well.      I enter with a pretty smile and excellent posture!      I walk in. Duh.      I don't.           13   How would you describe yourself in theatre.?        I'm terrified of being on stage, singing a solo, and public speaking. AGH!      I'm SUPER loud and outgoing! I like to overpower EVERYBODY!      I'm very emotional and demonstrative. But I'm not afraid to show off.      I don't like theatre.           14   What do you think is the most important part of theatre?        Nothing.      Working hard and being let down. And repeating that over again EVERY DAY.      Sharing your emotions with the audience and doing what I LOVE!:)      Showing off and getting lots of attention!           15   You just got a phone call that you got on Broadway! How do you react!        I scream and laugh and smile and cry tears of pure joy! This is my dream come true!      I get really excited but then start worrying about all the consequences of being on Broadway.      I flip out because I DON'T want to be on Broadway!      I scream and then I go and tell EVERYONE!

                applying to auditions!    Backstage Guides  How to Get Cast on Broadway  By Casey Mink | Posted Sept. 25, 2017, 10:30 a.m.    Share:                           advice  Backstage Experts  BACKSTAGE GUIDES  Broadway  musical theater  NEW YORK-SPECIFIC  plays      Photo Source: Jesse Balgley   Broadway is an entity, a state of mind, a goal held by so many and attained by so few. Whether you have dreams of seeing your name in lights atop a marquee or inside a Broadway program amongst the names that comprise a robust ensemble, you have a long journey ahead towards the Great White Way. Fortunately, you’ve got a friend in us! From how to obtain your Equity card to the all-important terms and creative forces you need to know, here is the Backstage Guide for how to get cast on Broadway.    What do I need to get started?   Headshot/résumé/reel  Backstage  Branded social media   What should I know about the Actors’ Equity Association?   What is AEA?  Do I have to be an AEA member to perform on Broadway?  How do I become a member?   How do I audition for Broadway?   Equity Principal Auditions  Equity Chorus Calls  Straight offers   Who are the big Broadway casting directors?  What are the different Broadway gigs?   Swing  Standby  Understudy  Ensemble  Principal   What are the actual theaters (and who owns them)?  Do I need an agent?  What terms should I know?  What are the best schools for breeding Broadway talent?  Who are the composers, book writers, and playwrights I need to know today?   What do I need to get started?  The materials you’ll need to get cast on Broadway will probably not be new to you. Still, you know what they say about making assumptions, so we’ll break them down below.  Headshot/résumé/reel: These are the materials that you will, unequivocally, need for every single acting job you want to obtain throughout your career. Check out our headshot archives for everything you need to know about what to wear, how to find a photographer, posing tips, and more.  Next, head over to our résumé section for thorough guidance on formatting, what does and does not belong, special skills, and more.  The only difference in these tools for Broadway is, if you’re hoping to break into the musical realm, your reel will need musical excerpts as well as acting. Here , Backstage Expert Tim Grady advises you on how to “recreate the energy and atmosphere of an actual audition” for your musical-theater reel and here expands on the subject by giving his five most useful pointers for your best MT reel.  Backstage: Many, many Broadway stars used Backstage in the early stages of their careers (and beyond). Rachel Bay Jones , who just won a 2017 Tony Award for her role in “Dear Evan Hansen,” says she “lived by Backstage religiously when I first moved to the city.” Broadway icon Beth Leavel also used Backstage at the onset of her New York tenure and tells us she “felt like I was a part of the club when I had my Backstage in my hand.” Veteran theater actor Brian d’Arcy James , most recently seen in “Hamilton,” also says he feels “like it was yesterday when I was going to open calls and looking at all the columns in Backstage.” And this doesn’t just apply to Broadway vets. Anthony Rosenthal , the young actor who starred in last season’s Tony-nominated “Falsettos” revival, also used Backstage when he was getting started. In short: It worked for them!  Branded social media: This is the only supply on this list that may be a little new or surprising. While a strong digital presence and brand certainly aren’t actual requirements to perform on Broadway, in the year 2017, they are instrumentally helpful. Even if a curated social-media presence doesn’t land you a starring role on Broadway, it may very well catch the attention of someone in the industry: a writer, a director, an all-important casting director. That could make your headshot stand out in the pile of submissions on the desk, help you get in the room, and that could, in fact, help get your name on the boards. But building your digital brand is easier said than done, of course, which is why we have an entire guide on that subject alone right here .  WATCH   What should I know about the Actors’ Equity Association?  Let’s start at the beginning, which, when it comes to Broadway, means the Actors’ Equity Association (AEA). Maybe you’re a member, maybe you’ve spent years trying to become one, or maybe you have no idea what the organization even is. Whatever the case may be, we’re here to provide a tell-all explanation.  What is AEA?  Actors’ Equity Association (referred to most commonly in the biz as “Equity”) is the U.S. labor union that represents upwards of 50,000 actors, as well as stage managers. Founded in 1913, it intends to “foster the art of live theater as an essential component of society,” as well as provide its members with benefits such as healthcare and pension plans, fair working hours and conditions, and leverage for negotiating wages. Members receive their Equity card upon initiation, which serves as proof of membership and is used for many purposes, primarily at Equity Principal Auditions and Equity Chorus Calls (which we will delve into deeper later in this guide).  A slight digression but an important distinction to make is that the actors’ union in the United Kingdom is similarly called simply Equity. Apart from the fact that Equity and Actors’ Equity Association are both affiliated with the International Federation of Actors, however, the two are entirely separate entities.  Actor Kate Shindle, who is in the midst of starring as big Alison in the “Fun Home” national tour, is the currently serving president of AEA. You can learn more about Actors’ Equity Association via their full website here .  Do I have to be an AEA member to perform on Broadway?  We won’t mince words. Yes, you have to be a member of AEA to perform on Broadway. There is virtually no exception. Every single performer you have ever seen on Broadway has been represented by AEA. There are, however, many, many different paths to gaining membership, which brings us to...  How do I become a member?  It’s a tale as old as, well, as old as the AEA. How does one become a member? As previously mentioned, there are different ways to get that coveted card in hand. Luckily for you, Backstage has already taken an extensive dive into the subject . Apart from the unicorn scenario where the creative team hands a Broadway contract to a non-union actor and thus has his or her Equity membership pushed through (unsurprisingly, this happens mainly with stars of film and television), there are three primary ways to get your card. They’re broken down below:   Get an Equity Contract While it may seem obvious, getting that first Equity contract can prove tricky. Depending on a variety of factors such as size of the house, budget, and ticket price, theaters may be operating with a limited number of Equity contracts per show or season. Those contracts are likely to go to actors who are members already, but not always. When a union contract is left over with no union member to fill it, it’s bestowed upon a qualified non-union actor. That actor is now paid union wages and, more importantly, is eligible to join during his or her term of employment. Hired as non-union but interested in joining? Particularly with larger companies, it may be worth asking for one or two contracted weeks as part of your negotiation process.    The Equity Membership Candidate Program  The EMC program is a great way to work towards union membership while gaining valuable early career experience. Mimicking an age-old theatrical apprenticeship model, Equity gives candidates the opportunity to earn their eligibility through 50 weeks of work in participating theaters. Once enrolled in the program, candidates earn one point for every eligible week worked; 50 points (and 50 weeks) later, EMC actors are welcomed into the union.  Join Through a Sister Union Another route to an Equity card? After a year’s membership, actors can buy into one of Equity’s sister unions with at least one principal contract or three background contracts worked. Eligible unions include SAG-AFTRA, AGMA (the American Guild of Musical Artists), AGVA (the American Guild of Variety Artists), and GIAA (the Guild of Italian-American Actors). Actors wishing to join through a sister union must provide proof of membership (and good standing), evidence of jobs worked within that one-year time frame, and at least $400 towards the Equity initiation fee—which currently stands at $1,100.   As with SAG-AFTRA , joining Equity is a big decision and a big commitment! Equity actors are barred from taking non-union contracts, so non-union tours, certain Off-Off Broadway companies, and some small regional theaters may be off limits to members. On the brighter side, Equity actors enjoy tons of perks like salary protections and healthcare—and don’t forget access to EPAs and ECCs—alongside a community of 50,000 talented fellow members.   RELATED:   How to Become a Musical Theater Actor   WATCH   How do I audition for Broadway?  You knew it was coming, and now, here it is. Chances are, you won’t book a Broadway gig without auditioning first. Here’s what you should know about the three prominent types of Broadway audition, before stepping into the room.  Equity Principal Auditions Every production with a negotiated Equity contract is required to hold EPAs wherein Equity actors can show up to these somewhat open calls and audition with or without representation. Naturally, your first few EPAs in particular may be intimidating. To take some of the pressure off, Backstage compiled nine important things to know before stepping into the room .  1.  Bring your ID Equity members and Equity Membership Candidates (EMCs) need to bring their paid-up cards in order to sign up for Equity calls. If you are not yet in the union, there’s still a chance you might be seen; future members can often sign up on a separate list (creative team permitting) and are seen on a first-come-first-served basis once the equity members are done. Non-union actors should also come prepared with an ID and expect a longer wait time at most auditions .  2. Go to the right call Do you know the difference between an EPA and an ECC? If not, do a little reading on the Actors’ Equity website before attending your first call to determine which audition is really right for you. Generally, the EPA is seeking leading (principal) roles in plays and musicals, while the ECC (Equity Chorus Call) is seeking ensemble members for larger-scale musicals and separates singers from dancers in two separate calls.  3. Know what you’re auditioning for While many actors see EPAs as a way to “get on the radar” of certain casting teams , you need to know what you’re auditioning for before spending a day in the Actors’ Equity center. Backstage and AEA offer breakdowns for all EPA calls, and it’s important to read those character descriptions before attending a call. Don’t see a role you’re right for in that regional theater’s winter play? Best to sit this one out and wait for an audition that you can nail.  4. Know your 20 Actors’ Equity assigns six actors to every 20-minute time slot with any remaining time at the end of the block given to Equity Alternates, EMCs, and (often) non-union performers. Actors are grouped in those 20-minute intervals and lined up according to sign-up order when they’ve reached their assigned time. If you’re lucky enough to have that secure time slot, you must be present, ready, and prepared when your name is called.  5. Know when you’d like to audition If you attend an EPA as a union member, you’ll be presented with the chance to choose your own time slot. If the time you’d like is not available (but other appointments are), you may sign up on “Alternate List B” to stand by for an earlier spot. If you arrive after all of the appointments have been booked, the monitor will place you on “Alternate List A” and will call off names one by one at the end of each 20-minute group.  6. Be early When it comes to EPAs, the earlier the better. The AEA audition monitor arrives one hour before a call’s start time and signs up actors by order of arrival. During New York’s prime audition season, actors may line up several hours before that monitor arrives (even before the building has opened), meaning that all time slots are filled by very early morning. If it’s a hot project with numerous roles, expect a heavy turnout and arrange your schedule accordingly. Additionally, if you do receive a slot, you must check in at least 10 minutes early. If an actor is not present when the AEA monitor reads off his  name, he or she will sacrifice his audition time to an alternate, EMC, or non-union actor on standby.  7. Be patient—and have plenty of time With their (often) large crowds and uncertain timing, EPAs can feel like a pretty big chore. It’s important to remain calm, polite, and friendly, and to remember why you’re there; the love of performing can always squash a frustrating commute or a long day spent waiting. That said, attending an EPA can often take several hours and should be thought of as an all-day activity. Set the time aside in advance (if possible), and it will be easier to brush off those hours spent in the waiting room.  8. Find great material EPA breakdowns usually request a two-minute monologue , a 32-bar song , or some combination of shorter song and/or monologue. The rules state that actors get at least one minute per audition, so you’ll have, at minimum, 60 seconds to show off what you do best. This is your chance to prove yourself to a new creative team and remind casting fans of your chops. Spend real time looking for a variety of material that suits your type and bring it to the EPA well practiced and polished.  9. Keep a journal Once you start attending EPAs on the reg, you’ll start seeing familiar faces on the other side of the table. Equity posts the ITR (in the room) personnel so you can easily see who was present at your audition. Take notes on this information from week to week, along with what you wore, what you performed, and how it was received by the casting team. In no time at all, you will have a who’s who of local theater casting directors and other important contacts.  Equity Chorus Calls: There are two different types of Equity Chorus Call: those for singing and those for dancing. The designated type will be detailed in the audition listing, however , the most prepared actors will have their given materials (their book, dance clothes, etc.) on hand for either, as performers are oftentimes asked to stay and dance and/or sing even if it was not described in the listing. For a detailed procedural breakdown of ECCs, we direct you again to the Actors’ Equity’s official website , which has all the information you need.  Straight offers: Straight offers don’t fall under the audition category per se, however, they are prominent in Broadway casting and thus must be discussed. Like so many aspects of show business, there is no uniform method for how a person gets to Broadway, and that is exemplified no clearer than with straight offers.  Here is an example: The actor Olivia Wilde made her Broadway debut recently in the stage adaptation of George Orwell’s “1984.” It is a safe assumption that, as an established actor of a different medium (or as it is often referred to in the biz, “a name”) Wilde did not have to attend an EPA to book her role, despite the fact she did not yet have her Equity card.  In a similar vein, Equity actors who may not be “names” in the traditional sense but who have an existing relationship with a given member of a creative team or who simply have a positive reputation and established type in the industry may also receive a straight offer.  RELATED:   How Broadway Shows Get Cast   WATCH   Who are the big Broadway casting directors?  The two names synonymous with Broadway casting that you need to know are Bernard “Bernie” Telsey and Tara Rubin. In its more than 20 years in the industry, the former’s Telsey + Co has cast everything from “Rent” to “Wicked” to a little show called “Hamilton.” Rubin is right on Telsey’s heels, though, having cast this season’s Tony-winning best musical “Dear Evan Hansen,” as well as the ever-running “The Phantom of the Opera.” In addition to these two powerhouses, the third name gaining rapid notoriety in the industry is Jim Carnahan, whose Carnahan Casting is responsible for filling roles in all of the prestigious Roundabout Theatre Company’s musicals and plays.  What’s important to understand about Broadway’s casting directors is the continuity between shows; it is unsurprising to see actors cast repeatedly in the different shows of the same casting director. Take two of Rubin’s most prominent titles: “Indecent,” which bowed on Broadway this past spring, and “The Band’s Visit,” which will play the Great White Way this coming fall. Both of those shows starred/will star Katrina Lenk. Similarly, all three of the roles originated on Broadway by Idina Menzel were cast by Telsey.

RELATED:   Broadway’s Bernie Telsey, Tara Rubin + Thomas Schumacher on What Theater Can Learn About Diversity From TV   WATCH   What are the different Broadway gigs?   Swing: Frequently regarded as the most challenging gig on Broadway, swing actors are not actually in the cast onstage for most performances. Rather, they cover multiple tracks in a show. That means a swing learns several different principal or ensemble roles and, in the event that an actor is out of a performance, he or she is able to step in at a moment’s notice.    Standby: Similar to swings, standby performers are not actually in the onstage cast when the entire lineup of performers is present. Standbys are there to do just that: They standby in case an actor is out of a show. Generally, standbys are only for the meatiest roles where a traditional understudy may not suffice, and they only cover one role in the show. “Wicked,” for example, has standbys for both witches.    Understudy: Speaking of understudies, you probably know at least vaguely what they are. What separates understudies from swings is that understudies are in the show, however, they also understudy a bigger or more principal role in the event that the actor playing it is out. (From there, a swing will likely step into that understudy’s usual role.)    Ensemble: The ensemble, less politically correctly referred to as “the chorus,” is the onstage performers and dancers who, for lack of a better word, support for the principal cast. They are also similar to background actors in television and film. They fill scenes and dance numbers and serve as a literal chorus in musical numbers.    Principal: Finally, principal actors are those who play characters with names and whose headshots are on the main page of the show’s program. They play the lead and supporting roles and, if they are well-known to the public, may even see their name above the title on the theater’s marquee. A note: If a performer’s name is above the title, they will automatically be considered in the leading role category when it comes to awards consideration unless otherwise campaigned for by the creative team.   WATCH   What are the actual theaters (and who owns them)?  Broadway is defined entirely by its houses. Did you know that what renders a theater a Broadway theater is not in fact its adjacency to the actual avenue, but the number of seats it contains? Five hundred seats or more, and the theater is Broadway; 100 or more, and it’s Off-Broadway; and, if it contains under 100 seats, it’s usually considered Off-Off-Broadway.  It probably sounds a bit strange conceptually, but Broadway theaters require rent to be paid in order to be occupied. And just like all New York City rents, the costs are exponentially high. For this reason, theater rental is one of the utmost financial considerations when it comes to funding as well as the decision to keep a show open or close it. So, who are these “theater landlords,” if you will?  When it comes to Broadway houses, there are three names you need to know: Shubert, Nederlander, and Jujamycyn. These three entities alone own the vast majority of Broadway’s now-41 theaters. (That number is thanks to the addition of this year’s re-opened Hudson Theatre).  The Nederlander Organization owns nine Broadway houses, including the Brooks Atkinson (“Waitress”), the Minskoff (“The Lion King”), and the Richard Rodgers (“Hamilton”).  The Shubert Organization boasts an impressive 18-theater roster including the Music Box (“Dear Evan Hansen”), the Gerald Schoenfeld (“Come From Away”), and the Cort (the incoming “M. Butterfly”).  The newest of the big three is Jujamcyn (pronounced joo-jam-sin), which has five theaters with several major hits, including the Eugene O’Neill (“The Book of Mormon”), the Al Hirschfeld (“Kinky Boots”), and the St. James (which will host the sure-to-be-massive “Frozen” adaptation next spring).  These three house owners do not account for every Broadway house, though. In addition, there are smaller, subscriber-based entities including the Roundabout Theatre Company (which owns the American Airlines Theatre as well as Studio 54), Manhattan Theatre Club (the Samuel J. Friedman), and of course, Lincoln Center, which boasts one Broadway theater way up at the actual Lincoln Center, the Vivian Beaumont. (Lincoln Center does get involved in producing other shows from time to time, including last season’s “Falsettos.”)  Do I need an agent?  There may be no question asked with more frequency than that of whether or not actors in all corners of the industry need an agent to get cast. Therefore, it’s unsurprising that we at Backstage have already done tons of hearty investigation in order to thoroughly and honestly answer it.  And that answer is, well, no, you do not need an agent to get cast on Broadway—but it helps! Of course, you can scour casting notices (hey, Backstage has lots of those!) and, if you’re Equity, you can show up to ECCs or try to submit for EPAs. But an agent increases your likelihood of getting seen by a large margin. Additionally, many Broadway gigs will not be publicly broadcasted anyway and will be filtered exclusively through agent submissions.  Similarly, though it’s a bit of a catch-22, just having an agent increases your industry cachet and standing, and that alone makes you a more desirable candidate for any Broadway gig.  To understand why exactly agents are so vital and how they help you in the casting process, Backstage Expert Gwyn Gilliss explains what they really do:  1. Submit you for an audition. An agent sends a casting director an email, an electronic submission, a hard-copy headshot and resume, your website link, IMDb page, or other website with your work. You need to provide excellent marketing tools so he or she can submit you.  2. Pitch you to industry leaders. An agent spends a lot of time on the phone and can talk about you—and your talent—with casting directors, directors, and producers in order to get you an appointment, meeting, or audition. You need to let your agent know what you can really do and what you book the most, as well as any unique qualities and talents you may have.  3. Follow up. Agents will follow up for you when you have a callback and you need to arrange the time and place. You need to be available, eager, passionate, prepared, aggressively competitive, and show up 100 percent.  4. Negotiate higher pay. Agents can get you higher-than-minimum pay when you book a job. They go over the details of your contract including salary, travel arrangements, billing, and other special arrangements of any kind. These could include: specific wardrobe designer or clothing style, hair or makeup artist request, special diet specifications, etc.—all things that might be accepted especially when you’re an established star. You need to communicate clearly what you want or require so there are no problems once the contract is signed and you’re miles away on location. Research and knowledge is essential on your part.  5. Re-negotiate contracts. When your contract is up for re-negotiation for a TV show, Broadway show, or network commercial extension, you agent can negotiate an increase in pay. You need to understand the commitment and the possibility of having to turn down a larger, more lucrative offer for a competitive show or project. You need to take responsibility for the results once you sign or re-sign a contract.  Again, though, just because your chances are higher of finding and booking a gig with an agent than without one, that doesn’t mean it’s not possible. “Some actors will tell you that it’s not worth your time to go to an EPA or Open Call, that we’re not really looking, or only seriously seeing agent/manager submissions,” says JV Mercanti , a Backstage Expert and head of acting for the musical theater program at Pace University’s School of the Arts. “I can tell you that when casting the Broadway production of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ‘The Woman in White’ many years ago that seven of our ensemble members came from the EPA. Musicals and shows requiring younger people (think “Spring Awakening”) especially use these calls to find young, unrepresented talent. For plays, understudy roles can often be cast from these calls.”  Ultimately, if you do decide an agent is the right path for you and your career to move forward, actually getting one will be a feat all its own. Lucky for you, we’ve already devoted an entire guide (similar to this one!) to how to get an acting agent .  Read:   6 Ways to Find the Best Agent for You   WATCH   What terms should I know?  Do you know what it means to go up on your lines or to be off-book? What about the difference between a production stage manager and an assistant stage manager (neither of which should be confused with the production assistant)? Are you going to understand what’s required when your sitzprobe is scheduled, or what a 10 out of 12 will entail?  It’s OK if you answered “no” to any of the above—for now. However, Broadway specifically has a ton of lingo that may sound foreign to someone not in the know and, if you plan to be on Broadway, you need to know it. We’ve got you covered below.   60+ Theater Terms Every Actor Should Know    23 Must-Know Musical Theater Audition Terms   WATCH   What are the best schools for breeding Broadway talent?  Just like having an agent, graduating from one of the “top” schools for breeding Broadway talent may help give you a leg up, but it’s hardly impossible to get cast without it. Additionally, graduating from one of these institutions in no way guarantees you a spot onstage. Still, it’s helpful to know the major schools, as well as some of the successful alums who’ve emerged from them. On the Broadway circuit, the “big three” when it comes to collegiate training are:  Carnegie Mellon University: Considered by many to be the top dog for Broadway training, CMU’s School of Drama emphasizes established practices integrated with innovation in order to produce artists that are both timeless and forward thinking. Additionally, musical theater actors are required to take the same acting classes as dramatic actors in order to ensure a roundedness. Alumni include “Wicked” and “Smash” star Megan Hilty, two-time Tony winner Christian Borle, “Hamilton” star Leslie Odom, Jr., “Book of Mormon” and “Frozen” star Josh Gad, and “Kinky Boots” Tony winner Billy Porter.  College Conservatory of Music: The oldest musical theater program in the entire country, CCM is widely recognized for its triple-threat approach to training and unsurprisingly has produced tons of talent that has gone on to Broadway. Currently on the boards, alumna Betsy Wolfe is playing the title role in “Waitress,” and Christy Altomare is also playing the title role in “Anastasia.” Faith Prince and Aaron Lazar are graduates as well, as are “Hamiton” stars Karen Olivo and Andrew Chappelle.  University of Michigan: Michigan’s department of theater and dance places importance on balance: Academic excellence and training are focused on equally. Darren Criss of “Glee” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” stardom is a 2009 alum, and Gavin Creel, who just won a 2017 Tony Award for his work in “Hello, Dolly!” is also a Michigan-degree carrier.  RELATED:   7 Schools Where Tony Winners Got Their Start   Who are the composers, book writers, and playwrights I need to know today?  In the same way that art is subjective and will speak to every viewer differently, there is no definitive ranking of creatives working on Broadway that you need to know. A playwright who has been seminal in your artistic drive since elementary school could be entirely obscure to a fellow actor. The same goes for composers and musical book writers. That being said, if you don’t have a very basic knowledge of the below artists and their corresponding legacies, well, good luck making small talk at your next ECC.  Lin-Manuel Miranda, composer and book writer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Hamilton”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Hamilton,” “In the Heights”   Stephen Sondheim, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sunday in the Park with George” revival starring Annaleigh Ashford and Jake Gyllenhaal  Most prominent Broadway work: “Sweeney Todd,” “Into the Woods,” “West Side Story”   Jeanine Tesori, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Fun Home”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Thoroughly Modern Millie,” “Caroline, or Change”   Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, composing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “Dear Evan Hansen”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Dear Evan Hansen,” “A Christmas Story”   Lynn Nottage, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sweat” (Broadway debut)   Andrew Lloyd Webber, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “School of Rock,” “The Phantom of the Opera”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Evita”   Paula Vogel, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Indecent” (Broadway debut)   Joshua Harmon, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Significant Other” (Broadway debut)   David Yazbek, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,” “The Band’s Visit” (upcoming)  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Full Monty”   Bobby Lopez, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “The Book of Mormon”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Book of Mormon,” “Avenue Q”   Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, composing/book writing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “If/Then”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Next to Normal”   Liesl Tommy, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Eclipsed” (Broadway debut)   Stephen Karam, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: Modern adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s “The Cherry Orchard,” “The Humans”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Humans”   RELATED:   How to Get Cast on Broadway by Terrence McNally   WATCH   Head over to Backstage’s casting calls to see our hosting opportunities!

Fortunately, you’ve got a friend in us! From how to obtain your Equity card to the all-important terms and creative forces you need to know, here is the Backstage Guide for how to get cast on Broadway.    What do I need to get started?

The materials you’ll need to get cast on Broadway will probably not be new to you. Still, you know what they say about making assumptions, so we’ll break them down below.  Headshot/résumé/reel: These are the materials that you will, unequivocally, need for every single acting job you want to obtain throughout your career. Check out our headshot archives for everything you need to know about what to wear, how to find a photographer, posing tips, and more.  Next, head over to our résumé section for thorough guidance on formatting, what does and does not belong, special skills, and more.  The only difference in these tools for Broadway is, if you’re hoping to break into the musical realm, your reel will need musical excerpts as well as acting. Here , Backstage Expert Tim Grady advises you on how to “recreate the energy and atmosphere of an actual audition” for your musical-theater reel and here expands on the subject by giving his five most useful pointers for your best MT reel.  Backstage: Many, many Broadway stars used Backstage in the early stages of their careers (and beyond). Rachel Bay Jones , who just won a 2017 Tony Award for her role in “Dear Evan Hansen,” says she “lived by Backstage religiously when I first moved to the city.” Broadway icon Beth Leavel also used Backstage at the onset of her New York tenure and tells us she “felt like I was a part of the club when I had my Backstage in my hand.” Veteran theater actor Brian d’Arcy James , most recently seen in “Hamilton,” also says he feels “like it was yesterday when I was going to open calls and looking at all the columns in Backstage.” And this doesn’t just apply to Broadway vets. Anthony Rosenthal , the young actor who starred in last season’s Tony-nominated “Falsettos” revival, also used Backstage when he was getting started. In short: It worked for them!  Branded social media: This is the only supply on this list that may be a little new or surprising. While a strong digital presence and brand certainly aren’t actual requirements to perform on Broadway, in the year 2017, they are instrumentally helpful. Even if a curated social-media presence doesn’t land you a starring role on Broadway, it may very well catch the attention of someone in the industry: a writer, a director, an all-important casting director. That could make your headshot stand out in the pile of submissions on the desk, help you get in the room, and that could, in fact, help get your name on the boards. But building your digital brand is easier said than done, of course, which is why we have an entire guide on that subject alone right here .  WATCH   What should I know about the Actors’ Equity Association?  Let’s start at the beginning, which, when it comes to Broadway, means the Actors’ Equity Association (AEA). Maybe you’re a member, maybe you’ve spent years trying to become one, or maybe you have no idea what the organization even is. Whatever the case may be, we’re here to provide a tell-all explanation.  What is AEA?  Actors’ Equity Association (referred to most commonly in the biz as “Equity”) is the U.S. labor union that represents upwards of 50,000 actors, as well as stage managers. Founded in 1913, it intends to “foster the art of live theater as an essential component of society,” as well as provide its members with benefits such as healthcare and pension plans, fair working hours and conditions, and leverage for negotiating wages. Members receive their Equity card upon initiation, which serves as proof of membership and is used for many purposes, primarily at Equity Principal Auditions and Equity Chorus Calls (which we will delve into deeper later in this guide).  A slight digression but an important distinction to make is that the actors’ union in the United Kingdom is similarly called simply Equity. Apart from the fact that Equity and Actors’ Equity Association are both affiliated with the International Federation of Actors, however, the two are entirely separate entities.  Actor Kate Shindle, who is in the midst of starring as big Alison in the “Fun Home” national tour, is the currently serving president of AEA. You can learn more about Actors’ Equity Association via their full website here .  Do I have to be an AEA member to perform on Broadway?  We won’t mince words. Yes, you have to be a member of AEA to perform on Broadway. There is virtually no exception. Every single performer you have ever seen on Broadway has been represented by AEA. There are, however, many, many different paths to gaining membership, which brings us to...  How do I become a member?  It’s a tale as old as, well, as old as the AEA. How does one become a member? As previously mentioned, there are different ways to get that coveted card in hand. Luckily for you, Backstage has already taken an extensive dive into the subject . Apart from the unicorn scenario where the creative team hands a Broadway contract to a non-union actor and thus has his or her Equity membership pushed through (unsurprisingly, this happens mainly with stars of film and television), there are three primary ways to get your card. They’re broken down below:   Get an Equity Contract While it may seem obvious, getting that first Equity contract can prove tricky. Depending on a variety of factors such as size of the house, budget, and ticket price, theaters may be operating with a limited number of Equity contracts per show or season. Those contracts are likely to go to actors who are members already, but not always. When a union contract is left over with no union member to fill it, it’s bestowed upon a qualified non-union actor. That actor is now paid union wages and, more importantly, is eligible to join during his or her term of employment. Hired as non-union but interested in joining? Particularly with larger companies, it may be worth asking for one or two contracted weeks as part of your negotiation process.    The Equity Membership Candidate Program  The EMC program is a great way to work towards union membership while gaining valuable early career experience. Mimicking an age-old theatrical apprenticeship model, Equity gives candidates the opportunity to earn their eligibility through 50 weeks of work in participating theaters. Once enrolled in the program, candidates earn one point for every eligible week worked; 50 points (and 50 weeks) later, EMC actors are welcomed into the union.  Join Through a Sister Union Another route to an Equity card? After a year’s membership, actors can buy into one of Equity’s sister unions with at least one principal contract or three background contracts worked. Eligible unions include SAG-AFTRA, AGMA (the American Guild of Musical Artists), AGVA (the American Guild of Variety Artists), and GIAA (the Guild of Italian-American Actors). Actors wishing to join through a sister union must provide proof of membership (and good standing), evidence of jobs worked within that one-year time frame, and at least $400 towards the Equity initiation fee—which currently stands at $1,100.   As with SAG-AFTRA , joining Equity is a big decision and a big commitment! Equity actors are barred from taking non-union contracts, so non-union tours, certain Off-Off Broadway companies, and some small regional theaters may be off limits to members. On the brighter side, Equity actors enjoy tons of perks like salary protections and healthcare—and don’t forget access to EPAs and ECCs—alongside a community of 50,000 talented fellow members.   RELATED:   How to Become a Musical Theater Actor   WATCH   How do I audition for Broadway?  You knew it was coming, and now, here it is. Chances are, you won’t book a Broadway gig without auditioning first. Here’s what you should know about the three prominent types of Broadway audition, before stepping into the room.  Equity Principal Auditions Every production with a negotiated Equity contract is required to hold EPAs wherein Equity actors can show up to these somewhat open calls and audition with or without representation. Naturally, your first few EPAs in particular may be intimidating. To take some of the pressure off, Backstage compiled nine important things to know before stepping into the room .  1.  Bring your ID Equity members and Equity Membership Candidates (EMCs) need to bring their paid-up cards in order to sign up for Equity calls. If you are not yet in the union, there’s still a chance you might be seen; future members can often sign up on a separate list (creative team permitting) and are seen on a first-come-first-served basis once the equity members are done. Non-union actors should also come prepared with an ID and expect a longer wait time at most auditions .  2. Go to the right call Do you know the difference between an EPA and an ECC? If not, do a little reading on the Actors’ Equity website before attending your first call to determine which audition is really right for you. Generally, the EPA is seeking leading (principal) roles in plays and musicals, while the ECC (Equity Chorus Call) is seeking ensemble members for larger-scale musicals and separates singers from dancers in two separate calls.  3. Know what you’re auditioning for While many actors see EPAs as a way to “get on the radar” of certain casting teams , you need to know what you’re auditioning for before spending a day in the Actors’ Equity center. Backstage and AEA offer breakdowns for all EPA calls, and it’s important to read those character descriptions before attending a call. Don’t see a role you’re right for in that regional theater’s winter play? Best to sit this one out and wait for an audition that you can nail.  4. Know your 20 Actors’ Equity assigns six actors to every 20-minute time slot with any remaining time at the end of the block given to Equity Alternates, EMCs, and (often) non-union performers. Actors are grouped in those 20-minute intervals and lined up according to sign-up order when they’ve reached their assigned time. If you’re lucky enough to have that secure time slot, you must be present, ready, and prepared when your name is called.  5. Know when you’d like to audition If you attend an EPA as a union member, you’ll be presented with the chance to choose your own time slot. If the time you’d like is not available (but other appointments are), you may sign up on “Alternate List B” to stand by for an earlier spot. If you arrive after all of the appointments have been booked, the monitor will place you on “Alternate List A” and will call off names one by one at the end of each 20-minute group.  6. Be early When it comes to EPAs, the earlier the better. The AEA audition monitor arrives one hour before a call’s start time and signs up actors by order of arrival. During New York’s prime audition season, actors may line up several hours before that monitor arrives (even before the building has opened), meaning that all time slots are filled by very early morning. If it’s a hot project with numerous roles, expect a heavy turnout and arrange your schedule accordingly. Additionally, if you do receive a slot, you must check in at least 10 minutes early. If an actor is not present when the AEA monitor reads off his  name, he or she will sacrifice his audition time to an alternate, EMC, or non-union actor on standby.  7. Be patient—and have plenty of time With their (often) large crowds and uncertain timing, EPAs can feel like a pretty big chore. It’s important to remain calm, polite, and friendly, and to remember why you’re there; the love of performing can always squash a frustrating commute or a long day spent waiting. That said, attending an EPA can often take several hours and should be thought of as an all-day activity. Set the time aside in advance (if possible), and it will be easier to brush off those hours spent in the waiting room.  8. Find great material EPA breakdowns usually request a two-minute monologue , a 32-bar song , or some combination of shorter song and/or monologue. The rules state that actors get at least one minute per audition, so you’ll have, at minimum, 60 seconds to show off what you do best. This is your chance to prove yourself to a new creative team and remind casting fans of your chops. Spend real time looking for a variety of material that suits your type and bring it to the EPA well practiced and polished.  9. Keep a journal Once you start attending EPAs on the reg, you’ll start seeing familiar faces on the other side of the table. Equity posts the ITR (in the room) personnel so you can easily see who was present at your audition. Take notes on this information from week to week, along with what you wore, what you performed, and how it was received by the casting team. In no time at all, you will have a who’s who of local theater casting directors and other important contacts.  Equity Chorus Calls: There are two different types of Equity Chorus Call: those for singing and those for dancing. The designated type will be detailed in the audition listing, however , the most prepared actors will have their given materials (their book, dance clothes, etc.) on hand for either, as performers are oftentimes asked to stay and dance and/or sing even if it was not described in the listing. For a detailed procedural breakdown of ECCs, we direct you again to the Actors’ Equity’s official website , which has all the information you need.  Straight offers: Straight offers don’t fall under the audition category per se, however, they are prominent in Broadway casting and thus must be discussed. Like so many aspects of show business, there is no uniform method for how a person gets to Broadway, and that is exemplified no clearer than with straight offers.  Here is an example: The actor Olivia Wilde made her Broadway debut recently in the stage adaptation of George Orwell’s “1984.” It is a safe assumption that, as an established actor of a different medium (or as it is often referred to in the biz, “a name”) Wilde did not have to attend an EPA to book her role, despite the fact she did not yet have her Equity card.  In a similar vein, Equity actors who may not be “names” in the traditional sense but who have an existing relationship with a given member of a creative team or who simply have a positive reputation and established type in the industry may also receive a straight offer.  RELATED:   How Broadway Shows Get Cast   WATCH   Who are the big Broadway casting directors?  The two names synonymous with Broadway casting that you need to know are Bernard “Bernie” Telsey and Tara Rubin. In its more than 20 years in the industry, the former’s Telsey + Co has cast everything from “Rent” to “Wicked” to a little show called “Hamilton.” Rubin is right on Telsey’s heels, though, having cast this season’s Tony-winning best musical “Dear Evan Hansen,” as well as the ever-running “The Phantom of the Opera.” In addition to these two powerhouses, the third name gaining rapid notoriety in the industry is Jim Carnahan, whose Carnahan Casting is responsible for filling roles in all of the prestigious Roundabout Theatre Company’s musicals and plays.  What’s important to understand about Broadway’s casting directors is the continuity between shows; it is unsurprising to see actors cast repeatedly in the different shows of the same casting director. Take two of Rubin’s most prominent titles: “Indecent,” which bowed on Broadway this past spring, and “The Band’s Visit,” which will play the Great White Way this coming fall. Both of those shows starred/will star Katrina Lenk. Similarly, all three of the roles originated on Broadway by Idina Menzel were cast by Telsey.

RELATED:   Broadway’s Bernie Telsey, Tara Rubin + Thomas Schumacher on What Theater Can Learn About Diversity From TV   WATCH   What are the different Broadway gigs?   Swing: Frequently regarded as the most challenging gig on Broadway, swing actors are not actually in the cast onstage for most performances. Rather, they cover multiple tracks in a show. That means a swing learns several different principal or ensemble roles and, in the event that an actor is out of a performance, he or she is able to step in at a moment’s notice.    Standby: Similar to swings, standby performers are not actually in the onstage cast when the entire lineup of performers is present. Standbys are there to do just that: They standby in case an actor is out of a show. Generally, standbys are only for the meatiest roles where a traditional understudy may not suffice, and they only cover one role in the show. “Wicked,” for example, has standbys for both witches.    Understudy: Speaking of understudies, you probably know at least vaguely what they are. What separates understudies from swings is that understudies are in the show, however, they also understudy a bigger or more principal role in the event that the actor playing it is out. (From there, a swing will likely step into that understudy’s usual role.)    Ensemble: The ensemble, less politically correctly referred to as “the chorus,” is the onstage performers and dancers who, for lack of a better word, support for the principal cast. They are also similar to background actors in television and film. They fill scenes and dance numbers and serve as a literal chorus in musical numbers.    Principal: Finally, principal actors are those who play characters with names and whose headshots are on the main page of the show’s program. They play the lead and supporting roles and, if they are well-known to the public, may even see their name above the title on the theater’s marquee. A note: If a performer’s name is above the title, they will automatically be considered in the leading role category when it comes to awards consideration unless otherwise campaigned for by the creative team.   WATCH   What are the actual theaters (and who owns them)?  Broadway is defined entirely by its houses. Did you know that what renders a theater a Broadway theater is not in fact its adjacency to the actual avenue, but the number of seats it contains? Five hundred seats or more, and the theater is Broadway; 100 or more, and it’s Off-Broadway; and, if it contains under 100 seats, it’s usually considered Off-Off-Broadway.  It probably sounds a bit strange conceptually, but Broadway theaters require rent to be paid in order to be occupied. And just like all New York City rents, the costs are exponentially high. For this reason, theater rental is one of the utmost financial considerations when it comes to funding as well as the decision to keep a show open or close it. So, who are these “theater landlords,” if you will?  When it comes to Broadway houses, there are three names you need to know: Shubert, Nederlander, and Jujamycyn. These three entities alone own the vast majority of Broadway’s now-41 theaters. (That number is thanks to the addition of this year’s re-opened Hudson Theatre).  The Nederlander Organization owns nine Broadway houses, including the Brooks Atkinson (“Waitress”), the Minskoff (“The Lion King”), and the Richard Rodgers (“Hamilton”).  The Shubert Organization boasts an impressive 18-theater roster including the Music Box (“Dear Evan Hansen”), the Gerald Schoenfeld (“Come From Away”), and the Cort (the incoming “M. Butterfly”).  The newest of the big three is Jujamcyn (pronounced joo-jam-sin), which has five theaters with several major hits, including the Eugene O’Neill (“The Book of Mormon”), the Al Hirschfeld (“Kinky Boots”), and the St. James (which will host the sure-to-be-massive “Frozen” adaptation next spring).  These three house owners do not account for every Broadway house, though. In addition, there are smaller, subscriber-based entities including the Roundabout Theatre Company (which owns the American Airlines Theatre as well as Studio 54), Manhattan Theatre Club (the Samuel J. Friedman), and of course, Lincoln Center, which boasts one Broadway theater way up at the actual Lincoln Center, the Vivian Beaumont. (Lincoln Center does get involved in producing other shows from time to time, including last season’s “Falsettos.”)  Do I need an agent?  There may be no question asked with more frequency than that of whether or not actors in all corners of the industry need an agent to get cast. Therefore, it’s unsurprising that we at Backstage have already done tons of hearty investigation in order to thoroughly and honestly answer it.  And that answer is, well, no, you do not need an agent to get cast on Broadway—but it helps! Of course, you can scour casting notices (hey, Backstage has lots of those!) and, if you’re Equity, you can show up to ECCs or try to submit for EPAs. But an agent increases your likelihood of getting seen by a large margin. Additionally, many Broadway gigs will not be publicly broadcasted anyway and will be filtered exclusively through agent submissions.  Similarly, though it’s a bit of a catch-22, just having an agent increases your industry cachet and standing, and that alone makes you a more desirable candidate for any Broadway gig.  To understand why exactly agents are so vital and how they help you in the casting process, Backstage Expert Gwyn Gilliss explains what they really do:  1. Submit you for an audition. An agent sends a casting director an email, an electronic submission, a hard-copy headshot and resume, your website link, IMDb page, or other website with your work. You need to provide excellent marketing tools so he or she can submit you.  2. Pitch you to industry leaders. An agent spends a lot of time on the phone and can talk about you—and your talent—with casting directors, directors, and producers in order to get you an appointment, meeting, or audition. You need to let your agent know what you can really do and what you book the most, as well as any unique qualities and talents you may have.  3. Follow up. Agents will follow up for you when you have a callback and you need to arrange the time and place. You need to be available, eager, passionate, prepared, aggressively competitive, and show up 100 percent.  4. Negotiate higher pay. Agents can get you higher-than-minimum pay when you book a job. They go over the details of your contract including salary, travel arrangements, billing, and other special arrangements of any kind. These could include: specific wardrobe designer or clothing style, hair or makeup artist request, special diet specifications, etc.—all things that might be accepted especially when you’re an established star. You need to communicate clearly what you want or require so there are no problems once the contract is signed and you’re miles away on location. Research and knowledge is essential on your part.  5. Re-negotiate contracts. When your contract is up for re-negotiation for a TV show, Broadway show, or network commercial extension, you agent can negotiate an increase in pay. You need to understand the commitment and the possibility of having to turn down a larger, more lucrative offer for a competitive show or project. You need to take responsibility for the results once you sign or re-sign a contract.  Again, though, just because your chances are higher of finding and booking a gig with an agent than without one, that doesn’t mean it’s not possible. “Some actors will tell you that it’s not worth your time to go to an EPA or Open Call, that we’re not really looking, or only seriously seeing agent/manager submissions,” says JV Mercanti , a Backstage Expert and head of acting for the musical theater program at Pace University’s School of the Arts. “I can tell you that when casting the Broadway production of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ‘The Woman in White’ many years ago that seven of our ensemble members came from the EPA. Musicals and shows requiring younger people (think “Spring Awakening”) especially use these calls to find young, unrepresented talent. For plays, understudy roles can often be cast from these calls.”  Ultimately, if you do decide an agent is the right path for you and your career to move forward, actually getting one will be a feat all its own. Lucky for you, we’ve already devoted an entire guide (similar to this one!) to how to get an acting agent .  Read:   6 Ways to Find the Best Agent for You   WATCH   What terms should I know?  Do you know what it means to go up on your lines or to be off-book? What about the difference between a production stage manager and an assistant stage manager (neither of which should be confused with the production assistant)? Are you going to understand what’s required when your sitzprobe is scheduled, or what a 10 out of 12 will entail?  It’s OK if you answered “no” to any of the above—for now. However, Broadway specifically has a ton of lingo that may sound foreign to someone not in the know and, if you plan to be on Broadway, you need to know it. We’ve got you covered below.   60+ Theater Terms Every Actor Should Know    23 Must-Know Musical Theater Audition Terms   WATCH   What are the best schools for breeding Broadway talent?  Just like having an agent, graduating from one of the “top” schools for breeding Broadway talent may help give you a leg up, but it’s hardly impossible to get cast without it. Additionally, graduating from one of these institutions in no way guarantees you a spot onstage. Still, it’s helpful to know the major schools, as well as some of the successful alums who’ve emerged from them. On the Broadway circuit, the “big three” when it comes to collegiate training are:  Carnegie Mellon University: Considered by many to be the top dog for Broadway training, CMU’s School of Drama emphasizes established practices integrated with innovation in order to produce artists that are both timeless and forward thinking. Additionally, musical theater actors are required to take the same acting classes as dramatic actors in order to ensure a roundedness. Alumni include “Wicked” and “Smash” star Megan Hilty, two-time Tony winner Christian Borle, “Hamilton” star Leslie Odom, Jr., “Book of Mormon” and “Frozen” star Josh Gad, and “Kinky Boots” Tony winner Billy Porter.  College Conservatory of Music: The oldest musical theater program in the entire country, CCM is widely recognized for its triple-threat approach to training and unsurprisingly has produced tons of talent that has gone on to Broadway. Currently on the boards, alumna Betsy Wolfe is playing the title role in “Waitress,” and Christy Altomare is also playing the title role in “Anastasia.” Faith Prince and Aaron Lazar are graduates as well, as are “Hamiton” stars Karen Olivo and Andrew Chappelle.  University of Michigan: Michigan’s department of theater and dance places importance on balance: Academic excellence and training are focused on equally. Darren Criss of “Glee” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” stardom is a 2009 alum, and Gavin Creel, who just won a 2017 Tony Award for his work in “Hello, Dolly!” is also a Michigan-degree carrier.  RELATED:   7 Schools Where Tony Winners Got Their Start   Who are the composers, book writers, and playwrights I need to know today?  In the same way that art is subjective and will speak to every viewer differently, there is no definitive ranking of creatives working on Broadway that you need to know. A playwright who has been seminal in your artistic drive since elementary school could be entirely obscure to a fellow actor. The same goes for composers and musical book writers. That being said, if you don’t have a very basic knowledge of the below artists and their corresponding legacies, well, good luck making small talk at your next ECC.  Lin-Manuel Miranda, composer and book writer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Hamilton”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Hamilton,” “In the Heights”   Stephen Sondheim, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sunday in the Park with George” revival starring Annaleigh Ashford and Jake Gyllenhaal  Most prominent Broadway work: “Sweeney Todd,” “Into the Woods,” “West Side Story”   Jeanine Tesori, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Fun Home”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Thoroughly Modern Millie,” “Caroline, or Change”   Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, composing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “Dear Evan Hansen”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Dear Evan Hansen,” “A Christmas Story”   Lynn Nottage, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sweat” (Broadway debut)   Andrew Lloyd Webber, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “School of Rock,” “The Phantom of the Opera”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Evita”   Paula Vogel, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Indecent” (Broadway debut)   Joshua Harmon, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Significant Other” (Broadway debut)   David Yazbek, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,” “The Band’s Visit” (upcoming)  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Full Monty”   Bobby Lopez, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “The Book of Mormon”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Book of Mormon,” “Avenue Q”   Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, composing/book writing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “If/Then”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Next to Normal”   Liesl Tommy, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Eclipsed” (Broadway debut)   Stephen Karam, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: Modern adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s “The Cherry Orchard,” “The Humans”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Humans”   RELATED:   How to Get Cast on Broadway by Terrence McNally   WATCH   Head over to Backstage’s casting calls to see our hosting opportunities!

Whether you have dreams of seeing your name in lights atop a marquee or inside a Broadway program amongst the names that comprise a robust ensemble, you have a long journey ahead towards the Great White Way. Fortunately, you’ve got a friend in us! From how to obtain your Equity card to the all-important terms and creative forces you need to know, here is the Backstage Guide for how to get cast on Broadway.    What do I need to get started?

The materials you’ll need to get cast on Broadway will probably not be new to you. Still, you know what they say about making assumptions, so we’ll break them down below.  Headshot/résumé/reel: These are the materials that you will, unequivocally, need for every single acting job you want to obtain throughout your career. Check out our headshot archives for everything you need to know about what to wear, how to find a photographer, posing tips, and more.  Next, head over to our résumé section for thorough guidance on formatting, what does and does not belong, special skills, and more.  The only difference in these tools for Broadway is, if you’re hoping to break into the musical realm, your reel will need musical excerpts as well as acting. Here , Backstage Expert Tim Grady advises you on how to “recreate the energy and atmosphere of an actual audition” for your musical-theater reel and here expands on the subject by giving his five most useful pointers for your best MT reel.  Backstage: Many, many Broadway stars used Backstage in the early stages of their careers (and beyond). Rachel Bay Jones , who just won a 2017 Tony Award for her role in “Dear Evan Hansen,” says she “lived by Backstage religiously when I first moved to the city.” Broadway icon Beth Leavel also used Backstage at the onset of her New York tenure and tells us she “felt like I was a part of the club when I had my Backstage in my hand.” Veteran theater actor Brian d’Arcy James , most recently seen in “Hamilton,” also says he feels “like it was yesterday when I was going to open calls and looking at all the columns in Backstage.” And this doesn’t just apply to Broadway vets. Anthony Rosenthal , the young actor who starred in last season’s Tony-nominated “Falsettos” revival, also used Backstage when he was getting started. In short: It worked for them!  Branded social media: This is the only supply on this list that may be a little new or surprising. While a strong digital presence and brand certainly aren’t actual requirements to perform on Broadway, in the year 2017, they are instrumentally helpful. Even if a curated social-media presence doesn’t land you a starring role on Broadway, it may very well catch the attention of someone in the industry: a writer, a director, an all-important casting director. That could make your headshot stand out in the pile of submissions on the desk, help you get in the room, and that could, in fact, help get your name on the boards. But building your digital brand is easier said than done, of course, which is why we have an entire guide on that subject alone right here .  WATCH   What should I know about the Actors’ Equity Association?  Let’s start at the beginning, which, when it comes to Broadway, means the Actors’ Equity Association (AEA). Maybe you’re a member, maybe you’ve spent years trying to become one, or maybe you have no idea what the organization even is. Whatever the case may be, we’re here to provide a tell-all explanation.  What is AEA?  Actors’ Equity Association (referred to most commonly in the biz as “Equity”) is the U.S. labor union that represents upwards of 50,000 actors, as well as stage managers. Founded in 1913, it intends to “foster the art of live theater as an essential component of society,” as well as provide its members with benefits such as healthcare and pension plans, fair working hours and conditions, and leverage for negotiating wages. Members receive their Equity card upon initiation, which serves as proof of membership and is used for many purposes, primarily at Equity Principal Auditions and Equity Chorus Calls (which we will delve into deeper later in this guide).  A slight digression but an important distinction to make is that the actors’ union in the United Kingdom is similarly called simply Equity. Apart from the fact that Equity and Actors’ Equity Association are both affiliated with the International Federation of Actors, however, the two are entirely separate entities.  Actor Kate Shindle, who is in the midst of starring as big Alison in the “Fun Home” national tour, is the currently serving president of AEA. You can learn more about Actors’ Equity Association via their full website here .  Do I have to be an AEA member to perform on Broadway?  We won’t mince words. Yes, you have to be a member of AEA to perform on Broadway. There is virtually no exception. Every single performer you have ever seen on Broadway has been represented by AEA. There are, however, many, many different paths to gaining membership, which brings us to...  How do I become a member?  It’s a tale as old as, well, as old as the AEA. How does one become a member? As previously mentioned, there are different ways to get that coveted card in hand. Luckily for you, Backstage has already taken an extensive dive into the subject . Apart from the unicorn scenario where the creative team hands a Broadway contract to a non-union actor and thus has his or her Equity membership pushed through (unsurprisingly, this happens mainly with stars of film and television), there are three primary ways to get your card. They’re broken down below:   Get an Equity Contract While it may seem obvious, getting that first Equity contract can prove tricky. Depending on a variety of factors such as size of the house, budget, and ticket price, theaters may be operating with a limited number of Equity contracts per show or season. Those contracts are likely to go to actors who are members already, but not always. When a union contract is left over with no union member to fill it, it’s bestowed upon a qualified non-union actor. That actor is now paid union wages and, more importantly, is eligible to join during his or her term of employment. Hired as non-union but interested in joining? Particularly with larger companies, it may be worth asking for one or two contracted weeks as part of your negotiation process.    The Equity Membership Candidate Program  The EMC program is a great way to work towards union membership while gaining valuable early career experience. Mimicking an age-old theatrical apprenticeship model, Equity gives candidates the opportunity to earn their eligibility through 50 weeks of work in participating theaters. Once enrolled in the program, candidates earn one point for every eligible week worked; 50 points (and 50 weeks) later, EMC actors are welcomed into the union.  Join Through a Sister Union Another route to an Equity card? After a year’s membership, actors can buy into one of Equity’s sister unions with at least one principal contract or three background contracts worked. Eligible unions include SAG-AFTRA, AGMA (the American Guild of Musical Artists), AGVA (the American Guild of Variety Artists), and GIAA (the Guild of Italian-American Actors). Actors wishing to join through a sister union must provide proof of membership (and good standing), evidence of jobs worked within that one-year time frame, and at least $400 towards the Equity initiation fee—which currently stands at $1,100.   As with SAG-AFTRA , joining Equity is a big decision and a big commitment! Equity actors are barred from taking non-union contracts, so non-union tours, certain Off-Off Broadway companies, and some small regional theaters may be off limits to members. On the brighter side, Equity actors enjoy tons of perks like salary protections and healthcare—and don’t forget access to EPAs and ECCs—alongside a community of 50,000 talented fellow members.   RELATED:   How to Become a Musical Theater Actor   WATCH   How do I audition for Broadway?  You knew it was coming, and now, here it is. Chances are, you won’t book a Broadway gig without auditioning first. Here’s what you should know about the three prominent types of Broadway audition, before stepping into the room.  Equity Principal Auditions Every production with a negotiated Equity contract is required to hold EPAs wherein Equity actors can show up to these somewhat open calls and audition with or without representation. Naturally, your first few EPAs in particular may be intimidating. To take some of the pressure off, Backstage compiled nine important things to know before stepping into the room .  1.  Bring your ID Equity members and Equity Membership Candidates (EMCs) need to bring their paid-up cards in order to sign up for Equity calls. If you are not yet in the union, there’s still a chance you might be seen; future members can often sign up on a separate list (creative team permitting) and are seen on a first-come-first-served basis once the equity members are done. Non-union actors should also come prepared with an ID and expect a longer wait time at most auditions .  2. Go to the right call Do you know the difference between an EPA and an ECC? If not, do a little reading on the Actors’ Equity website before attending your first call to determine which audition is really right for you. Generally, the EPA is seeking leading (principal) roles in plays and musicals, while the ECC (Equity Chorus Call) is seeking ensemble members for larger-scale musicals and separates singers from dancers in two separate calls.  3. Know what you’re auditioning for While many actors see EPAs as a way to “get on the radar” of certain casting teams , you need to know what you’re auditioning for before spending a day in the Actors’ Equity center. Backstage and AEA offer breakdowns for all EPA calls, and it’s important to read those character descriptions before attending a call. Don’t see a role you’re right for in that regional theater’s winter play? Best to sit this one out and wait for an audition that you can nail.  4. Know your 20 Actors’ Equity assigns six actors to every 20-minute time slot with any remaining time at the end of the block given to Equity Alternates, EMCs, and (often) non-union performers. Actors are grouped in those 20-minute intervals and lined up according to sign-up order when they’ve reached their assigned time. If you’re lucky enough to have that secure time slot, you must be present, ready, and prepared when your name is called.  5. Know when you’d like to audition If you attend an EPA as a union member, you’ll be presented with the chance to choose your own time slot. If the time you’d like is not available (but other appointments are), you may sign up on “Alternate List B” to stand by for an earlier spot. If you arrive after all of the appointments have been booked, the monitor will place you on “Alternate List A” and will call off names one by one at the end of each 20-minute group.  6. Be early When it comes to EPAs, the earlier the better. The AEA audition monitor arrives one hour before a call’s start time and signs up actors by order of arrival. During New York’s prime audition season, actors may line up several hours before that monitor arrives (even before the building has opened), meaning that all time slots are filled by very early morning. If it’s a hot project with numerous roles, expect a heavy turnout and arrange your schedule accordingly. Additionally, if you do receive a slot, you must check in at least 10 minutes early. If an actor is not present when the AEA monitor reads off his  name, he or she will sacrifice his audition time to an alternate, EMC, or non-union actor on standby.  7. Be patient—and have plenty of time With their (often) large crowds and uncertain timing, EPAs can feel like a pretty big chore. It’s important to remain calm, polite, and friendly, and to remember why you’re there; the love of performing can always squash a frustrating commute or a long day spent waiting. That said, attending an EPA can often take several hours and should be thought of as an all-day activity. Set the time aside in advance (if possible), and it will be easier to brush off those hours spent in the waiting room.  8. Find great material EPA breakdowns usually request a two-minute monologue , a 32-bar song , or some combination of shorter song and/or monologue. The rules state that actors get at least one minute per audition, so you’ll have, at minimum, 60 seconds to show off what you do best. This is your chance to prove yourself to a new creative team and remind casting fans of your chops. Spend real time looking for a variety of material that suits your type and bring it to the EPA well practiced and polished.  9. Keep a journal Once you start attending EPAs on the reg, you’ll start seeing familiar faces on the other side of the table. Equity posts the ITR (in the room) personnel so you can easily see who was present at your audition. Take notes on this information from week to week, along with what you wore, what you performed, and how it was received by the casting team. In no time at all, you will have a who’s who of local theater casting directors and other important contacts.  Equity Chorus Calls: There are two different types of Equity Chorus Call: those for singing and those for dancing. The designated type will be detailed in the audition listing, however , the most prepared actors will have their given materials (their book, dance clothes, etc.) on hand for either, as performers are oftentimes asked to stay and dance and/or sing even if it was not described in the listing. For a detailed procedural breakdown of ECCs, we direct you again to the Actors’ Equity’s official website , which has all the information you need.  Straight offers: Straight offers don’t fall under the audition category per se, however, they are prominent in Broadway casting and thus must be discussed. Like so many aspects of show business, there is no uniform method for how a person gets to Broadway, and that is exemplified no clearer than with straight offers.  Here is an example: The actor Olivia Wilde made her Broadway debut recently in the stage adaptation of George Orwell’s “1984.” It is a safe assumption that, as an established actor of a different medium (or as it is often referred to in the biz, “a name”) Wilde did not have to attend an EPA to book her role, despite the fact she did not yet have her Equity card.  In a similar vein, Equity actors who may not be “names” in the traditional sense but who have an existing relationship with a given member of a creative team or who simply have a positive reputation and established type in the industry may also receive a straight offer.  RELATED:   How Broadway Shows Get Cast   WATCH   Who are the big Broadway casting directors?  The two names synonymous with Broadway casting that you need to know are Bernard “Bernie” Telsey and Tara Rubin. In its more than 20 years in the industry, the former’s Telsey + Co has cast everything from “Rent” to “Wicked” to a little show called “Hamilton.” Rubin is right on Telsey’s heels, though, having cast this season’s Tony-winning best musical “Dear Evan Hansen,” as well as the ever-running “The Phantom of the Opera.” In addition to these two powerhouses, the third name gaining rapid notoriety in the industry is Jim Carnahan, whose Carnahan Casting is responsible for filling roles in all of the prestigious Roundabout Theatre Company’s musicals and plays.  What’s important to understand about Broadway’s casting directors is the continuity between shows; it is unsurprising to see actors cast repeatedly in the different shows of the same casting director. Take two of Rubin’s most prominent titles: “Indecent,” which bowed on Broadway this past spring, and “The Band’s Visit,” which will play the Great White Way this coming fall. Both of those shows starred/will star Katrina Lenk. Similarly, all three of the roles originated on Broadway by Idina Menzel were cast by Telsey.

RELATED:   Broadway’s Bernie Telsey, Tara Rubin + Thomas Schumacher on What Theater Can Learn About Diversity From TV   WATCH   What are the different Broadway gigs?   Swing: Frequently regarded as the most challenging gig on Broadway, swing actors are not actually in the cast onstage for most performances. Rather, they cover multiple tracks in a show. That means a swing learns several different principal or ensemble roles and, in the event that an actor is out of a performance, he or she is able to step in at a moment’s notice.    Standby: Similar to swings, standby performers are not actually in the onstage cast when the entire lineup of performers is present. Standbys are there to do just that: They standby in case an actor is out of a show. Generally, standbys are only for the meatiest roles where a traditional understudy may not suffice, and they only cover one role in the show. “Wicked,” for example, has standbys for both witches.    Understudy: Speaking of understudies, you probably know at least vaguely what they are. What separates understudies from swings is that understudies are in the show, however, they also understudy a bigger or more principal role in the event that the actor playing it is out. (From there, a swing will likely step into that understudy’s usual role.)    Ensemble: The ensemble, less politically correctly referred to as “the chorus,” is the onstage performers and dancers who, for lack of a better word, support for the principal cast. They are also similar to background actors in television and film. They fill scenes and dance numbers and serve as a literal chorus in musical numbers.    Principal: Finally, principal actors are those who play characters with names and whose headshots are on the main page of the show’s program. They play the lead and supporting roles and, if they are well-known to the public, may even see their name above the title on the theater’s marquee. A note: If a performer’s name is above the title, they will automatically be considered in the leading role category when it comes to awards consideration unless otherwise campaigned for by the creative team.   WATCH   What are the actual theaters (and who owns them)?  Broadway is defined entirely by its houses. Did you know that what renders a theater a Broadway theater is not in fact its adjacency to the actual avenue, but the number of seats it contains? Five hundred seats or more, and the theater is Broadway; 100 or more, and it’s Off-Broadway; and, if it contains under 100 seats, it’s usually considered Off-Off-Broadway.  It probably sounds a bit strange conceptually, but Broadway theaters require rent to be paid in order to be occupied. And just like all New York City rents, the costs are exponentially high. For this reason, theater rental is one of the utmost financial considerations when it comes to funding as well as the decision to keep a show open or close it. So, who are these “theater landlords,” if you will?  When it comes to Broadway houses, there are three names you need to know: Shubert, Nederlander, and Jujamycyn. These three entities alone own the vast majority of Broadway’s now-41 theaters. (That number is thanks to the addition of this year’s re-opened Hudson Theatre).  The Nederlander Organization owns nine Broadway houses, including the Brooks Atkinson (“Waitress”), the Minskoff (“The Lion King”), and the Richard Rodgers (“Hamilton”).  The Shubert Organization boasts an impressive 18-theater roster including the Music Box (“Dear Evan Hansen”), the Gerald Schoenfeld (“Come From Away”), and the Cort (the incoming “M. Butterfly”).  The newest of the big three is Jujamcyn (pronounced joo-jam-sin), which has five theaters with several major hits, including the Eugene O’Neill (“The Book of Mormon”), the Al Hirschfeld (“Kinky Boots”), and the St. James (which will host the sure-to-be-massive “Frozen” adaptation next spring).  These three house owners do not account for every Broadway house, though. In addition, there are smaller, subscriber-based entities including the Roundabout Theatre Company (which owns the American Airlines Theatre as well as Studio 54), Manhattan Theatre Club (the Samuel J. Friedman), and of course, Lincoln Center, which boasts one Broadway theater way up at the actual Lincoln Center, the Vivian Beaumont. (Lincoln Center does get involved in producing other shows from time to time, including last season’s “Falsettos.”)  Do I need an agent?  There may be no question asked with more frequency than that of whether or not actors in all corners of the industry need an agent to get cast. Therefore, it’s unsurprising that we at Backstage have already done tons of hearty investigation in order to thoroughly and honestly answer it.  And that answer is, well, no, you do not need an agent to get cast on Broadway—but it helps! Of course, you can scour casting notices (hey, Backstage has lots of those!) and, if you’re Equity, you can show up to ECCs or try to submit for EPAs. But an agent increases your likelihood of getting seen by a large margin. Additionally, many Broadway gigs will not be publicly broadcasted anyway and will be filtered exclusively through agent submissions.  Similarly, though it’s a bit of a catch-22, just having an agent increases your industry cachet and standing, and that alone makes you a more desirable candidate for any Broadway gig.  To understand why exactly agents are so vital and how they help you in the casting process, Backstage Expert Gwyn Gilliss explains what they really do:  1. Submit you for an audition. An agent sends a casting director an email, an electronic submission, a hard-copy headshot and resume, your website link, IMDb page, or other website with your work. You need to provide excellent marketing tools so he or she can submit you.  2. Pitch you to industry leaders. An agent spends a lot of time on the phone and can talk about you—and your talent—with casting directors, directors, and producers in order to get you an appointment, meeting, or audition. You need to let your agent know what you can really do and what you book the most, as well as any unique qualities and talents you may have.  3. Follow up. Agents will follow up for you when you have a callback and you need to arrange the time and place. You need to be available, eager, passionate, prepared, aggressively competitive, and show up 100 percent.  4. Negotiate higher pay. Agents can get you higher-than-minimum pay when you book a job. They go over the details of your contract including salary, travel arrangements, billing, and other special arrangements of any kind. These could include: specific wardrobe designer or clothing style, hair or makeup artist request, special diet specifications, etc.—all things that might be accepted especially when you’re an established star. You need to communicate clearly what you want or require so there are no problems once the contract is signed and you’re miles away on location. Research and knowledge is essential on your part.  5. Re-negotiate contracts. When your contract is up for re-negotiation for a TV show, Broadway show, or network commercial extension, you agent can negotiate an increase in pay. You need to understand the commitment and the possibility of having to turn down a larger, more lucrative offer for a competitive show or project. You need to take responsibility for the results once you sign or re-sign a contract.  Again, though, just because your chances are higher of finding and booking a gig with an agent than without one, that doesn’t mean it’s not possible. “Some actors will tell you that it’s not worth your time to go to an EPA or Open Call, that we’re not really looking, or only seriously seeing agent/manager submissions,” says JV Mercanti , a Backstage Expert and head of acting for the musical theater program at Pace University’s School of the Arts. “I can tell you that when casting the Broadway production of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ‘The Woman in White’ many years ago that seven of our ensemble members came from the EPA. Musicals and shows requiring younger people (think “Spring Awakening”) especially use these calls to find young, unrepresented talent. For plays, understudy roles can often be cast from these calls.”  Ultimately, if you do decide an agent is the right path for you and your career to move forward, actually getting one will be a feat all its own. Lucky for you, we’ve already devoted an entire guide (similar to this one!) to how to get an acting agent .  Read:   6 Ways to Find the Best Agent for You   WATCH   What terms should I know?  Do you know what it means to go up on your lines or to be off-book? What about the difference between a production stage manager and an assistant stage manager (neither of which should be confused with the production assistant)? Are you going to understand what’s required when your sitzprobe is scheduled, or what a 10 out of 12 will entail?  It’s OK if you answered “no” to any of the above—for now. However, Broadway specifically has a ton of lingo that may sound foreign to someone not in the know and, if you plan to be on Broadway, you need to know it. We’ve got you covered below.   60+ Theater Terms Every Actor Should Know    23 Must-Know Musical Theater Audition Terms   WATCH   What are the best schools for breeding Broadway talent?  Just like having an agent, graduating from one of the “top” schools for breeding Broadway talent may help give you a leg up, but it’s hardly impossible to get cast without it. Additionally, graduating from one of these institutions in no way guarantees you a spot onstage. Still, it’s helpful to know the major schools, as well as some of the successful alums who’ve emerged from them. On the Broadway circuit, the “big three” when it comes to collegiate training are:  Carnegie Mellon University: Considered by many to be the top dog for Broadway training, CMU’s School of Drama emphasizes established practices integrated with innovation in order to produce artists that are both timeless and forward thinking. Additionally, musical theater actors are required to take the same acting classes as dramatic actors in order to ensure a roundedness. Alumni include “Wicked” and “Smash” star Megan Hilty, two-time Tony winner Christian Borle, “Hamilton” star Leslie Odom, Jr., “Book of Mormon” and “Frozen” star Josh Gad, and “Kinky Boots” Tony winner Billy Porter.  College Conservatory of Music: The oldest musical theater program in the entire country, CCM is widely recognized for its triple-threat approach to training and unsurprisingly has produced tons of talent that has gone on to Broadway. Currently on the boards, alumna Betsy Wolfe is playing the title role in “Waitress,” and Christy Altomare is also playing the title role in “Anastasia.” Faith Prince and Aaron Lazar are graduates as well, as are “Hamiton” stars Karen Olivo and Andrew Chappelle.  University of Michigan: Michigan’s department of theater and dance places importance on balance: Academic excellence and training are focused on equally. Darren Criss of “Glee” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” stardom is a 2009 alum, and Gavin Creel, who just won a 2017 Tony Award for his work in “Hello, Dolly!” is also a Michigan-degree carrier.  RELATED:   7 Schools Where Tony Winners Got Their Start   Who are the composers, book writers, and playwrights I need to know today?  In the same way that art is subjective and will speak to every viewer differently, there is no definitive ranking of creatives working on Broadway that you need to know. A playwright who has been seminal in your artistic drive since elementary school could be entirely obscure to a fellow actor. The same goes for composers and musical book writers. That being said, if you don’t have a very basic knowledge of the below artists and their corresponding legacies, well, good luck making small talk at your next ECC.  Lin-Manuel Miranda, composer and book writer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Hamilton”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Hamilton,” “In the Heights”   Stephen Sondheim, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sunday in the Park with George” revival starring Annaleigh Ashford and Jake Gyllenhaal  Most prominent Broadway work: “Sweeney Todd,” “Into the Woods,” “West Side Story”   Jeanine Tesori, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Fun Home”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Thoroughly Modern Millie,” “Caroline, or Change”   Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, composing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “Dear Evan Hansen”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Dear Evan Hansen,” “A Christmas Story”   Lynn Nottage, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sweat” (Broadway debut)   Andrew Lloyd Webber, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “School of Rock,” “The Phantom of the Opera”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Evita”   Paula Vogel, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Indecent” (Broadway debut)   Joshua Harmon, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Significant Other” (Broadway debut)   David Yazbek, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,” “The Band’s Visit” (upcoming)  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Full Monty”   Bobby Lopez, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “The Book of Mormon”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Book of Mormon,” “Avenue Q”   Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, composing/book writing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “If/Then”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Next to Normal”   Liesl Tommy, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Eclipsed” (Broadway debut)   Stephen Karam, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: Modern adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s “The Cherry Orchard,” “The Humans”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Humans”   RELATED:   How to Get Cast on Broadway by Terrence McNally   WATCH   Head over to Backstage’s casting calls to see our hosting opportunities!

Whether you have dreams of seeing your name in lights atop a marquee or inside a Broadway program amongst the names that comprise a robust ensemble, you have a long journey ahead towards the Great White Way. Fortunately, you’ve got a friend in us! From how to obtain your Equity card to the all-important terms and creative forces you need to know, here is the Backstage Guide for how to get cast on Broadway.    What do I need to get started?

The materials you’ll need to get cast on Broadway will probably not be new to you. Still, you know what they say about making assumptions, so we’ll break them down below.  Headshot/résumé/reel: These are the materials that you will, unequivocally, need for every single acting job you want to obtain throughout your career. Check out our headshot archives for everything you need to know about what to wear, how to find a photographer, posing tips, and more.  Next, head over to our résumé section for thorough guidance on formatting, what does and does not belong, special skills, and more.  The only difference in these tools for Broadway is, if you’re hoping to break into the musical realm, your reel will need musical excerpts as well as acting. Here , Backstage Expert Tim Grady advises you on how to “recreate the energy and atmosphere of an actual audition” for your musical-theater reel and here expands on the subject by giving his five most useful pointers for your best MT reel.  Backstage: Many, many Broadway stars used Backstage in the early stages of their careers (and beyond). Rachel Bay Jones , who just won a 2017 Tony Award for her role in “Dear Evan Hansen,” says she “lived by Backstage religiously when I first moved to the city.” Broadway icon Beth Leavel also used Backstage at the onset of her New York tenure and tells us she “felt like I was a part of the club when I had my Backstage in my hand.” Veteran theater actor Brian d’Arcy James , most recently seen in “Hamilton,” also says he feels “like it was yesterday when I was going to open calls and looking at all the columns in Backstage.” And this doesn’t just apply to Broadway vets. Anthony Rosenthal , the young actor who starred in last season’s Tony-nominated “Falsettos” revival, also used Backstage when he was getting started. In short: It worked for them!  Branded social media: This is the only supply on this list that may be a little new or surprising. While a strong digital presence and brand certainly aren’t actual requirements to perform on Broadway, in the year 2017, they are instrumentally helpful. Even if a curated social-media presence doesn’t land you a starring role on Broadway, it may very well catch the attention of someone in the industry: a writer, a director, an all-important casting director. That could make your headshot stand out in the pile of submissions on the desk, help you get in the room, and that could, in fact, help get your name on the boards. But building your digital brand is easier said than done, of course, which is why we have an entire guide on that subject alone right here .  WATCH   What should I know about the Actors’ Equity Association?  Let’s start at the beginning, which, when it comes to Broadway, means the Actors’ Equity Association (AEA). Maybe you’re a member, maybe you’ve spent years trying to become one, or maybe you have no idea what the organization even is. Whatever the case may be, we’re here to provide a tell-all explanation.  What is AEA?  Actors’ Equity Association (referred to most commonly in the biz as “Equity”) is the U.S. labor union that represents upwards of 50,000 actors, as well as stage managers. Founded in 1913, it intends to “foster the art of live theater as an essential component of society,” as well as provide its members with benefits such as healthcare and pension plans, fair working hours and conditions, and leverage for negotiating wages. Members receive their Equity card upon initiation, which serves as proof of membership and is used for many purposes, primarily at Equity Principal Auditions and Equity Chorus Calls (which we will delve into deeper later in this guide).  A slight digression but an important distinction to make is that the actors’ union in the United Kingdom is similarly called simply Equity. Apart from the fact that Equity and Actors’ Equity Association are both affiliated with the International Federation of Actors, however, the two are entirely separate entities.  Actor Kate Shindle, who is in the midst of starring as big Alison in the “Fun Home” national tour, is the currently serving president of AEA. You can learn more about Actors’ Equity Association via their full website here .  Do I have to be an AEA member to perform on Broadway?  We won’t mince words. Yes, you have to be a member of AEA to perform on Broadway. There is virtually no exception. Every single performer you have ever seen on Broadway has been represented by AEA. There are, however, many, many different paths to gaining membership, which brings us to...  How do I become a member?  It’s a tale as old as, well, as old as the AEA. How does one become a member? As previously mentioned, there are different ways to get that coveted card in hand. Luckily for you, Backstage has already taken an extensive dive into the subject . Apart from the unicorn scenario where the creative team hands a Broadway contract to a non-union actor and thus has his or her Equity membership pushed through (unsurprisingly, this happens mainly with stars of film and television), there are three primary ways to get your card. They’re broken down below:   Get an Equity Contract While it may seem obvious, getting that first Equity contract can prove tricky. Depending on a variety of factors such as size of the house, budget, and ticket price, theaters may be operating with a limited number of Equity contracts per show or season. Those contracts are likely to go to actors who are members already, but not always. When a union contract is left over with no union member to fill it, it’s bestowed upon a qualified non-union actor. That actor is now paid union wages and, more importantly, is eligible to join during his or her term of employment. Hired as non-union but interested in joining? Particularly with larger companies, it may be worth asking for one or two contracted weeks as part of your negotiation process.    The Equity Membership Candidate Program  The EMC program is a great way to work towards union membership while gaining valuable early career experience. Mimicking an age-old theatrical apprenticeship model, Equity gives candidates the opportunity to earn their eligibility through 50 weeks of work in participating theaters. Once enrolled in the program, candidates earn one point for every eligible week worked; 50 points (and 50 weeks) later, EMC actors are welcomed into the union.  Join Through a Sister Union Another route to an Equity card? After a year’s membership, actors can buy into one of Equity’s sister unions with at least one principal contract or three background contracts worked. Eligible unions include SAG-AFTRA, AGMA (the American Guild of Musical Artists), AGVA (the American Guild of Variety Artists), and GIAA (the Guild of Italian-American Actors). Actors wishing to join through a sister union must provide proof of membership (and good standing), evidence of jobs worked within that one-year time frame, and at least $400 towards the Equity initiation fee—which currently stands at $1,100.   As with SAG-AFTRA , joining Equity is a big decision and a big commitment! Equity actors are barred from taking non-union contracts, so non-union tours, certain Off-Off Broadway companies, and some small regional theaters may be off limits to members. On the brighter side, Equity actors enjoy tons of perks like salary protections and healthcare—and don’t forget access to EPAs and ECCs—alongside a community of 50,000 talented fellow members.   RELATED:   How to Become a Musical Theater Actor   WATCH   How do I audition for Broadway?  You knew it was coming, and now, here it is. Chances are, you won’t book a Broadway gig without auditioning first. Here’s what you should know about the three prominent types of Broadway audition, before stepping into the room.  Equity Principal Auditions Every production with a negotiated Equity contract is required to hold EPAs wherein Equity actors can show up to these somewhat open calls and audition with or without representation. Naturally, your first few EPAs in particular may be intimidating. To take some of the pressure off, Backstage compiled nine important things to know before stepping into the room .  1.  Bring your ID Equity members and Equity Membership Candidates (EMCs) need to bring their paid-up cards in order to sign up for Equity calls. If you are not yet in the union, there’s still a chance you might be seen; future members can often sign up on a separate list (creative team permitting) and are seen on a first-come-first-served basis once the equity members are done. Non-union actors should also come prepared with an ID and expect a longer wait time at most auditions .  2. Go to the right call Do you know the difference between an EPA and an ECC? If not, do a little reading on the Actors’ Equity website before attending your first call to determine which audition is really right for you. Generally, the EPA is seeking leading (principal) roles in plays and musicals, while the ECC (Equity Chorus Call) is seeking ensemble members for larger-scale musicals and separates singers from dancers in two separate calls.  3. Know what you’re auditioning for While many actors see EPAs as a way to “get on the radar” of certain casting teams , you need to know what you’re auditioning for before spending a day in the Actors’ Equity center. Backstage and AEA offer breakdowns for all EPA calls, and it’s important to read those character descriptions before attending a call. Don’t see a role you’re right for in that regional theater’s winter play? Best to sit this one out and wait for an audition that you can nail.  4. Know your 20 Actors’ Equity assigns six actors to every 20-minute time slot with any remaining time at the end of the block given to Equity Alternates, EMCs, and (often) non-union performers. Actors are grouped in those 20-minute intervals and lined up according to sign-up order when they’ve reached their assigned time. If you’re lucky enough to have that secure time slot, you must be present, ready, and prepared when your name is called.  5. Know when you’d like to audition If you attend an EPA as a union member, you’ll be presented with the chance to choose your own time slot. If the time you’d like is not available (but other appointments are), you may sign up on “Alternate List B” to stand by for an earlier spot. If you arrive after all of the appointments have been booked, the monitor will place you on “Alternate List A” and will call off names one by one at the end of each 20-minute group.  6. Be early When it comes to EPAs, the earlier the better. The AEA audition monitor arrives one hour before a call’s start time and signs up actors by order of arrival. During New York’s prime audition season, actors may line up several hours before that monitor arrives (even before the building has opened), meaning that all time slots are filled by very early morning. If it’s a hot project with numerous roles, expect a heavy turnout and arrange your schedule accordingly. Additionally, if you do receive a slot, you must check in at least 10 minutes early. If an actor is not present when the AEA monitor reads off his  name, he or she will sacrifice his audition time to an alternate, EMC, or non-union actor on standby.  7. Be patient—and have plenty of time With their (often) large crowds and uncertain timing, EPAs can feel like a pretty big chore. It’s important to remain calm, polite, and friendly, and to remember why you’re there; the love of performing can always squash a frustrating commute or a long day spent waiting. That said, attending an EPA can often take several hours and should be thought of as an all-day activity. Set the time aside in advance (if possible), and it will be easier to brush off those hours spent in the waiting room.  8. Find great material EPA breakdowns usually request a two-minute monologue , a 32-bar song , or some combination of shorter song and/or monologue. The rules state that actors get at least one minute per audition, so you’ll have, at minimum, 60 seconds to show off what you do best. This is your chance to prove yourself to a new creative team and remind casting fans of your chops. Spend real time looking for a variety of material that suits your type and bring it to the EPA well practiced and polished.  9. Keep a journal Once you start attending EPAs on the reg, you’ll start seeing familiar faces on the other side of the table. Equity posts the ITR (in the room) personnel so you can easily see who was present at your audition. Take notes on this information from week to week, along with what you wore, what you performed, and how it was received by the casting team. In no time at all, you will have a who’s who of local theater casting directors and other important contacts.  Equity Chorus Calls: There are two different types of Equity Chorus Call: those for singing and those for dancing. The designated type will be detailed in the audition listing, however , the most prepared actors will have their given materials (their book, dance clothes, etc.) on hand for either, as performers are oftentimes asked to stay and dance and/or sing even if it was not described in the listing. For a detailed procedural breakdown of ECCs, we direct you again to the Actors’ Equity’s official website , which has all the information you need.  Straight offers: Straight offers don’t fall under the audition category per se, however, they are prominent in Broadway casting and thus must be discussed. Like so many aspects of show business, there is no uniform method for how a person gets to Broadway, and that is exemplified no clearer than with straight offers.  Here is an example: The actor Olivia Wilde made her Broadway debut recently in the stage adaptation of George Orwell’s “1984.” It is a safe assumption that, as an established actor of a different medium (or as it is often referred to in the biz, “a name”) Wilde did not have to attend an EPA to book her role, despite the fact she did not yet have her Equity card.  In a similar vein, Equity actors who may not be “names” in the traditional sense but who have an existing relationship with a given member of a creative team or who simply have a positive reputation and established type in the industry may also receive a straight offer.  RELATED:   How Broadway Shows Get Cast   WATCH   Who are the big Broadway casting directors?  The two names synonymous with Broadway casting that you need to know are Bernard “Bernie” Telsey and Tara Rubin. In its more than 20 years in the industry, the former’s Telsey + Co has cast everything from “Rent” to “Wicked” to a little show called “Hamilton.” Rubin is right on Telsey’s heels, though, having cast this season’s Tony-winning best musical “Dear Evan Hansen,” as well as the ever-running “The Phantom of the Opera.” In addition to these two powerhouses, the third name gaining rapid notoriety in the industry is Jim Carnahan, whose Carnahan Casting is responsible for filling roles in all of the prestigious Roundabout Theatre Company’s musicals and plays.  What’s important to understand about Broadway’s casting directors is the continuity between shows; it is unsurprising to see actors cast repeatedly in the different shows of the same casting director. Take two of Rubin’s most prominent titles: “Indecent,” which bowed on Broadway this past spring, and “The Band’s Visit,” which will play the Great White Way this coming fall. Both of those shows starred/will star Katrina Lenk. Similarly, all three of the roles originated on Broadway by Idina Menzel were cast by Telsey.

RELATED:   Broadway’s Bernie Telsey, Tara Rubin + Thomas Schumacher on What Theater Can Learn About Diversity From TV   WATCH   What are the different Broadway gigs?   Swing: Frequently regarded as the most challenging gig on Broadway, swing actors are not actually in the cast onstage for most performances. Rather, they cover multiple tracks in a show. That means a swing learns several different principal or ensemble roles and, in the event that an actor is out of a performance, he or she is able to step in at a moment’s notice.    Standby: Similar to swings, standby performers are not actually in the onstage cast when the entire lineup of performers is present. Standbys are there to do just that: They standby in case an actor is out of a show. Generally, standbys are only for the meatiest roles where a traditional understudy may not suffice, and they only cover one role in the show. “Wicked,” for example, has standbys for both witches.    Understudy: Speaking of understudies, you probably know at least vaguely what they are. What separates understudies from swings is that understudies are in the show, however, they also understudy a bigger or more principal role in the event that the actor playing it is out. (From there, a swing will likely step into that understudy’s usual role.)    Ensemble: The ensemble, less politically correctly referred to as “the chorus,” is the onstage performers and dancers who, for lack of a better word, support for the principal cast. They are also similar to background actors in television and film. They fill scenes and dance numbers and serve as a literal chorus in musical numbers.    Principal: Finally, principal actors are those who play characters with names and whose headshots are on the main page of the show’s program. They play the lead and supporting roles and, if they are well-known to the public, may even see their name above the title on the theater’s marquee. A note: If a performer’s name is above the title, they will automatically be considered in the leading role category when it comes to awards consideration unless otherwise campaigned for by the creative team.   WATCH   What are the actual theaters (and who owns them)?  Broadway is defined entirely by its houses. Did you know that what renders a theater a Broadway theater is not in fact its adjacency to the actual avenue, but the number of seats it contains? Five hundred seats or more, and the theater is Broadway; 100 or more, and it’s Off-Broadway; and, if it contains under 100 seats, it’s usually considered Off-Off-Broadway.  It probably sounds a bit strange conceptually, but Broadway theaters require rent to be paid in order to be occupied. And just like all New York City rents, the costs are exponentially high. For this reason, theater rental is one of the utmost financial considerations when it comes to funding as well as the decision to keep a show open or close it. So, who are these “theater landlords,” if you will?  When it comes to Broadway houses, there are three names you need to know: Shubert, Nederlander, and Jujamycyn. These three entities alone own the vast majority of Broadway’s now-41 theaters. (That number is thanks to the addition of this year’s re-opened Hudson Theatre).  The Nederlander Organization owns nine Broadway houses, including the Brooks Atkinson (“Waitress”), the Minskoff (“The Lion King”), and the Richard Rodgers (“Hamilton”).  The Shubert Organization boasts an impressive 18-theater roster including the Music Box (“Dear Evan Hansen”), the Gerald Schoenfeld (“Come From Away”), and the Cort (the incoming “M. Butterfly”).  The newest of the big three is Jujamcyn (pronounced joo-jam-sin), which has five theaters with several major hits, including the Eugene O’Neill (“The Book of Mormon”), the Al Hirschfeld (“Kinky Boots”), and the St. James (which will host the sure-to-be-massive “Frozen” adaptation next spring).  These three house owners do not account for every Broadway house, though. In addition, there are smaller, subscriber-based entities including the Roundabout Theatre Company (which owns the American Airlines Theatre as well as Studio 54), Manhattan Theatre Club (the Samuel J. Friedman), and of course, Lincoln Center, which boasts one Broadway theater way up at the actual Lincoln Center, the Vivian Beaumont. (Lincoln Center does get involved in producing other shows from time to time, including last season’s “Falsettos.”)  Do I need an agent?  There may be no question asked with more frequency than that of whether or not actors in all corners of the industry need an agent to get cast. Therefore, it’s unsurprising that we at Backstage have already done tons of hearty investigation in order to thoroughly and honestly answer it.  And that answer is, well, no, you do not need an agent to get cast on Broadway—but it helps! Of course, you can scour casting notices (hey, Backstage has lots of those!) and, if you’re Equity, you can show up to ECCs or try to submit for EPAs. But an agent increases your likelihood of getting seen by a large margin. Additionally, many Broadway gigs will not be publicly broadcasted anyway and will be filtered exclusively through agent submissions.  Similarly, though it’s a bit of a catch-22, just having an agent increases your industry cachet and standing, and that alone makes you a more desirable candidate for any Broadway gig.  To understand why exactly agents are so vital and how they help you in the casting process, Backstage Expert Gwyn Gilliss explains what they really do:  1. Submit you for an audition. An agent sends a casting director an email, an electronic submission, a hard-copy headshot and resume, your website link, IMDb page, or other website with your work. You need to provide excellent marketing tools so he or she can submit you.  2. Pitch you to industry leaders. An agent spends a lot of time on the phone and can talk about you—and your talent—with casting directors, directors, and producers in order to get you an appointment, meeting, or audition. You need to let your agent know what you can really do and what you book the most, as well as any unique qualities and talents you may have.  3. Follow up. Agents will follow up for you when you have a callback and you need to arrange the time and place. You need to be available, eager, passionate, prepared, aggressively competitive, and show up 100 percent.  4. Negotiate higher pay. Agents can get you higher-than-minimum pay when you book a job. They go over the details of your contract including salary, travel arrangements, billing, and other special arrangements of any kind. These could include: specific wardrobe designer or clothing style, hair or makeup artist request, special diet specifications, etc.—all things that might be accepted especially when you’re an established star. You need to communicate clearly what you want or require so there are no problems once the contract is signed and you’re miles away on location. Research and knowledge is essential on your part.  5. Re-negotiate contracts. When your contract is up for re-negotiation for a TV show, Broadway show, or network commercial extension, you agent can negotiate an increase in pay. You need to understand the commitment and the possibility of having to turn down a larger, more lucrative offer for a competitive show or project. You need to take responsibility for the results once you sign or re-sign a contract.  Again, though, just because your chances are higher of finding and booking a gig with an agent than without one, that doesn’t mean it’s not possible. “Some actors will tell you that it’s not worth your time to go to an EPA or Open Call, that we’re not really looking, or only seriously seeing agent/manager submissions,” says JV Mercanti , a Backstage Expert and head of acting for the musical theater program at Pace University’s School of the Arts. “I can tell you that when casting the Broadway production of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ‘The Woman in White’ many years ago that seven of our ensemble members came from the EPA. Musicals and shows requiring younger people (think “Spring Awakening”) especially use these calls to find young, unrepresented talent. For plays, understudy roles can often be cast from these calls.”  Ultimately, if you do decide an agent is the right path for you and your career to move forward, actually getting one will be a feat all its own. Lucky for you, we’ve already devoted an entire guide (similar to this one!) to how to get an acting agent .  Read:   6 Ways to Find the Best Agent for You   WATCH   What terms should I know?  Do you know what it means to go up on your lines or to be off-book? What about the difference between a production stage manager and an assistant stage manager (neither of which should be confused with the production assistant)? Are you going to understand what’s required when your sitzprobe is scheduled, or what a 10 out of 12 will entail?  It’s OK if you answered “no” to any of the above—for now. However, Broadway specifically has a ton of lingo that may sound foreign to someone not in the know and, if you plan to be on Broadway, you need to know it. We’ve got you covered below.   60+ Theater Terms Every Actor Should Know    23 Must-Know Musical Theater Audition Terms   WATCH   What are the best schools for breeding Broadway talent?  Just like having an agent, graduating from one of the “top” schools for breeding Broadway talent may help give you a leg up, but it’s hardly impossible to get cast without it. Additionally, graduating from one of these institutions in no way guarantees you a spot onstage. Still, it’s helpful to know the major schools, as well as some of the successful alums who’ve emerged from them. On the Broadway circuit, the “big three” when it comes to collegiate training are:  Carnegie Mellon University: Considered by many to be the top dog for Broadway training, CMU’s School of Drama emphasizes established practices integrated with innovation in order to produce artists that are both timeless and forward thinking. Additionally, musical theater actors are required to take the same acting classes as dramatic actors in order to ensure a roundedness. Alumni include “Wicked” and “Smash” star Megan Hilty, two-time Tony winner Christian Borle, “Hamilton” star Leslie Odom, Jr., “Book of Mormon” and “Frozen” star Josh Gad, and “Kinky Boots” Tony winner Billy Porter.  College Conservatory of Music: The oldest musical theater program in the entire country, CCM is widely recognized for its triple-threat approach to training and unsurprisingly has produced tons of talent that has gone on to Broadway. Currently on the boards, alumna Betsy Wolfe is playing the title role in “Waitress,” and Christy Altomare is also playing the title role in “Anastasia.” Faith Prince and Aaron Lazar are graduates as well, as are “Hamiton” stars Karen Olivo and Andrew Chappelle.  University of Michigan: Michigan’s department of theater and dance places importance on balance: Academic excellence and training are focused on equally. Darren Criss of “Glee” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” stardom is a 2009 alum, and Gavin Creel, who just won a 2017 Tony Award for his work in “Hello, Dolly!” is also a Michigan-degree carrier.  RELATED:   7 Schools Where Tony Winners Got Their Start   Who are the composers, book writers, and playwrights I need to know today?  In the same way that art is subjective and will speak to every viewer differently, there is no definitive ranking of creatives working on Broadway that you need to know. A playwright who has been seminal in your artistic drive since elementary school could be entirely obscure to a fellow actor. The same goes for composers and musical book writers. That being said, if you don’t have a very basic knowledge of the below artists and their corresponding legacies, well, good luck making small talk at your next ECC.  Lin-Manuel Miranda, composer and book writer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Hamilton”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Hamilton,” “In the Heights”   Stephen Sondheim, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sunday in the Park with George” revival starring Annaleigh Ashford and Jake Gyllenhaal  Most prominent Broadway work: “Sweeney Todd,” “Into the Woods,” “West Side Story”   Jeanine Tesori, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Fun Home”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Thoroughly Modern Millie,” “Caroline, or Change”   Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, composing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “Dear Evan Hansen”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Dear Evan Hansen,” “A Christmas Story”   Lynn Nottage, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Sweat” (Broadway debut)   Andrew Lloyd Webber, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “School of Rock,” “The Phantom of the Opera”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Evita”   Paula Vogel, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Indecent” (Broadway debut)   Joshua Harmon, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Significant Other” (Broadway debut)   David Yazbek, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,” “The Band’s Visit” (upcoming)  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Full Monty”   Bobby Lopez, composer:   Recent work on Broadway: “The Book of Mormon”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Book of Mormon,” “Avenue Q”   Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, composing/book writing team:   Recent work on Broadway: “If/Then”  Most prominent Broadway work: “Next to Normal”   Liesl Tommy, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: “Eclipsed” (Broadway debut)   Stephen Karam, playwright:   Recent work on Broadway: Modern adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s “The Cherry Orchard,” “The Humans”  Most prominent Broadway work: “The Humans”   RELATED:   How to Get Cast on Broadway by Terrence McNally   WATCH   Head over to Backstage’s casting calls to see our hosting opportunities!

I get a lot of emails from folks telling me that it’s their dream to work on Broadway.  Some want to be General Managers.  Some want to be Casting Directors.  Some don’t have a clue as to what they want to do, but they know they want . . . well . . . to be a part of it, New York, New York.  Some have finished school.  Some have even been through graduate school.  And quite a few through law school, actually.  Some haven’t even finished high school.  But they all know they want to do what I have been so blessed to have been able to do . . . work in an industry that they love.  Since I was one of those people who dreamed about working on Broadway, I’ve come up with some tips for folks looking to land that theater job . . . and keep it.  And while, sure, these tips are focused on the NY scene, they are easily applied to wherever you may be.  So if you’re looking to work on the Broadway, here are five tips to help you out:  1.  Got an interview?  Get tickets.  One of the first questions I ask people who sit in front of me looking for a job is, “What shows have you seen lately?”  And then I ask, “ Have you seen mine? ”  I can’t tell you how many people say no.  Does it count them out?  Not 100%.  But the people that say yes?  Oooohhh, they vault to the top of the leader board.  It’s not about kissing a$$, or putting some bucks in my till.  It’s about a gesture that says, “I’m interested in seeing the work that goes on here, so I can show you how I can contribute to making it even better.”  I know, theater tickets are expensive.  But they’ll be a lot easier to pay for if you have a job that pays you a salary.  Make an investment in your search, and people will invest in you.  2.  Get in the right room.  There’s no question that Broadway is a very closed-door industry.  And it’s hard to get that open, no matter how hard you knock.  Here’s the good news.  Once you do get the door open and you get in the room, the door usually shuts and we don’t let you out.  You’re ours!  Bahahahahaha.  Jobs are the best way to get entry into the room, but there’s the catch 22 , right?  So how else can you get potential employers to know who you are?  Emails rarely work.  Cold phone calls?  Forget it.  So, attend Galas.  Go to conferences (like my annual Super Conference !).   Get to opening nights.  Invest.  Do whatever you can do to put your face in front of employers.  I’ve hired at least three people who grabbed me for an intro after listening to me speak on a panel.  A face-to-face intro is a zillion times more “impressive” than an electronic one.  3.  Be prepared to start at the bottom.  I have a lot of respect for people who have earned MBA’s, JD’s, MD’s, or any advanced degree that cost six figures and took several years.  But that doesn’t mean you get to start at the middle.  Broadway is a niche industry which requires a lot of specialized knowledge that isn’t taught in any curriculum (except it’s all on The Producer’s Perspective PRO! ).  So that means anyone looking to get a job in the biz has to start where everyone else does . . . at the bottom. Fortunately, the bottom is a little better now than when I first started out in this industry 20 years ago!  It means having a “can-do” attitude! My staff knows that no task is too small (we have spring cleaning each year and everyone pitches in), and no project too large. It’s all about teamwork, collaboration, and a positive attitude.  But do what’s required with a smile on your face, and you’ll rise to the top quicker than you can say “I went to graduate school for this?”  4.  We don’t punch clocks.  At the end of every interview, I always ask if the job candidate has any questions.  (Tip:  Have a question or two . . . it’ll keep you in the room longer and create a stronger impression.)  The questions they ask me, teach me more about their personality than any other part of the interview.  And the one question I hate the most?  “What are the hours?”  This is indicative that they aren’t prepared for #3 above.  Office hours may be 10am-6pm, but everyone does the work for the love of it. If you love what you do, then you won’t be watching the clock. And I only want to work with people who truly love what they do.  Need an example of these type of employees? Stop by my office sometime and meet anyone on my staff.  5. Remember JFK .  I’ve saved my favorite tip for last . . .  When going in for an interview, remember these words:  “Ask not what your company can do for you, ask what you can do for your company.”  Remembering that mantra will get you in the perfect frame of mind to seem like the perfect employee.  _ _ _ _  Want to hear what it really takes to get in the room from Broadway insiders?

I would also like to ask though what an audition would be like and what are some amazing things to do to stand out (per say what types of clothing to wear, what songs to sing or monologues to perform, and what questions to ask)? What should I be ready for? And what are things I should stay away from talking about or auditioning with?  Thank you in advance for your time!

Now that I am a senior that needs to figure out what I really want to do in life I ask myself “what would I really love to do?” and I think theatre.

It’s something I *can* mimic it at a loud volume, but kind of fear “the belt” as it sounds traditionally. Is shouting musically an absolute requirement, or is a strong mix just as acceptable if it sounds good and is well projected with shimmering vibrato?  Best Wishes,  Don C.

Really loved what you wrote it answered pretty much all my questions about what it is like and what it takes, but I do have 2 more question. 1.I understand in this inderusy you will probably get rejected a lot. But say you are an average person, with an average singing, dancing and acting abilities who are passionate about Broadway. How many auditions do you think it will take before they get a role? (big or small) 2. This question is mainly based on auditions in new york, how many people on an average audition, for example, the Ensemble. Also sorry for the long comment I just want to know as much as I can so I thrive and actually have some idea of what I’m doing. From Maddie Cariss  Reply        Piper Grace  says:   September 26, 2017 at 10:28 am   I really appreciated that advice! I am fourteen years old and have had a passion for Broadway since I was seven when I got the starring role in the school play. I love to work hard and pour my heart into musical theatre. There are a few complications though. First, my parents don’t want me to pursue acting. They want me to be an engineer. Second, I live in New Mexico. There isn’t much “pre Broadway” theatres here. I’ve been doing shows at the community college since I was nine. I need some advice on how to pursue my dreams. I plan to go to college in New York or Boston. So should I just keep working harder than ever and audition when I get there? I love the atmosphere of the theater so much that I am willing to just bring coffee to the actors or go and get them lunch. I would even be willing to work in the ticket office for goodness sake. I have been taking dance lessons since I could walk and singing and acting lessons since I was ten. Tap dancing is my passion and I am part of a professional tap company based out of Phoenix, Arizona called tap 24.7. Once I again when I am older I would love to help the theater in anyway possible.

I am very late but sadly i just knew what i really want and passionate in and it is performing. I love performing ever since i was a kid but i never know my love being on stage, creating and acting that play could mean so much to me. I live in Indonesia and indonesia here there is no such thing as theater or performing arts, plays, drama. IT IS VERY RARE and only the professionals can apply for the job like a 17 year old girl who have been doing ballet ever since she was a baby. Me? As i say again, i just knew that i am passionate at this section and i really want to make this a dream come true. I’ve been taking dancing lessons but im not a big pro yet, i also suck at singing but im taking lessons and my dad doesnt allow me to pursuit my dream as he think i suck at it (well yeah obviously because i never actually have a big experience on theater only dance performances yeah) and i am only allowed to go there if i am able to recieve a scholarship. My dad wishes me to stay here and learn on interior design which i don’t really want to because it is kinda boring to have as a carrer. Im commenting here because i need help, i have no basic or skill or knowledge of to be a great theater player, it would be nice if someone could suggest me like an online teaching about the steps and basics to become a great theater person. My school grades aren’t that great and I just want to be a great performer that’s all, i can be really committed if i want to and yeah i want to, so please help me and reply back to my email:) ill be waiting☺️!!

Credit Robert Stolarik for The New York Times     Michael Rodgers came from California to New York City last month  to defy the odds of making a living as an actor, not to defy death by pedaling a secondhand bicycle through Midtown traffic. But, like so many aspiring actors taking a crack at the nation’s theater capital, Mr. Rodgers has been trying to save money any way he can. He is now looking for his third temporary home in three months, having exhausted what he called “the deal of the century”  — $100 for two weeks in the East Side apartment of a friend of a friend of a friend. To get around town, he bought a bike for $75 from “this fellow, Carlos” he met on the street. For weeks he rode it through traffic every day to join a small company of performers in what amounted to a master class on the sacrifices actors will make to get onstage in Manhattan. On a limited budget the group pulled together a two-week test run of a complicated, three-act play, “Epitaph for George Dillon,” with the hope that a producer might want to stage it. There was barely enough money to rent a small, shabby theater and buy costumes at consignment shops. For the director and the actors, some of whom had left behind jobs and families in California, there were no salaries and no reimbursement of expenses.

Denise Crosby left her husband and 9-year-old son in Pacific Palisades and talked her way into a temporary apartment in Harlem. Anna Garduño, the lead actress, has been sleeping on a fold-out couch in the Greenwich Village home office of some friends.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       In many ways it is that most common of theater stories — illustrating the struggles and sacrifices that hundreds, if not thousands, of aspiring performers make every year to get a new show, and a new career, off the ground in New York. “There’s this whole underground where you all help each other in the theater,” Ms. Garduño said, after she and two of her fellow actors spent the morning repainting walls in the 45th Street Theater. They had rented the theater earlier this month  for $3,500 a week to stage 14 performances as a showcase, a temporary run intended to draw attention to the actors and, in this case, a play that was last on Broadway almost 50 years ago. “Epitaph for George Dillon,” which the British playwright John Osborne wrote with Anthony Creighton, was  Mr. Osborne’s first notable work.      He is best remembered for his  next play,  “Look Back in Anger,” which was staged before “Epitaph for George Dillon.”   Under the rules of Actors Equity, the union, the maximum amount that can be spent on a showcase is $20,000,  a pittance compared with the millions it costs to stage a full-blown Broadway production. Ms. Garduño, who secured the rights to the play from Mr. Osborne’s estate, raised much of the money from friends and found ways to cut costs at every turn. When she learned that it would cost $1,000 to rent a curtain for the theater, she had one made for $200. Rather than pay $75 a night to have the theater provide a fire marshal, she convinced the assistant stage manager, Elle Aghabala, to go to Brooklyn and take the fire department’s test that qualified her to guard against a fire backstage. Within an hour of the final curtain call, a crew member dashed off to return the rented computer that had provided sound for the show, to avoid another day’s rental fee. The ad hoc troupe expended all of this effort and sacrifice on the long shot that somebody would be inspired to produce the play. At least, they hoped, it would lead to more work, preferably of the sort that pays. “It’s all a gamble,” Mr. Rodgers said of the pursuit of a career onstage. “I never thought I was a gambler, but I’m almost 40 and I’m still gambling at it.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He sold his 14-year-old Mercedes and other possessions for $4,000 before leaving Los Angeles and has been sleeping on a friend’s futon in the East Village next to a duffel bag that holds everything he owns, he said.

I’m not thinking about the instability and all that stuff. I’m just grateful to be doing this.” Like the rest of the cast, Mr. Martin received no pay for the first 12 performances. But after that, Equity rules mandate that the players be paid $10 each per show. So each cast member got a check for $20 at the end of the run, or about 50 cents for each hour of performance. (The play ran for 2 hours and 45 minutes.). That meant that the actors collected less than the stage manager and his assistant, who each earned $100 and a Metrocard worth $81, but still more than the director, Larry Moss. Mr. Moss, who is also an acting coach, said he worked on the play because it had haunted him since he first read it about 30 years ago. He has assigned scenes from it to his students in acting workshops for years and has always wanted to revive it. “I never wanted to do plays that were already done  —  except for this play,” Mr. Moss said. “I’m getting nothing. But I’m getting everything. I’m getting to do the play.” Ms. Crosby and John Cirigliano, another cast member who lives in Southern California, said they had gladly dipped into their savings to finance their appearances in the showcase. “I can say now that I’ve done theater in New York, which gives you some credibility,” said Ms. Crosby, who spent time one weekend trying to drum up interest in the play at a sci-fi convention in Midtown. She was recognized there for having played Tasha Yar on “Star Trek: The Next Generation.” “If there’s anything worth saving for, it’s this,” Mr. Cirigliano, 60, said as he gestured toward the cluttered stage an hour before showtime one evening. “If nothing else happens with this production, it will be very satisfying. But we all hope it will move to a larger venue, so we can get paid.”   A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: The Odds Are as Big As Their Dreams.

EDIT  Edit this Article                Home » Categories  » Arts and Entertainment » Performing Arts » Theater    Article Edit Discuss           Reader Approved How to Become a Broadway Actor  Three Parts: Training to be a Broadway Actor Promoting Yourself as an Actor Becoming a Professional Community Q&A  Many people aspire to make it on Broadway. The steps to get there can seem long and hard, but if you are willing to put in the work, you just may see your name in lights. Train hard, work hard and put your name out there at auditions and on the stage in New York City.         Steps    Part 1   Training to be a Broadway Actor           1   Take acting classes. Even if you think you are born with the natural talent to be an actor, you will need some legitimate training to list on your resume and help you get jobs. Find classes in your area to increase and practice your skills. This is also a great way to meet other professionals and aspiring actors. [1]   Consider a degree in theater from your local college or seek out classes at your local theater.  Colleges with highly respected acting programs in New York include Juilliard, Columbia and NYU.  Training programs are also available throughout New York City. Some respected companies are HB Studios and Atlantic Theater Company School.            2   Learn to dance. Most of the shows on Broadway are musicals. This means that not only must you be a good actor, but you will need skills in singing and dancing. Find a dance school which offers training in all of the different styles of dance used on Broadway, including ballet, tap, and jazz.  The more well-rounded your dance abilities are, the better you will be able to adapt to the style of any show.  Keep up with your dance practice. You can begin to lose strength and flexibility if you don’t dance and stretch regularly.           3   Find a voice coach. Once you can sing, dance and act, the theater world will deem you a “triple threat.” You will be able to provide everything required of a Broadway actor. The best way to train your voice is the personal attention of a vocal coach, who can find your range and fine tune your skills.  Look for coaches at your local colleges.  Consider asking a music director to work with you personally.           4   Perform at your local theaters before moving to New York. This will help you gain experience and build your resume. Gaining experience onstage is important to growing as a performer, as well as creating a name for yourself. If you are available for a role, take it and perform to the best of your ability, no matter the size of the part.         5   Take direction well. The director is there to help you and the other actors come together to tell the story. Listen to what the director says and perform your part. Learn from every experience no matter how small the role may be.  If the director is not giving much feedback on your performance. Ask specifically for input. Explore your role and ask questions about your character and performance.                 Part 2   Promoting Yourself as an Actor          1   Buy professional headshots. Headshots are photographs of your head and shoulders. Actors are required to have both a headshot and resume when submitting for a role. Headshot used to be black and white, but the current expectation is that headshots are full-color.  Make sure the picture is current and looks like you. If you age or change your hairstyle, you will need to get new headshots. [2]   Bring several different clothing options to the photoshoot and have pictures taken wearing different shirts. Don’t wear distracting patterns or colors. Keep your outfit simple so the focus is on your face. [3]            2   Build an acting resume. An acting resume should include your contact information, body specifications, experience, training, and special skills. List your most recent roles first and work your way backward. [4]   Your name should be at the top of the resume and in the largest font.  If you are a member of an acting union list the abbreviation for the union after your name.  If you have an agent, they will give you a stamp to add to your resume to replace your personal contact information.  List your height, weight, hair and eye color, and make sure that it is accurate.  Never lie on your resume. Only list work you have actually completed.           3   Go to auditions. Find the auditions in your area and go to any which are offering a role you would fit. Auditioning itself is a good way to continue working on your skills. It is an opportunity to perform for influential casting directors and artistic directors. You can find auditions through postings like backstage.com, on the “call board” at the AEA office, or your agent can search and submit on your behalf.  Be prepared to deal with a lot of rejection. There are any number of reasons you may not be the best fit for a particular role, and there are a lot of other actors looking to make it on Broadway. The competition is abundant and you will audition many times without being offered a role. [5]   Treat every audition seriously. Even if you are not a perfect match for this role you are auditioning for, you can impress the casting agent or artistic director who may then call you in for another role in the future.           4   Perform in plays and musicals. The best way for Broadway producers to see what you are capable of is to see you in action. Perform onstage off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway on your way to Broadway. Start making a name for yourself as a performer to get closer to Broadway.         5   Write a bio for play programs. A bio, or biography, should consist of about four of five sentences and highlight your past work as an actor. It is a little blurb which allows the audience to learn more about you and your career. If you have a lot of acting credits, choose four or five of the top performances or roles, and mention that the ones listed are some of your favorite roles to date. [6]   Although you will be writing the bio yourself, you should use third person vernacular like “he” and “she.”  List your achievements, credits and performance history using full sentences rather than a literal list.  You can include your training, and some personal information to endear yourself to the reader.  You can also list film and television credits in a theatrical bio.            Part 3   Becoming a Professional          1   Make the move to New York City. You may be able to audition for a Broadway show if you live in a major city which is hosting auditions, but if you really want to make it on Broadway, you should live in New York. You will be more available to your agent and have many more auditions available to you. [7]   New York can be very expensive. Be sure that you have savings to last you for several months once you arrive. The average monthly rent on a 900 square foot unit in New York City is $2815. Add utilities and the higher cost of food, and you can plan on needing at least $3500 per month.  Many people live on the outskirts of the city in Queens or Brooklyn, and some even live across the river in New Jersey. These can be cheaper options than living in Manhattan, and the public transit system makes the commute quick, easy and cheap.           2   Join Actor’s Equity Association. Actor’s Equity Association, also referred to as Equity and AEA, is a union for actors in America. It’s purpose is to provide protection for the professional actor and enforce guidelines regarding pay, breaks, insurance and other professional needs. On the other hand, many professional theater companies will only use Equity actors, especially in leading roles, as a way to weed out actors with less experience. [8]   In order to join you must first be eligible. You may be able to join if you are cast in a production under an Equity contract.  You may be allowed to join Equity if you are a member of one of their sister unions, SAG-AFTRA, AGMA, AGVA, or GIAA. You must have been a member for at least a year, remain in good standing and have performed a significant role under their jurisdiction.  You can register as an Equity Membership Candidate, or EMC, to earn credit toward membership by working at an Equity theater. The cost to register is $100, and you must work at least 50 weeks in an Equity house to become eligible to apply for membership.           3   Acquire a talent agent. Broadway stages often only work with talent agencies when they are looking to cast important roles for a Broadway show. Using a talent agent helps streamline their process, since the agent will knows their actors and can submit only the people who they know could fit the role. Having a talent agent is going to be necessary to getting in the door of a Broadway audition if you want a lead role.  Submit your headshot and resume to agents in New York City along with a cover letter.  Ask other actors which agent they use and if you can use that actor as a reference in your cover letter.  Invite agents to come see you perform when you are in a show.           4   Work hard and get along with your directors and fellow actors. Your performance onstage is very important, but your behavior off-stage is just as important if not more important. Broadway professionals and casting agents all work in the same circles. It is likely that someone who has not worked with you will consult others asking about their experience working with you before they offer you a role. [9]   Protect your reputation by being on time, following direction, and being respectful to everyone on the cast and crew.  Emotions are a large part of theatrical work. Do your best to keep the emotions in the performance and stay logical and collected when you are dealing with others off-stage.

The honest truth is this: a lot of people will not make it. And no matter how hard you try, you could be one of the ones who doesn't make it. But you miss every single shot you don't make, and Broadway is no exception! Start from the bottom: school productions, community plays, and work your way up.  When in doubt, always prepare a song and monologue for an audition.

Invite agents to come see you perform when you are in a show.           4   Work hard and get along with your directors and fellow actors. Your performance onstage is very important, but your behavior off-stage is just as important if not more important. Broadway professionals and casting agents all work in the same circles. It is likely that someone who has not worked with you will consult others asking about their experience working with you before they offer you a role. [9]   Protect your reputation by being on time, following direction, and being respectful to everyone on the cast and crew.  Emotions are a large part of theatrical work. Do your best to keep the emotions in the performance and stay logical and collected when you are dealing with others off-stage.

If you are auditioning for an adult role, it is less likely, yet not impossible. If you look older than you are, then maybe.   Thanks!

The honest truth is this: a lot of people will not make it. And no matter how hard you try, you could be one of the ones who doesn't make it. But you miss every single shot you don't make, and Broadway is no exception! Start from the bottom: school productions, community plays, and work your way up.  When in doubt, always prepare a song and monologue for an audition.

Like those at the top of their game in any profession, it’s easy to be inspired by those on The Great White Way, but like other professions, you don’t start out as the CEO of a company or an olympic athlete. You start at the bottom and with a lot of hard work, determination and luck, might get a shot if you take every opportunity that comes your way.  There are basics that every single person who has made it has taken. Though their paths have all been different, here are the things you can do to begin your path to Broadway:  Train, Train, Train  There is nothing natural about standing in front of large groups of strangers, speaking someone else’s words or singing someone else’s songs, while turning partially away from the person to whom you’re talking.  Whether your training takes place in a high school classroom, in a well-established theatre conservatory, under the tutelage of a great teacher in a weekly class, or in each and every show you can get into, you can learn both from the critique you receive directly, and from watching others and listening to the critique they get.  Take acting classes, dance classes, voice classes (whether you’re looking to do musicals or not), get a voice teacher – and do things that seemingly have nothing to do with theatre…  Those who played an instrument had an upper hand in casting for the recent revival of Sweeney Todd; those who were cheerleaders got a leg up in Lysistrata Jones; ballroom dancers have gotten huge legs up in numerous shows. If you’re passionate about anything – continue to train there as well, you’ll never know if it might help you – and if nothing more, you’ll have something else that gives you joy, make you a healthier, more rounded person and expose you to more of the world and more of the incredible people you might one day play.  Network  Connections are a huge portion of this industry. The biggest legs up happen when someone you’ve worked with before recommends you. As much as the diva personality circulates as the norm in this industry, it’s unlikely to ever help you – divas get cast despite their eccentric nature. If you work hard, are fun to work with and are you – directors, writers, stage managers and producers will want to work with you again and might bring you in for consideration in their next project, or suggest you to a friend who’s looking for X for their next project.  Always Say Yes  If you’re asked to do a reading, to meet with someone for a quick lunch, to sing in a cabaret, to do an interview with Seth Rudetsky, anything – say yes. You’ll never know who will be in the audience, whether that writer may go on to become the next David Mamet, or be meeting with him later that afternoon.  See as Much Theatre as You Can  See as many shows as you can – both directly in your chosen area and outside of it. You can learn by watching others, noting what works and what doesn’t and trying to dig in to discover just what it was that made a performance work so wonderfully. And don’t just see Broadway shows, get Off-Broadway, Off-Off-Off-Off Broadway, see West End productions, dance productions, experimental art pieces, the show your cousin is doing at some summerstock theatre upstate. Then sit back and think about what worked and what didn’t and why.  Take Care of Yourself So You Look and Feel Good  And get to the gym – yes, everyone has as much trouble as you do getting there – but if you’re going to become an actor, your looks are part of your package, so tone it and get into the best shape you can.  Also take care of your skin and learn how to apply makeup, invest in clothing and shoes that look good on you, is comfortable and allows you to move.  As much as everyone would like to believe that looks are only a part of the equation — they are a big part and form your first impression. If you look good, hold yourself well and walk into a room feeling good about yourself, you have a leg up over at least half of your competition.  Show Up and Move On  You will be rejected over and over again. You will spend months preparing for an audition and not get a callback. You will not even be considered for a role you know you are perfect for because they decided they want a veteran actress playing it, or producers think Adele will bring in more ticket sales. You might be an inch taller than the man they want to cast as the male lead and so miss out. Or it may be some reason even more inane – the director just ended a relationship with someone who looks like you or he really wants someone with freckles  Most of the time you’ll never know and you’ll never hear back. You’ll have poured out your heart and soul and will be told “we’ll be in touch” and left in the dark.  But your job if you really want to work in this industry is to grow a thick skin, shake it off, and show up for the next audition. To again pour out your heart and soul – to invest every ounce of your being in the next one, most likely to be rejected once again.  Everyone has different techniques for dealing with this – one actress figured out that she would get a callback for every 18 auditions she did, so she would keep track. For every rejection she got, she would put a big “X” and think – I’m one rejection closer to a callback!  It’s an incredibly hard thing to do but it’s part of the job – no matter how famous, how talented, how successful, every actor faces rejection every time they step into a room or submit themselves for a part. But you’ll never get anywhere if you don’t show up first.  Work Hard  After you’ve celebrated when you do get a callback and the incredible day you get cast, hit the ground running – start your research, learn your lines and throw yourself head-first into the role.  During rehearsals, listen to your director, be nice to your stage manager, learn from and work with your fellow actors and soak it all up. Try to stay away from gossip, stay humble and be kind – hopefully you’ll work with some of these same people again in the future. Don’t make the reason you don’t get cast the next time that you snapped at the stage manager during the run of this show.  It’s a hard life and everyone says that if you can imagine yourself doing anything else you should do that instead. Just keep training, networking, saying yes, seeing theatre, taking care of yourself, showing up and working hard — because you know, like everyone in this industry, it’s worth all the heartache and effort, because there’s nothing like the moment the curtain rises and you open your mouth to say or sing your first word.  Advice Directly from the Pros:  Betty Buckley : Study, study, study. Practice, practice, practice. : )  Constantine Maroulis : Do everything u can…community theater to school plays, work hard respect the craft and be good to all – never know who they become.  Nick Adams : Find a great acting teacher. Take as many classes as you can in all disciplines. Train. See everything!  Natalie Hill : Study & train & take classes from casting directors then go to open calls & nail it!  Diana DeGarmo : Be a sponge & take everything in-educate yourself! Music, shows, directors,  choreographers, dance, etc – all of it! & have FUN! 🙂  Erin Wilson : Get ready to work like you never have before. Research, be prepared, know your type, be kind, find an outside hobby – sanity!  Howard Sherman : You don’t become a “Broadway actor.” You become an actor and then, perhaps, you get cast in a Broadway show.  Nicole Tori : Lots of hard work, persistence, training, networking and LUCK!  Lexi Lawson : Pray! JK – my advice is to make sure you are fully prepared (though I always have a tendency of always messing up my dialogue) but I go in prepared. And go in loving what it is. The creative team will see if the passion in you pour out if it’s a project you absolutely love and want to be a part of. Good luck to my musical munchkins.  What’s Your Advice?

Any ambition to act for the sake of artistic satisfaction was run down and sucked into the wheel wells under the sports car of fame long ago, because fame makes more money and it's just cooler.

Parents, teachers and community theater directors have told you your entire life that you are gifted -- that you are born to make emotions with your face under camera and stage lights, a face that was too optimistic or too young to devastate with brutal honesty. Well, I can't see your faces, and I have some bad news. Here are five good reasons your career path will make you absolutely miserable.  Advertisement   5 You Aren't Building a Real Skill Set   When your dream is to be an actor, you don't have the luxury of simultaneously perusing a fallback dream. That's why you'll never see a struggling actor holding down a full-time job as a marine biologist. Acting is a jealous and needy career that doesn't like the thought of you keeping your options open. You'll need a job that allows you to leave at a moment's notice for auditions, usually for two or three hours at a time. Or, assuming you are fortunate enough to be cast in anything, you need a job that allows you to miss work for a week at the very least. The logical solution is to work at night at a restaurant or bar. The trouble, however, is that most of these jobs were never intended to be careers. They have high turnover rates and offer little in terms of personal satisfaction. And that will all seem fine at first -- great, even -- for building that romantic sense of humility you intend to wear once you're famous. Taking orders from customers and folding napkin fans in wine glasses is just part of the struggle that you will remember fondly while masturbating poolside to your own biography.   "Ooh yeah. Keep toiling, right there."  That is, until your friends outside of the entertainment industry start developing actual skill sets that lead to raises, promotions and the general advancement of their careers. Everyone who entered the work force along with you will gradually move into better jobs because they've built up experience and because that's how nearly every other profession is designed to function. Meanwhile, there's no guarantee that you will book a role,   ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement       ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement       ever . All the experience you'll be racking up will just be preparing you for a life in the service industry. Sure, you will still be honing your skills as an actor through classes and auditions, but until your acting resume includes more than school plays and student films, it won't help you get a job, because ... 4 Most Roles Have Nothing to Do With Acting   Here is an innocuous commercial for Listerine:    There are three people featured for about four seconds apiece in that commercial. Each one of them is an actor who had to audition for that role. That may not sound like much, but take a minute to consider exactly what that entails: All three of them, without a doubt, started with dreams of being respected actors. They likely struggled for weeks if not months to find an agent, and paid upwards of $500 to have headshots taken and printed. Then they drove to an audition in the middle of a workweek and waited in a waiting room for an hour with 20 to 30 other people who looked exactly like them before being wrangled into a small room four or five at a time to say their names and, finally, to swish. They stood there for a few seconds pretending to swish mouthwash around their mouths. That's it. That's 80 percent of all the auditions you will go to. Now consider the hundreds of people who also auditioned and didn't get that part. All of that energy, time and money amounted to 10 seconds of moving their cheeks around for a casting director who had already seen scores of other eager young actors do the exact same thing.   "Yeah, I get it. You're doing like a crazy thing. Really nice work, there."    ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement        ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     Those three actors weren't hired for that commercial based on their acting ability or really anything that they could control. They were hired because they had a look that a Listerine ad sales department thought might sell more bottles, so the purpose of all those auditions was only to be sure that everyone actually looked like their headshots and that they were capable of ballooning their cheeks. But surely that's just a commercial, right? Actors also audition for meaty roles in movies and television, acting must be the deciding factor there. Well actually, no. 3 You Will Never Be Considered for Roles That Require Acting   Any struggling actors who have never had a significant role before are not members of the Screen Actors Guild. SAG was designed as a union to ensure that actors were paid fair wages for their work. Nearly every movie and television show has to operate within the guidelines of SAG, which means that they can only hire SAG actors or else they have to   ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     pay a hefty fine to cast someone outside the union. Naturally, studios will cast SAG members over nonmembers every time. So how do you become a member? Well, that's where things get completely absurd. The rules of SAG state, "Performers are eligible to join Screen Actors Guild after working on a SAG film in a principal role." So just to clarify, no one will cast you unless you are already in the union, and you can't get into the union until you are cast. A director has to like you so much that he or she is willing to trust you with a primary role despite the fact that you have no previous experience in film and be willing to pay a fine just to have you in that role. Now remember before when I mentioned that there are hundreds of other people who look exactly like you auditioning? At least 50 of them will already have their SAG cards.   "Good luck!"  That still leaves you with non-SAG or   ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement       ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     Ultra-Low Budget SAG productions. The only trouble there is ...   2 Your Faith Will Be Exploited   Acting requires about as much faith as religious fanaticism. Performers rely on directors and editors like zealots rely on God; both of them are just doing their best and hoping that the higher powers don't make them look like an idiot in the end. Actress Rosalind Russell once said, "Acting is standing up naked and turning around very slowly." The point being, actors have to play pretend so earnestly that an audience is willing to forget that it's really just someone standing in front of a green screen, reacting to a water weenie.    That's Faith.  As an actor, you also have to trust implicitly that writers, directors and editors have your best interest at heart. And generally speaking, they don't. Actors have an arguably deserved reputation for being kind of shitty people. Anyone making a movie, particularly a low-budget or non-union film, will try to interact with the talent as little as possible for fear that they'll   ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement       ↓  Continue Reading Below    Advertisement     want something . In addition, a director has a thousand other things to worry about than whether or not an actor looks completely ridiculous. The consequence, however, is far more severe for you than anyone else. You are the one immortalized on camera with a crying face that looks eerily similar to a pooping face, or while wearing nothing but a dress that is subtly but irrefutably see-through under set lights. Even if you luck into a film, commercial or show that does well and of which you are proud to be a part, the saddest truth of all is still to come ... 1 You Won't Make Enough Money to Live On   Among the miniscule number of actors who actually book jobs, there is an even tinier fraction of people who manage to make a living doing it. First, there is the matter of digging yourself out of a hole of expenses. The costs surrounding a struggling actor can seem almost like a malicious scheme to take money from naive, handsome people. I've already mentioned that headshots cost hundreds of dollars, but you'll need one for commercials, and one for dramas, and one for vampire movies, and one for sports stories. Ultimately, you will have around five different headshots of which you will need to print hundreds. On top of that, you can expect to do the whole process over again in three years when you no longer look like the person in the picture. You can also prepare to sink around $60 a week into parking tickets. This will obviously vary from city to city, but in Los Angeles, there isn't a reliable public transportation system to get you everywhere you need to go for auditions. Driving is the only option, and metered parking is ubiquitous. An audition can take anywhere from 10 minutes to two hours, so you never really know how much time you'll need, and you can't run out in the middle of an audition to feed the meter. So be prepared to collect at least one parking ticket a week.    "Hahaha. Fuck you for following your dreams."  Lastly, when you do finally get a job that pays you actual money, you will owe around 15 percent of that to a manager and 10 percent of it to an agent, all before taxes. These are the people responsible for getting you auditions and, ironically, ensuring that you aren't screwed over once you book a job. Add actual taxes to that and your take is less than 50 percent of whatever dollar amount appears in the contract. So, assuming you are doing a SAG Ultra-Low Budget shoot because you aren't a member of the union yet, you will probably be paid around $100 a day, of which you will actually take home about $40, or roughly the price of a Greyhound ticket back home.
