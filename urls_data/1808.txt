Math Alive       Rolling Dice   In 1654, Chevalier de Mere, a French gambler, wrote to Pierre Fermat and Blaise Pascal, two of France's mathematical giants, with a number of problems concerning the odds of particular combinations of numbers occurring, when several dice are rolled. This event is considered to be the birth of probability theory. Let's investigate a simple question that Chevalier de Mere could have asked. Suppose we roll two dice. We can get a sum of 4 in two different combinations: (1,3) and (2,2). We can get a sum of 5 in two different combinations also: (1,4) and (2,3). Why is it that in de Mere's practice 5 appears more often than 4?  The answer is the following: the combinations (1,3) and (2,2) are not equiprobable. We have a probability of 1/6 that the first die rolls 2, and a probability of 1/6 that the second die rolls 2, thus making a combination (2,2) with the probability 1/36. By a similar argument we see that the probability that the first die rolls 1 and the second die rolls 3 is 1/36. The probability that the first die rolls 3 and the second die rolls 1 is also 1/36. Hence, the combination (1,3) is rolled with probability 2/36 = 1/18. In the table below, the numbers in the left column show what is rolled on the first die and the numbers in the top row show what is rolled on the second die. We will color in blue the cells corresponding to the sum of 4 , and in pink the cells corresponding to the sum of 5 . Probabilities for Two Dice       1 2 3 4  5 6    1 1/36 1/36  1/36   1/36   1/36 1/36    2 1/36  1/36   1/36  1/36  1/36 1/36    3  1/36   1/36  1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36    4  1/36  1/36 1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36    5 1/36 1/36 1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36    6 1/36 1/36 1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36     Now we can see that the sum 4 will be rolled with probability 3/36 = 1/12 , and the sum 5 with probability 4/36 = 1/9 .

If the sum of the numbers shown on two dice is 10, what is the probability that one number is a 4?  (1) There are three ways for the sum of the dice to be 10: rolls of 4,6 and 5,5 and 6,4.  The sample space has three items, and the event space has two items as there are two possible throws with a 4, Thus the probability is 2/3  (2) We can use conditional probability to confirm:  `P(B|A)=(P(A"and"B))/(P(A)) `  Here we define P(A) as the probability of rolling a sum of 10, and P(B) as the probability that a die shows a 4.  P(A and B) is the probability that the sum is 10 and there is a 4. This is 2/36 as there are 36 possible rolls with (4,6) and (6,4) the only rolls whose sum is 10 with a 4.  P(A) is the probability of rolling a 10. This is 3/36 as there are 36 possible rolls, three of which sum to 10. (4,6),(5,5),(6,4).  Thus the probability of a pair of dice having a 4 if we know the sum is 10 is  `P(B|A)=(2/36)/(3/36)=2/3 `    Further Reading:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability       list Cite  link Link           steveschoen | Certified Educator    A lot of it has to do with what perspective you are looking at.  If you consider the chart on the webpage given, there are 36 combination of rolls you can get from two dice.  When you consider the sum being 10, there are only 3 combinations.  So, the probability of getting a 10 would be 3/36 = 1/12.  But, then, of those 3 combinations, only 2 of them have a 4.  So, then, the probability of getting a sum of 10 with one die being a 4 would be 2/36 = 1/18, when taking into consideration all possible combinations.  But, then, if you consider the perspective of taking into consideration all possible combinations of 10 only, then the probability would be 2/3, 3 total combinations of 10, with 2 of them having a 4.

When two two dice are thrown the sum of the numbers that turn up is 10. This is the case when the following sets of numbers turn up on the dice {(4,6)(5,5),(6,4)}. There are total of three cases in which the sum is 10 and in two of these the number on one of the die is 4. The required probability is therefore 2/3.  If the sum of the numbers that turn up when 2 dice are thrown is 10, there is a probability of 2/3 that the number on one of the dice is 4.      list Cite  link Link              Student Comments      rachellopez | Student    Dice have 6 faces with the numbers 1-6 on them. If you have two dice that add up to a sum of 10, the possible combinations would be {4, 6}, {6, 4}, and {5, 5}. Out the combinations, there are 2 that include a 4, out of 3 total possibilities. Your probability would be `(2)/(3)`.                         Access hundreds of thousands of answers with a free trial.

When a die is thrown the outcome can be any of the numbers from 1 to 6. If two dice are thrown the set of outcomes that ensure the sum is 9 is {(3, 6), (6,3), (4, 5), (5, 4)}. The total number of possible outcomes is 6*6 = 36  This gives the required probability as 4/36 = 1/9  The probability of getting 9 as the sum when 2 dice are thrown is 1/9.  Problem 2.  A standard deck of cards has 52 cards with 4 aces and 4 queens. The total number of outcomes when two cards are randomly picked is 52*51 = 2652. There are 4 ways in which the first card picked can be an ace. And there are 4 ways in which the second card can be a queen. It is important to notice that the order of picking an ace and a queen is not important here. As a result, we also have to consider the possibility of picking a queen followed by an ace. This gives the total number of ways in which an ace and a queen can be picked as 4*4 + 4*4 = 32. The required probability is 32/2652 = 8/663  When 2 cards are randomly picked from a standard deck of cards the probability of picking a queen and an ace is 8/663 .      list Cite  link Link              Student Comments      rachellopez | Student    1. In order to get a sum of 9 with two dice, you would have to roll the pairs 4 & 5, 5 & 4, 3 & 6, or 6 & 3. Since you have two dice there are 36 different combinations (6 faces*6 faces) you could roll, but only 4 of them would give you a sum of 9. That makes the probability 4/36 or 1/9 .  2. There are 52 cards in a deck. If you draw two at random you'd have 52 to choose from for your first draw and only 51 for your second. That gives you 2,652 combinations of cards total. Out of the 52 cards in the deck, 4 are aces and 4 are queens. This means you can choose an ace and then a queen (4*4) or a queen and then an ace (4*4). You'll have 32 combinations of an ace and a queen total, giving you a probability of 32/2,652 or 8/663 .                         Access hundreds of thousands of answers with a free trial.

Probability  Probabilities of 6-Sided Dice  It's sometimes handy to know the probabilities of an action succeeding
in TFT. Since TFT uses 6-sided dice exclusively (as does GURPS),
these tables do not include any other possibilities. The first table
gives the probability of rolling a specific number; the second table
gives the probability of rolling less than or equal to a specific number.  This table gives the probability of rolling a particular number on a set
of so many 6-sided dice.

It can also be used
to find the probability of rolling a particular number or more .
Since the probability of rolling N or more is the same as the
probability of not rolling N-1 or less, simply look up the
N-1 value on this table, and subtract it from 1 or 100%. For example,
to find the probability of rolling 8 or more on 3 dice, look up
the probability of rolling 7 or less, which is 35/216 or 16.204%.

Dice Rolling Probability: The chances of rolling dice and its mathematical probability            Dice Rolling Probability basics   Dice Rolling Probability Figuring out the mathematical probability of rolling two dice is a lot easier than you think. If holding two dice in your hands, you'll probably figure this out on your own. Lets make sense of things, and why the dice do what they do.   Dice Roll Odds Understanding dice rolling probability isn't much different than a coin flip probability. A coin has two sides. If you flip a coin,probability dictates that either heads or tails have a 50% chance of coming up. If you choose heads before the flipping of a coin, then there's 1 way of 2 that would happen. It can be written as 1/2, 1 out of 2, or 50% (1 divided by 2).   Dice rolling probability is similar to a coins probability, only with more choices Looking at a die (only one from a pair of dice), you'll see 6 sides. The pips (the little white dots) are 1,2,3,4,5,6.   Take a trip back to high school and revisit fractions An apple pie (my favorite) is cut into 6 slices, and one of these slices contains a $100 bill (eww) - what would your chances be of grabbing that $100 bill? Saying it out loud gives you the answer: One slice out of the 6 slices has the $100. Therefore, that's your odds of grabbing it - 1 out of 6, 1/6, or ~16.67% (1 divided by 6) chance.  That's exactly the probability of one side of a die coming up when you roll it. The probability of at least one of the die coming up a 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 is exactly 1 out of 6.   Probability of rolling two dice Craps actually has two dice, and not anymore complicated than the pie example. There are 6 sides on each die.  There are two of them. Twist and turn each of the dice and you get 36 different variations.    Ever wanted to know the probability of rolling doubles with two dice? A hardway,2 or 12 has exactly a dice rolling probability of 1 out of 36 possibilities. Let's look at this chart, and see how it works. I know it's everywhere, but you can't fight science...    Dice Rolling Probability Chart:    # on Dice Ttl Combinations Combinations/Permutations    2 1 1-1    3 2 1-2    2-1    4 3 1-3    2-2    3-1    5 4 1-4    2-3    3-2    4-1    6 5 1-5    2-4    3-3    4-2    5-1    7 6 1-6    2-5    3-4    4-3    5-2    6-1    8 5 2-6    3-5    4-4    5-3    6-2    9 4 3-6    4-5    5-4    6-3    10 3 4-6    5-5    6-4    11 2 5-6    6-5    12 1 6-6    36 Total Combinations     7 has the most possibilities of coming up. The dice rolling probability can never change in a random roll.  It's the rules of probability . The chances of rolling dice are confined to the above chart. This is the reason 7 rolls more often then any number when you roll two dice randomly. When playing Monopoly, you'll have approximately a 66.7% chance of moving 5-9 spaces (hopefully not into another players' Boardwalk). Why? Because adding up the ways 5,6,7,8, and 9 can roll you get 24 different ways. Since there's only 36 results the dice can roll - you're left with 24 out of 36 ways 5-9 come up. That's 24 divided by 36, equaling .666666... Multiply by 100, and you have ~66.7%. So if exaclty two squares away is the "Go To Jail" square, you don't have to worry much on landing there. But there's always a chance of course (a 1 out of 36, or ~2.78% chance to be precise).  Since the 7 comes up more often than the rest, the casinos capitalize on this. The more random the dice are, the more this is true.     An easy way to remember each numbers' combination Looking at the chart, you see that there are pairs that have the same combinations: 2&12, 3&11, 4&10, 5&9,6&8. Just memorize this, because I'm going to show you a cool trick.  By subtracting 1 from any number from 2 to 7, you get the total combinations: Therefore the dice rolling probability of rolling a 6 with two dice is 5 out of 36 (Or 13.89%).  Knowing the pairs I just mentioned, helps you figure out any dice rolling probability. Viola!   When playing craps, you should keep these combinations in mind For example, most people play the 6 & 8 at the same time. The 6 has 5 different ways of coming up on the dice, and so does the 8 - totalling 10 different permutations. That's 10 out of 36 ways.  Translation - ~27.8% chance of hitting the 6 or 8; and a ~16.7% chance of losing. (dice rolling probability=6/36 ways the 7 can come out).  Others place bets on the "inside" - 5,6,8,9. Using what you know so far, try and figure the chance of winning one of those bets on the next roll. Did you get it? It's 50% because 5&9 have 4 ways each 6&8 has 5, giving you 18 (4+5+5+4) out of 36 ways the dice can come up.  I'm not saying whether these are good bets or bad ones, I'm just getting into the math right now. For some betting strategies, check out How to Win At Craps on this website.

Part 1.    Math Alive       Rolling Dice   In 1654, Chevalier de Mere, a French gambler, wrote to Pierre Fermat and Blaise Pascal, two of France's mathematical giants, with a number of problems concerning the odds of particular combinations of numbers occurring, when several dice are rolled. This event is considered to be the birth of probability theory. Let's investigate a simple question that Chevalier de Mere could have asked. Suppose we roll two dice. We can get a sum of 4 in two different combinations: (1,3) and (2,2). We can get a sum of 5 in two different combinations also: (1,4) and (2,3). Why is it that in de Mere's practice 5 appears more often than 4?  The answer is the following: the combinations (1,3) and (2,2) are not equiprobable. We have a probability of 1/6 that the first die rolls 2, and a probability of 1/6 that the second die rolls 2, thus making a combination (2,2) with the probability 1/36. By a similar argument we see that the probability that the first die rolls 1 and the second die rolls 3 is 1/36. The probability that the first die rolls 3 and the second die rolls 1 is also 1/36. Hence, the combination (1,3) is rolled with probability 2/36 = 1/18. In the table below, the numbers in the left column show what is rolled on the first die and the numbers in the top row show what is rolled on the second die. We will color in blue the cells corresponding to the sum of 4 , and in pink the cells corresponding to the sum of 5 . Probabilities for Two Dice       1 2 3 4  5 6    1 1/36 1/36  1/36   1/36   1/36 1/36    2 1/36  1/36   1/36  1/36  1/36 1/36    3  1/36   1/36  1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36    4  1/36  1/36 1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36    5 1/36 1/36 1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36    6 1/36 1/36 1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36     Now we can see that the sum 4 will be rolled with probability 3/36 = 1/12 , and the sum 5 with probability 4/36 = 1/9 .

Single dice  Click here for how to write a probability.  Throwing dice is more complicated than tossing coins , as there are more than 2 values. If you throw a single dice, then it can fall six ways, each of which is equally likely if the dice is true. So the probability of getting one particular value is 1/6 . If you want either of two values it is 2/6 or 1/3 , and so on.    Sum of two dice  It gets more interesting when you have two dice. One thing that you can do is work out what the total of the dice is. The dice experiment allows you to simulate throwing pairs of dice and see what the result is. This is a good introduction to probability, since you can see which combinations are more likely. But the real world, or even a simulated real world, never matches completely with calculated probability. So how do we calculate it? The first thing is to work out what the range is. You can't have a total less than 2 (both dice being 1) and you can't have a total more than 12 (both dice being 6). The easiest way to see what the probabilities is to write out the possible totals. There are 36 of them in all (6 x 6).   Total on dice Pairs of dice Probability  2 1 + 1 1/36 = 3%  3 1 + 2 , 2 + 1 2/36 = 6%  4 1 + 3 , 2 + 2 , 3 + 1 3/36 = 8%  5 1 + 4 , 2 + 3 , 3 + 2 , 4 + 1 4/36 = 11%  6 1 + 5 , 2 + 4 , 3 + 3 , 4 + 2 , 5 + 1 5/36 = 14%  7 1 + 6 , 2 + 5 , 3 + 4 , 4 + 3 , 5 + 2 , 6 + 1 6/36 = 17%  8 2 + 6 , 3 + 5 , 4 + 4 , 5 + 3 , 6 + 2 5/36 = 14%  9 3 + 6 , 4 + 5 , 5 + 4 , 6 + 3 4/36 = 11%  10 4 + 6 , 5 + 5 , 6 + 4 3/36 = 8%  11 5 + 6 , 6 + 5 2/36 = 6%  12 6 + 6 1/36 = 3%   The percentages above are rounded. Compare these with the dice experiment . It won't match exactly, although the more throws you do, the closer it will get.    Other conditions with two dice  There are plenty of other conditions that you can have with two dice. Often, the easiest way to get the probability of a condition is to list all possible throws, and count the ones that fit the condition. The best way to make sure you have remembered all throws is to list them in a 6 x 6 table, like below.  Imagine two dice, red and green. This table shows all possible throws of these dice, with red numbers for the red dice, and green for the green dice. The background is black if the condition is satisfied. You can change the numbers and the condition to see what happens. You find the probability of this condition by counting the black squares, and dividing by 36 (all possible throws).    First number:  1  2  3  4  5  6   Either dice is  Neither dice is  Both dice are  At least one dice isn't  The highest dice is  The lowest dice is  Second number:  1  2  3  4  5  6   Dice are or  Dice are not and not  Dice are and      Probability of this condition =  See below for an explanation     Either dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice being a particular number is 1/6 . You would assume that it would be twice as likely that either of two dice being a particular number, or 1/3 , but this would be wrong. If you select the first condition above, you will see why. While there are six conditions where one dice is a number, and six conditions where the other dice is that number, there is one condition in both. So the probability is (12-1)/36 or 11/36 .  There is a better way to calculate this. If you click on the second condition, then back on the first, you will find that they are opposites of each other. That means that their probabilities add up to one. The second condition is easier to calculate directly (see below), as 25/36 . So this probability is (36-25)/36 = 11/36 .   Neither dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice not being a particular number is 5/6 . The probability of two dice not being a that number is 5/6 x 5/6 = 25/36 . You can do this as they don't overlap as all (the correct term is that they are independent events).   Both dice are the same particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice being a particular number is 1/6 . The probability of two dice being the same particular number is 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 . This is not the same as saying that both dice are the same number. There are six different possible numbers, so that would be 6/36 or 1/6 .   At least one dice isn't a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  This is the opposite of both dice being the same particular number, so the probabilities will add up to one. So the probability of at least one dice isn't a particular number = 1 - (1/36) = 35/36 .   The highest dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  This is a fun conditions, but a little strange to work out! Try experimenting with different numbers, and you will get different collections of throws fitting the conditions, and so different probabilities. To take an example, considering one dice, if the particular number is 5 then there are 5 throws which fit the condition. There are another 5 for the other dice, and there is one overlap, so the result is (5 + 5 - 1)/36 = 9/36 or 1/4 . But this varies for other numbers.   The lowest dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probabilities vary considering what the number is. But the probability of the lowest dice being a particular number is the same as the probability of the highest dice being six minus that particular number.   The dice have two particular numbers  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  Like the first condition, there are two ways to work this out. The first is doing it directly. Each dice has 6 throws for each number, but there are four overlaps. So the probability is (4 x 6 - 4)/36 = 20/36 .  An easier way is to realise that this condition is the opposite of the next one, dice are not either number. That probability is 16/36 so this one is 1 - 16/36 = 20/36 or 5/9 .   The dice are not either particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice not being either of two numbers is 4/6 , so the probability of both dice fitting this condition is 4/6 x 4/6 = 16/36 . We can do this as the conditions don't overlap, so they are independent events.   The dice are two particular numbers  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  There are only two ways that two dice can have two values (try the exercise above to see why), so the probability is 2/36 or 1/18 .   More than two dice  As the number of dice increase, then the different conditions can become more complicated. You can work out some simply.  The easiest is the probability of a number of dice being a particular number. For n dice, this is 1/(6 n ) . For example, the probability for throwing 5 dice and getting them all sixes is 1/(6 5 ) = 1/(6x6x6x6x6) = 1/7776 = 0.000128 or 7775 to 1 .  You can work out what is the chance of getting various numbers when throwing several dice (or one dice several times), but you do it in a back-to-front way, as above . For example, if you throw three dice, what is the chance of one of the dice getting less than five? This means that one of the dice (at least) will be a one, two, three or four. Now this is quite hard to work out directly. What we can do is work out the opposite. The chance of one dice not getting less than five means the chance of it getting a five or six, and this is 2/6 , or 1/3 . But we need all dice to get this. This is 1/3 x 1/3 x 1/3 or 1/27 . This was the opposite of what we want, so we must take it away from one. 1 - 1/27 or 26/27 which is about 96% .   Die or dice  People occasionally point out to me that the singular of 'dice' is 'die'. Yes, I know that. However, a lot of people don't, and I prefer to use 'dice' since then my meaning is clear. It stops them wondering why I'm talking about dying! However, if you think that I should be accurate rather than comprehensible, I'm afraid that the authorities are not on your side. The Oxford English Dictionary says "The form dice (used as pl. and sing.) is of much more frequent occurrence in gaming and related senses than the singular die." I think that probability is related to gaming! It gives a quote: 1474 CAXTON Chesse 132 "He caste thre dyse and on eche dyse was a sise."

The best way to make sure you have remembered all throws is to list them in a 6 x 6 table, like below.  Imagine two dice, red and green. This table shows all possible throws of these dice, with red numbers for the red dice, and green for the green dice. The background is black if the condition is satisfied. You can change the numbers and the condition to see what happens. You find the probability of this condition by counting the black squares, and dividing by 36 (all possible throws).    First number:  1  2  3  4  5  6   Either dice is  Neither dice is  Both dice are  At least one dice isn't  The highest dice is  The lowest dice is  Second number:  1  2  3  4  5  6   Dice are or  Dice are not and not  Dice are and      Probability of this condition =  See below for an explanation     Either dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice being a particular number is 1/6 . You would assume that it would be twice as likely that either of two dice being a particular number, or 1/3 , but this would be wrong. If you select the first condition above, you will see why. While there are six conditions where one dice is a number, and six conditions where the other dice is that number, there is one condition in both. So the probability is (12-1)/36 or 11/36 .  There is a better way to calculate this. If you click on the second condition, then back on the first, you will find that they are opposites of each other. That means that their probabilities add up to one. The second condition is easier to calculate directly (see below), as 25/36 . So this probability is (36-25)/36 = 11/36 .   Neither dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice not being a particular number is 5/6 . The probability of two dice not being a that number is 5/6 x 5/6 = 25/36 . You can do this as they don't overlap as all (the correct term is that they are independent events).   Both dice are the same particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice being a particular number is 1/6 . The probability of two dice being the same particular number is 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 . This is not the same as saying that both dice are the same number. There are six different possible numbers, so that would be 6/36 or 1/6 .   At least one dice isn't a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  This is the opposite of both dice being the same particular number, so the probabilities will add up to one. So the probability of at least one dice isn't a particular number = 1 - (1/36) = 35/36 .   The highest dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  This is a fun conditions, but a little strange to work out! Try experimenting with different numbers, and you will get different collections of throws fitting the conditions, and so different probabilities. To take an example, considering one dice, if the particular number is 5 then there are 5 throws which fit the condition. There are another 5 for the other dice, and there is one overlap, so the result is (5 + 5 - 1)/36 = 9/36 or 1/4 . But this varies for other numbers.   The lowest dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probabilities vary considering what the number is. But the probability of the lowest dice being a particular number is the same as the probability of the highest dice being six minus that particular number.   The dice have two particular numbers  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  Like the first condition, there are two ways to work this out. The first is doing it directly. Each dice has 6 throws for each number, but there are four overlaps. So the probability is (4 x 6 - 4)/36 = 20/36 .  An easier way is to realise that this condition is the opposite of the next one, dice are not either number. That probability is 16/36 so this one is 1 - 16/36 = 20/36 or 5/9 .   The dice are not either particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice not being either of two numbers is 4/6 , so the probability of both dice fitting this condition is 4/6 x 4/6 = 16/36 . We can do this as the conditions don't overlap, so they are independent events.   The dice are two particular numbers  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  There are only two ways that two dice can have two values (try the exercise above to see why), so the probability is 2/36 or 1/18 .   More than two dice  As the number of dice increase, then the different conditions can become more complicated. You can work out some simply.  The easiest is the probability of a number of dice being a particular number. For n dice, this is 1/(6 n ) . For example, the probability for throwing 5 dice and getting them all sixes is 1/(6 5 ) = 1/(6x6x6x6x6) = 1/7776 = 0.000128 or 7775 to 1 .  You can work out what is the chance of getting various numbers when throwing several dice (or one dice several times), but you do it in a back-to-front way, as above . For example, if you throw three dice, what is the chance of one of the dice getting less than five? This means that one of the dice (at least) will be a one, two, three or four. Now this is quite hard to work out directly. What we can do is work out the opposite. The chance of one dice not getting less than five means the chance of it getting a five or six, and this is 2/6 , or 1/3 . But we need all dice to get this. This is 1/3 x 1/3 x 1/3 or 1/27 . This was the opposite of what we want, so we must take it away from one. 1 - 1/27 or 26/27 which is about 96% .   Die or dice  People occasionally point out to me that the singular of 'dice' is 'die'. Yes, I know that. However, a lot of people don't, and I prefer to use 'dice' since then my meaning is clear. It stops them wondering why I'm talking about dying! However, if you think that I should be accurate rather than comprehensible, I'm afraid that the authorities are not on your side. The Oxford English Dictionary says "The form dice (used as pl. and sing.) is of much more frequent occurrence in gaming and related senses than the singular die." I think that probability is related to gaming! It gives a quote: 1474 CAXTON Chesse 132 "He caste thre dyse and on eche dyse was a sise."

Single dice  Click here for how to write a probability.  Throwing dice is more complicated than tossing coins , as there are more than 2 values. If you throw a single dice, then it can fall six ways, each of which is equally likely if the dice is true. So the probability of getting one particular value is 1/6 . If you want either of two values it is 2/6 or 1/3 , and so on.    Sum of two dice  It gets more interesting when you have two dice. One thing that you can do is work out what the total of the dice is. The dice experiment allows you to simulate throwing pairs of dice and see what the result is. This is a good introduction to probability, since you can see which combinations are more likely. But the real world, or even a simulated real world, never matches completely with calculated probability. So how do we calculate it? The first thing is to work out what the range is. You can't have a total less than 2 (both dice being 1) and you can't have a total more than 12 (both dice being 6). The easiest way to see what the probabilities is to write out the possible totals. There are 36 of them in all (6 x 6).   Total on dice Pairs of dice Probability  2 1 + 1 1/36 = 3%  3 1 + 2 , 2 + 1 2/36 = 6%  4 1 + 3 , 2 + 2 , 3 + 1 3/36 = 8%  5 1 + 4 , 2 + 3 , 3 + 2 , 4 + 1 4/36 = 11%  6 1 + 5 , 2 + 4 , 3 + 3 , 4 + 2 , 5 + 1 5/36 = 14%  7 1 + 6 , 2 + 5 , 3 + 4 , 4 + 3 , 5 + 2 , 6 + 1 6/36 = 17%  8 2 + 6 , 3 + 5 , 4 + 4 , 5 + 3 , 6 + 2 5/36 = 14%  9 3 + 6 , 4 + 5 , 5 + 4 , 6 + 3 4/36 = 11%  10 4 + 6 , 5 + 5 , 6 + 4 3/36 = 8%  11 5 + 6 , 6 + 5 2/36 = 6%  12 6 + 6 1/36 = 3%   The percentages above are rounded. Compare these with the dice experiment . It won't match exactly, although the more throws you do, the closer it will get.

Rolling a pair of six-sided dice, what is the probability that you will get a sum of 4?    I thought the answer was 4/36 = 1/9 because each die is a mutually exclusive event 1-3, 3-1, 2-2, 2-2 but are 2-2 and 2-2 truly mutually exclusive?

The part I wasn't sure about was the 2-2 - whether or not order mattered on that particular roll... the mutual exclusivity of 3-1 and 1-3 was clear, obviousl!

Comment            Comments    So if there are 36 total possibilities of rolling a pair of dice and 2-2 only counts once, is it 3/35?    {1-3, 3-1, 2 a -2 b } NOT {2 b -2 a }           1/1/2016 |  Spele from Columbia, SC      2-2 is one out of 36. If you list all possible pairs (a,b) you'll get 36.           1/1/2016 |  Arnold F.

Comment              David W. | Experienced Prof Experienced Prof     4.4   4.4  (47 lesson ratings)  (47)      Message             -1            Probability is the ratio of (number of successful events) divided by (number of total events).    With two "fair" dice having numbers 1-6, there are a total of 6*6=36 total events.  How many of these 36 have a sum of 4?  Well, it might help to list them:  1 - 1  no  1 - 2  no  1 - 3  yes  1 - 4  no  . . .  2 - 2 yes  . . .  3 - 1 yes  . . .  6 - 6 no    There are exactly 3 times where the sum is 4 (the success criteria).  The case of 2-2 means that when the first die has a 2 and the second die also has a 2.  You would not call 1-3 and 3-1 the same outcome, would you?    The probability of the sum being 4 is 3/36 = 1/12 .     1/1/2016 |  David W.           Comment                Create a Free Account to Continue  Already have an account?

Thus, there are 6*6=36 possible outcomes.  Next, we must determine how many successes exist, because Probability=(number of successes)/(number of possibilities).

Comment                 Adam S. | Professional and Proficient Math Tutor Professional and Proficient Math Tutor                0            To find the probability determine the number of successful outcomes divided by the number of possible outcomes overall. Each dice has six combinations which are independent. Therefore the number of possible outcomes will be 6*6 = 36.    The number of successful outcomes will be the number of outcomes where the number of the dice adds up to five. There are four successful outcomes:    (1)(4)  (2)(3)  (3)(2)  (4)(1)      The probability of rolling a pair of dice whose numbers add to 5 is 4/36 = 1/9.       3/15/2014 | Adam S.

Vivian L. | Microsoft Word/Excel/Outlook, essay composition, math; I LOVE TO TEACH Microsoft Word/Excel/Outlook, essay comp...     3.0   3.0  (1 lesson ratings)  (1)               0            Hi Again Brittany;  When rolling a pair of dice, there are 36 possible arrangements.  We can easily ascertain this by the formula of 6 2 .  Six represents the quantity of options each die offers.  Two represents how many dice we have.      For the probability of seven...  If one die is 6, the other die must be 1.  If one die is 5, the other die must be 2.  If one die is 4, the other die must be 3.  If one die is 3, the other die must be 4.  If one die is 2, the other die must be 5.  If one die is 1, the other die must be 6.    There are six possible scenarios.  So 6/6 2 = 6/36    For the probability of 11...  If one die is 6, the other die must be 5.  If one die is 5, the other die must be 6.    So 2/6 2 =2/36    We must add the two figures...  6/36 + 2/36=8/36=4/18=2/9         10/13/2013 | Vivian L.

one and second one, a left and a right, a red and a green, etc.  Let
(a,b) denote a possible outcome of rolling the two die, with a the
number on the top of the first die and b the number on the top of the second
die.  Note that each of a and b can be any of the integers from 1 through 6.
Here is a listing of all the joint possibilities for (a,b):    (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)   (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)   (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)   (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)   (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)   (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)   Note that there are 36 possibilities for (a,b).  This total number of possibilities can be obtained from the multiplication principle :  there are 6 possibilities for a, and for each outcome for a, there are 6 possibilities for b.  So,
the total number of joint outcomes (a,b) is 6 times 6 which is 36.  The set of
all possible outcomes for (a,b) is called the sample space of this probability experiment.  With the sample space now identified, formal probability theory requires
that we identify the possible events .
These are always subsets of the
sample space, and must form a sigma-algebra.  In an example such as this,
where the sample space is finite because it has only 36 different outcomes,
it is perhaps easiest to simply declare ALL subsets of the sample space to
be possible events.  That will be a sigma-algebra and avoids what might
otherwise be an annoying technical difficulty.  We make that declaration
with this example of two dice.  With the above declaration, the outcomes where the sum of the two
dice is equal to 5 form an event.
If we call this event E, we have E={(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1)}. Note that we have listed all the ways a first die and second die add
up to 5 when we look at their top faces.  Consider next the probability of E, P(E).  Here we need more information.
If the two dice are fair and independent , each possibility (a,b) is equally likely.  Because there are
36 possibilities in all, and the sum of their probabilities must equal
1, each singleton event {(a,b)} is assigned probability equal to 1/36.
Because E is composed of 4 such distinct singleton events, P(E)=4/36=
1/9.  In general, when the two dice are fair and independent, the probability
of any event is the number of elements in the event divided by 36.  What if the dice aren't fair, or aren't independent of each other?
Then each outcome {(a,b)} is assigned a probability (a number in [0,1])
whose sum over all 36 outcomes is equal to 1.  These probabilities aren't
all equal, and must be estimated by experiment or inferred from other
hypotheses about how the dice are related and and how likely each number
is on each of the dice.  Then the probability of an event such as E
is the sum of the probabilities of the singleton events {(a,b)} that make
up E.      Go to the home page for Tom Ramsey    Go to the home page for the UHM Department of Mathemati

Find probability sum of 5 appears before sum of 7.  2 approaches:   $$P(\text{sum of 5 appears before sum of 7})$$   $$= P(\text{roll 1 is 5})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 2 is 5, roll 1 is not 7})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 3 is 5, roll 1,2 are not 7})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 4 is 5, roll 1,2,3 are not 7})$$  $$+ \ldots$$   $$P(\text{sum of 5 appears before sum of 7})$$   $$= P(\text{roll 1 is 5})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 2 is 5, roll 1 is not 7}, \ \color{red}{\text{roll 1 is not 5}})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 3 is 5, roll 1,2 are not 7}, \ \color{red}{\text{roll 1,2 are not 5}})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 4 is 5, roll 1,2,3 are not 7}, \ \color{red}{\text{roll 1,2,3 are not 5}})$$  $$+ \ldots$$  Which if any is right?   Mathematically:  Let $n = 1,2,...$  Let $A_n$ be probability that sum of 5 appears on roll $n$  Let $B_n$ be probability that sum of 7 appears on roll $n$  Let $B_0^C = \Omega$  Observe that $A_n$ and $B_n$ are disjoint. Hence $A_n \subseteq B_n^C$  Approach 1 gives:  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n} B_m^C)$$  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{\color{red}{n-1}} B_m^C)$$  $$ = \frac{4}{36} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (\frac{30}{36})^{n-1}$$  Approach 2 gives:  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n} B_m^C \color{red}{\cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n-1} A_m^C})$$  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{\color{red}{n-1}} B_m^C \color{red}{\cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n-1} A_m^C})$$  $$ = \frac{4}{36} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (\frac{30}{36})^{n-1} \color{red}{(\frac{32}{36})^{n-1}}$$   What is the weakest independence assumption we need to make?  For approach 1 it seems that we need to assume independence of  $$A_n, B_1, B_2, ..., B_{n-1}$$.  For approach 2 it seems that we need to assume independence of  $$A_1, A_2, ..., A_n, B_1, B_2, ..., B_{n-1}$$.  Is that right?    probability  summation  mathematical-modeling  dice  independence     share | cite | improve this question     asked Jun 16 '16 at 9:14       BCLC   6,523 2 19 66              add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  9  down vote  accepted      I do not give an answer to your question(s) (yet), but hand over a different approach.  Probability corresponding with sum $5$ is $\frac{4}{36}$ and probability
corresponding with sum $7$ is $\frac{6}{36}$.  Neglecting the other outcomes we find a probability $\frac{4}{10}$
for sum $5$ and $\frac{6}{10}$
for sum $7$.  If on base of these probabilities a choice is made then the probability that sum $5$ is chosen (i.e. comes before sum $7$) is: $$\frac25$$   edit :  Your first approach is wrong and your second is correct (but tedious). See the answer of Micapps.  Let $E_{k}$ denotes the event that at the $k$-roll for the first
time a sum of $5$ or $7$ appears.  Then more formally we have: $$P\left(\text{sum }5\text{ appears first}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P\left(\text{sum }5\text{ appears first}\mid E_{k}\right)P\left(E_{k}\right)=$$$$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P\left(\text{sum }5\text{ appears at roll }k\mid E_{k}\right)P\left(E_{k}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{2}{5}P\left(E_{k}\right)=\frac{2}{5}$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 16 '16 at 10:09             answered Jun 16 '16 at 9:29       drhab   78.7k 5 37 108                  Wait what about the mathematical formulation and the weakest independence assumption? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:45        1      What exactly do you mean by that? – drhab  Jun 16 '16 at 9:46            drhab, is my mathematical representation of my second approach correct?

Now, the probability of a sum of $5$ is $\color\red{1/9}$, and the probability of a sum of $7$ is $\color\green{1/6}$.  Therefore:   The probability that a sum of $5$ appears before a sum of $7$ is $\frac{\color\red{1/9}}{\color\red{1/9}+\color\green{1/6}}=\frac25$  The probability that a sum of $7$ appears before a sum of $5$ is $\frac{\color\green{1/6}}{\color\red{1/9}+\color\green{1/6}}=\frac35$      share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 16 '16 at 9:57             answered Jun 16 '16 at 9:54       barak manos   37.2k 7 40 92                  World = omega (The whole sample space) ? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:57        1      @BCLC: I guess you could call it that way (it's probability even a more "mathematical" way of saying it)... I added some colors to make it clearer. – barak manos  Jun 16 '16 at 9:58        1      @BCLC: You're welcome :) – barak manos  Jun 16 '16 at 20:26            @barakmanos I have a similar question. What is the probability that a sum of $7$ appears before a sum of $8$? Can you help me with that – behold  May 4 '17 at 2:26        add a comment |             up vote  4  down vote      In your first approach the events are not disjoint: For example the event where the first two rolls are $5$ is contained in both of the first two events.  In the second approach the events are disjoint and their union is the event that $5$ appeared before $7$, so this is the way to go.  Indidentally, if we can assume the throws are all independent, a neat trick in solving this sort of problem is as follows: Let $p$ be the probability that $5$ appears before $7$. By the law of complete probability we have:  $p = \Pr[5\text{ appears on first roll}] + \Pr[\text{first roll is not }5\text{ or }7]\cdot\Pr[5\text{ appears before }7\ |\text{ first roll is not }5\text{ or }7]$  Now, because of the self-similar nature of the problem we get:  $\Pr[5\text{ appears before }7\ |\text{ first roll is not }5\text{ or }7]=p$  Plugging numbers in the first equation we get:  $$p=\frac{4}{36}+\frac{26}{36}p\implies\frac{5}{18}p=\frac{1}{9}\implies p=\frac{2}{5}$$   Regarding "mathematical formulation" of the second approach: The way you've presented the problem by defining the events $A_n,B_n$ is correct as far as I can tell, in the sense that it encodes the intuition given at the start of the question.  Regarding independence: In order to move from the probability of an intersection of events to the product of their probabilities in general you need independence. You may be able to get away with something "weaker" (which you would have to specify), but I have no clue what the "weakest" assumption would be.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 16 '16 at 9:55             answered Jun 16 '16 at 9:29       Micapps   794 2 6                  Wait what about the mathematical formulation and the weakest independence assumption? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:45            The approach above (as well as your approach #2, from where you plug in the numbers) use the independence of the distinct dice rolls. Without this assumption the answer would (in general) change, and would probably be much more difficult to compute directly (although everything that doesn't involve actual numbers would still be correct). – Micapps  Jun 16 '16 at 9:50        1      Mathematical formulation: Not sure what you mean by this. – Micapps  Jun 16 '16 at 9:51            Micapps, about mathematical formulation: is my mathematical representation of my second approach correct? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:51         2      The only thing that matters is that the chances on sum $5$ or sum $7$ are constant. For that you do not need independency. If e.g. you would work under the condition that every roll will have the same outcome (heavily dependent) as the first roll then still the answer is $\frac25$. Independence is not essential here. See my answer for a proof that also works under dependency. – drhab  Jun 16 '16 at 10:31         |  show 4 more comments           Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

You have two dice, what is the probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7? Thanks.. First of all please note that this question is far beyond the GMAT scope. \(P(sum=3)=\frac{2}{36}=\frac{1}{18}\): either (1,2) or (2,1) out of total of 36 different combinations of two dice; \(P(sum=7)=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}\): (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), or (6,1); \(P(other \ sum)=1-(\frac{1}{18}+\frac{1}{6})=\frac{7}{9}\), probability of sums: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12; Winning scenarios: {sum=3} - we have sum of 3 on the first roll of two dice - \(P_1=\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; sum=3} - on the first roll we have other sum and sum of 3 on the second roll - \(P_2=\frac{7}{9}*\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; other sum; sum=3} - \(P_3=(\frac{7}{9})^2*\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; other sum; other sum; sum=3} - \(P_4=(\frac{7}{9})^3*\frac{1}{18}\); ... So probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7 would be the sum of the above infinite series: \(P=\frac{1}{18}+\frac{7}{9}*\frac{1}{18}+(\frac{7}{9})^2*\frac{1}{18}+(\frac{7}{9})^3*\frac{1}{18}+...=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{7}{9}+(\frac{7}{9})^2+(\frac{7}{9})^3+...)=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{\frac{7}{9}}{1-\frac{7}{9}})=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{7}{2})=\frac{1}{4}\) (for geometric progression with common ratio \(|q|<1\), the sum of the progression: \(b_1, b_2, ...\) is \(Sum=\frac{b_1}{1-q}\).). OR: As \(P(sum=3)=\frac{2}{36}\) and \(P(sum=7)=\frac{6}{36}\) then getting the sum of 7 is 3 times more likely than getting the sum of 3, so the sum of 3 has 1 chance out of 4 to get first out of any number of tries, so \(P=\frac{1}{4}\) or \(P=\frac{\frac{2}{36}}{\frac{2}{36}+\frac{6}{36}}=\frac{1}{4}\). Hope it's clear. _________________   New to the Math Forum? Please read this: Ultimate GMAT Quantitative Megathread | All You Need for Quant | PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW:  12 Rules for Posting!!!

However I have a few questions: I understand up to P(other sum). How can you conclude the winning scenario is other sum then sum 3? I know it's a possible case, but why is it (other sum, sum 3) will lead to a (other sum, sum 3, then sum 7). It could be (other sum, sum 3, sum 8) - after 3 rollings, while what we expect is sum 7. Therefore the (other sum, other sum,..., sum 3) could be a wrong case. On the other hand, if we can conclude other sum, other sum,..., sum 3 is a winning scenario, have we assume the probability of sum 7 and other sum but not 7 are the same, while there are different? I don't understand this sentence too "So probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7 would be the sum of the above infinite series" - how can you conclude it's the sum that series, how about if we have an AFTER word? What is the difference between BEFORE and AFTER? Edit: I like your second approach, by comparing the fraction of the probability of 2 events we can say P = 1/4, but I still don't understand the word BEFORE.. What if they ask for AFTER? Will we still compare the 2 probabilities?

Will we still compare the 2 probabilities? When we roll 2 dice the sum can be 3, 7, or some other number (not 3 and not 7). The questions asks for the cases when we get the sum of 3 BEFORE the sum of 7. For example why the cases I wrote are the winning scenarios: {sum=3} - means that right on the first throw we have sum of 3, so we have 3 before 7 (as no 7 at all); {other sum; sum=3} - first roll not 7 and not 3, so we can continue. On the second throw we have sum of 3, so again 3 before 7 - OK; {other sum; other sum; sum=3} - sum of 3 on the third roll; {other sum; other sum; other sum; sum=3} - sum of 3 on the fourth roll; .... {other sum; other sum; other sum; ..., other sum on the nth roll; sum of 3 on the (n+1)th roll} - out of n+1 rolls we have other sum for the rolls from 1 to n and sum of 3 on the (n+1)th roll, still 3 before 7 - OK; ... The above can be continued infinitely, and all above case represent the scenario when we have the sum of 3 BEFORE we have the sum of 7 (which will eventually occur on some roll afterwards). So the probability of getting 3 before 7 would be the sum of the probabilities of the above events. Hope it's clear. Anyway: you won't need this for GMAT, so don't worry too much. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

However I think you miss the scenario where sum=7 occurs before sum=3. For example, 1st time sum=7, 2nd time sum=3, so the probability must be 6/36 * 2/36. You assumed that sum 7 never happens before sum 3 so you take the probability of other sum (7/9) to calculate. Am I wrong?

I'm not assuming that 7 doesn't occur before 3 rather than I'm only interested to count the probability of the cases when 3 occur before 7 as this is what the question is asking, that's why I'm not considering the cases when 7 occur before 3. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

You have two dice, what is the probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7? Thanks.. First of all please note that this question is far beyond the GMAT scope. \(P(sum=3)=\frac{2}{36}=\frac{1}{18}\): either (1,2) or (2,1) out of total of 36 different combinations of two dice; \(P(sum=7)=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}\): (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), or (6,1); \(P(other \ sum)=1-(\frac{1}{18}+\frac{1}{6})=\frac{7}{9}\), probability of sums: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12; Winning scenarios: {sum=3} - we have sum of 3 on the first roll of two dice - \(P_1=\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; sum=3} - on the first roll we have other sum and sum of 3 on the second roll - \(P_2=\frac{7}{9}*\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; other sum; sum=3} - \(P_3=(\frac{7}{9})^2*\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; other sum; other sum; sum=3} - \(P_4=(\frac{7}{9})^3*\frac{1}{18}\); ... So probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7 would be the sum of the above infinite series: \(P=\frac{1}{18}+\frac{7}{9}*\frac{1}{18}+(\frac{7}{9})^2*\frac{1}{18}+(\frac{7}{9})^3*\frac{1}{18}+...=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{7}{9}+(\frac{7}{9})^2+(\frac{7}{9})^3+...)=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{\frac{7}{9}}{1-\frac{7}{9}})=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{7}{2})=\frac{1}{4}\) (for geometric progression with common ratio \(|q|<1\), the sum of the progression: \(b_1, b_2, ...\) is \(Sum=\frac{b_1}{1-q}\).). OR: As \(P(sum=3)=\frac{2}{36}\) and \(P(sum=7)=\frac{6}{36}\) then getting the sum of 7 is 3 times more likely than getting the sum of 3, so the sum of 3 has 1 chance out of 4 to get first out of any number of tries, so \(P=\frac{1}{4}\) or \(P=\frac{\frac{2}{36}}{\frac{2}{36}+\frac{6}{36}}=\frac{1}{4}\). Hope it's clear. _________________   New to the Math Forum? Please read this: Ultimate GMAT Quantitative Megathread | All You Need for Quant | PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW:  12 Rules for Posting!!!

However I have a few questions: I understand up to P(other sum). How can you conclude the winning scenario is other sum then sum 3? I know it's a possible case, but why is it (other sum, sum 3) will lead to a (other sum, sum 3, then sum 7). It could be (other sum, sum 3, sum 8) - after 3 rollings, while what we expect is sum 7. Therefore the (other sum, other sum,..., sum 3) could be a wrong case. On the other hand, if we can conclude other sum, other sum,..., sum 3 is a winning scenario, have we assume the probability of sum 7 and other sum but not 7 are the same, while there are different? I don't understand this sentence too "So probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7 would be the sum of the above infinite series" - how can you conclude it's the sum that series, how about if we have an AFTER word? What is the difference between BEFORE and AFTER? Edit: I like your second approach, by comparing the fraction of the probability of 2 events we can say P = 1/4, but I still don't understand the word BEFORE.. What if they ask for AFTER? Will we still compare the 2 probabilities?

Will we still compare the 2 probabilities? When we roll 2 dice the sum can be 3, 7, or some other number (not 3 and not 7). The questions asks for the cases when we get the sum of 3 BEFORE the sum of 7. For example why the cases I wrote are the winning scenarios: {sum=3} - means that right on the first throw we have sum of 3, so we have 3 before 7 (as no 7 at all); {other sum; sum=3} - first roll not 7 and not 3, so we can continue. On the second throw we have sum of 3, so again 3 before 7 - OK; {other sum; other sum; sum=3} - sum of 3 on the third roll; {other sum; other sum; other sum; sum=3} - sum of 3 on the fourth roll; .... {other sum; other sum; other sum; ..., other sum on the nth roll; sum of 3 on the (n+1)th roll} - out of n+1 rolls we have other sum for the rolls from 1 to n and sum of 3 on the (n+1)th roll, still 3 before 7 - OK; ... The above can be continued infinitely, and all above case represent the scenario when we have the sum of 3 BEFORE we have the sum of 7 (which will eventually occur on some roll afterwards). So the probability of getting 3 before 7 would be the sum of the probabilities of the above events. Hope it's clear. Anyway: you won't need this for GMAT, so don't worry too much. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

However I think you miss the scenario where sum=7 occurs before sum=3. For example, 1st time sum=7, 2nd time sum=3, so the probability must be 6/36 * 2/36. You assumed that sum 7 never happens before sum 3 so you take the probability of other sum (7/9) to calculate. Am I wrong?

I'm not assuming that 7 doesn't occur before 3 rather than I'm only interested to count the probability of the cases when 3 occur before 7 as this is what the question is asking, that's why I'm not considering the cases when 7 occur before 3. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

Part 1.    Math Alive       Rolling Dice   In 1654, Chevalier de Mere, a French gambler, wrote to Pierre Fermat and Blaise Pascal, two of France's mathematical giants, with a number of problems concerning the odds of particular combinations of numbers occurring, when several dice are rolled. This event is considered to be the birth of probability theory. Let's investigate a simple question that Chevalier de Mere could have asked. Suppose we roll two dice. We can get a sum of 4 in two different combinations: (1,3) and (2,2). We can get a sum of 5 in two different combinations also: (1,4) and (2,3). Why is it that in de Mere's practice 5 appears more often than 4?  The answer is the following: the combinations (1,3) and (2,2) are not equiprobable. We have a probability of 1/6 that the first die rolls 2, and a probability of 1/6 that the second die rolls 2, thus making a combination (2,2) with the probability 1/36. By a similar argument we see that the probability that the first die rolls 1 and the second die rolls 3 is 1/36. The probability that the first die rolls 3 and the second die rolls 1 is also 1/36. Hence, the combination (1,3) is rolled with probability 2/36 = 1/18. In the table below, the numbers in the left column show what is rolled on the first die and the numbers in the top row show what is rolled on the second die. We will color in blue the cells corresponding to the sum of 4 , and in pink the cells corresponding to the sum of 5 . Probabilities for Two Dice       1 2 3 4  5 6    1 1/36 1/36  1/36   1/36   1/36 1/36    2 1/36  1/36   1/36  1/36  1/36 1/36    3  1/36   1/36  1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36    4  1/36  1/36 1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36    5 1/36 1/36 1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36    6 1/36 1/36 1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36     Now we can see that the sum 4 will be rolled with probability 3/36 = 1/12 , and the sum 5 with probability 4/36 = 1/9 .

If the sum of the numbers shown on two dice is 10, what is the probability that one number is a 4?  (1) There are three ways for the sum of the dice to be 10: rolls of 4,6 and 5,5 and 6,4.  The sample space has three items, and the event space has two items as there are two possible throws with a 4, Thus the probability is 2/3  (2) We can use conditional probability to confirm:  `P(B|A)=(P(A"and"B))/(P(A)) `  Here we define P(A) as the probability of rolling a sum of 10, and P(B) as the probability that a die shows a 4.  P(A and B) is the probability that the sum is 10 and there is a 4. This is 2/36 as there are 36 possible rolls with (4,6) and (6,4) the only rolls whose sum is 10 with a 4.  P(A) is the probability of rolling a 10. This is 3/36 as there are 36 possible rolls, three of which sum to 10. (4,6),(5,5),(6,4).  Thus the probability of a pair of dice having a 4 if we know the sum is 10 is  `P(B|A)=(2/36)/(3/36)=2/3 `    Further Reading:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability       list Cite  link Link           steveschoen | Certified Educator    A lot of it has to do with what perspective you are looking at.  If you consider the chart on the webpage given, there are 36 combination of rolls you can get from two dice.  When you consider the sum being 10, there are only 3 combinations.  So, the probability of getting a 10 would be 3/36 = 1/12.  But, then, of those 3 combinations, only 2 of them have a 4.  So, then, the probability of getting a sum of 10 with one die being a 4 would be 2/36 = 1/18, when taking into consideration all possible combinations.  But, then, if you consider the perspective of taking into consideration all possible combinations of 10 only, then the probability would be 2/3, 3 total combinations of 10, with 2 of them having a 4.

When two two dice are thrown the sum of the numbers that turn up is 10. This is the case when the following sets of numbers turn up on the dice {(4,6)(5,5),(6,4)}. There are total of three cases in which the sum is 10 and in two of these the number on one of the die is 4. The required probability is therefore 2/3.  If the sum of the numbers that turn up when 2 dice are thrown is 10, there is a probability of 2/3 that the number on one of the dice is 4.      list Cite  link Link              Student Comments      rachellopez | Student    Dice have 6 faces with the numbers 1-6 on them. If you have two dice that add up to a sum of 10, the possible combinations would be {4, 6}, {6, 4}, and {5, 5}. Out the combinations, there are 2 that include a 4, out of 3 total possibilities.

When a die is thrown the outcome can be any of the numbers from 1 to 6. If two dice are thrown the set of outcomes that ensure the sum is 9 is {(3, 6), (6,3), (4, 5), (5, 4)}. The total number of possible outcomes is 6*6 = 36  This gives the required probability as 4/36 = 1/9  The probability of getting 9 as the sum when 2 dice are thrown is 1/9.  Problem 2.  A standard deck of cards has 52 cards with 4 aces and 4 queens. The total number of outcomes when two cards are randomly picked is 52*51 = 2652. There are 4 ways in which the first card picked can be an ace. And there are 4 ways in which the second card can be a queen. It is important to notice that the order of picking an ace and a queen is not important here. As a result, we also have to consider the possibility of picking a queen followed by an ace. This gives the total number of ways in which an ace and a queen can be picked as 4*4 + 4*4 = 32. The required probability is 32/2652 = 8/663  When 2 cards are randomly picked from a standard deck of cards the probability of picking a queen and an ace is 8/663 .      list Cite  link Link              Student Comments      rachellopez | Student    1. In order to get a sum of 9 with two dice, you would have to roll the pairs 4 & 5, 5 & 4, 3 & 6, or 6 & 3. Since you have two dice there are 36 different combinations (6 faces*6 faces) you could roll, but only 4 of them would give you a sum of 9. That makes the probability 4/36 or 1/9 .  2. There are 52 cards in a deck. If you draw two at random you'd have 52 to choose from for your first draw and only 51 for your second. That gives you 2,652 combinations of cards total. Out of the 52 cards in the deck, 4 are aces and 4 are queens. This means you can choose an ace and then a queen (4*4) or a queen and then an ace (4*4). You'll have 32 combinations of an ace and a queen total, giving you a probability of 32/2,652 or 8/663 .                         Access hundreds of thousands of answers with a free trial.

Probability  Probabilities of 6-Sided Dice  It's sometimes handy to know the probabilities of an action succeeding
in TFT. Since TFT uses 6-sided dice exclusively (as does GURPS),
these tables do not include any other possibilities. The first table
gives the probability of rolling a specific number; the second table
gives the probability of rolling less than or equal to a specific number.  This table gives the probability of rolling a particular number on a set
of so many 6-sided dice.

It can also be used
to find the probability of rolling a particular number or more .
Since the probability of rolling N or more is the same as the
probability of not rolling N-1 or less, simply look up the
N-1 value on this table, and subtract it from 1 or 100%. For example,
to find the probability of rolling 8 or more on 3 dice, look up
the probability of rolling 7 or less, which is 35/216 or 16.204%.
Subtract that from 1, giving 181/216 (216 - 35 = 181) or 83.796%.

Dice Rolling Probability: The chances of rolling dice and its mathematical probability            Dice Rolling Probability basics   Dice Rolling Probability Figuring out the mathematical probability of rolling two dice is a lot easier than you think. If holding two dice in your hands, you'll probably figure this out on your own. Lets make sense of things, and why the dice do what they do.   Dice Roll Odds Understanding dice rolling probability isn't much different than a coin flip probability. A coin has two sides. If you flip a coin,probability dictates that either heads or tails have a 50% chance of coming up. If you choose heads before the flipping of a coin, then there's 1 way of 2 that would happen. It can be written as 1/2, 1 out of 2, or 50% (1 divided by 2).   Dice rolling probability is similar to a coins probability, only with more choices Looking at a die (only one from a pair of dice), you'll see 6 sides. The pips (the little white dots) are 1,2,3,4,5,6.   Take a trip back to high school and revisit fractions An apple pie (my favorite) is cut into 6 slices, and one of these slices contains a $100 bill (eww) - what would your chances be of grabbing that $100 bill? Saying it out loud gives you the answer: One slice out of the 6 slices has the $100. Therefore, that's your odds of grabbing it - 1 out of 6, 1/6, or ~16.67% (1 divided by 6) chance.  That's exactly the probability of one side of a die coming up when you roll it. The probability of at least one of the die coming up a 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 is exactly 1 out of 6.   Probability of rolling two dice Craps actually has two dice, and not anymore complicated than the pie example. There are 6 sides on each die.  There are two of them. Twist and turn each of the dice and you get 36 different variations.    Ever wanted to know the probability of rolling doubles with two dice? A hardway,2 or 12 has exactly a dice rolling probability of 1 out of 36 possibilities. Let's look at this chart, and see how it works. I know it's everywhere, but you can't fight science...    Dice Rolling Probability Chart:    # on Dice Ttl Combinations Combinations/Permutations    2 1 1-1    3 2 1-2    2-1    4 3 1-3    2-2    3-1    5 4 1-4    2-3    3-2    4-1    6 5 1-5    2-4    3-3    4-2    5-1    7 6 1-6    2-5    3-4    4-3    5-2    6-1    8 5 2-6    3-5    4-4    5-3    6-2    9 4 3-6    4-5    5-4    6-3    10 3 4-6    5-5    6-4    11 2 5-6    6-5    12 1 6-6    36 Total Combinations     7 has the most possibilities of coming up. The dice rolling probability can never change in a random roll.  It's the rules of probability . The chances of rolling dice are confined to the above chart. This is the reason 7 rolls more often then any number when you roll two dice randomly. When playing Monopoly, you'll have approximately a 66.7% chance of moving 5-9 spaces (hopefully not into another players' Boardwalk). Why? Because adding up the ways 5,6,7,8, and 9 can roll you get 24 different ways. Since there's only 36 results the dice can roll - you're left with 24 out of 36 ways 5-9 come up. That's 24 divided by 36, equaling .666666... Multiply by 100, and you have ~66.7%. So if exaclty two squares away is the "Go To Jail" square, you don't have to worry much on landing there. But there's always a chance of course (a 1 out of 36, or ~2.78% chance to be precise).  Since the 7 comes up more often than the rest, the casinos capitalize on this. The more random the dice are, the more this is true.     An easy way to remember each numbers' combination Looking at the chart, you see that there are pairs that have the same combinations: 2&12, 3&11, 4&10, 5&9,6&8. Just memorize this, because I'm going to show you a cool trick.  By subtracting 1 from any number from 2 to 7, you get the total combinations: Therefore the dice rolling probability of rolling a 6 with two dice is 5 out of 36 (Or 13.89%).  Knowing the pairs I just mentioned, helps you figure out any dice rolling probability. Viola!   When playing craps, you should keep these combinations in mind For example, most people play the 6 & 8 at the same time. The 6 has 5 different ways of coming up on the dice, and so does the 8 - totalling 10 different permutations. That's 10 out of 36 ways.  Translation - ~27.8% chance of hitting the 6 or 8; and a ~16.7% chance of losing. (dice rolling probability=6/36 ways the 7 can come out).  Others place bets on the "inside" - 5,6,8,9. Using what you know so far, try and figure the chance of winning one of those bets on the next roll. Did you get it? It's 50% because 5&9 have 4 ways each 6&8 has 5, giving you 18 (4+5+5+4) out of 36 ways the dice can come up.  I'm not saying whether these are good bets or bad ones, I'm just getting into the math right now. For some betting strategies, check out How to Win At Craps on this website.

Part 1.    Math Alive       Rolling Dice   In 1654, Chevalier de Mere, a French gambler, wrote to Pierre Fermat and Blaise Pascal, two of France's mathematical giants, with a number of problems concerning the odds of particular combinations of numbers occurring, when several dice are rolled. This event is considered to be the birth of probability theory. Let's investigate a simple question that Chevalier de Mere could have asked. Suppose we roll two dice. We can get a sum of 4 in two different combinations: (1,3) and (2,2). We can get a sum of 5 in two different combinations also: (1,4) and (2,3). Why is it that in de Mere's practice 5 appears more often than 4?  The answer is the following: the combinations (1,3) and (2,2) are not equiprobable. We have a probability of 1/6 that the first die rolls 2, and a probability of 1/6 that the second die rolls 2, thus making a combination (2,2) with the probability 1/36. By a similar argument we see that the probability that the first die rolls 1 and the second die rolls 3 is 1/36. The probability that the first die rolls 3 and the second die rolls 1 is also 1/36. Hence, the combination (1,3) is rolled with probability 2/36 = 1/18. In the table below, the numbers in the left column show what is rolled on the first die and the numbers in the top row show what is rolled on the second die. We will color in blue the cells corresponding to the sum of 4 , and in pink the cells corresponding to the sum of 5 . Probabilities for Two Dice       1 2 3 4  5 6    1 1/36 1/36  1/36   1/36   1/36 1/36    2 1/36  1/36   1/36  1/36  1/36 1/36    3  1/36   1/36  1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36    4  1/36  1/36 1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36    5 1/36 1/36 1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36    6 1/36 1/36 1/36 1/36  1/36 1/36     Now we can see that the sum 4 will be rolled with probability 3/36 = 1/12 , and the sum 5 with probability 4/36 = 1/9 .

Single dice  Click here for how to write a probability.  Throwing dice is more complicated than tossing coins , as there are more than 2 values. If you throw a single dice, then it can fall six ways, each of which is equally likely if the dice is true. So the probability of getting one particular value is 1/6 . If you want either of two values it is 2/6 or 1/3 , and so on.    Sum of two dice  It gets more interesting when you have two dice. One thing that you can do is work out what the total of the dice is. The dice experiment allows you to simulate throwing pairs of dice and see what the result is. This is a good introduction to probability, since you can see which combinations are more likely. But the real world, or even a simulated real world, never matches completely with calculated probability. So how do we calculate it? The first thing is to work out what the range is. You can't have a total less than 2 (both dice being 1) and you can't have a total more than 12 (both dice being 6). The easiest way to see what the probabilities is to write out the possible totals. There are 36 of them in all (6 x 6).   Total on dice Pairs of dice Probability  2 1 + 1 1/36 = 3%  3 1 + 2 , 2 + 1 2/36 = 6%  4 1 + 3 , 2 + 2 , 3 + 1 3/36 = 8%  5 1 + 4 , 2 + 3 , 3 + 2 , 4 + 1 4/36 = 11%  6 1 + 5 , 2 + 4 , 3 + 3 , 4 + 2 , 5 + 1 5/36 = 14%  7 1 + 6 , 2 + 5 , 3 + 4 , 4 + 3 , 5 + 2 , 6 + 1 6/36 = 17%  8 2 + 6 , 3 + 5 , 4 + 4 , 5 + 3 , 6 + 2 5/36 = 14%  9 3 + 6 , 4 + 5 , 5 + 4 , 6 + 3 4/36 = 11%  10 4 + 6 , 5 + 5 , 6 + 4 3/36 = 8%  11 5 + 6 , 6 + 5 2/36 = 6%  12 6 + 6 1/36 = 3%   The percentages above are rounded. Compare these with the dice experiment . It won't match exactly, although the more throws you do, the closer it will get.    Other conditions with two dice  There are plenty of other conditions that you can have with two dice. Often, the easiest way to get the probability of a condition is to list all possible throws, and count the ones that fit the condition. The best way to make sure you have remembered all throws is to list them in a 6 x 6 table, like below.  Imagine two dice, red and green. This table shows all possible throws of these dice, with red numbers for the red dice, and green for the green dice. The background is black if the condition is satisfied. You can change the numbers and the condition to see what happens. You find the probability of this condition by counting the black squares, and dividing by 36 (all possible throws).    First number:  1  2  3  4  5  6   Either dice is  Neither dice is  Both dice are  At least one dice isn't  The highest dice is  The lowest dice is  Second number:  1  2  3  4  5  6   Dice are or  Dice are not and not  Dice are and      Probability of this condition =  See below for an explanation     Either dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice being a particular number is 1/6 . You would assume that it would be twice as likely that either of two dice being a particular number, or 1/3 , but this would be wrong. If you select the first condition above, you will see why. While there are six conditions where one dice is a number, and six conditions where the other dice is that number, there is one condition in both. So the probability is (12-1)/36 or 11/36 .  There is a better way to calculate this. If you click on the second condition, then back on the first, you will find that they are opposites of each other. That means that their probabilities add up to one. The second condition is easier to calculate directly (see below), as 25/36 . So this probability is (36-25)/36 = 11/36 .   Neither dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice not being a particular number is 5/6 . The probability of two dice not being a that number is 5/6 x 5/6 = 25/36 . You can do this as they don't overlap as all (the correct term is that they are independent events).   Both dice are the same particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice being a particular number is 1/6 . The probability of two dice being the same particular number is 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 . This is not the same as saying that both dice are the same number. There are six different possible numbers, so that would be 6/36 or 1/6 .   At least one dice isn't a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  This is the opposite of both dice being the same particular number, so the probabilities will add up to one. So the probability of at least one dice isn't a particular number = 1 - (1/36) = 35/36 .   The highest dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  This is a fun conditions, but a little strange to work out! Try experimenting with different numbers, and you will get different collections of throws fitting the conditions, and so different probabilities. To take an example, considering one dice, if the particular number is 5 then there are 5 throws which fit the condition. There are another 5 for the other dice, and there is one overlap, so the result is (5 + 5 - 1)/36 = 9/36 or 1/4 . But this varies for other numbers.   The lowest dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probabilities vary considering what the number is. But the probability of the lowest dice being a particular number is the same as the probability of the highest dice being six minus that particular number.   The dice have two particular numbers  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  Like the first condition, there are two ways to work this out. The first is doing it directly. Each dice has 6 throws for each number, but there are four overlaps. So the probability is (4 x 6 - 4)/36 = 20/36 .  An easier way is to realise that this condition is the opposite of the next one, dice are not either number. That probability is 16/36 so this one is 1 - 16/36 = 20/36 or 5/9 .   The dice are not either particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice not being either of two numbers is 4/6 , so the probability of both dice fitting this condition is 4/6 x 4/6 = 16/36 . We can do this as the conditions don't overlap, so they are independent events.   The dice are two particular numbers  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  There are only two ways that two dice can have two values (try the exercise above to see why), so the probability is 2/36 or 1/18 .   More than two dice  As the number of dice increase, then the different conditions can become more complicated. You can work out some simply.  The easiest is the probability of a number of dice being a particular number. For n dice, this is 1/(6 n ) . For example, the probability for throwing 5 dice and getting them all sixes is 1/(6 5 ) = 1/(6x6x6x6x6) = 1/7776 = 0.000128 or 7775 to 1 .  You can work out what is the chance of getting various numbers when throwing several dice (or one dice several times), but you do it in a back-to-front way, as above . For example, if you throw three dice, what is the chance of one of the dice getting less than five? This means that one of the dice (at least) will be a one, two, three or four. Now this is quite hard to work out directly. What we can do is work out the opposite. The chance of one dice not getting less than five means the chance of it getting a five or six, and this is 2/6 , or 1/3 . But we need all dice to get this. This is 1/3 x 1/3 x 1/3 or 1/27 . This was the opposite of what we want, so we must take it away from one. 1 - 1/27 or 26/27 which is about 96% .   Die or dice  People occasionally point out to me that the singular of 'dice' is 'die'. Yes, I know that. However, a lot of people don't, and I prefer to use 'dice' since then my meaning is clear. It stops them wondering why I'm talking about dying! However, if you think that I should be accurate rather than comprehensible, I'm afraid that the authorities are not on your side. The Oxford English Dictionary says "The form dice (used as pl. and sing.) is of much more frequent occurrence in gaming and related senses than the singular die." I think that probability is related to gaming! It gives a quote: 1474 CAXTON Chesse 132 "He caste thre dyse and on eche dyse was a sise."

Total on dice Pairs of dice Probability  2 1 + 1 1/36 = 3%  3 1 + 2 , 2 + 1 2/36 = 6%  4 1 + 3 , 2 + 2 , 3 + 1 3/36 = 8%  5 1 + 4 , 2 + 3 , 3 + 2 , 4 + 1 4/36 = 11%  6 1 + 5 , 2 + 4 , 3 + 3 , 4 + 2 , 5 + 1 5/36 = 14%  7 1 + 6 , 2 + 5 , 3 + 4 , 4 + 3 , 5 + 2 , 6 + 1 6/36 = 17%  8 2 + 6 , 3 + 5 , 4 + 4 , 5 + 3 , 6 + 2 5/36 = 14%  9 3 + 6 , 4 + 5 , 5 + 4 , 6 + 3 4/36 = 11%  10 4 + 6 , 5 + 5 , 6 + 4 3/36 = 8%  11 5 + 6 , 6 + 5 2/36 = 6%  12 6 + 6 1/36 = 3%   The percentages above are rounded. Compare these with the dice experiment . It won't match exactly, although the more throws you do, the closer it will get.    Other conditions with two dice  There are plenty of other conditions that you can have with two dice. Often, the easiest way to get the probability of a condition is to list all possible throws, and count the ones that fit the condition. The best way to make sure you have remembered all throws is to list them in a 6 x 6 table, like below.  Imagine two dice, red and green. This table shows all possible throws of these dice, with red numbers for the red dice, and green for the green dice. The background is black if the condition is satisfied. You can change the numbers and the condition to see what happens. You find the probability of this condition by counting the black squares, and dividing by 36 (all possible throws).    First number:  1  2  3  4  5  6   Either dice is  Neither dice is  Both dice are  At least one dice isn't  The highest dice is  The lowest dice is  Second number:  1  2  3  4  5  6   Dice are or  Dice are not and not  Dice are and      Probability of this condition =  See below for an explanation     Either dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice being a particular number is 1/6 . You would assume that it would be twice as likely that either of two dice being a particular number, or 1/3 , but this would be wrong. If you select the first condition above, you will see why. While there are six conditions where one dice is a number, and six conditions where the other dice is that number, there is one condition in both. So the probability is (12-1)/36 or 11/36 .  There is a better way to calculate this. If you click on the second condition, then back on the first, you will find that they are opposites of each other. That means that their probabilities add up to one. The second condition is easier to calculate directly (see below), as 25/36 . So this probability is (36-25)/36 = 11/36 .   Neither dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice not being a particular number is 5/6 . The probability of two dice not being a that number is 5/6 x 5/6 = 25/36 . You can do this as they don't overlap as all (the correct term is that they are independent events).   Both dice are the same particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice being a particular number is 1/6 . The probability of two dice being the same particular number is 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 . This is not the same as saying that both dice are the same number. There are six different possible numbers, so that would be 6/36 or 1/6 .   At least one dice isn't a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  This is the opposite of both dice being the same particular number, so the probabilities will add up to one. So the probability of at least one dice isn't a particular number = 1 - (1/36) = 35/36 .   The highest dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  This is a fun conditions, but a little strange to work out! Try experimenting with different numbers, and you will get different collections of throws fitting the conditions, and so different probabilities. To take an example, considering one dice, if the particular number is 5 then there are 5 throws which fit the condition. There are another 5 for the other dice, and there is one overlap, so the result is (5 + 5 - 1)/36 = 9/36 or 1/4 . But this varies for other numbers.   The lowest dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probabilities vary considering what the number is. But the probability of the lowest dice being a particular number is the same as the probability of the highest dice being six minus that particular number.   The dice have two particular numbers  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  Like the first condition, there are two ways to work this out. The first is doing it directly. Each dice has 6 throws for each number, but there are four overlaps. So the probability is (4 x 6 - 4)/36 = 20/36 .  An easier way is to realise that this condition is the opposite of the next one, dice are not either number. That probability is 16/36 so this one is 1 - 16/36 = 20/36 or 5/9 .   The dice are not either particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice not being either of two numbers is 4/6 , so the probability of both dice fitting this condition is 4/6 x 4/6 = 16/36 . We can do this as the conditions don't overlap, so they are independent events.   The dice are two particular numbers  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  There are only two ways that two dice can have two values (try the exercise above to see why), so the probability is 2/36 or 1/18 .   More than two dice  As the number of dice increase, then the different conditions can become more complicated. You can work out some simply.  The easiest is the probability of a number of dice being a particular number. For n dice, this is 1/(6 n ) . For example, the probability for throwing 5 dice and getting them all sixes is 1/(6 5 ) = 1/(6x6x6x6x6) = 1/7776 = 0.000128 or 7775 to 1 .  You can work out what is the chance of getting various numbers when throwing several dice (or one dice several times), but you do it in a back-to-front way, as above . For example, if you throw three dice, what is the chance of one of the dice getting less than five? This means that one of the dice (at least) will be a one, two, three or four. Now this is quite hard to work out directly. What we can do is work out the opposite. The chance of one dice not getting less than five means the chance of it getting a five or six, and this is 2/6 , or 1/3 . But we need all dice to get this. This is 1/3 x 1/3 x 1/3 or 1/27 . This was the opposite of what we want, so we must take it away from one. 1 - 1/27 or 26/27 which is about 96% .   Die or dice  People occasionally point out to me that the singular of 'dice' is 'die'. Yes, I know that. However, a lot of people don't, and I prefer to use 'dice' since then my meaning is clear. It stops them wondering why I'm talking about dying! However, if you think that I should be accurate rather than comprehensible, I'm afraid that the authorities are not on your side. The Oxford English Dictionary says "The form dice (used as pl. and sing.) is of much more frequent occurrence in gaming and related senses than the singular die." I think that probability is related to gaming! It gives a quote: 1474 CAXTON Chesse 132 "He caste thre dyse and on eche dyse was a sise."

Single dice  Click here for how to write a probability.  Throwing dice is more complicated than tossing coins , as there are more than 2 values. If you throw a single dice, then it can fall six ways, each of which is equally likely if the dice is true. So the probability of getting one particular value is 1/6 . If you want either of two values it is 2/6 or 1/3 , and so on.    Sum of two dice  It gets more interesting when you have two dice. One thing that you can do is work out what the total of the dice is. The dice experiment allows you to simulate throwing pairs of dice and see what the result is. This is a good introduction to probability, since you can see which combinations are more likely. But the real world, or even a simulated real world, never matches completely with calculated probability. So how do we calculate it? The first thing is to work out what the range is. You can't have a total less than 2 (both dice being 1) and you can't have a total more than 12 (both dice being 6). The easiest way to see what the probabilities is to write out the possible totals.

Rolling a pair of six-sided dice, what is the probability that you will get a sum of 4?    I thought the answer was 4/36 = 1/9 because each die is a mutually exclusive event 1-3, 3-1, 2-2, 2-2 but are 2-2 and 2-2 truly mutually exclusive? They're the exact same number on each die after all... so maybe the probability is 3/36 = 1/12?       1/1/2016 |  Spele from Columbia, SC      Subscribe          Comment              3 Answers by Expert Tutors  Tutors, sign in to answer this question.

The part I wasn't sure about was the 2-2 - whether or not order mattered on that particular roll... the mutual exclusivity of 3-1 and 1-3 was clear, obviousl! Thanks also for mapping out a table- very helpful!           1/1/2016 |  Spele from Columbia, SC         Comment              Arnold F. | College Professor & Expert Tutor In Statistics and Calculus College Professor & Expert Tutor In Stat...     5.0   5.0  (53 lesson ratings)  (53)               2            Yes, 2-2 should only be counted once since they are the same pair of outcomes.     1/1/2016 | Arnold F.          Comment            Comments    So if there are 36 total possibilities of rolling a pair of dice and 2-2 only counts once, is it 3/35?    {1-3, 3-1, 2 a -2 b } NOT {2 b -2 a }           1/1/2016 |  Spele from Columbia, SC      2-2 is one out of 36. If you list all possible pairs (a,b) you'll get 36.           1/1/2016 |  Arnold F.      Awesome, thanks!           1/1/2016 |  Spele from Columbia, SC      You're welcome.           1/1/2016 |  Arnold F.         Comment              David W. | Experienced Prof Experienced Prof     4.4   4.4  (47 lesson ratings)  (47)      Message             -1            Probability is the ratio of (number of successful events) divided by (number of total events).    With two "fair" dice having numbers 1-6, there are a total of 6*6=36 total events.  How many of these 36 have a sum of 4?  Well, it might help to list them:  1 - 1  no  1 - 2  no  1 - 3  yes  1 - 4  no  . . .  2 - 2 yes  . . .  3 - 1 yes  . . .  6 - 6 no    There are exactly 3 times where the sum is 4 (the success criteria).  The case of 2-2 means that when the first die has a 2 and the second die also has a 2.  You would not call 1-3 and 3-1 the same outcome, would you?    The probability of the sum being 4 is 3/36 = 1/12 .     1/1/2016 |  David W.           Comment                Create a Free Account to Continue  Already have an account?

Thus, there are 6*6=36 possible outcomes.  Next, we must determine how many successes exist, because Probability=(number of successes)/(number of possibilities).

Comment                 Adam S. | Professional and Proficient Math Tutor Professional and Proficient Math Tutor                0            To find the probability determine the number of successful outcomes divided by the number of possible outcomes overall. Each dice has six combinations which are independent. Therefore the number of possible outcomes will be 6*6 = 36.    The number of successful outcomes will be the number of outcomes where the number of the dice adds up to five. There are four successful outcomes:    (1)(4)  (2)(3)  (3)(2)  (4)(1)      The probability of rolling a pair of dice whose numbers add to 5 is 4/36 = 1/9.       3/15/2014 | Adam S.

Vivian L. | Microsoft Word/Excel/Outlook, essay composition, math; I LOVE TO TEACH Microsoft Word/Excel/Outlook, essay comp...     3.0   3.0  (1 lesson ratings)  (1)               0            Hi Again Brittany;  When rolling a pair of dice, there are 36 possible arrangements.  We can easily ascertain this by the formula of 6 2 .  Six represents the quantity of options each die offers.  Two represents how many dice we have.      For the probability of seven...  If one die is 6, the other die must be 1.  If one die is 5, the other die must be 2.  If one die is 4, the other die must be 3.  If one die is 3, the other die must be 4.  If one die is 2, the other die must be 5.  If one die is 1, the other die must be 6.    There are six possible scenarios.  So 6/6 2 = 6/36    For the probability of 11...  If one die is 6, the other die must be 5.  If one die is 5, the other die must be 6.    So 2/6 2 =2/36    We must add the two figures...  6/36 + 2/36=8/36=4/18=2/9         10/13/2013 | Vivian L.

one and second one, a left and a right, a red and a green, etc.  Let
(a,b) denote a possible outcome of rolling the two die, with a the
number on the top of the first die and b the number on the top of the second
die.  Note that each of a and b can be any of the integers from 1 through 6.
Here is a listing of all the joint possibilities for (a,b):    (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)   (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)   (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)   (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)   (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)   (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)   Note that there are 36 possibilities for (a,b).  This total number of possibilities can be obtained from the multiplication principle :  there are 6 possibilities for a, and for each outcome for a, there are 6 possibilities for b.  So,
the total number of joint outcomes (a,b) is 6 times 6 which is 36.  The set of
all possible outcomes for (a,b) is called the sample space of this probability experiment.  With the sample space now identified, formal probability theory requires
that we identify the possible events .
These are always subsets of the
sample space, and must form a sigma-algebra.  In an example such as this,
where the sample space is finite because it has only 36 different outcomes,
it is perhaps easiest to simply declare ALL subsets of the sample space to
be possible events.  That will be a sigma-algebra and avoids what might
otherwise be an annoying technical difficulty.  We make that declaration
with this example of two dice.  With the above declaration, the outcomes where the sum of the two
dice is equal to 5 form an event.
If we call this event E, we have E={(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1)}. Note that we have listed all the ways a first die and second die add
up to 5 when we look at their top faces.  Consider next the probability of E, P(E).  Here we need more information.
If the two dice are fair and independent , each possibility (a,b) is equally likely.  Because there are
36 possibilities in all, and the sum of their probabilities must equal
1, each singleton event {(a,b)} is assigned probability equal to 1/36.
Because E is composed of 4 such distinct singleton events, P(E)=4/36=
1/9.  In general, when the two dice are fair and independent, the probability
of any event is the number of elements in the event divided by 36.  What if the dice aren't fair, or aren't independent of each other?
Then each outcome {(a,b)} is assigned a probability (a number in [0,1])
whose sum over all 36 outcomes is equal to 1.  These probabilities aren't
all equal, and must be estimated by experiment or inferred from other
hypotheses about how the dice are related and and how likely each number
is on each of the dice.  Then the probability of an event such as E
is the sum of the probabilities of the singleton events {(a,b)} that make
up E.      Go to the home page for Tom Ramsey    Go to the home page for the UHM Department of Mathemati

Find probability sum of 5 appears before sum of 7.  2 approaches:   $$P(\text{sum of 5 appears before sum of 7})$$   $$= P(\text{roll 1 is 5})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 2 is 5, roll 1 is not 7})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 3 is 5, roll 1,2 are not 7})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 4 is 5, roll 1,2,3 are not 7})$$  $$+ \ldots$$   $$P(\text{sum of 5 appears before sum of 7})$$   $$= P(\text{roll 1 is 5})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 2 is 5, roll 1 is not 7}, \ \color{red}{\text{roll 1 is not 5}})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 3 is 5, roll 1,2 are not 7}, \ \color{red}{\text{roll 1,2 are not 5}})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 4 is 5, roll 1,2,3 are not 7}, \ \color{red}{\text{roll 1,2,3 are not 5}})$$  $$+ \ldots$$  Which if any is right?   Mathematically:  Let $n = 1,2,...$  Let $A_n$ be probability that sum of 5 appears on roll $n$  Let $B_n$ be probability that sum of 7 appears on roll $n$  Let $B_0^C = \Omega$  Observe that $A_n$ and $B_n$ are disjoint. Hence $A_n \subseteq B_n^C$  Approach 1 gives:  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n} B_m^C)$$  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{\color{red}{n-1}} B_m^C)$$  $$ = \frac{4}{36} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (\frac{30}{36})^{n-1}$$  Approach 2 gives:  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n} B_m^C \color{red}{\cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n-1} A_m^C})$$  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{\color{red}{n-1}} B_m^C \color{red}{\cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n-1} A_m^C})$$  $$ = \frac{4}{36} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (\frac{30}{36})^{n-1} \color{red}{(\frac{32}{36})^{n-1}}$$   What is the weakest independence assumption we need to make?  For approach 1 it seems that we need to assume independence of  $$A_n, B_1, B_2, ..., B_{n-1}$$.  For approach 2 it seems that we need to assume independence of  $$A_1, A_2, ..., A_n, B_1, B_2, ..., B_{n-1}$$.

Probability corresponding with sum $5$ is $\frac{4}{36}$ and probability
corresponding with sum $7$ is $\frac{6}{36}$.  Neglecting the other outcomes we find a probability $\frac{4}{10}$
for sum $5$ and $\frac{6}{10}$
for sum $7$.  If on base of these probabilities a choice is made then the probability that sum $5$ is chosen (i.e. comes before sum $7$) is: $$\frac25$$   edit :  Your first approach is wrong and your second is correct (but tedious). See the answer of Micapps.  Let $E_{k}$ denotes the event that at the $k$-roll for the first
time a sum of $5$ or $7$ appears.  Then more formally we have: $$P\left(\text{sum }5\text{ appears first}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P\left(\text{sum }5\text{ appears first}\mid E_{k}\right)P\left(E_{k}\right)=$$$$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P\left(\text{sum }5\text{ appears at roll }k\mid E_{k}\right)P\left(E_{k}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{2}{5}P\left(E_{k}\right)=\frac{2}{5}$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 16 '16 at 10:09             answered Jun 16 '16 at 9:29       drhab   78.7k 5 37 108                  Wait what about the mathematical formulation and the weakest independence assumption? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:45        1      What exactly do you mean by that? – drhab  Jun 16 '16 at 9:46            drhab, is my mathematical representation of my second approach correct?

Now, the probability of a sum of $5$ is $\color\red{1/9}$, and the probability of a sum of $7$ is $\color\green{1/6}$.  Therefore:   The probability that a sum of $5$ appears before a sum of $7$ is $\frac{\color\red{1/9}}{\color\red{1/9}+\color\green{1/6}}=\frac25$  The probability that a sum of $7$ appears before a sum of $5$ is $\frac{\color\green{1/6}}{\color\red{1/9}+\color\green{1/6}}=\frac35$      share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 16 '16 at 9:57             answered Jun 16 '16 at 9:54       barak manos   37.2k 7 40 92                  World = omega (The whole sample space) ? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:57        1      @BCLC: I guess you could call it that way (it's probability even a more "mathematical" way of saying it)...

What is the probability that a sum of $7$ appears before a sum of $8$? Can you help me with that – behold  May 4 '17 at 2:26        add a comment |             up vote  4  down vote      In your first approach the events are not disjoint: For example the event where the first two rolls are $5$ is contained in both of the first two events.  In the second approach the events are disjoint and their union is the event that $5$ appeared before $7$, so this is the way to go.  Indidentally, if we can assume the throws are all independent, a neat trick in solving this sort of problem is as follows: Let $p$ be the probability that $5$ appears before $7$. By the law of complete probability we have:  $p = \Pr[5\text{ appears on first roll}] + \Pr[\text{first roll is not }5\text{ or }7]\cdot\Pr[5\text{ appears before }7\ |\text{ first roll is not }5\text{ or }7]$  Now, because of the self-similar nature of the problem we get:  $\Pr[5\text{ appears before }7\ |\text{ first roll is not }5\text{ or }7]=p$  Plugging numbers in the first equation we get:  $$p=\frac{4}{36}+\frac{26}{36}p\implies\frac{5}{18}p=\frac{1}{9}\implies p=\frac{2}{5}$$   Regarding "mathematical formulation" of the second approach: The way you've presented the problem by defining the events $A_n,B_n$ is correct as far as I can tell, in the sense that it encodes the intuition given at the start of the question.  Regarding independence: In order to move from the probability of an intersection of events to the product of their probabilities in general you need independence. You may be able to get away with something "weaker" (which you would have to specify), but I have no clue what the "weakest" assumption would be.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 16 '16 at 9:55             answered Jun 16 '16 at 9:29       Micapps   794 2 6                  Wait what about the mathematical formulation and the weakest independence assumption? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:45            The approach above (as well as your approach #2, from where you plug in the numbers) use the independence of the distinct dice rolls. Without this assumption the answer would (in general) change, and would probably be much more difficult to compute directly (although everything that doesn't involve actual numbers would still be correct). – Micapps  Jun 16 '16 at 9:50        1      Mathematical formulation: Not sure what you mean by this. – Micapps  Jun 16 '16 at 9:51            Micapps, about mathematical formulation: is my mathematical representation of my second approach correct? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:51         2      The only thing that matters is that the chances on sum $5$ or sum $7$ are constant. For that you do not need independency. If e.g. you would work under the condition that every roll will have the same outcome (heavily dependent) as the first roll then still the answer is $\frac25$. Independence is not essential here. See my answer for a proof that also works under dependency. – drhab  Jun 16 '16 at 10:31         |  show 4 more comments           Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

You have two dice, what is the probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7? Thanks.. First of all please note that this question is far beyond the GMAT scope. \(P(sum=3)=\frac{2}{36}=\frac{1}{18}\): either (1,2) or (2,1) out of total of 36 different combinations of two dice; \(P(sum=7)=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}\): (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), or (6,1); \(P(other \ sum)=1-(\frac{1}{18}+\frac{1}{6})=\frac{7}{9}\), probability of sums: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12; Winning scenarios: {sum=3} - we have sum of 3 on the first roll of two dice - \(P_1=\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; sum=3} - on the first roll we have other sum and sum of 3 on the second roll - \(P_2=\frac{7}{9}*\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; other sum; sum=3} - \(P_3=(\frac{7}{9})^2*\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; other sum; other sum; sum=3} - \(P_4=(\frac{7}{9})^3*\frac{1}{18}\); ... So probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7 would be the sum of the above infinite series: \(P=\frac{1}{18}+\frac{7}{9}*\frac{1}{18}+(\frac{7}{9})^2*\frac{1}{18}+(\frac{7}{9})^3*\frac{1}{18}+...=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{7}{9}+(\frac{7}{9})^2+(\frac{7}{9})^3+...)=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{\frac{7}{9}}{1-\frac{7}{9}})=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{7}{2})=\frac{1}{4}\) (for geometric progression with common ratio \(|q|<1\), the sum of the progression: \(b_1, b_2, ...\) is \(Sum=\frac{b_1}{1-q}\).). OR: As \(P(sum=3)=\frac{2}{36}\) and \(P(sum=7)=\frac{6}{36}\) then getting the sum of 7 is 3 times more likely than getting the sum of 3, so the sum of 3 has 1 chance out of 4 to get first out of any number of tries, so \(P=\frac{1}{4}\) or \(P=\frac{\frac{2}{36}}{\frac{2}{36}+\frac{6}{36}}=\frac{1}{4}\). Hope it's clear. _________________   New to the Math Forum? Please read this: Ultimate GMAT Quantitative Megathread | All You Need for Quant | PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW:  12 Rules for Posting!!!

However I have a few questions: I understand up to P(other sum). How can you conclude the winning scenario is other sum then sum 3? I know it's a possible case, but why is it (other sum, sum 3) will lead to a (other sum, sum 3, then sum 7). It could be (other sum, sum 3, sum 8) - after 3 rollings, while what we expect is sum 7. Therefore the (other sum, other sum,..., sum 3) could be a wrong case. On the other hand, if we can conclude other sum, other sum,..., sum 3 is a winning scenario, have we assume the probability of sum 7 and other sum but not 7 are the same, while there are different? I don't understand this sentence too "So probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7 would be the sum of the above infinite series" - how can you conclude it's the sum that series, how about if we have an AFTER word? What is the difference between BEFORE and AFTER? Edit: I like your second approach, by comparing the fraction of the probability of 2 events we can say P = 1/4, but I still don't understand the word BEFORE.. What if they ask for AFTER? Will we still compare the 2 probabilities?

Will we still compare the 2 probabilities? When we roll 2 dice the sum can be 3, 7, or some other number (not 3 and not 7). The questions asks for the cases when we get the sum of 3 BEFORE the sum of 7. For example why the cases I wrote are the winning scenarios: {sum=3} - means that right on the first throw we have sum of 3, so we have 3 before 7 (as no 7 at all); {other sum; sum=3} - first roll not 7 and not 3, so we can continue. On the second throw we have sum of 3, so again 3 before 7 - OK; {other sum; other sum; sum=3} - sum of 3 on the third roll; {other sum; other sum; other sum; sum=3} - sum of 3 on the fourth roll; .... {other sum; other sum; other sum; ..., other sum on the nth roll; sum of 3 on the (n+1)th roll} - out of n+1 rolls we have other sum for the rolls from 1 to n and sum of 3 on the (n+1)th roll, still 3 before 7 - OK; ... The above can be continued infinitely, and all above case represent the scenario when we have the sum of 3 BEFORE we have the sum of 7 (which will eventually occur on some roll afterwards). So the probability of getting 3 before 7 would be the sum of the probabilities of the above events. Hope it's clear. Anyway: you won't need this for GMAT, so don't worry too much. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

However I think you miss the scenario where sum=7 occurs before sum=3. For example, 1st time sum=7, 2nd time sum=3, so the probability must be 6/36 * 2/36. You assumed that sum 7 never happens before sum 3 so you take the probability of other sum (7/9) to calculate. Am I wrong?

I'm not assuming that 7 doesn't occur before 3 rather than I'm only interested to count the probability of the cases when 3 occur before 7 as this is what the question is asking, that's why I'm not considering the cases when 7 occur before 3. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

You have two dice, what is the probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7? Thanks.. First of all please note that this question is far beyond the GMAT scope. \(P(sum=3)=\frac{2}{36}=\frac{1}{18}\): either (1,2) or (2,1) out of total of 36 different combinations of two dice; \(P(sum=7)=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}\): (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), or (6,1); \(P(other \ sum)=1-(\frac{1}{18}+\frac{1}{6})=\frac{7}{9}\), probability of sums: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12; Winning scenarios: {sum=3} - we have sum of 3 on the first roll of two dice - \(P_1=\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; sum=3} - on the first roll we have other sum and sum of 3 on the second roll - \(P_2=\frac{7}{9}*\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; other sum; sum=3} - \(P_3=(\frac{7}{9})^2*\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; other sum; other sum; sum=3} - \(P_4=(\frac{7}{9})^3*\frac{1}{18}\); ... So probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7 would be the sum of the above infinite series: \(P=\frac{1}{18}+\frac{7}{9}*\frac{1}{18}+(\frac{7}{9})^2*\frac{1}{18}+(\frac{7}{9})^3*\frac{1}{18}+...=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{7}{9}+(\frac{7}{9})^2+(\frac{7}{9})^3+...)=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{\frac{7}{9}}{1-\frac{7}{9}})=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{7}{2})=\frac{1}{4}\) (for geometric progression with common ratio \(|q|<1\), the sum of the progression: \(b_1, b_2, ...\) is \(Sum=\frac{b_1}{1-q}\).). OR: As \(P(sum=3)=\frac{2}{36}\) and \(P(sum=7)=\frac{6}{36}\) then getting the sum of 7 is 3 times more likely than getting the sum of 3, so the sum of 3 has 1 chance out of 4 to get first out of any number of tries, so \(P=\frac{1}{4}\) or \(P=\frac{\frac{2}{36}}{\frac{2}{36}+\frac{6}{36}}=\frac{1}{4}\). Hope it's clear. _________________   New to the Math Forum? Please read this: Ultimate GMAT Quantitative Megathread | All You Need for Quant | PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW:  12 Rules for Posting!!!

However I have a few questions: I understand up to P(other sum). How can you conclude the winning scenario is other sum then sum 3? I know it's a possible case, but why is it (other sum, sum 3) will lead to a (other sum, sum 3, then sum 7). It could be (other sum, sum 3, sum 8) - after 3 rollings, while what we expect is sum 7. Therefore the (other sum, other sum,..., sum 3) could be a wrong case. On the other hand, if we can conclude other sum, other sum,..., sum 3 is a winning scenario, have we assume the probability of sum 7 and other sum but not 7 are the same, while there are different? I don't understand this sentence too "So probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7 would be the sum of the above infinite series" - how can you conclude it's the sum that series, how about if we have an AFTER word? What is the difference between BEFORE and AFTER? Edit: I like your second approach, by comparing the fraction of the probability of 2 events we can say P = 1/4, but I still don't understand the word BEFORE.. What if they ask for AFTER? Will we still compare the 2 probabilities?

Will we still compare the 2 probabilities? When we roll 2 dice the sum can be 3, 7, or some other number (not 3 and not 7). The questions asks for the cases when we get the sum of 3 BEFORE the sum of 7. For example why the cases I wrote are the winning scenarios: {sum=3} - means that right on the first throw we have sum of 3, so we have 3 before 7 (as no 7 at all); {other sum; sum=3} - first roll not 7 and not 3, so we can continue. On the second throw we have sum of 3, so again 3 before 7 - OK; {other sum; other sum; sum=3} - sum of 3 on the third roll; {other sum; other sum; other sum; sum=3} - sum of 3 on the fourth roll; .... {other sum; other sum; other sum; ..., other sum on the nth roll; sum of 3 on the (n+1)th roll} - out of n+1 rolls we have other sum for the rolls from 1 to n and sum of 3 on the (n+1)th roll, still 3 before 7 - OK; ... The above can be continued infinitely, and all above case represent the scenario when we have the sum of 3 BEFORE we have the sum of 7 (which will eventually occur on some roll afterwards). So the probability of getting 3 before 7 would be the sum of the probabilities of the above events. Hope it's clear. Anyway: you won't need this for GMAT, so don't worry too much. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

However I think you miss the scenario where sum=7 occurs before sum=3. For example, 1st time sum=7, 2nd time sum=3, so the probability must be 6/36 * 2/36. You assumed that sum 7 never happens before sum 3 so you take the probability of other sum (7/9) to calculate. Am I wrong?

I'm not assuming that 7 doesn't occur before 3 rather than I'm only interested to count the probability of the cases when 3 occur before 7 as this is what the question is asking, that's why I'm not considering the cases when 7 occur before 3. _________________   New to the Math Forum?
