Placenta previa is a condition in which the placenta lies very low in the uterus and covers all or part of the cervix. The cervix is the opening to the uterus that sits at the top of the vagina.  Placenta previa happens in about 1 in 200 pregnancies. If you have placenta previa early in pregnancy, it usually isn’t a problem. However, it can cause serious bleeding and other complications later in pregnancy.  Normally, the placenta grows into the upper part of the uterus wall, away from the cervix. It stays there until your baby is born. During the last stage of labor , the placenta separates from the wall, and your contractions help push it into the vagina (birth canal). This is also called the afterbirth.  During labor, your baby passes through the cervix into the birth canal. If you have placenta previa, when the cervix begins to efface (thin out) and dilate (open up) for labor, blood vessels connecting the placenta to the uterus may tear. This can cause severe bleeding during labor and birth, putting you and your baby in danger.  What are the symptoms of placenta previa?  The most common symptom of placenta previa is painless bleeding from the vagina during the second half of pregnancy. Call your health care provider right away if you have vaginal bleeding anytime during your pregnancy. If the bleeding is severe, go to the hospital.  Not all women with placenta previa have vaginal bleeding. In fact, about one-third of women with placenta previa don’t have this symptom.  How is placenta previa diagnosed?  An ultrasound usually can find placenta previa and pinpoint the placenta’s location. In some cases, your provider may use a transvaginal ultrasound instead.  Even if you don’t have vaginal bleeding, a routine, second trimester ultrasound may show that you have placenta previa. Don’t be too worried if this happens. Placenta previa found in the second trimester fixes itself in most cases.  How is placenta previa treated?  Treatment depends on how far along you are in your pregnancy, the seriousness of your bleeding and the health of you and your baby. The goal is to keep you pregnant as long as possible. Providers recommend cesarean birth (c-section) for nearly all women with placenta previa to prevent severe bleeding.  If you are bleeding as a result of placenta previa, you need to be closely monitored in the hospital. If tests show that you and your baby are doing well, your provider may give you treatment to try to keep you pregnant for as long as possible.  If you have a lot of bleeding, you may be treated with blood transfusions. A blood transfusion is having new blood put into your body. Your provider also may give you medicines called corticosteroids. These medicines help speed up development of your baby’s lungs and other organs.  Your provider may want you to stay in the hospital until you give birth. If the bleeding stops, you may be able to go home. If you have severe bleeding due to placenta previa at about 34 to 36 weeks of pregnancy, your provider may recommend an immediate c-section.  At 36 to 37 weeks, your provider may suggest an amniocentesis to test the amniotic fluid around your baby to see if her lungs are fully developed. If they are, your provider may recommend an immediate c-section to avoid risks of future bleeding.  At any stage of pregnancy, a c-section may be necessary if you have dangerously heavy bleeding or if you and your baby are having problems.  What causes placenta previa?  We don’t know what causes placenta previa. However, you may be at higher risk for placenta previa if:   You smoke cigarettes .  You use cocaine .  You’re 35 or older.  You’ve been pregnant before.  You’re pregnant with twins, triplets or more .  You’ve had surgery on your uterus, including a c-section or a D&C (dilation and curettage). A D&C is when a doctor removes tissue from the lining of a woman's uterus. Some women have a D&C after a miscarriage .   If you've had placenta previa before, what are your chances of having it again?  If you’ve had placenta previa in a past pregnancy, you have a 2 to 3 in 100 (2 to 3 percent) chance of having it again.  How can you reduce your risk for placenta previa?  We don’t know how to prevent placenta previa. But you may be able to reduce your risk by not smoking and not using cocaine. You also may be able to lower your chances of having placenta previa in future pregnancies by having a c-section only if it’s medically necessary. If your pregnancy is healthy and there are no medical reasons for you to have a c-section, it’s best to let labor begin on its own. The more c-sections you have, the greater your risk of placenta previa.

It is a condition in which the placenta – the flapjack-shaped organ that supplies the fetus with nutrients through the umbilical cord – implants itself unusually low in the uterus, next to or covering your cervix.  If the placenta completely covers the cervical opening it is known as a complete or total placenta previa. If it only partially covers the opening, it is known as a partial placenta previa. If it is within two centimeters of the cervix but not covering it, the condition is known as a marginal placenta previa.  What causes this condition? Placenta previa happens when an embryo implants itself in the lower uterus. Then, when the placenta grows, it may partially or completely cover the cervical opening.  Is placenta previa serious? Placenta previa discovered early in pregnancy is not yet cause for alarm. More often than not, the placenta will fix itself, “migrating” away from the cervix. In actuality, the placenta is attached to the uterus and does not move. But as the uterus grows, the placenta may end up farther from your cervix. In addition, the placenta itself has a general tendency to grow toward the richer blood supply at the top of the uterus.  In fact, only about 10% of women diagnosed with placenta previa at mid-pregnancy still have it when their time comes to deliver. Unfortunately, a total placenta previa is less likely to resolve itself than a marginal or low-lying placenta.  What if the condition persists? Even if you have placenta previa later in pregnancy, it may still move away from the cervical opening. You will need to have a follow-up ultrasound early in your third trimester to check on the condition of the placenta. You may need an examination sooner if you experience any vaginal bleeding.  If your placenta previa persists, you will need to be very careful. You should have regular ultrasounds and be wary of vaginal bleeding. Your doctor will tell you to avoid strenuous activities, heavy lifting, and sex for the rest of your pregnancy.  Bleeding? Bleeding from placenta previa can range from spotting to extremely heavy. This happens when the cervix begins to dilate. It is usually painless and starts without warning. Depending on the severity of the bleeding, you may need to deliver your baby immediately and may also need a blood transfusion.  If you begin bleeding or having contractions, you will have to be hospitalized. Depending on the amount of bleeding, the health of you and your baby, and how far along you are in your pregnancy, the baby may need to be delivered by c-section immediately.  If the bleeding stops and everything is ok, you will likely be sent home. But if the bleeding starts again, you will have to return to the hospital immediately.  What about the delivery? If you still have placenta previa when you are ready to deliver, you will need to have a c-section. Unfortunately having placenta previa may increase your risk for other complications. For instance, you may be at risk of heavy bleeding during and after delivery. Once the baby is delivered the placenta will be delivered and you will be given medications that will cause your uterus to contract. This helps to stop the bleeding from the area of the uterus where the placenta was implanted.  Unfortunately, women who have placenta previa are also more likely to have placenta accrete, a condition where the placenta is implanted too deeply and does not separate easily at delivery. Although placenta accrete only occurs in about one out of 2,500 births overall, your chances of developing this problem are one out of ten if you still have placenta previa when the time comes to deliver. This may cause severe bleeding and a blood transfusion and hysterectomy may be necessary to stop the bleeding.  Who's at risk for placenta previa? For most women, there are no apparent warning signs, but if any of the following risk factors apply to you, your chances may be increased.   You've had placenta previa in an earlier pregnancy  You've had previous c-sections  You're having a multiple pregnancy  You've had uterine surgery  You are a cigarette smoker  You use cocaine   As always, if you ever notice any bleeding or pains in your abdomen, call your doctor right away.

In most pregnancies, the placenta is located at the top or side of the uterus. In placenta previa, the placenta is located low in the uterus. The placenta might partially or completely cover the cervix, as shown here. Placenta previa can cause severe bleeding in the mother before or during delivery. A C-section delivery might be required.     The placenta is a structure that develops inside your uterus during pregnancy, providing oxygen and nutrition to and removing wastes from your baby. The placenta connects to your baby through the umbilical cord. In most pregnancies, the placenta attaches at the top or side of the uterus.  Placenta previa (pluh-SEN-tuh PREH-vee-uh) occurs when a baby's placenta partially or totally covers the mother's cervix — the outlet for the uterus. Placenta previa can cause severe bleeding during pregnancy and delivery.  If you have placenta previa, you might bleed throughout your pregnancy and during your delivery. Your health care provider will recommend avoiding activities that might cause contractions, including having sex, douching, using tampons, or engaging in activities that can increase your risk of bleeding, such as running, squatting, and jumping.  You'll need a C-section to deliver your baby if the placenta previa doesn't resolve.      Symptoms Bright red vaginal bleeding without pain during the second half of pregnancy is the main sign of placenta previa. Some women also have contractions.  In many women diagnosed with placenta previa early in their pregnancies, the placenta previa resolves. As the uterus grows, it might increase the distance between the cervix and the placenta. The more the placenta covers the cervix and the later in the pregnancy that it remains over the cervix, the less likely it is to resolve.  When to see a doctor  If you have vaginal bleeding during your second or third trimester, call your doctor right away. If the bleeding is severe, seek emergency medical care.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes The exact cause of placenta previa is unknown.  Risk factors Placenta previa is more common among women who:   Have had a baby  Have scars on the uterus, such as from previous surgery, including cesarean deliveries, uterine fibroid removal, and dilation and curettage  Had placenta previa with a previous pregnancy  Are carrying more than one fetus  Are age 35 or older  Are of a race other than white  Smoke  Use cocaine   Complications If you have placenta previa, your health care provider will monitor you and your baby to reduce the risk of these serious complications:   Bleeding. Severe, possibly life-threatening vaginal bleeding (hemorrhage) can occur during labor, delivery or in the first few hours after delivery.  Preterm birth. Severe bleeding may prompt an emergency C-section before your baby is full term.

[Article in Serbian] Jovanović B 1 , Dordević M . Author information 1 Ginekolosko-akuserska klinika, Klinicko-bolnicki centar "Kragujevac", Kragujevac. Abstract INTRODUCTION: This is a case report of maternal and fetal death due to major hemorrhage of a patients with placenta previa/accreta in a concealed pregnancy. Bleeding is the leading cause of maternal mortality in obstetrics. Postpartum hemorrhage is the most important cause of maternal death. Placenta accreta is a severe complication involving an abnormal attachment to the uterine wall so that it cannot be easily separated from the uterus. CASE REPORT: Due to the fact that one part of the placenta is partially detached, while the other part has grown into the uterus, postpartum hemorrhage may occur with lethal outcome, unless the mother is hospitalized. Fetal death was caused by severe meconium aspiration. One way to prevent such complications is to support legal abortions.

Placenta previa is a problem of pregnancy in which the placenta grows in the lowest part of the womb (uterus) and covers all or part of the opening to the cervix . The placenta grows during pregnancy and feeds the developing baby. The cervix is the opening to the birth canal. Causes   During pregnancy, the placenta moves as the womb stretches and grows. It is very common for the placenta to be low in the womb in early pregnancy. But as the pregnancy continues, the placenta moves to the top of the womb. By the third trimester, the placenta should be near the top of the womb, so the cervix is open for delivery. Sometimes, the placenta partly or completely covers the cervix. This is called a previa. There are different forms of placenta previa: Marginal: The placenta is next to the cervix but does not cover the opening. Partial: The placenta covers part of the cervical opening. Complete: The placenta covers all of the cervical opening. Placenta previa occurs in 1 out of 200 pregnancies. It is more common in women who have: An abnormally shaped uterus Had many pregnancies in the past Had multiple pregnancies, such as twins or triplets Scarring on the lining of the uterus due to a history of surgery, C-section, or abortion In vitro fertilization Women who smoke, use cocaine, or have their children at an older age may also have an increased risk. Symptoms   The main symptom of placenta previa is sudden bleeding from the vagina . Some women also have cramps. The bleeding often starts near the end of the second trimester or beginning of the third trimester. Bleeding may be severe and life threatening. It may stop on its own, but can start again days or weeks later. Labor sometimes starts within several days of the heavy bleeding. Sometimes, bleeding may not occur until after labor starts. Exams and Tests   Your health care provider can diagnose this condition with a pregnancy ultrasound. Treatment   Your provider will carefully consider the risk of bleeding against early delivery of your baby. After 36 weeks, delivery of the baby may be the best treatment. Nearly all women with placenta previa need a C-section . If the placenta covers all or part of the cervix, a vaginal delivery can cause severe bleeding. This can be deadly to both the mother and baby. If the placenta is near or covering part of the cervix, your provider may recommend: Reducing your activities Bed rest Pelvic rest, which means no sex, no tampons, and no douching Nothing should be placed in the vagina. You may need to stay in the hospital so your health care team can closely monitor you and your baby. Other treatments you may receive: Blood transfusions Medicines to prevent early labor Medicines to help pregnancy continue to at least 36 weeks Shot of special medicine called Rhogam if your blood type is Rh-negative Steroid shots to help the baby's lungs mature An emergency C-section may be done if the bleeding is heavy and cannot be controlled. Outlook (Prognosis)   The biggest risk is severe bleeding that can be life threatening to the mother and baby. If you have severe bleeding, your baby may need to be delivered early, before major organs, such as the lungs, have developed. When to Contact a Medical Professional   Call your provider if you have vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. Placenta previa can be dangerous to both you and your baby.

Placenta previa is a condition in which the placenta lies very low in the uterus and covers all or part of the cervix. The cervix is the opening to the uterus that sits at the top of the vagina.  Placenta previa happens in about 1 in 200 pregnancies. If you have placenta previa early in pregnancy, it usually isn’t a problem. However, it can cause serious bleeding and other complications later in pregnancy.  Normally, the placenta grows into the upper part of the uterus wall, away from the cervix. It stays there until your baby is born. During the last stage of labor , the placenta separates from the wall, and your contractions help push it into the vagina (birth canal). This is also called the afterbirth.  During labor, your baby passes through the cervix into the birth canal. If you have placenta previa, when the cervix begins to efface (thin out) and dilate (open up) for labor, blood vessels connecting the placenta to the uterus may tear. This can cause severe bleeding during labor and birth, putting you and your baby in danger.  What are the symptoms of placenta previa?  The most common symptom of placenta previa is painless bleeding from the vagina during the second half of pregnancy. Call your health care provider right away if you have vaginal bleeding anytime during your pregnancy. If the bleeding is severe, go to the hospital.  Not all women with placenta previa have vaginal bleeding. In fact, about one-third of women with placenta previa don’t have this symptom.  How is placenta previa diagnosed?  An ultrasound usually can find placenta previa and pinpoint the placenta’s location. In some cases, your provider may use a transvaginal ultrasound instead.  Even if you don’t have vaginal bleeding, a routine, second trimester ultrasound may show that you have placenta previa. Don’t be too worried if this happens. Placenta previa found in the second trimester fixes itself in most cases.  How is placenta previa treated?  Treatment depends on how far along you are in your pregnancy, the seriousness of your bleeding and the health of you and your baby. The goal is to keep you pregnant as long as possible. Providers recommend cesarean birth (c-section) for nearly all women with placenta previa to prevent severe bleeding.  If you are bleeding as a result of placenta previa, you need to be closely monitored in the hospital. If tests show that you and your baby are doing well, your provider may give you treatment to try to keep you pregnant for as long as possible.  If you have a lot of bleeding, you may be treated with blood transfusions. A blood transfusion is having new blood put into your body. Your provider also may give you medicines called corticosteroids. These medicines help speed up development of your baby’s lungs and other organs.  Your provider may want you to stay in the hospital until you give birth. If the bleeding stops, you may be able to go home. If you have severe bleeding due to placenta previa at about 34 to 36 weeks of pregnancy, your provider may recommend an immediate c-section.  At 36 to 37 weeks, your provider may suggest an amniocentesis to test the amniotic fluid around your baby to see if her lungs are fully developed. If they are, your provider may recommend an immediate c-section to avoid risks of future bleeding.  At any stage of pregnancy, a c-section may be necessary if you have dangerously heavy bleeding or if you and your baby are having problems.  What causes placenta previa?  We don’t know what causes placenta previa. However, you may be at higher risk for placenta previa if:   You smoke cigarettes .  You use cocaine .  You’re 35 or older.  You’ve been pregnant before.  You’re pregnant with twins, triplets or more .  You’ve had surgery on your uterus, including a c-section or a D&C (dilation and curettage). A D&C is when a doctor removes tissue from the lining of a woman's uterus. Some women have a D&C after a miscarriage .   If you've had placenta previa before, what are your chances of having it again?  If you’ve had placenta previa in a past pregnancy, you have a 2 to 3 in 100 (2 to 3 percent) chance of having it again.  How can you reduce your risk for placenta previa?  We don’t know how to prevent placenta previa. But you may be able to reduce your risk by not smoking and not using cocaine. You also may be able to lower your chances of having placenta previa in future pregnancies by having a c-section only if it’s medically necessary. If your pregnancy is healthy and there are no medical reasons for you to have a c-section, it’s best to let labor begin on its own. The more c-sections you have, the greater your risk of placenta previa.

I had a marginal PP  (previous poster) with DD  (dear daughter) (17mo old) and am now expecting #2 due in Jan. I haven't been able to find anything but plan to ask doc @ my appt. next Mon.  I do know that the placenta attaches itself differently for every pregnancy so I find it hard to believe that you can have multiple previas but then again, I'm not a professional just a woman with a body that likes to do strange things. Will keep you posted and would love to know anyone else's take on this.    --  Mommy of DD 3/7/09,  DS 1/22/11, and DS 11/5/13             Reply            Report this comment        1                     mommysoup    Posted 08/04/2010      found this reassuring & helpful: community.babycenter.com/post/a1969...    --  Mommy of DD 3/7/09,  DS 1/22/11, and DS 11/5/13             Reply            Report this comment        1                     mommysoup    Posted 08/23/2010      Go In for an U/S  (ultrasound) today w/ a perinatologist to see what the likelyhood of reocurrance will be this time.

I asked my OB about this same thing, and he said..its the luck of the draw. With a prior C-section, the risk I believe is higher, but he says every pregnancy is diff, and you could have PP  (previous poster) your first preg, and not have it your 2nd.. but again, its luck :( It scares me as well, to take the risk again.. and then being afraid it will be worse a 2nd time around.. the whole thing, just sucks.    --  Alissa- baby center  community moderator  Mom to my 3 sweet  BOYS  (Sept 2010, March 2013 & March 2016)  Complete placenta previa,  2x ISO Anti-D mom             Reply            Report this comment        1                     alimeredith    Posted 08/31/2010      I don't have a lot of research to back this up, but I had a cpp with my first but  a great outcome.

Charliemw    Posted 08/07/2016       Hello ladies! So..I had undiagnosed placenta accreta with my last pregnancy. I had previa so was high risk but it still wasn't caught. Anywho.. everything after labor was horrible..emergency surgery..massive blood loss..4 day stay in the ICU..etc.. I am now 28 weeks and my doctor doesn't seem that concerned, and sent me to the same specialist that missed it last time. The specialist did one ultrasound and casually tells me everything's fine and I have a less than 1% chance of having it again. Everything I've read online says chances of it reoccurring are much higher than that. Should I be worried? Has anyone had it once and then not had it in future pregnancies?

Thank you for the response! The fb pages were very helpful! I nagged my doc into sending me to a different specialist, and I plan on asking for one. And when I asked if a team would be prepared the response was..this is a good hospital, you'll be fine... =/               Reply            Report this comment        1                     MelEricBabyD    Posted 10/19/2016      I will be interested in any responses to this as well. I had an undiagnosed accreta with my first child. My experience went as well as I could hope for. My labor was very fast (about 2 hours from first contraction to delivery). It was an unmedicated vaginal delivery with a midwife. It was in the middle of the night in a small but good hospital. After delivery, the placenta would not budge. It was very painful when they attempted manual removal, but it still would not come out. I went to the OR where they put me to sleep and did a manual removal of the placenta (during which I hemmorhaged and required blood transfusion) followed by a D & C. I'm so lucky to still have my uterus, and I'm so grateful to the amazing doctors and nurses who kept their wits about them and saved my life and fertility.  The only risk factor that I had is a prior D&C. I did not have placenta previa or any prior c-sections. It seems this type of case is quite rare.  I'm now 9 weeks pregnant and very concerned that it will happen again. My MFM has already started seeing me, although there is nothing to see in regards to the placenta yet. He believes that the chances of reoccurence are slim, but is very cautious. He has recommended that I change delivery hospitals just in case it goes undetected again. Not that my medical team was in any way inadequate, but just for the access to facilities and specialist at all times. I am very sad to deliver at another hospital (my father is a retired OB from my current hospital), but I will do what is best for my health. I believe I will have ultrasounds at 13 weeks, 18 weeks, early 20s, and early 30s to inspect placenta. I believe he also said we can do an MRI for further imaging if needed.  I'm not sure how many people will be posting here, but I just wanted to share my experience, and I will try to update as I progress through my pregnancy. I hope to put some information out there regarding reoccurence of accreta when it was not related to scar tissue from c-sections or related to previa. I've been a member of the facebook support groups for a while, and I have enjoyed the information.

WowAMomToThree    Posted 09/27/2012      Backstory: diagnosed with CPP at 14 weeks. Put on pelvic rest immediately and bedrest at 20 weeks once U/S  (ultrasound) shown it had not moved. At 28 weeks had a minor bleed, hospitalized for 1 week with no bleeding in hospital. Same night I was released (now 29 weeks) had another minor bleed but was more serious the previous bleed. Was hospitalized for another week with no bleeding again while in the hospital. Received my steroid shots for the baby's lungs, signed the hysterectomy paperwork that time and everything. Was released and put on strict bedrest. Made it to 32 weeks and went into early labor with a major bleed. Made it to ER by squad and was put thru an emergency c/s to save both of us. He was deprived of some oxygen and I was severely anemic for a year after birth. Long story shortened the best I could. DS  (dear son) was born at 4.3 lbs and was in NICU for 3 weeks. He was on a CPAP for a week but he actually did amazingl6 well for how early he was and was a healthy boy even after being without oxygen for a period of time. Now I'm pregnant again. I swore not to carry again because of the chance of me getting CPP is higher bc I have had it once. But I did and I am truly blessed to be able to have my 3rd child (last pregnancy was my 2nd) but I'm scared to death. I will be 29 weeks on Saturday and this is around the time period everything happened last time. I had an ultrasound 6 weeks ago and my placenta was low lying but not previa. I get another tomorrow to make sure it has not moved lower. I'm nervous, worried, scared but at the same time trying not to think so much. I'm wondering how other many moms decided to carry again after having CPP to the finish line? How did you handle the later months of the pregnancy? Did you have CPP the second time around? Any advice is greatly appreciated and I want to say thank you in advance for any helpful words.  Engaged with 2 kids.

I didn't have previa with my 1st but he ended in an emergency C as I just couldn't push him out, even with the help of the vacuum. Baby #2 was a CPP. Brown blood at 14 weeks then 3 red bleeds (21, 25, and 29 weeks) that would fill a pad then turn to brown blood. Spent 12 weeks on strict BR with a total of 3 of those hospitalized after the 2nd and 3rd bleeds. I was in pre term labor at 25.5 weeks so had the steroid shots then. Last bleed was at 29 weeks. Came home from the hospital at 31 weeks and made it to 36+1 when during my last non stress test the nurses discovered I was in labor with contractions 2-3 min apart. Delivered my 2nd baby emergenc C a couple hrs later. He was born at 6.6lbs no NICU, stayed with me in my room and was discharged with me 5 days later.  I'm really wanting to start trying for #3, last one. So I'm also looking to hear from other woman who went on to have previa free babies or even low lying/marginal previas.    --  Moxley-01.09 Jaxon-07.10 BF'd til 18 mths, ERFing, SAHM who loves her boys to the moon and back!

I'm pretty nervous about it all, since I had CPP with my 1st pregnancy.. had bleeds, hospital stays and my son was born by emergency c/s at 35.5 weeks. Thankfully he was 100% healthy and never needed any intervention. But- it was a huge deciding factor on getting pregnant again. I was very hesitant and nervous, and everyone kept telling me, this time will be diff..but we'll see. I found out at 10 weeks, that I am dealing with having Anti-D antibodies due to the fact that I am a negative blood type, and husband is positive. At some point in my pregnancy with him, I bled, didn't know it- and became sensitized.. so we are all ready hooked up with a specialist and are watching this baby's blood to make sure MY blood doesn't cause it to be anemic. So- talk about stress ALL READY and I don't even know about having placenta previa again.  My OB is very optimistic, and seems to think it's even more rare for me to have it again..but my hopes aren't high- we'll just wait and see!

My OB and my perinatologists have all been very very optomistic. They tell me that research shows, you're more likley to have it again, only DUE to the fact that you've had a c/section...NOT because you had PP. And that any women whose had a c/s is at just as high of a risk as I am, but that still, the risk is low. My Ob says that due to his experiance, he's seen more women NOT have it a 2nd time, then do, and that he'd bet me 85% i'll be clear this time. I'm praying he's right.. and will find out soon! I will keep you and the others who have asked, posted on what happens! :) But- yes, if I do have it a 2nd time, due to the fact that I've had a c/s..I am at higher risk of complications, including placenta accreta :(    --  Alissa- baby center  community moderator  Mom to my 3 sweet  BOYS  (Sept 2010, March 2013 & March 2016)  Complete placenta previa,  2x ISO Anti-D mom             Reply            Report this comment       0                     Bethann5584    Posted 09/05/2012      bump               Reply            Report this comment       0                     meems02 · Original Poster    Posted 09/05/2012      Ali, the first time you had PP, when did you deliver your baby? Did your baby make it to full term? I was on hospital bedrest due to bleeding on and off and had an emergency c-section at 32 weeks... I'm scared if I get pregnant again and I have PP, the baby might even have to born earlier! And of course all those other complications come to mind such as placenta accreta, increta or percreta. Placenta Previa is such a scary complication.  The bleeding didn't scare me as much as the preterm delivery. My baby was in the NICU for several weeks. Goodluck and I pray you don't have PP  (previous poster) this time around.

My first pregnancy was smooth sailing. My son was breech so we scheduled c-section at 39w. Second pregnancy had PP  (previous poster) that became complete previa. I have two major bleeding episodes that ultimately landed me in the hospital on bedrest. Delivered emergency c-section at 32w. I'm SO  (significant other) worried about what will happen this time around. I'm finding mixed research on the likelihood of it reoccuring. What were your outcomes?

I had one major bleed at 34 weeks one day (in my sleep).  Upon  arriving to the hospital, I was rushed into an emergency C-Section right there and then. I ended up having a beautiful and healthy baby girl who needed to stay in the NICU for a full 4 weeks primarily due to feeding issues.    My daughter is almost 11 months now and I am currently 18 weeks pregnant. A few days ago, I was diagnosed with complete placenta previa again!! I am afraid it will be much harder this time around as 1) I have a 20 lbs baby to take care off and not much help at all 2) My body is probably weaker that it was with my last pregnancy being that my pregnancies are so close to one another.  Did you make it farther in pregnancy the second time around with the previa?

I've had 5 c-sections... though the first 3 were 10-12 years before the last 2. In my 4th pregnancy I had a placenta previa, was on bed rest for bleeding off and on, and I was dealing with anemia. Thankfully, as the pregnancy progressed the placenta "migrated" a little farther away from the "Os" (the inside top of the cervix). This made things a little less severe, but although I went into premature labor, it was progressing and doctor's could not stop it, even with Turbutaline. So, fearing the bleeding might still be an issue, I ended up with C-section 4.  My 5th pregnancy was mostly uneventful. The first 7 months were fabulous, the placenta placement was great, but I faced other complications from working too much, getting dehydrated and going into pre-eclampsia... we didn't know I had HUGE kidney stones at the time, which was probably a large part of the toxemia.  Now, I'm in my 2nd trimester of surprize (unplanned) pregnancy number 6! Wow.... didn't see this one coming at all as we've been faithful about using preventive measures. So, I have to believe this little bundle is meant to be! The good news is, we just had our 2nd ultrasound and this little one is in a much safer position. Despite all my previous C-section scar tissue and my previous placenta previa, this little one has a healthy looking placenta at the top of the uterus, right where it should be! So far so good!  So, rest in hope and faith that just because lightening struck once... doesn't mean it will strike again!  Be AWARE of complications that can occur, stay educated on risks, treatments and options, but don't fear them. Just stay informed and if a complication presents itself you will be ahead of the game because you will be educated enough to discuss it rationally with your doctor and decide the best and safest course of action for you and your darling baby!  God bless you and good luck to you!

(9 Posts)       Add message | Report    Fairylea   Tue 12-Feb-13 21:58:31    Not thinking of having another right now. But genuine question for the future. I had one very long difficult vaginal birth with dd now aged 9. So I opted for an elective section with ds 8 months ago. As soon as they started there was a huge panic ... turned out I had undiagnosed placenta previa. I had had no symptoms or bleeding at all during the pregnancy. During the section I lost nearly 3 litres of blood, had two blood transfusions in recovery afterwards. I was in hospital for a week. Would I be mad to even consider another? Or was it just a case of bad luck and if they had been more prepared maybe it wouldn't have been so bad? Thanks.       Add message | Report    Emsyboo   Wed 13-Feb-13 07:08:58    Can't help but bumping and curious I have PP now due in a few weeks it has been hard with bleeds and wondering possibility of it happening again. Sorry       Add message | Report    Fairylea   Wed 13-Feb-13 08:50:18    Thanks, maybe someone will know !       Add message | Report    NAR4   Wed 13-Feb-13 10:05:16    I'm not medically qualified or anything but don't think PP is more likely if you have had it before. There are however risk factors that make it more likely, which include a previous CS. I think you were very unlucky Fairy because a CS is normal if you have been diagnosed with PP and it doesn't move before you are ready to give birth. Also it was unlucky not to be picked up at your 20 wk scan.       Add message | Report    Emsyboo   Wed 13-Feb-13 10:38:37    I agree Fairy you were unlucky for it not to be picked up although they nearly missed it with me at 20 weeks as sonographer was pleased to be giving us good news but we asked about the placenta as she was finishing since I had problems last time which is when she double checked and spotted it. I had lots of bleeds which would have meant it would probably be picked up but you never know as I wouldn't have had extra scans if it wasn't for the early diagnosis. The consultant I saw also said bleeding is more likely with a c section but if they had known they would have been more prepared.       Add message | Report    kitkatsz23   Wed 13-Feb-13 10:45:08    I'm watching it with interest as I am currently pregnant with DC1 and have placenta previa. I would recommend you to go back to the hospital and request an appointment with the consultant. Could you request to see the same dr who did the section? They should have given you advise on future pregnancies after your c-section and placenta previa. I've been told the section scar will increase the risk of having placenta previa again.       Add message | Report     Stangirl    Wed 13-Feb-13 18:04:17    I have had a very similar experience to you and had a follow up discussion with my consultant about subsequent pg/births. I had a placenta previa that moved with DC1 - followed by a very straight-forward ELCS. 2nd pg I had an ELCS but had an undiagnosed placenta accreta (placenta had grown through uterus via thinned area of c section) that had been missed on scans. I bled out 5 pints of blood/had blood transfusion/nearly had to have a hysterectomy to stem bleeding but didn't in the end. My DP was told "don't worry she's now got 4 consultants in with her" - this did nowt to reassure him. At one point they lost a needle in me and the surgeon called for an Xray machine with the immortal line "bring it down but I've got bigger things to worry about here than a missing needle". Anyhoo - I asked for a follow up chat with my consultant and he said I'd be good to go again and would be very carefully scanned next time as my chances of it happening again were increased - but it was still unlikely. However my DP has said he was very scared that I was going to die and so we have agreed not to have any more children.       Add message | Report    smileyhappymummy   Wed 13-Feb-13 19:36:58    I didn't have placenta praevia but did have massive pph during emcs - 7 litres due to sepsis and hence blood not clotting. I have just had dd2 - now 4 months but there is a 5 year age gap because neither of us felt ready to ttc sooner. We went back when we were thinking about ttc and saw the consultant again - had same consultant for second delivery - to have a proper talk about it and that really helped. Had a elective section second time which went incredibly smoothly but felt very well looked after as everyone was very well prepared.       Add message | Report    Emsyboo   Wed 13-Feb-13 21:55:57    Stangirl what a terrible experience my friend had acreta and needed a hysterectomy something that scares me about this pregnancy. Glad you are ok! I had PPH as well as smiley with DS they said the risk of this happening again was likely I then had retained placenta which got infected they thought this may have contributed to placenta previa as I had infections for 6 weeks till a D&C which left scarring I imagine a c section on top of this may increase chances again.

(40 Posts)       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Sat 25-Apr-15 21:03:21    I had placenta praevia with my first pregnancy. Big bleeds, frequent stays in hospital, living in fear but made it to 37 and DS arrived safely by emergency caesarean. Now I am 15 weeks pregnant and have been told that the chances of having it again are the same as anyone who has had 1 previous section which is roughly 5% but an terrified. At my 12 week scan the lady wouldn't tell me if it was high or low. She said she wouldn't be able to tell although I have read they can... Am wondering if I could get a private scan to see where it is rather than wait another 5 weeks... I don't feel like I can enjoy being pregnant until I know! But then if it is low then I will just feel worse... If you had It the first time did you get it again?       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Sat 25-Apr-15 21:09:32    I could've written your post! I'm 13 weeks and they wouldn't tell me the position either. She just said it doesn't matter at this stage, which I'm guessing means low, or perhaps I'm reading too much into it?       Add message | Report    Summerdaydreams   Sat 25-Apr-15 21:12:26    I am 20weeks and had pp in my last pregnancy, like you I had heavy bleeds, numerous hospital stays, dd was born prem. I wanted to know the same at my 12 week scan but they couldn't say, I have my 20 week scan next week and I am praying, hoping, wishing they tell me it his high this time around like with my first DC. I have seen a consultant who told me that I am at no greater risk and that my chances of it happening are low. A friend who had it first time around, didn't the second. I will let you know next week how it is for me. Wishing you a smooth pregnancy.       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Sat 25-Apr-15 21:34:51    Fingers crossed for all three of us! When they told me it was low lying at 20 weeks they also said that 90% of the time it moves out of the way. Because it didn't I now deeply mistrust any stats! Even those that say we have a 95% chance of being ok! Silly of me really...       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Sat 25-Apr-15 21:44:56    I'm exactly the same boolean even at my 33 week scan they kept insisting it would move out of the way. Massive bleed 2 weeks later and DS delivered prematurely. It moved somewhere alright...out the exit hole!       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Sat 25-Apr-15 21:56:34    Abbeyroad they kept telling me it would definitely move as well! I realise now how lucky I was to make it to 37 weeks and for DS not to be born prem. Interestingly I read an article that said that 80% of pp cases are male babies! Would love to know why this is!       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Sat 25-Apr-15 22:01:05    Me too! I didn't find out the sex and the midwife said "oh it's going to be a boy, you have praevia" strange it's mainly boys as surely it's chance where the egg implants itself? I'd love to know what the science is with that.       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Sun 26-Apr-15 08:38:02    boolean do you think you might get a private scan? I'm thinking about it, but I don't want to know the sex so if they can't see the placenta it'll be a waste of time as that's all I want to see. I could just wait another month though...undecided Hoping we all have very boring normal pregnancies       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Sun 26-Apr-15 14:32:11    Abbey I keep thinking about it but haven't got round to booking anything and the weeks are ticking by...keep wondering if ignorance is bliss...       Add message | Report    Summerdaydreams   Sun 26-Apr-15 19:35:42    I had a consultant appoint at 16 weeks and she said scanning at this stage would not be accurate, the earliest to wait would be 18 weeks but even that would be on the early side. So not sure if a private scan would tell you much. At the minute I am in the ignorance is bliss camp, I don't know and am having no problems ( at this stage in my last pregnancy, I had already been admitted with heavy bleed), so I am taking that as positive. I don't know what I will do, if they tell me it is low again at this weeks 20 week scan. Interesting about pp and the sex of baby, although I had a girl so don't follow the trend.       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Sun 26-Apr-15 21:39:57    Thanks for that Summer it sounds like its worth waiting until 20 weeks then for accuracy. Hope it all goes well for you       Add message | Report    Parkend   Sun 26-Apr-15 22:28:41    It is to not relevant where the placenta is at 12 weeks, it will often look low as proprtionally it will cover a larger section of the uterus. By 19/20 weeks it is easier to assess. If it looks low then most hospitals will repeat at 34/36 weeks. The placenta does not move as such but imagine drawing a line on a ballon and then blowing the ballon up, it will move. As the uterus expands the placenta will move. That is why it is unlikely you will know if it will be low at term until nearer the time. A private scan at 12 weeks will not help.

I know they don't officially diagnose it until later, but it does matter earlier - I had bleeds at 11 weeks, 19 weeks and 35. So I never made it to the 36 week scan. And I was very lucky compared to many women as DS was premature but he's going to be ok. No bleeds so far though so hoping that's a good sign at the moment - I'd already been in at this point last pregnancy       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Tue 28-Apr-15 16:16:55    Summer do let us know how your scan goes this week... Abbey I think I am going to wait and see. Just keep trying to remember that our chances of having it are the same as anyone who has had 1 csection...which is loads of people       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Tue 28-Apr-15 16:53:21    Yes do let us know Summer. I think this might become a previous praevia support thread! Thanks for that boolean I too was told it's just luck where the egg implants. No bleeds so far so I'm hoping that's a good sign compared to last time. I think I can feel flutters as well, so hoping that means it's not at the front in the scar either. Who knew growing an entire new organ could be so stressful!       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Tue 28-Apr-15 19:27:19    Abbey when is your due date? I have some weddings and other events that are happening in the third trimester that I feel I just can't commit to until I know if I'm going to be on bedrest/bleed alert... Also am operating a no sex policy until I know as well! You can't be too safe!       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Tue 28-Apr-15 21:12:46    I'm 29th October, but on the November antenatal thread as my dates got moved forward. Same here, I've got a wedding in September. I was in hospital at 35 weeks last time and had DS at 36 so even though most people think they've got ages at that stage I'm not so sure. Even if I don't have praevia I think I'll be nervous from the point I had DS anyway. I have told anyone (apart from DH and 2 prem mum friends) I'm pregnant yet either. I was hoping to be able to say all is fine so I don't worry our families too much. Don't know if it'll be obvious before 20 weeks though. I carried small last time but everything is stretched now! When are you due?       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Wed 29-Apr-15 19:10:00    Am due 14th October. Another 4 weeks until I find out. You have done well keeping it from people! I have a noticeable bump already although some of it may be from all the food I ate to stop myself from feeling sick in the first trimester! This lady at work keeps mentioning how I had a 'problem pregnancy! Last time and it's driving me mad as I am trying my best to not focus on it! But as my massive bleed at 32 weeks happened at work they all know!       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Wed 29-Apr-15 20:38:52    Oh gosh, poor you having that at work. I was at home in bed luckily for my big bleed - thought it was my waters until I saw it I have a small age gap, so I think people assume it's baby weight. Which it is, but from a different baby!       Add message | Report    Summerdaydreams   Wed 29-Apr-15 22:44:40    Had my 20 weeks scan and also an internal scan to accurately measure the placenta position. They told me that the placenta structure is normal, posterior but low (minor) . It apparently measures 18mm from the internal OS, Anything under 20mm is considered low. So almost Okish. I admit I had a little cry as I wanted them to say it was high. I am being rescanned at 36 weeks. sonographer seemed to think it would move as my uterus grew. Told me they always move up and not down?? The positive is it isn't partially or completely covering the OS, so does this mean it isn't placenta previa??? And all should be ok??? Anyone? Don't see consultant until 13th. My previous experience was of major previa and I was already bleeding at this stage.       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Thu 30-Apr-15 08:18:03    Ah summer I would have cried as well you poor thing but it's only classed as low by 2mm which sounds really positive and much more likely to move out of the way. Do you think you could ask for another scan before 36 weeks to check the position sooner?       Add message | Report    Summerdaydreams   Thu 30-Apr-15 08:35:18    Due to my previous pregnancy the consultant already said I would have at least one, maybe two additional scans, so I won't have to wait until 36 weeks. Just feel a bit deflated by it all. As I really want to start enjoying it but now feel it is hanging over me again. I know I am in a far better position than last time around, so I probably need to focus on the 'glass half full' and not 'half empty approach. I really want to speak to the consultant but have to wait 2 weeks. And now, I am anaylsing and over analysing everything said yesterday. DH is so much more positive and reckons it will be fine. Grrrrrr bloody placentas!!!!!       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Thu 30-Apr-15 08:49:30    I also just thought that if you hadn't had an internal it might not even have been classed as low as its so borderline?       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Thu 30-Apr-15 09:48:44    Oh no Summer that's rubbish. I never know whether to say or not but mine moved the wrong way. But I did carry small so maybe I never stretched it enough. I don't have my notes but I think I was touching OS at 20 weeks, just under 2cm at 32 weeks, (was back on for birth centre vaginal birth!) then out the exit hole at 35 and had to deliver DS. So I think mine moved about. I remember them saying it was 1 in 200 chance what happened to me though so very rare. It sounds like you're in a better position than last time though, very unlikely to bleed with it a few cm away            Share on Facebook    Share on Twitter    Share on Google +1               Start new thread in this topic | Watch this thread | Flip this thread | Refresh the display      Show 100 messages  Add a message        This is page 1 of 2	(This thread has 40 messages.)

I know it's what Kim Kardashian had. She's just had her second and planning a third. Or do many result in a hysterectomy especially those with emergency c/s , who had no prior knowledge of it.

I had placenta accreta with my first (2.5) that was undiagnosed until delivery and resulted in major blood loss and multiple transfusions. We are al healthy today, but it was scary. My doc doesn't tell you can't get pregnant, but the stories are scary! Reply  Close M  Mommieb4 I had placenta Privia and accreta with my last pregnancy and am now currently 14 weeks pregnant. I am very nervous about how things will go this time. I have several other issues on top of it. Wondering if I will for sure have accreta again or not. Reply  Close s  sfm85 I just had an undiagnosed placenta accreta that was found during my scheduled c section (due to other complications with the placenta). I just had my six week follow up with my OB a few weeks ago and we talked about the risks of getting pregnant again. He said there's about a 30% chance of getting it again but because I've had it once, I would be monitored closely for it with special Ultrasounds and MRI. The risk of having percreta or increta is also about 30%. If they know about it ahead of time they can plan for it but if it's bad enough and depending on the type you could need hysterectomy or bladder repair etc. He said the decision shouldn't be taken lightly and actually suggested we consider surrogacy if we didn't want to take the risk. 30% doesn't seem high at first but this was my first pregnancy with no risk factors and i had complete placenta previa (moved to low lying), vasa previa and placenta accreta. You should meet with your OB and talk about your situation and risks to get a good idea of how risky it is for you. Reply  Close s  sfm85 Also, there are a few good Facebook groups with more people who can share insight. Just search accreta and look in groups.

Placenta previa is a low-lying placenta that covers part or all of the inner opening of the cervix. This can result in heavy bleeding during labor and delivery, which can be dangerous for mother and baby.            How often does placenta previa occur, and what are the symptoms?  Placenta previa occurs in about one in 200 pregnancies. Women who've had a placenta previa in a previous pregnancy have a 4 to 8 percent chance of a recurrence. The most common symptom of placenta previa is painless uterine bleeding.  What causes placenta previa?  The cause of placenta previa is unknown, but like placental abruption, a condition in which the placenta separates from the uterine wall, it's more common among women who smoke, use cocaine, or are over age 35. Women are also at increased risk if they've had previous uterine surgery, including a c-section, a D&C (dilation and curettage, in which the lining of the uterus is scraped) following a miscarriage, an abortion, or if they are carrying twins (or a higher number multiples).  What's the treatment for placenta previa?  Your doctor will do an ultrasound exam to diagnose placenta previa and pinpoint the placenta's location. You'll probably need to stay in the hospital until delivery. If the bleeding stops, which it usually does, your physician will continue to monitor both you and baby. If the bleeding does not stop, or if you go into labor, your doctor will probably suggest a c-section.  If you haven't yet gone into labor but your doctor thinks you may deliver before 34 weeks, she'll probably recommend treatment with corticosteroids. At 36 weeks, if you haven't delivered, she may also suggest a test called amniocentesis to see if your baby's lungs are mature. Provided they are, she will likely suggest a c-section to prevent serious uterine bleeding.  Some women learn during a routine ultrasound that they have a low-lying placenta. More than 90 percent of the time, placenta previa diagnosed in the second trimester corrects itself by term. You don't need to restrict your activities or undergo any treatment. Your doctor will probably recommend another ultrasound at about 28 weeks, though, to make sure the placenta has moved away from the cervix. In the unlikely event that it hasn't, she may recommend that you cut back on activities and rest in bed.  The information on this Web site is designed for educational purposes only.

		            August 03, 2014   Fox News       Facebook 0  Twitter 0  livefyre  Email  Print         “It didn’t hit me that this could potentially be problematic,” Courtney Nowak, of Staten Island, NY remembers thinking. She had just had a routine sonogram at 13 weeks and her doctor had drawn her a picture to show her that her placenta wasn’t where it should be— it was now covering her cervix.  She told Nowak that the condition, placenta previa, was common, it was nothing to worry about. As the pregnancy progressed, the placenta could move, she assured her.  Nevertheless, Nowak was told to avoid heavy lifting, vigorous exercise and sexual intercourse. And if she had any bleeding or pain, she had to call her doctor immediately.  After researching the condition, Nowak became a little nervous, especially since she was over 35 and already considered high-risk.  “I was aware that things could happen,” she said.  Fortunately, at her 30-week sonogram, Nowak and her husband found out her placenta had moved. And five months ago, Nowak gave birth to a healthy baby girl.  What is placenta previa? One out of 200 pregnancies are affected by placenta previa, a condition in which the placenta covers part or all of the opening of the cervix , according to Dr. James Bernasko, an OB/GYN in the division of maternal-fetal medicine at Stony Brook University Hospital in New York.  “When you have a placenta that’s lying over the cervix or very close to the cervix when labor begins, it can cause a lot of bleeding and that endangers the health and sometimes the life of the fetus and the mother,” he said.  What’s more, a recent study in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology found that women with placenta previa who had previous births had a two-fold increased chance of delivering a low birth weight baby.  Experts aren’t sure why placenta previa occurs, although one theory is that upon implantation, the embryo tries to go to a part of the uterus where it thinks it will get the most nourishment. For example, if there is a scar in the uterus or the blood supply isn’t optimal, the embryo will implant somewhere else.  Sometimes that somewhere else may be close to the cervix,” Bernasko said.  Risk factors for placenta previa include:  • Smoking (before pregnancy or during) • Maternal age (over 40) • Abnormally shaped uterus • Several previous pregnancies • African American or Asian American race • Cocaine use • Previous pregnancy with placenta previa • One or more previous cesarean sections • Uterine surgery or abortion  Placenta previa is usually diagnosed at the 20-week sonogram, and since many women can have a “silent” placenta previa— one without any bleeding— women should have regular sonograms, Bernasko said.  The good news is that the placenta usually moves upward as the pregnancy progresses and about 90 percent of placenta previa cases will resolve by the time the woman is full term.  In women who have no bleeding, some providers will say it’s not necessary to make any changes. Other doctors may advise women avoid strenuous activity, exercise and sexual intercourse, or order bed rest.  “The recommendations that providers give vary considerably,” Bernasko said.  If you have bleeding, your provider will likely put you on bed rest. If the bleeding stops, you may either have to restrict your activity or be on bed rest at home or in the hospital, depending on how heavy the bleeding was.  If your pregnancy is at 37 weeks or more and you have very heavy bleeding, your provider will recommend a C-section. If it’s earlier than 37 weeks and the bleeding is life-threatening to you or your baby, a C-section is necessary as well.  However, most providers will recommend a C-section at 37 weeks and would prefer that you don’t wait until your due date to do so—  as you get closer, you’re more likely to go into labor on your own, which could turn into an emergency.  “It may be a bit of cautious recommendation, but it’s only because we don’t know exactly when the woman’s going to go into labor,” Bernasko said.

Im now pregnant with my second child, and I would like to know if anyone else has been pregnant after going through placenta previa, and whether you had it with your second child, as I have heard from my OB that the chance of my experiencing it again are high.      Back to top                #2   bubblebear    Posted 22 February 2010 - 10:55 PM    Hi there, I had a grade 4 placenta previa with my first pregnancy, hospitalised from 28 weeks until delivery at 37 weeks. My second pregnancy I was very scared of it happening again, however it was all clear and my pregnancy progressed well. This time I didn't deliver until 41+2 weeks, I felt VERY overdue after last time! Keep in mind that anyone who has had a c-section has increased risk of this, however I don't think it's that big. Best of luck       Back to top                #3   5lilcherubs    Posted 25 February 2010 - 09:17 AM    Hi Bubblebear, congrats on your pregnancy how exciting :0) I just wanted to wish you good luck and i will be stalking this thread to find out what other ppl have gone through. I am currently in hospital (have been in here from 28 weeks also) and fingers crossed will get to 37 - 38 weeks. Its the first pregnancy that i have suffered grade 4 PP, and its really scary!!! I think i have read that the more c-sections you have the greater the risk, this will be my 5th so it makes sense. Congrats once again, and good luck, fingers crossed you will NOT have any issues with your placenta with this pregnancy,      Back to top                #4   just roses    Posted 25 February 2010 - 09:55 PM    What does your OB consider to be a high risk? I've been looking into this for a friend who has also experienced Grade 4 placenta previa. One medical journal I found stated the risk of a subsequent PP as being about 4 or 5%. So not that high really. Although other resources stated the risk higher, but still under 1 in 10. And just because you're at higher risk the second time around, does this necessarily mean you're at high risk of a Grade 4 PP again? Or just regular placenta previa, which might resolve itself during your pregnancy? I'd be interested to know if people have answers to these questions, as it can be difficult to find accurate info online. I hope it all works out well for you!

My second child I was fine. I even tried for a VBAC (it did fail) and ended up having her at 41 weeks. Little bugger was too comfy, I think. Good luck      Back to top                #6  Guest_purplemonkey_*   Posted 25 February 2010 - 10:58 PM    I had grade 4 placenta praevia with my last pregnancy and was hospitalised from 31 weeks, ending in a stillbirth at 33w6d. I am too early in this pregnancy to know yet if i have PP again... I have everything crossed that i wont. I thought the risk of having it again was pretty low.      Back to top                #7   4boys4me    Posted 08 March 2010 - 11:39 AM    Hi there.. I had Placenta Praevia Grade 4 with my second pregnancy. Had 3 massive bleeds at 23wks, 32wks and 38wks resulting in a week hospital stay each time. I was very lucky to be allowed to go home after the each bleed but I lived very close to hospital.. C section at 39 wks. I too worried I'd get it again but the chances are slim..It's just one of those things!!

My doctor just told me today that my placenta is low or that I have placenta previa.  I didn't really know enough to ask more questions about it then, but she mentioned that I have complete placenta previa.  I'll be getting an ultrasound around 32 weeks, and if things haven't changed by then, I'll most likely have to give birth by C-section.  I was really worried about having to get a C-section, but after reading up on placenta previa and the possible complications that could occur with the weeks leading up to birth and birthing itself, I'm really scared!  I just want my little girl to be ok. Reading things like possible premature birth, bleeding more and requiring a blood transfusion at birth, the placenta not separating easily after birth, etc. is scaring me so much I stopped researching.  The doctor did say that 90% of these cases resolve themselves i.e. as the uterus grows, the placenta's position may shift and move out of the way from the cervix and the woman can give birth naturally.  But since my placenta is implanted completely across my cervix at this point, I'm not too positive...  Did anyone have complete placenta previa in a previous pregnancy and was still able to give birth naturally because the problem resolved itself? I really need some good news right now                       Status: Offline                       Jun 28th, 2012, 15:40 PM   2       momto4girls    Mum (Mom)  Active BnB Member        Join Date: Sep 2010  Posts: 258        I had a complete placenta previa with my 4th pregnancy.  In the end, it moved up and I was able to have a completely natural delivery. I too was worried about a c-section.  Baby #5 was born by emergency c-section, and the actual procedure itself wasn't too bad, though the recovery was a lot harder.

I don't know if I'm more worried about the C-section or if I'm more worried about the complications that might arise from the previa itself...  There are a variety of reasons for needing a C-section so I guess it's the latter that scares me                   Status: Offline                   Jun 29th, 2012, 07:38 AM   4       Courtfrog    Pregnant (Expecting)  Active BnB Member        Join Date: Jan 2012  Location: Oklahoma  Posts: 398        Hey. I was so stressed early on bc we flu out I had complete previa at 12 weeks (bleeding) it was still complete thought atleast 24 weeks.. But we found it moved I still have anterior placenta but I am safe to deliver vaginally! My dr told me not to worry unless it was still previa at 35 weeks. 90% of woman it will move                  Status: Offline                               Jun 29th, 2012, 08:12 AM   5       velirya    Mum (Mom)  Active BnB Member        Join Date: Feb 2012  Location: Sunderland  Posts: 364        i had placenta praevia with my 1st, they only actually found out while i was in labour! i lost an awful lot of blood (i had severe anaemia aswell btw) and they offered me a blood transfusion. i was shattered and grumpy by then so i refused and they let me home with iron tablets.  my second labour was almost perfect! im hoping it will be the same for me this time   xx                  Status: Offline                   Jun 29th, 2012, 13:13 PM   6       Mia Evan    Pregnant (Expecting)  Active BnB Member        Join Date: Aug 2011  Posts: 504          Quote:     Originally Posted by velirya    i had placenta praevia with my 1st, they only actually found out while i was in labour! i lost an awful lot of blood (i had severe anaemia aswell btw) and they offered me a blood transfusion. i was shattered and grumpy by then so i refused and they let me home with iron tablets.  my second labour was almost perfect! im hoping it will be the same for me this time   xx     I can't believe they didn't find out till you were in labour..that must have been scary! I'm glad to hear your second labour was a much better experience.  Did you have placenta previa again the second time around? I read somewhere that if it happened in a previous pregnancy, it's more likely to happen again in a future pregnancy?

My doctor just told me to take it easy and no intercourse; is that the same as pelvic rest?  I'm crossing my fingers that it's good news the next time our doctors check!

Methods  Retrospective cohort study of 399,674 women who gave birth to a singleton first and second baby between April 2000 and February 2009 in England. Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust the estimates for maternal age, ethnicity, deprivation, placenta previa at first birth, inter-birth interval and pregnancy complications. In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis of the reported results in peer-reviewed articles since 1980.   Results  The rate of placenta previa at second birth for women with vaginal first births was 4.4 per 1000 births, compared to 8.7 per 1000 births for women with CS at first birth. After adjustment, CS at first birth remained associated with an increased risk of placenta previa (odds ratio = 1.60; 95% CI 1.44 to 1.76). In the meta-analysis of 37 previously published studies from 21 countries, the overall pooled random effects odds ratio was 2.20 (95% CI 1.96-2.46). Our results from the current study is consistent with those of the meta-analysis as the pooled odds ratio for the six population-based cohort studies that analyzed second births only was 1.51 (95% CI 1.39-1.65).   Conclusions  There is an increased risk of placenta previa in the subsequent pregnancy after CS delivery at first birth, but the risk is lower than previously estimated. Given the placenta previa rate in England and the adjusted effect of previous CS, 359 deliveries by CS at first birth would result in one additional case of placenta previa in the next pregnancy.  Keywords Cesarean Section Birth Interval Placenta Previa Hospital Episode Statistics Previous Cesarean Section  Background Placenta previa can have serious adverse consequences for both mother and baby, including an increased risk of maternal and neonatal mortality[ 1 – 3 ], fetal growth restriction and preterm delivery[ 4 ], antenatal and intrapartum hemorrhage[ 5 – 7 ], and women may require a blood transfusion[ 8 ] or even an emergency hysterectomy. It is a relatively uncommon condition, with an overall incidence in England of 6.3 per 1000 births[ 9 ], but incidence rates are higher among women with advanced maternal age, multiple gestation, high parity, or who smoke or use illegal drugs[ 10 ]. The risk of placenta previa is also reported to be higher among women with previous uterine surgery, including cesarean section[ 11 ]. In England, cesarean sections constituted 25% of National Health Service (NHS) deliveries during 2010, and the rates have been rising for both primary and emergency CS[ 9 ]. The risk of placenta previa in a pregnancy after a CS delivery has been reported to be between 1.5 and 6 times higher than after a vaginal delivery. A meta-analysis of studies published before 2000 of previous CS as a risk factor for placenta previa found an overall odds ratio of 2.7 [ 10 ]. However, the overall odds ratio was lower in studies that had better adjustment for confounders[ 10 ]. A recent study from the USA that was not included in the meta-analysis, and which used a population-based cohort of 11 million pregnancies, found an adjusted odds ratio of 1.8 for all pregnancies[ 12 ] and an adjusted odds ratio of 1.5 for second births only[ 13 ]. Evidence about the risk of placenta previa following a previous CS in UK women is limited to results published 25 years ago[ 14 ]. We used the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), an administrative database of all admissions to NHS hospitals in England, to define a population-based cohort and to quantify the association between CS at first birth and the risk of developing placenta previa in the subsequent pregnancy. We also performed a meta-analysis of the reported results in peer-reviewed articles since 1980.  Methods  The cohort study  We used the HES dataset for nine financial years from April 2000 to February 2009 for the cohort study. In HES, individual patients are allocated the same identifier for each episode of care[ 9 ] and core fields contain patient demographics, clinical information, and hospital administrative data. Diagnostic information is coded using the International Classification of Diseases 10 th revision (ICD10) and operative procedures are coded using the UK Office for Population Censuses and Surveys classification, 4 th revision (OPCS4). For delivery episodes, the HES dataset also has an additional "maternity tail" which includes parity, birth weight, gestational age, method of delivery, and pregnancy outcome. However, not all records that describe a delivery episode have data entered into this tail.  All women who gave birth to a singleton first and second baby from 1 st April 2000 to 28 th February 2009 were eligible for inclusion. A delivery was defined as an episode of care that included a relevant OPCS4 code (R17-R25) or ICD10 code (O80-O84) for the mode of delivery, or a maternity tail with a valid date of birth for a baby. Deliveries were coded as a cesarean section by the relevant OPCS4 codes (R17 for primary CS or R18 for emergency CS) or if OPCS4 codes were not available, by the delivery method specified in the maternity tail. If neither of the sets of codes were available (0.5% of delivery episodes), vaginal delivery was assumed.  We confined the analysis to NHS trusts (acute hospital organizations) that had a reasonable level of data completeness on parity, defined as having parity information in the maternity tail for more than 50% of the delivery episodes in at least seven of the nine years covered in the study. NHS trusts were included if the proportion of nulliparous women in that trust was between 25% and 55% (which corresponded to the overall rate in England and Wales ± 15%[ 15 ]) to remove hospitals with poor data quality. Women were allocated to the NHS trusts that existed in February 2009 to take account of previous organizational mergers.  We used the HES patient identifier to trace the second births of those women who had been recorded as nulliparous and who had singleton first births in identified NHS trusts. Diagnostic information for the second birth was taken from the core HES diagnosis fields. Cases of placenta previa were identified by the ICD10 code O44. Pregnancy complications were identified using ICD10 codes O10, O11, O16 for pre-existing hypertension; O13 for gestational hypertension; O14 and O15 for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia; O24.4 and O24.9 for gestational diabetes; and O40 for polyhydramnios.  The effect of previous CS delivery on the risk of placenta previa was estimated using unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios. Multiple logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios and the risk of placenta previa adjusted for maternal age (<20, 20-29, 30-39, ≥40), maternal ethnicity (White, Asian, Black and Other), deprivation, inter-birth interval (<1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, ≥5 years), placenta previa at first birth and indicators for pregnancy complications (i.e., pre-existing hypertension, gestational hypertension including pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, gestational diabetes and polyhydramnios). Deprivation was measured using the 2004 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) rank of the English Super Output Areas. The IMD combines a range of economic, social and housing indicators into a single deprivation score for each small area in England [ 16 ]. Categories were defined by partitioning the ranks of the 32,480 areas into quintiles (0-20th percentiles, 20-40th percentiles, etc.) and labeled 1 (least deprived) to 5 (most deprived). Women were allocated a category based on their region of residence. We calculated the number needed to harm using the adjusted estimates from the logistic regression[ 17 ].  We examined whether the effect of CS on placenta previa rates was related to the level of other risk factors, such as whether the effect of CS on the placenta previa risk differed between younger and older women. The significance of an interaction term between previous CS and other risk factors was assessed with the likelihood ratio test. All analyses were done in Stata/SE 10.0.  The study is exempt from IRB and UK NREC approval as it involved analysis of an existing dataset comprising information on delivery episodes for women who cannot be identified directly or through the HES patient numbers linked to them.   Review of literature and meta-analysis  We searched Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Cinahl and the Cochrane Library for the period January 1980 to January 2011 to identify studies that examined the relationship between previous cesarean section and placenta previa. The keywords of "placenta previa"/"placenta praevia" and "cesarean"/"caesarean" were searched in MESH headings, titles and abstracts to locate relevant articles. We also checked the references of the selected articles and previous reviews. We only included articles written in English and limited the search to peer-reviewed journals.  We selected studies in which placenta previa was diagnosed or recorded at third trimester or during delivery. If two or more relevant articles used the same data source in overlapping years, we selected the study that adjusted the effect size by age or parity, and if there is still replication, the study with the larger sample size.  Estimated log odds ratios and standard errors of log odds ratios were calculated from raw data presented in the included papers. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, and summarized the degree of consistency across the study results using the I 2 measure, the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance[ 18 ]. Meta-regression was used to assess whether the effect size was associated with date of publication, study design (cohort vs. case-control), source of data (population vs. hospital based), method of diagnosis of placenta previa (confirmed at delivery vs. recorded at hospital or birth registry databases), and whether the results were adjusted for age and parity. We also did a subgroup analysis of population-based cohort studies focusing on the association between first-birth cesarean delivery and second-birth placenta previa and compared the magnitude of this association with the results from our cohort.   Results  The cohort study  Between April 2000 and February 2009, there were 4,987,245 singleton delivery episodes in 146 English NHS trusts. It was necessary to exclude 76 NHS trusts due to incomplete parity information. This left 2,484,468 (49.8%) singleton delivery episodes in 70 NHS trusts. Of these, 958,882 (38.6%) women were nulliparous and 399,674 had had a second singleton birth by February 2009. The overall rate of placenta previa for the cohort at first birth was 3.6 and at second birth was 5.3 per 1000 births. The proportion of women who had undergone a CS at first birth was 21.5%. The median birthweight at second birth was 3448 grams (Interquartile range: 3110 -3780 grams).  The rate of placenta previa at second birth was 4.4 per 1000 births for women with vaginal delivery at first birth and 8.7 for women with CS at first birth (unadjusted odds ratio = 1.88). We found that this increased risk of placenta previa persisted after other risk factors were taken into account (adjusted odds ratio = 1.60) (Table 1 ). The strongest association between a maternal characteristic and the risk of placenta previa was for women who had placenta previa at first birth (adjusted odds ratio = 4.77). Women with advanced maternal age, with polyhydramnios, with very short birth intervals of less than one year, and with birth intervals of more than four years also had higher placenta previa risks. Women with pre-existing hypertension had lower placenta previa risks. Using these estimates, we expect that 359 CS deliveries at first birth would result in one additional case of placenta previa at second birth.

Review of literature and meta-analysis  We identified 2077 articles of which 74 were of potential relevance to merit a full-text review. 41 articles were selected for inclusion in the review, and an additional eight articles were retrieved from reference lists [ 8 , 12 , 13 , 19 – 64 ]. Among the 49 articles, 12 used overlapping datasets with other studies and were excluded. Study characteristics are presented in Table 2 and the meta-analysis results from the selected 37 studies are given in Figure 1 . The overall pooled random effects odds ratio was 2.20 (95% CI 1.96-2.46). The spread of the odds ratios reported in the individual studies were larger than can be expected by chance alone (I 2 = 87.6%).

In bi-variate meta-regressions of various study characteristics on the reported odds ratios (Table 3 ), significantly smaller effect size of previous cesarean section on placenta previa was associated with recent studies (p = 0.04), population-based studies (p = 0.03), and those that adjusted for age and parity (p = 0.04). The odds ratios reported in the individual studies were not associated with type of study design (cohort vs. case-control) and method of diagnosis of placenta previa (data record in database vs. confirmation at delivery). Heterogeneity across studies remained in subgroup analyses by study design, setting and timing of diagnosis of placenta previa. Results from studies that adjusted for age and parity were less heterogeneous (I 2 = 52.3%) and the variation in the results from studies that analyzed first two births were due to chance alone (I 2 = 0%).

The subgroup of studies analyzing first two births had significantly smaller effect sizes (p = 0.04).   Discussion and Conclusions Among women in England, cesarean section in the first delivery increased the risk of placenta previa in the subsequent delivery by 60%. There was no evidence that the effect of CS on placenta previa rates varied among different groups of women or by the time between two pregnancies. The risks of placenta previa in the second pregnancy also increased by previous placenta previa, advanced maternal age and with birth intervals of less than one year or more than four years. Women with pre-existing hypertension were less likely to have placenta previa. Our results are consistent with recent studies from other countries which typically found odds ratios ranging from 1.4 to 1.7.  Strengths and limitations of this study  This is the first study of placenta previa risk in England using a large, population-based cohort of nearly 400,000 women with first two births. It included half of all singleton NHS hospital deliveries between April 2000 and February 2009. Due to its comprehensive coverage, the HES database is a valuable resource particularly for studies of relatively uncommon conditions such as placenta previa.  In this study we focused only on the effect of a CS delivery at first birth on a second pregnancy. This has two benefits. First, it corresponds to the information typically required by women and obstetricians. For example, the average achieved family size in the UK is approximately two[ 65 ], and so the effect of CS on the second birth is more relevant and accurate than a relative risk based on all pregnancies that may include women with multiple previous CS. Second, estimates based on all pregnancies will be influenced by the proportions of women in 2 nd , 3 rd , 4 th ... pregnancies contained in the study sample. Study samples may also differ in the observed sequences of modes of delivery (for example, due to differences in the propensity of local women to opt for trial of labor). Both factors will reduce the comparability of the estimates across studies. We note that, while there is a wide range of reported relative risks, there is consistency in the effect sizes for studies limited to second births.  It is possible that the women with incomplete data in the maternity tail differed from women included in the study in terms of their characteristics and pregnancy risks. However, the distributions of maternal age and mode of delivery were similar in the episodes with good quality data and omitted episodes, which suggests the risk of selection bias is likely to be small.  The coding of the diagnoses and procedures in administrative databases is potentially inaccurate. However, this is unlikely to have had a major effect in our study because previous studies have reported high-levels of agreement in the coding of cesarean section between administrative databases and medical reviews (kappa > 0.98, where stated) [ 66 – 68 ]. Furthermore, cesarean deliveries were defined using the first three characters of the full 4-character OPCS codes, and broader categories rather than specific codes have been shown to be more reliable[ 69 ].  Just like other population-based studies, we were not able to confirm the grade and severity of placenta previa [ 70 , 71 ]. We were also not able to control for behavioral risk factors, such as maternal smoking and alcohol and drug use, and previous abortions [ 40 , 72 – 74 ]. However, the effects of these risk factors as reported in the literature are small compared to the effect of prior CS, maternal age and parity[ 10 ].   Comparison with other studies  In the previous meta-analysis of 21 studies, the pooled odds ratios of previous CS as a risk factor for placenta previa was found to be 2.7 (95% CI: 2.3 to 3.2). The same study emphasized that the odds ratios were highly variable by setting, study design, sample size and quality. For well-designed studies, the pooled odds ratio was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.7 to 2.2)[ 10 ].  Since this review, a number of studies have been published. 13 of the 37 studies included in our meta-analysis are post-2000 and cover approximately 12 million women. The pooled odds-ratio of 2.2 (95% CI: 2.0 to 2.5) from this meta-analysis is less than the previous review, and reflects the fact that studies with recent publication dates found smaller effect sizes.  Our results for the English cohort are in agreement with other recent, population-based cohorts analyzing second-births only. In the largest population-based cohort study of over 11 million singleton deliveries between 1995 and 2000 in the USA, the adjusted odds ratio of the effect of previous CS on placenta previa at second-birth was 1.5[ 75 ]. Other population-based cohort studies published in the last decade reported adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.4 to 1.7, using Missouri state birth certificates data[ 26 ], Washington state Birth Events data[ 8 ], South Australian Perinatal Data[ 37 ] and Medical Birth Registry of Norway[ 49 ]. A population-based study using data from the Swedish Birth Registry found a higher adjusted odds ratio of 1.8, but this study did not adequately control for risk factors[ 76 ].  A few studies have investigated whether the effect of a previous CS on the risk of placenta previa was modified by other risk factors. The Missouri cohort study found that the effect of CS was 70% higher for women with a second pregnancy within a year after the first delivery[ 26 ]. We did not find evidence to support the hypothesis that inter-pregnancy interval influences the size of effect of first birth CS. Our results are consistent with the Washington state cohort study that found the size of effect of CS was not influenced by maternal age at second birth [ 8 ].   Implications for policy and practice  Cesarean section rates are rising worldwide, and an increase in the longer term complications of CS should be anticipated. The presumed short and long term safety of CS is probably one of the factors underlying both the growing rate of CS and the wide variation in CS rates not accounted for by case mix. There is a need for better understanding of the relative risks associated with vaginal and CS births to support decision-making by mothers and clinicians[ 77 ].  The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health recommends that women with a prior CS should have placental localization in current pregnancy to exclude placenta previa[ 78 ]. If placenta previa is diagnosed, there must be further investigation to exclude placenta accreta, a potentially life-threatening condition. In high-income countries, advanced radiological facilities can help to diagnose this serious condition in antenatal care and to plan delivery in a tertiary care unit. However, in low or middle-income countries, placental conditions may be encountered first time at the CS with its serious consequences and it is imperative that senior and experienced doctors are involved in the care of women with placenta previa from the outset.  Our study has demonstrated that, in addition to women with previous CS, women with advanced maternal age, women with birth intervals of less than one year and women who had a previous placenta previa are at a higher risk of developing placenta previa. Nonetheless, our study suggests that the absolute risk remains small. Women who had placenta previa in their previous pregnancy were at the greatest risk of placenta previa in a current pregnancy but less than 5 in 100 of women with a previous placenta previa would be expected to have this complication again. Clinicians should consider and communicate these factors when counseling their patients using appropriate and simplified risk statistics[ 79 ]. Our study quantifies this risk and provides data that can be used to reassure women, attending for pre-conception counseling clinics or antenatal clinics as well as in pre-operative consent discussions for women undergoing CS.

Placenta previa is a condition in which the placenta lies very low in the uterus and covers all or part of the cervix. The cervix is the opening to the uterus that sits at the top of the vagina.  Placenta previa happens in about 1 in 200 pregnancies. If you have placenta previa early in pregnancy, it usually isn’t a problem. However, it can cause serious bleeding and other complications later in pregnancy.  Normally, the placenta grows into the upper part of the uterus wall, away from the cervix. It stays there until your baby is born. During the last stage of labor , the placenta separates from the wall, and your contractions help push it into the vagina (birth canal). This is also called the afterbirth.  During labor, your baby passes through the cervix into the birth canal. If you have placenta previa, when the cervix begins to efface (thin out) and dilate (open up) for labor, blood vessels connecting the placenta to the uterus may tear. This can cause severe bleeding during labor and birth, putting you and your baby in danger.  What are the symptoms of placenta previa?  The most common symptom of placenta previa is painless bleeding from the vagina during the second half of pregnancy. Call your health care provider right away if you have vaginal bleeding anytime during your pregnancy. If the bleeding is severe, go to the hospital.  Not all women with placenta previa have vaginal bleeding. In fact, about one-third of women with placenta previa don’t have this symptom.  How is placenta previa diagnosed?  An ultrasound usually can find placenta previa and pinpoint the placenta’s location. In some cases, your provider may use a transvaginal ultrasound instead.  Even if you don’t have vaginal bleeding, a routine, second trimester ultrasound may show that you have placenta previa. Don’t be too worried if this happens. Placenta previa found in the second trimester fixes itself in most cases.  How is placenta previa treated?  Treatment depends on how far along you are in your pregnancy, the seriousness of your bleeding and the health of you and your baby. The goal is to keep you pregnant as long as possible. Providers recommend cesarean birth (c-section) for nearly all women with placenta previa to prevent severe bleeding.  If you are bleeding as a result of placenta previa, you need to be closely monitored in the hospital. If tests show that you and your baby are doing well, your provider may give you treatment to try to keep you pregnant for as long as possible.  If you have a lot of bleeding, you may be treated with blood transfusions. A blood transfusion is having new blood put into your body. Your provider also may give you medicines called corticosteroids. These medicines help speed up development of your baby’s lungs and other organs.  Your provider may want you to stay in the hospital until you give birth. If the bleeding stops, you may be able to go home. If you have severe bleeding due to placenta previa at about 34 to 36 weeks of pregnancy, your provider may recommend an immediate c-section.  At 36 to 37 weeks, your provider may suggest an amniocentesis to test the amniotic fluid around your baby to see if her lungs are fully developed. If they are, your provider may recommend an immediate c-section to avoid risks of future bleeding.  At any stage of pregnancy, a c-section may be necessary if you have dangerously heavy bleeding or if you and your baby are having problems.  What causes placenta previa?  We don’t know what causes placenta previa. However, you may be at higher risk for placenta previa if:   You smoke cigarettes .  You use cocaine .  You’re 35 or older.  You’ve been pregnant before.  You’re pregnant with twins, triplets or more .  You’ve had surgery on your uterus, including a c-section or a D&C (dilation and curettage). A D&C is when a doctor removes tissue from the lining of a woman's uterus. Some women have a D&C after a miscarriage .   If you've had placenta previa before, what are your chances of having it again?  If you’ve had placenta previa in a past pregnancy, you have a 2 to 3 in 100 (2 to 3 percent) chance of having it again.  How can you reduce your risk for placenta previa?  We don’t know how to prevent placenta previa. But you may be able to reduce your risk by not smoking and not using cocaine. You also may be able to lower your chances of having placenta previa in future pregnancies by having a c-section only if it’s medically necessary. If your pregnancy is healthy and there are no medical reasons for you to have a c-section, it’s best to let labor begin on its own. The more c-sections you have, the greater your risk of placenta previa.

It is a condition in which the placenta – the flapjack-shaped organ that supplies the fetus with nutrients through the umbilical cord – implants itself unusually low in the uterus, next to or covering your cervix.  If the placenta completely covers the cervical opening it is known as a complete or total placenta previa. If it only partially covers the opening, it is known as a partial placenta previa. If it is within two centimeters of the cervix but not covering it, the condition is known as a marginal placenta previa.  What causes this condition? Placenta previa happens when an embryo implants itself in the lower uterus. Then, when the placenta grows, it may partially or completely cover the cervical opening.  Is placenta previa serious? Placenta previa discovered early in pregnancy is not yet cause for alarm. More often than not, the placenta will fix itself, “migrating” away from the cervix. In actuality, the placenta is attached to the uterus and does not move. But as the uterus grows, the placenta may end up farther from your cervix. In addition, the placenta itself has a general tendency to grow toward the richer blood supply at the top of the uterus.  In fact, only about 10% of women diagnosed with placenta previa at mid-pregnancy still have it when their time comes to deliver. Unfortunately, a total placenta previa is less likely to resolve itself than a marginal or low-lying placenta.  What if the condition persists? Even if you have placenta previa later in pregnancy, it may still move away from the cervical opening. You will need to have a follow-up ultrasound early in your third trimester to check on the condition of the placenta. You may need an examination sooner if you experience any vaginal bleeding.  If your placenta previa persists, you will need to be very careful. You should have regular ultrasounds and be wary of vaginal bleeding. Your doctor will tell you to avoid strenuous activities, heavy lifting, and sex for the rest of your pregnancy.  Bleeding? Bleeding from placenta previa can range from spotting to extremely heavy. This happens when the cervix begins to dilate. It is usually painless and starts without warning. Depending on the severity of the bleeding, you may need to deliver your baby immediately and may also need a blood transfusion.  If you begin bleeding or having contractions, you will have to be hospitalized. Depending on the amount of bleeding, the health of you and your baby, and how far along you are in your pregnancy, the baby may need to be delivered by c-section immediately.  If the bleeding stops and everything is ok, you will likely be sent home. But if the bleeding starts again, you will have to return to the hospital immediately.  What about the delivery? If you still have placenta previa when you are ready to deliver, you will need to have a c-section. Unfortunately having placenta previa may increase your risk for other complications. For instance, you may be at risk of heavy bleeding during and after delivery. Once the baby is delivered the placenta will be delivered and you will be given medications that will cause your uterus to contract. This helps to stop the bleeding from the area of the uterus where the placenta was implanted.  Unfortunately, women who have placenta previa are also more likely to have placenta accrete, a condition where the placenta is implanted too deeply and does not separate easily at delivery. Although placenta accrete only occurs in about one out of 2,500 births overall, your chances of developing this problem are one out of ten if you still have placenta previa when the time comes to deliver. This may cause severe bleeding and a blood transfusion and hysterectomy may be necessary to stop the bleeding.  Who's at risk for placenta previa? For most women, there are no apparent warning signs, but if any of the following risk factors apply to you, your chances may be increased.   You've had placenta previa in an earlier pregnancy  You've had previous c-sections  You're having a multiple pregnancy  You've had uterine surgery  You are a cigarette smoker  You use cocaine   As always, if you ever notice any bleeding or pains in your abdomen, call your doctor right away.

In most pregnancies, the placenta is located at the top or side of the uterus. In placenta previa, the placenta is located low in the uterus. The placenta might partially or completely cover the cervix, as shown here. Placenta previa can cause severe bleeding in the mother before or during delivery. A C-section delivery might be required.     The placenta is a structure that develops inside your uterus during pregnancy, providing oxygen and nutrition to and removing wastes from your baby. The placenta connects to your baby through the umbilical cord. In most pregnancies, the placenta attaches at the top or side of the uterus.  Placenta previa (pluh-SEN-tuh PREH-vee-uh) occurs when a baby's placenta partially or totally covers the mother's cervix — the outlet for the uterus. Placenta previa can cause severe bleeding during pregnancy and delivery.  If you have placenta previa, you might bleed throughout your pregnancy and during your delivery. Your health care provider will recommend avoiding activities that might cause contractions, including having sex, douching, using tampons, or engaging in activities that can increase your risk of bleeding, such as running, squatting, and jumping.  You'll need a C-section to deliver your baby if the placenta previa doesn't resolve.      Symptoms Bright red vaginal bleeding without pain during the second half of pregnancy is the main sign of placenta previa. Some women also have contractions.  In many women diagnosed with placenta previa early in their pregnancies, the placenta previa resolves. As the uterus grows, it might increase the distance between the cervix and the placenta. The more the placenta covers the cervix and the later in the pregnancy that it remains over the cervix, the less likely it is to resolve.  When to see a doctor  If you have vaginal bleeding during your second or third trimester, call your doctor right away. If the bleeding is severe, seek emergency medical care.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes The exact cause of placenta previa is unknown.  Risk factors Placenta previa is more common among women who:   Have had a baby  Have scars on the uterus, such as from previous surgery, including cesarean deliveries, uterine fibroid removal, and dilation and curettage  Had placenta previa with a previous pregnancy  Are carrying more than one fetus  Are age 35 or older  Are of a race other than white  Smoke  Use cocaine   Complications If you have placenta previa, your health care provider will monitor you and your baby to reduce the risk of these serious complications:   Bleeding. Severe, possibly life-threatening vaginal bleeding (hemorrhage) can occur during labor, delivery or in the first few hours after delivery.  Preterm birth. Severe bleeding may prompt an emergency C-section before your baby is full term.

[Article in Serbian] Jovanović B 1 , Dordević M . Author information 1 Ginekolosko-akuserska klinika, Klinicko-bolnicki centar "Kragujevac", Kragujevac. Abstract INTRODUCTION: This is a case report of maternal and fetal death due to major hemorrhage of a patients with placenta previa/accreta in a concealed pregnancy. Bleeding is the leading cause of maternal mortality in obstetrics. Postpartum hemorrhage is the most important cause of maternal death. Placenta accreta is a severe complication involving an abnormal attachment to the uterine wall so that it cannot be easily separated from the uterus. CASE REPORT: Due to the fact that one part of the placenta is partially detached, while the other part has grown into the uterus, postpartum hemorrhage may occur with lethal outcome, unless the mother is hospitalized. Fetal death was caused by severe meconium aspiration. One way to prevent such complications is to support legal abortions.

Placenta previa is a problem of pregnancy in which the placenta grows in the lowest part of the womb (uterus) and covers all or part of the opening to the cervix . The placenta grows during pregnancy and feeds the developing baby. The cervix is the opening to the birth canal. Causes   During pregnancy, the placenta moves as the womb stretches and grows. It is very common for the placenta to be low in the womb in early pregnancy. But as the pregnancy continues, the placenta moves to the top of the womb. By the third trimester, the placenta should be near the top of the womb, so the cervix is open for delivery. Sometimes, the placenta partly or completely covers the cervix. This is called a previa. There are different forms of placenta previa: Marginal: The placenta is next to the cervix but does not cover the opening. Partial: The placenta covers part of the cervical opening. Complete: The placenta covers all of the cervical opening. Placenta previa occurs in 1 out of 200 pregnancies. It is more common in women who have: An abnormally shaped uterus Had many pregnancies in the past Had multiple pregnancies, such as twins or triplets Scarring on the lining of the uterus due to a history of surgery, C-section, or abortion In vitro fertilization Women who smoke, use cocaine, or have their children at an older age may also have an increased risk. Symptoms   The main symptom of placenta previa is sudden bleeding from the vagina . Some women also have cramps. The bleeding often starts near the end of the second trimester or beginning of the third trimester. Bleeding may be severe and life threatening. It may stop on its own, but can start again days or weeks later. Labor sometimes starts within several days of the heavy bleeding. Sometimes, bleeding may not occur until after labor starts. Exams and Tests   Your health care provider can diagnose this condition with a pregnancy ultrasound. Treatment   Your provider will carefully consider the risk of bleeding against early delivery of your baby. After 36 weeks, delivery of the baby may be the best treatment. Nearly all women with placenta previa need a C-section . If the placenta covers all or part of the cervix, a vaginal delivery can cause severe bleeding. This can be deadly to both the mother and baby. If the placenta is near or covering part of the cervix, your provider may recommend: Reducing your activities Bed rest Pelvic rest, which means no sex, no tampons, and no douching Nothing should be placed in the vagina. You may need to stay in the hospital so your health care team can closely monitor you and your baby. Other treatments you may receive: Blood transfusions Medicines to prevent early labor Medicines to help pregnancy continue to at least 36 weeks Shot of special medicine called Rhogam if your blood type is Rh-negative Steroid shots to help the baby's lungs mature An emergency C-section may be done if the bleeding is heavy and cannot be controlled. Outlook (Prognosis)   The biggest risk is severe bleeding that can be life threatening to the mother and baby. If you have severe bleeding, your baby may need to be delivered early, before major organs, such as the lungs, have developed. When to Contact a Medical Professional   Call your provider if you have vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. Placenta previa can be dangerous to both you and your baby.

Placenta previa is a condition in which the placenta lies very low in the uterus and covers all or part of the cervix. The cervix is the opening to the uterus that sits at the top of the vagina.  Placenta previa happens in about 1 in 200 pregnancies. If you have placenta previa early in pregnancy, it usually isn’t a problem. However, it can cause serious bleeding and other complications later in pregnancy.  Normally, the placenta grows into the upper part of the uterus wall, away from the cervix. It stays there until your baby is born. During the last stage of labor , the placenta separates from the wall, and your contractions help push it into the vagina (birth canal). This is also called the afterbirth.  During labor, your baby passes through the cervix into the birth canal. If you have placenta previa, when the cervix begins to efface (thin out) and dilate (open up) for labor, blood vessels connecting the placenta to the uterus may tear. This can cause severe bleeding during labor and birth, putting you and your baby in danger.  What are the symptoms of placenta previa?  The most common symptom of placenta previa is painless bleeding from the vagina during the second half of pregnancy. Call your health care provider right away if you have vaginal bleeding anytime during your pregnancy. If the bleeding is severe, go to the hospital.  Not all women with placenta previa have vaginal bleeding. In fact, about one-third of women with placenta previa don’t have this symptom.  How is placenta previa diagnosed?  An ultrasound usually can find placenta previa and pinpoint the placenta’s location. In some cases, your provider may use a transvaginal ultrasound instead.  Even if you don’t have vaginal bleeding, a routine, second trimester ultrasound may show that you have placenta previa. Don’t be too worried if this happens. Placenta previa found in the second trimester fixes itself in most cases.  How is placenta previa treated?  Treatment depends on how far along you are in your pregnancy, the seriousness of your bleeding and the health of you and your baby. The goal is to keep you pregnant as long as possible. Providers recommend cesarean birth (c-section) for nearly all women with placenta previa to prevent severe bleeding.  If you are bleeding as a result of placenta previa, you need to be closely monitored in the hospital. If tests show that you and your baby are doing well, your provider may give you treatment to try to keep you pregnant for as long as possible.  If you have a lot of bleeding, you may be treated with blood transfusions. A blood transfusion is having new blood put into your body. Your provider also may give you medicines called corticosteroids. These medicines help speed up development of your baby’s lungs and other organs.  Your provider may want you to stay in the hospital until you give birth. If the bleeding stops, you may be able to go home. If you have severe bleeding due to placenta previa at about 34 to 36 weeks of pregnancy, your provider may recommend an immediate c-section.  At 36 to 37 weeks, your provider may suggest an amniocentesis to test the amniotic fluid around your baby to see if her lungs are fully developed. If they are, your provider may recommend an immediate c-section to avoid risks of future bleeding.  At any stage of pregnancy, a c-section may be necessary if you have dangerously heavy bleeding or if you and your baby are having problems.  What causes placenta previa?  We don’t know what causes placenta previa. However, you may be at higher risk for placenta previa if:   You smoke cigarettes .  You use cocaine .  You’re 35 or older.  You’ve been pregnant before.  You’re pregnant with twins, triplets or more .  You’ve had surgery on your uterus, including a c-section or a D&C (dilation and curettage). A D&C is when a doctor removes tissue from the lining of a woman's uterus. Some women have a D&C after a miscarriage .   If you've had placenta previa before, what are your chances of having it again?  If you’ve had placenta previa in a past pregnancy, you have a 2 to 3 in 100 (2 to 3 percent) chance of having it again.  How can you reduce your risk for placenta previa?  We don’t know how to prevent placenta previa. But you may be able to reduce your risk by not smoking and not using cocaine. You also may be able to lower your chances of having placenta previa in future pregnancies by having a c-section only if it’s medically necessary. If your pregnancy is healthy and there are no medical reasons for you to have a c-section, it’s best to let labor begin on its own. The more c-sections you have, the greater your risk of placenta previa.

I asked my OB about this same thing, and he said..its the luck of the draw. With a prior C-section, the risk I believe is higher, but he says every pregnancy is diff, and you could have PP  (previous poster) your first preg, and not have it your 2nd.. but again, its luck :( It scares me as well, to take the risk again.. and then being afraid it will be worse a 2nd time around.. the whole thing, just sucks.    --  Alissa- baby center  community moderator  Mom to my 3 sweet  BOYS  (Sept 2010, March 2013 & March 2016)  Complete placenta previa,  2x ISO Anti-D mom             Reply            Report this comment        1                     alimeredith    Posted 08/31/2010      I don't have a lot of research to back this up, but I had a cpp with my first but  a great outcome.

I was also told 2 years between births and DD  (dear daughter) will be 21 months when DS  (dear son) is born in January so we are just shy of our 2 years.

Charliemw    Posted 08/07/2016       Hello ladies! So..I had undiagnosed placenta accreta with my last pregnancy. I had previa so was high risk but it still wasn't caught. Anywho.. everything after labor was horrible..emergency surgery..massive blood loss..4 day stay in the ICU..etc.. I am now 28 weeks and my doctor doesn't seem that concerned, and sent me to the same specialist that missed it last time. The specialist did one ultrasound and casually tells me everything's fine and I have a less than 1% chance of having it again. Everything I've read online says chances of it reoccurring are much higher than that. Should I be worried? Has anyone had it once and then not had it in future pregnancies?

Thank you for the response! The fb pages were very helpful! I nagged my doc into sending me to a different specialist, and I plan on asking for one. And when I asked if a team would be prepared the response was..this is a good hospital, you'll be fine... =/               Reply            Report this comment        1                     MelEricBabyD    Posted 10/19/2016      I will be interested in any responses to this as well. I had an undiagnosed accreta with my first child. My experience went as well as I could hope for. My labor was very fast (about 2 hours from first contraction to delivery). It was an unmedicated vaginal delivery with a midwife. It was in the middle of the night in a small but good hospital. After delivery, the placenta would not budge. It was very painful when they attempted manual removal, but it still would not come out. I went to the OR where they put me to sleep and did a manual removal of the placenta (during which I hemmorhaged and required blood transfusion) followed by a D & C. I'm so lucky to still have my uterus, and I'm so grateful to the amazing doctors and nurses who kept their wits about them and saved my life and fertility.  The only risk factor that I had is a prior D&C. I did not have placenta previa or any prior c-sections. It seems this type of case is quite rare.  I'm now 9 weeks pregnant and very concerned that it will happen again. My MFM has already started seeing me, although there is nothing to see in regards to the placenta yet. He believes that the chances of reoccurence are slim, but is very cautious. He has recommended that I change delivery hospitals just in case it goes undetected again. Not that my medical team was in any way inadequate, but just for the access to facilities and specialist at all times. I am very sad to deliver at another hospital (my father is a retired OB from my current hospital), but I will do what is best for my health. I believe I will have ultrasounds at 13 weeks, 18 weeks, early 20s, and early 30s to inspect placenta. I believe he also said we can do an MRI for further imaging if needed.  I'm not sure how many people will be posting here, but I just wanted to share my experience, and I will try to update as I progress through my pregnancy. I hope to put some information out there regarding reoccurence of accreta when it was not related to scar tissue from c-sections or related to previa. I've been a member of the facebook support groups for a while, and I have enjoyed the information.

WowAMomToThree    Posted 09/27/2012      Backstory: diagnosed with CPP at 14 weeks. Put on pelvic rest immediately and bedrest at 20 weeks once U/S  (ultrasound) shown it had not moved. At 28 weeks had a minor bleed, hospitalized for 1 week with no bleeding in hospital. Same night I was released (now 29 weeks) had another minor bleed but was more serious the previous bleed. Was hospitalized for another week with no bleeding again while in the hospital. Received my steroid shots for the baby's lungs, signed the hysterectomy paperwork that time and everything. Was released and put on strict bedrest. Made it to 32 weeks and went into early labor with a major bleed. Made it to ER by squad and was put thru an emergency c/s to save both of us. He was deprived of some oxygen and I was severely anemic for a year after birth. Long story shortened the best I could. DS  (dear son) was born at 4.3 lbs and was in NICU for 3 weeks. He was on a CPAP for a week but he actually did amazingl6 well for how early he was and was a healthy boy even after being without oxygen for a period of time. Now I'm pregnant again. I swore not to carry again because of the chance of me getting CPP is higher bc I have had it once. But I did and I am truly blessed to be able to have my 3rd child (last pregnancy was my 2nd) but I'm scared to death. I will be 29 weeks on Saturday and this is around the time period everything happened last time. I had an ultrasound 6 weeks ago and my placenta was low lying but not previa. I get another tomorrow to make sure it has not moved lower. I'm nervous, worried, scared but at the same time trying not to think so much. I'm wondering how other many moms decided to carry again after having CPP to the finish line? How did you handle the later months of the pregnancy? Did you have CPP the second time around? Any advice is greatly appreciated and I want to say thank you in advance for any helpful words.  Engaged with 2 kids.

I just assumed that I would have it again if I carried again but so far its only been lying low and not covering the cervix. I am having another c/s tho.

I didn't have previa with my 1st but he ended in an emergency C as I just couldn't push him out, even with the help of the vacuum. Baby #2 was a CPP. Brown blood at 14 weeks then 3 red bleeds (21, 25, and 29 weeks) that would fill a pad then turn to brown blood. Spent 12 weeks on strict BR with a total of 3 of those hospitalized after the 2nd and 3rd bleeds. I was in pre term labor at 25.5 weeks so had the steroid shots then. Last bleed was at 29 weeks. Came home from the hospital at 31 weeks and made it to 36+1 when during my last non stress test the nurses discovered I was in labor with contractions 2-3 min apart. Delivered my 2nd baby emergenc C a couple hrs later. He was born at 6.6lbs no NICU, stayed with me in my room and was discharged with me 5 days later.  I'm really wanting to start trying for #3, last one. So I'm also looking to hear from other woman who went on to have previa free babies or even low lying/marginal previas.    --  Moxley-01.09 Jaxon-07.10 BF'd til 18 mths, ERFing, SAHM who loves her boys to the moon and back!

I'm pretty nervous about it all, since I had CPP with my 1st pregnancy.. had bleeds, hospital stays and my son was born by emergency c/s at 35.5 weeks. Thankfully he was 100% healthy and never needed any intervention. But- it was a huge deciding factor on getting pregnant again. I was very hesitant and nervous, and everyone kept telling me, this time will be diff..but we'll see. I found out at 10 weeks, that I am dealing with having Anti-D antibodies due to the fact that I am a negative blood type, and husband is positive. At some point in my pregnancy with him, I bled, didn't know it- and became sensitized.. so we are all ready hooked up with a specialist and are watching this baby's blood to make sure MY blood doesn't cause it to be anemic. So- talk about stress ALL READY and I don't even know about having placenta previa again.  My OB is very optimistic, and seems to think it's even more rare for me to have it again..but my hopes aren't high- we'll just wait and see! OP- I can totally understand your worry- I would be the same way. BUT, the fact that you all ready know it's not a previa and only low lying, is a great sign. Please keep us posted! You'll be in my thoughts and I'll keep checking on you through the boards! :)    --  Alissa- baby center  community moderator  Mom to my 3 sweet  BOYS  (Sept 2010, March 2013 & March 2016)  Complete placenta previa,  2x ISO Anti-D mom             Reply            Report this comment        1                     ExpectingDos    Posted 09/30/2012      I have read the only increased risk for another previa pregnancy is having a previous c/s, not having a prior previa......good luck ladies!

And that any women whose had a c/s is at just as high of a risk as I am, but that still, the risk is low.

Did your baby make it to full term? I was on hospital bedrest due to bleeding on and off and had an emergency c-section at 32 weeks... I'm scared if I get pregnant again and I have PP, the baby might even have to born earlier! And of course all those other complications come to mind such as placenta accreta, increta or percreta. Placenta Previa is such a scary complication.  The bleeding didn't scare me as much as the preterm delivery. My baby was in the NICU for several weeks.

My first pregnancy was smooth sailing. My son was breech so we scheduled c-section at 39w. Second pregnancy had PP  (previous poster) that became complete previa. I have two major bleeding episodes that ultimately landed me in the hospital on bedrest. Delivered emergency c-section at 32w. I'm SO  (significant other) worried about what will happen this time around. I'm finding mixed research on the likelihood of it reoccuring. What were your outcomes?

I had one major bleed at 34 weeks one day (in my sleep).  Upon  arriving to the hospital, I was rushed into an emergency C-Section right there and then. I ended up having a beautiful and healthy baby girl who needed to stay in the NICU for a full 4 weeks primarily due to feeding issues.    My daughter is almost 11 months now and I am currently 18 weeks pregnant. A few days ago, I was diagnosed with complete placenta previa again!! I am afraid it will be much harder this time around as 1) I have a 20 lbs baby to take care off and not much help at all 2) My body is probably weaker that it was with my last pregnancy being that my pregnancies are so close to one another.  Did you make it farther in pregnancy the second time around with the previa?

Everything seems to be going well this time, too.  I guess we'll have to see about the remainder of the pregnancy, but I wanted to give you some good news.  I'll keep you posted!  HTH  Greta                 Reply            Report this comment        3                     countingmyblessings · Original Poster    Posted 11/02/2008      Hi Greta,  Thanks for sharing your story.  I will pray that everything goes well for you for the remainder of your pregnancy!  Keep me posted on your progress.

I've had 5 c-sections... though the first 3 were 10-12 years before the last 2. In my 4th pregnancy I had a placenta previa, was on bed rest for bleeding off and on, and I was dealing with anemia. Thankfully, as the pregnancy progressed the placenta "migrated" a little farther away from the "Os" (the inside top of the cervix). This made things a little less severe, but although I went into premature labor, it was progressing and doctor's could not stop it, even with Turbutaline. So, fearing the bleeding might still be an issue, I ended up with C-section 4.  My 5th pregnancy was mostly uneventful. The first 7 months were fabulous, the placenta placement was great, but I faced other complications from working too much, getting dehydrated and going into pre-eclampsia... we didn't know I had HUGE kidney stones at the time, which was probably a large part of the toxemia.  Now, I'm in my 2nd trimester of surprize (unplanned) pregnancy number 6! Wow.... didn't see this one coming at all as we've been faithful about using preventive measures. So, I have to believe this little bundle is meant to be! The good news is, we just had our 2nd ultrasound and this little one is in a much safer position. Despite all my previous C-section scar tissue and my previous placenta previa, this little one has a healthy looking placenta at the top of the uterus, right where it should be! So far so good!  So, rest in hope and faith that just because lightening struck once... doesn't mean it will strike again!  Be AWARE of complications that can occur, stay educated on risks, treatments and options, but don't fear them. Just stay informed and if a complication presents itself you will be ahead of the game because you will be educated enough to discuss it rationally with your doctor and decide the best and safest course of action for you and your darling baby!  God bless you and good luck to you!

(9 Posts)       Add message | Report    Fairylea   Tue 12-Feb-13 21:58:31    Not thinking of having another right now. But genuine question for the future. I had one very long difficult vaginal birth with dd now aged 9. So I opted for an elective section with ds 8 months ago. As soon as they started there was a huge panic ... turned out I had undiagnosed placenta previa. I had had no symptoms or bleeding at all during the pregnancy. During the section I lost nearly 3 litres of blood, had two blood transfusions in recovery afterwards. I was in hospital for a week. Would I be mad to even consider another? Or was it just a case of bad luck and if they had been more prepared maybe it wouldn't have been so bad? Thanks.       Add message | Report    Emsyboo   Wed 13-Feb-13 07:08:58    Can't help but bumping and curious I have PP now due in a few weeks it has been hard with bleeds and wondering possibility of it happening again. Sorry       Add message | Report    Fairylea   Wed 13-Feb-13 08:50:18    Thanks, maybe someone will know !       Add message | Report    NAR4   Wed 13-Feb-13 10:05:16    I'm not medically qualified or anything but don't think PP is more likely if you have had it before. There are however risk factors that make it more likely, which include a previous CS. I think you were very unlucky Fairy because a CS is normal if you have been diagnosed with PP and it doesn't move before you are ready to give birth. Also it was unlucky not to be picked up at your 20 wk scan.       Add message | Report    Emsyboo   Wed 13-Feb-13 10:38:37    I agree Fairy you were unlucky for it not to be picked up although they nearly missed it with me at 20 weeks as sonographer was pleased to be giving us good news but we asked about the placenta as she was finishing since I had problems last time which is when she double checked and spotted it. I had lots of bleeds which would have meant it would probably be picked up but you never know as I wouldn't have had extra scans if it wasn't for the early diagnosis. The consultant I saw also said bleeding is more likely with a c section but if they had known they would have been more prepared.       Add message | Report    kitkatsz23   Wed 13-Feb-13 10:45:08    I'm watching it with interest as I am currently pregnant with DC1 and have placenta previa. I would recommend you to go back to the hospital and request an appointment with the consultant. Could you request to see the same dr who did the section? They should have given you advise on future pregnancies after your c-section and placenta previa. I've been told the section scar will increase the risk of having placenta previa again.       Add message | Report     Stangirl    Wed 13-Feb-13 18:04:17    I have had a very similar experience to you and had a follow up discussion with my consultant about subsequent pg/births. I had a placenta previa that moved with DC1 - followed by a very straight-forward ELCS. 2nd pg I had an ELCS but had an undiagnosed placenta accreta (placenta had grown through uterus via thinned area of c section) that had been missed on scans. I bled out 5 pints of blood/had blood transfusion/nearly had to have a hysterectomy to stem bleeding but didn't in the end. My DP was told "don't worry she's now got 4 consultants in with her" - this did nowt to reassure him. At one point they lost a needle in me and the surgeon called for an Xray machine with the immortal line "bring it down but I've got bigger things to worry about here than a missing needle". Anyhoo - I asked for a follow up chat with my consultant and he said I'd be good to go again and would be very carefully scanned next time as my chances of it happening again were increased - but it was still unlikely. However my DP has said he was very scared that I was going to die and so we have agreed not to have any more children.       Add message | Report    smileyhappymummy   Wed 13-Feb-13 19:36:58    I didn't have placenta praevia but did have massive pph during emcs - 7 litres due to sepsis and hence blood not clotting. I have just had dd2 - now 4 months but there is a 5 year age gap because neither of us felt ready to ttc sooner. We went back when we were thinking about ttc and saw the consultant again - had same consultant for second delivery - to have a proper talk about it and that really helped. Had a elective section second time which went incredibly smoothly but felt very well looked after as everyone was very well prepared.       Add message | Report    Emsyboo   Wed 13-Feb-13 21:55:57    Stangirl what a terrible experience my friend had acreta and needed a hysterectomy something that scares me about this pregnancy. Glad you are ok! I had PPH as well as smiley with DS they said the risk of this happening again was likely I then had retained placenta which got infected they thought this may have contributed to placenta previa as I had infections for 6 weeks till a D&C which left scarring I imagine a c section on top of this may increase chances again.

(40 Posts)       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Sat 25-Apr-15 21:03:21    I had placenta praevia with my first pregnancy. Big bleeds, frequent stays in hospital, living in fear but made it to 37 and DS arrived safely by emergency caesarean. Now I am 15 weeks pregnant and have been told that the chances of having it again are the same as anyone who has had 1 previous section which is roughly 5% but an terrified. At my 12 week scan the lady wouldn't tell me if it was high or low. She said she wouldn't be able to tell although I have read they can... Am wondering if I could get a private scan to see where it is rather than wait another 5 weeks... I don't feel like I can enjoy being pregnant until I know! But then if it is low then I will just feel worse... If you had It the first time did you get it again?       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Sat 25-Apr-15 21:09:32    I could've written your post! I'm 13 weeks and they wouldn't tell me the position either. She just said it doesn't matter at this stage, which I'm guessing means low, or perhaps I'm reading too much into it?       Add message | Report    Summerdaydreams   Sat 25-Apr-15 21:12:26    I am 20weeks and had pp in my last pregnancy, like you I had heavy bleeds, numerous hospital stays, dd was born prem. I wanted to know the same at my 12 week scan but they couldn't say, I have my 20 week scan next week and I am praying, hoping, wishing they tell me it his high this time around like with my first DC. I have seen a consultant who told me that I am at no greater risk and that my chances of it happening are low. A friend who had it first time around, didn't the second. I will let you know next week how it is for me. Wishing you a smooth pregnancy.       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Sat 25-Apr-15 21:34:51    Fingers crossed for all three of us! When they told me it was low lying at 20 weeks they also said that 90% of the time it moves out of the way. Because it didn't I now deeply mistrust any stats! Even those that say we have a 95% chance of being ok! Silly of me really...       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Sat 25-Apr-15 21:44:56    I'm exactly the same boolean even at my 33 week scan they kept insisting it would move out of the way. Massive bleed 2 weeks later and DS delivered prematurely. It moved somewhere alright...out the exit hole!       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Sat 25-Apr-15 21:56:34    Abbeyroad they kept telling me it would definitely move as well! I realise now how lucky I was to make it to 37 weeks and for DS not to be born prem. Interestingly I read an article that said that 80% of pp cases are male babies! Would love to know why this is!       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Sat 25-Apr-15 22:01:05    Me too! I didn't find out the sex and the midwife said "oh it's going to be a boy, you have praevia" strange it's mainly boys as surely it's chance where the egg implants itself? I'd love to know what the science is with that.       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Sun 26-Apr-15 08:38:02    boolean do you think you might get a private scan? I'm thinking about it, but I don't want to know the sex so if they can't see the placenta it'll be a waste of time as that's all I want to see. I could just wait another month though...undecided Hoping we all have very boring normal pregnancies       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Sun 26-Apr-15 14:32:11    Abbey I keep thinking about it but haven't got round to booking anything and the weeks are ticking by...keep wondering if ignorance is bliss...       Add message | Report    Summerdaydreams   Sun 26-Apr-15 19:35:42    I had a consultant appoint at 16 weeks and she said scanning at this stage would not be accurate, the earliest to wait would be 18 weeks but even that would be on the early side. So not sure if a private scan would tell you much. At the minute I am in the ignorance is bliss camp, I don't know and am having no problems ( at this stage in my last pregnancy, I had already been admitted with heavy bleed), so I am taking that as positive. I don't know what I will do, if they tell me it is low again at this weeks 20 week scan. Interesting about pp and the sex of baby, although I had a girl so don't follow the trend.       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Sun 26-Apr-15 21:39:57    Thanks for that Summer it sounds like its worth waiting until 20 weeks then for accuracy. Hope it all goes well for you       Add message | Report    Parkend   Sun 26-Apr-15 22:28:41    It is to not relevant where the placenta is at 12 weeks, it will often look low as proprtionally it will cover a larger section of the uterus. By 19/20 weeks it is easier to assess. If it looks low then most hospitals will repeat at 34/36 weeks. The placenta does not move as such but imagine drawing a line on a ballon and then blowing the ballon up, it will move. As the uterus expands the placenta will move. That is why it is unlikely you will know if it will be low at term until nearer the time. A private scan at 12 weeks will not help.       Add message | Report    Parkend   Sun 26-Apr-15 22:34:28    Oops, balloon.       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Mon 27-Apr-15 12:54:05    I'll wait until the scan. I know they don't officially diagnose it until later, but it does matter earlier - I had bleeds at 11 weeks, 19 weeks and 35. So I never made it to the 36 week scan. And I was very lucky compared to many women as DS was premature but he's going to be ok. No bleeds so far though so hoping that's a good sign at the moment - I'd already been in at this point last pregnancy       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Tue 28-Apr-15 16:16:55    Summer do let us know how your scan goes this week... Abbey I think I am going to wait and see. Just keep trying to remember that our chances of having it are the same as anyone who has had 1 csection...which is loads of people       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Tue 28-Apr-15 16:53:21    Yes do let us know Summer. I think this might become a previous praevia support thread! Thanks for that boolean I too was told it's just luck where the egg implants. No bleeds so far so I'm hoping that's a good sign compared to last time. I think I can feel flutters as well, so hoping that means it's not at the front in the scar either. Who knew growing an entire new organ could be so stressful!       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Tue 28-Apr-15 19:27:19    Abbey when is your due date? I have some weddings and other events that are happening in the third trimester that I feel I just can't commit to until I know if I'm going to be on bedrest/bleed alert... Also am operating a no sex policy until I know as well! You can't be too safe!       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Tue 28-Apr-15 21:12:46    I'm 29th October, but on the November antenatal thread as my dates got moved forward. Same here, I've got a wedding in September. I was in hospital at 35 weeks last time and had DS at 36 so even though most people think they've got ages at that stage I'm not so sure. Even if I don't have praevia I think I'll be nervous from the point I had DS anyway. I have told anyone (apart from DH and 2 prem mum friends) I'm pregnant yet either. I was hoping to be able to say all is fine so I don't worry our families too much. Don't know if it'll be obvious before 20 weeks though. I carried small last time but everything is stretched now! When are you due?       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Wed 29-Apr-15 19:10:00    Am due 14th October. Another 4 weeks until I find out. You have done well keeping it from people! I have a noticeable bump already although some of it may be from all the food I ate to stop myself from feeling sick in the first trimester! This lady at work keeps mentioning how I had a 'problem pregnancy! Last time and it's driving me mad as I am trying my best to not focus on it! But as my massive bleed at 32 weeks happened at work they all know!       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Wed 29-Apr-15 20:38:52    Oh gosh, poor you having that at work. I was at home in bed luckily for my big bleed - thought it was my waters until I saw it I have a small age gap, so I think people assume it's baby weight. Which it is, but from a different baby!       Add message | Report    Summerdaydreams   Wed 29-Apr-15 22:44:40    Had my 20 weeks scan and also an internal scan to accurately measure the placenta position. They told me that the placenta structure is normal, posterior but low (minor) . It apparently measures 18mm from the internal OS, Anything under 20mm is considered low. So almost Okish. I admit I had a little cry as I wanted them to say it was high. I am being rescanned at 36 weeks. sonographer seemed to think it would move as my uterus grew. Told me they always move up and not down?? The positive is it isn't partially or completely covering the OS, so does this mean it isn't placenta previa??? And all should be ok??? Anyone? Don't see consultant until 13th. My previous experience was of major previa and I was already bleeding at this stage.       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Thu 30-Apr-15 08:18:03    Ah summer I would have cried as well you poor thing but it's only classed as low by 2mm which sounds really positive and much more likely to move out of the way. Do you think you could ask for another scan before 36 weeks to check the position sooner?       Add message | Report    Summerdaydreams   Thu 30-Apr-15 08:35:18    Due to my previous pregnancy the consultant already said I would have at least one, maybe two additional scans, so I won't have to wait until 36 weeks. Just feel a bit deflated by it all. As I really want to start enjoying it but now feel it is hanging over me again. I know I am in a far better position than last time around, so I probably need to focus on the 'glass half full' and not 'half empty approach. I really want to speak to the consultant but have to wait 2 weeks. And now, I am anaylsing and over analysing everything said yesterday. DH is so much more positive and reckons it will be fine. Grrrrrr bloody placentas!!!!!       Add message | Report    thebooleanoperator   Thu 30-Apr-15 08:49:30    I also just thought that if you hadn't had an internal it might not even have been classed as low as its so borderline?       Add message | Report    AbbeyRoadCrossing   Thu 30-Apr-15 09:48:44    Oh no Summer that's rubbish. I never know whether to say or not but mine moved the wrong way. But I did carry small so maybe I never stretched it enough. I don't have my notes but I think I was touching OS at 20 weeks, just under 2cm at 32 weeks, (was back on for birth centre vaginal birth!) then out the exit hole at 35 and had to deliver DS. So I think mine moved about. I remember them saying it was 1 in 200 chance what happened to me though so very rare. It sounds like you're in a better position than last time though, very unlikely to bleed with it a few cm away            Share on Facebook    Share on Twitter    Share on Google +1               Start new thread in this topic | Watch this thread | Flip this thread | Refresh the display      Show 100 messages  Add a message        This is page 1 of 2	(This thread has 40 messages.)

I am very nervous about how things will go this time. I have several other issues on top of it. Wondering if I will for sure have accreta again or not. Reply  Close s  sfm85 I just had an undiagnosed placenta accreta that was found during my scheduled c section (due to other complications with the placenta). I just had my six week follow up with my OB a few weeks ago and we talked about the risks of getting pregnant again. He said there's about a 30% chance of getting it again but because I've had it once, I would be monitored closely for it with special Ultrasounds and MRI. The risk of having percreta or increta is also about 30%. If they know about it ahead of time they can plan for it but if it's bad enough and depending on the type you could need hysterectomy or bladder repair etc. He said the decision shouldn't be taken lightly and actually suggested we consider surrogacy if we didn't want to take the risk. 30% doesn't seem high at first but this was my first pregnancy with no risk factors and i had complete placenta previa (moved to low lying), vasa previa and placenta accreta. You should meet with your OB and talk about your situation and risks to get a good idea of how risky it is for you.

Placenta previa is a low-lying placenta that covers part or all of the inner opening of the cervix. This can result in heavy bleeding during labor and delivery, which can be dangerous for mother and baby.            How often does placenta previa occur, and what are the symptoms?  Placenta previa occurs in about one in 200 pregnancies. Women who've had a placenta previa in a previous pregnancy have a 4 to 8 percent chance of a recurrence. The most common symptom of placenta previa is painless uterine bleeding.  What causes placenta previa?  The cause of placenta previa is unknown, but like placental abruption, a condition in which the placenta separates from the uterine wall, it's more common among women who smoke, use cocaine, or are over age 35. Women are also at increased risk if they've had previous uterine surgery, including a c-section, a D&C (dilation and curettage, in which the lining of the uterus is scraped) following a miscarriage, an abortion, or if they are carrying twins (or a higher number multiples).  What's the treatment for placenta previa?  Your doctor will do an ultrasound exam to diagnose placenta previa and pinpoint the placenta's location. You'll probably need to stay in the hospital until delivery. If the bleeding stops, which it usually does, your physician will continue to monitor both you and baby. If the bleeding does not stop, or if you go into labor, your doctor will probably suggest a c-section.  If you haven't yet gone into labor but your doctor thinks you may deliver before 34 weeks, she'll probably recommend treatment with corticosteroids. At 36 weeks, if you haven't delivered, she may also suggest a test called amniocentesis to see if your baby's lungs are mature. Provided they are, she will likely suggest a c-section to prevent serious uterine bleeding.  Some women learn during a routine ultrasound that they have a low-lying placenta. More than 90 percent of the time, placenta previa diagnosed in the second trimester corrects itself by term. You don't need to restrict your activities or undergo any treatment. Your doctor will probably recommend another ultrasound at about 28 weeks, though, to make sure the placenta has moved away from the cervix. In the unlikely event that it hasn't, she may recommend that you cut back on activities and rest in bed.  The information on this Web site is designed for educational purposes only.

		            August 03, 2014   Fox News       Facebook 0  Twitter 0  livefyre  Email  Print         “It didn’t hit me that this could potentially be problematic,” Courtney Nowak, of Staten Island, NY remembers thinking. She had just had a routine sonogram at 13 weeks and her doctor had drawn her a picture to show her that her placenta wasn’t where it should be— it was now covering her cervix.  She told Nowak that the condition, placenta previa, was common, it was nothing to worry about. As the pregnancy progressed, the placenta could move, she assured her.  Nevertheless, Nowak was told to avoid heavy lifting, vigorous exercise and sexual intercourse. And if she had any bleeding or pain, she had to call her doctor immediately.  After researching the condition, Nowak became a little nervous, especially since she was over 35 and already considered high-risk.  “I was aware that things could happen,” she said.  Fortunately, at her 30-week sonogram, Nowak and her husband found out her placenta had moved. And five months ago, Nowak gave birth to a healthy baby girl.  What is placenta previa? One out of 200 pregnancies are affected by placenta previa, a condition in which the placenta covers part or all of the opening of the cervix , according to Dr. James Bernasko, an OB/GYN in the division of maternal-fetal medicine at Stony Brook University Hospital in New York.  “When you have a placenta that’s lying over the cervix or very close to the cervix when labor begins, it can cause a lot of bleeding and that endangers the health and sometimes the life of the fetus and the mother,” he said.  What’s more, a recent study in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology found that women with placenta previa who had previous births had a two-fold increased chance of delivering a low birth weight baby.  Experts aren’t sure why placenta previa occurs, although one theory is that upon implantation, the embryo tries to go to a part of the uterus where it thinks it will get the most nourishment. For example, if there is a scar in the uterus or the blood supply isn’t optimal, the embryo will implant somewhere else.  Sometimes that somewhere else may be close to the cervix,” Bernasko said.  Risk factors for placenta previa include:  • Smoking (before pregnancy or during) • Maternal age (over 40) • Abnormally shaped uterus • Several previous pregnancies • African American or Asian American race • Cocaine use • Previous pregnancy with placenta previa • One or more previous cesarean sections • Uterine surgery or abortion  Placenta previa is usually diagnosed at the 20-week sonogram, and since many women can have a “silent” placenta previa— one without any bleeding— women should have regular sonograms, Bernasko said.  The good news is that the placenta usually moves upward as the pregnancy progresses and about 90 percent of placenta previa cases will resolve by the time the woman is full term.  In women who have no bleeding, some providers will say it’s not necessary to make any changes. Other doctors may advise women avoid strenuous activity, exercise and sexual intercourse, or order bed rest.  “The recommendations that providers give vary considerably,” Bernasko said.  If you have bleeding, your provider will likely put you on bed rest. If the bleeding stops, you may either have to restrict your activity or be on bed rest at home or in the hospital, depending on how heavy the bleeding was.  If your pregnancy is at 37 weeks or more and you have very heavy bleeding, your provider will recommend a C-section. If it’s earlier than 37 weeks and the bleeding is life-threatening to you or your baby, a C-section is necessary as well.  However, most providers will recommend a C-section at 37 weeks and would prefer that you don’t wait until your due date to do so—  as you get closer, you’re more likely to go into labor on your own, which could turn into an emergency.  “It may be a bit of cautious recommendation, but it’s only because we don’t know exactly when the woman’s going to go into labor,” Bernasko said.

Started by Nicsta79 , Feb 20 2010 10:22 AM        Please log in to reply     6 replies to this topic            #1   Nicsta79    Posted 20 February 2010 - 10:22 AM    Hi I experienced grade 4 placenta previa when I was pregnant with my DS.  I was diagnosed at 20 weeks, and went into hospital at 30 weeks with a bleed until 36 weeks, 6 days where I had DS via Csection. Im now pregnant with my second child, and I would like to know if anyone else has been pregnant after going through placenta previa, and whether you had it with your second child, as I have heard from my OB that the chance of my experiencing it again are high.      Back to top                #2   bubblebear    Posted 22 February 2010 - 10:55 PM    Hi there, I had a grade 4 placenta previa with my first pregnancy, hospitalised from 28 weeks until delivery at 37 weeks. My second pregnancy I was very scared of it happening again, however it was all clear and my pregnancy progressed well. This time I didn't deliver until 41+2 weeks, I felt VERY overdue after last time! Keep in mind that anyone who has had a c-section has increased risk of this, however I don't think it's that big. Best of luck       Back to top                #3   5lilcherubs    Posted 25 February 2010 - 09:17 AM    Hi Bubblebear, congrats on your pregnancy how exciting :0) I just wanted to wish you good luck and i will be stalking this thread to find out what other ppl have gone through. I am currently in hospital (have been in here from 28 weeks also) and fingers crossed will get to 37 - 38 weeks. Its the first pregnancy that i have suffered grade 4 PP, and its really scary!!! I think i have read that the more c-sections you have the greater the risk, this will be my 5th so it makes sense. Congrats once again, and good luck, fingers crossed you will NOT have any issues with your placenta with this pregnancy,      Back to top                #4   just roses    Posted 25 February 2010 - 09:55 PM    What does your OB consider to be a high risk? I've been looking into this for a friend who has also experienced Grade 4 placenta previa. One medical journal I found stated the risk of a subsequent PP as being about 4 or 5%. So not that high really. Although other resources stated the risk higher, but still under 1 in 10. And just because you're at higher risk the second time around, does this necessarily mean you're at high risk of a Grade 4 PP again? Or just regular placenta previa, which might resolve itself during your pregnancy? I'd be interested to know if people have answers to these questions, as it can be difficult to find accurate info online. I hope it all works out well for you!     Back to top                #5   Lawsie    Posted 25 February 2010 - 09:58 PM    Hey, I'm not pregnant, but I saw your post. I had grade two or three Placenta praevia with my first child. My second child I was fine. I even tried for a VBAC (it did fail) and ended up having her at 41 weeks. Little bugger was too comfy, I think. Good luck      Back to top                #6  Guest_purplemonkey_*   Posted 25 February 2010 - 10:58 PM    I had grade 4 placenta praevia with my last pregnancy and was hospitalised from 31 weeks, ending in a stillbirth at 33w6d. I am too early in this pregnancy to know yet if i have PP again... I have everything crossed that i wont. I thought the risk of having it again was pretty low.      Back to top                #7   4boys4me    Posted 08 March 2010 - 11:39 AM    Hi there.. I had Placenta Praevia Grade 4 with my second pregnancy. Had 3 massive bleeds at 23wks, 32wks and 38wks resulting in a week hospital stay each time. I was very lucky to be allowed to go home after the each bleed but I lived very close to hospital.. C section at 39 wks. I too worried I'd get it again but the chances are slim..It's just one of those things!! Went on to have a healthy pregnancy and an amazing VBAC that was my quickest and best birth yet!!!

My doctor just told me today that my placenta is low or that I have placenta previa.  I didn't really know enough to ask more questions about it then, but she mentioned that I have complete placenta previa.  I'll be getting an ultrasound around 32 weeks, and if things haven't changed by then, I'll most likely have to give birth by C-section.  I was really worried about having to get a C-section, but after reading up on placenta previa and the possible complications that could occur with the weeks leading up to birth and birthing itself, I'm really scared!  I just want my little girl to be ok. Reading things like possible premature birth, bleeding more and requiring a blood transfusion at birth, the placenta not separating easily after birth, etc. is scaring me so much I stopped researching.  The doctor did say that 90% of these cases resolve themselves i.e. as the uterus grows, the placenta's position may shift and move out of the way from the cervix and the woman can give birth naturally.  But since my placenta is implanted completely across my cervix at this point, I'm not too positive...  Did anyone have complete placenta previa in a previous pregnancy and was still able to give birth naturally because the problem resolved itself? I really need some good news right now                       Status: Offline                       Jun 28th, 2012, 15:40 PM   2       momto4girls    Mum (Mom)  Active BnB Member        Join Date: Sep 2010  Posts: 258        I had a complete placenta previa with my 4th pregnancy.  In the end, it moved up and I was able to have a completely natural delivery. I too was worried about a c-section.  Baby #5 was born by emergency c-section, and the actual procedure itself wasn't too bad, though the recovery was a lot harder.

I don't know if I'm more worried about the C-section or if I'm more worried about the complications that might arise from the previa itself...

Methods  Retrospective cohort study of 399,674 women who gave birth to a singleton first and second baby between April 2000 and February 2009 in England. Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust the estimates for maternal age, ethnicity, deprivation, placenta previa at first birth, inter-birth interval and pregnancy complications. In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis of the reported results in peer-reviewed articles since 1980.   Results  The rate of placenta previa at second birth for women with vaginal first births was 4.4 per 1000 births, compared to 8.7 per 1000 births for women with CS at first birth. After adjustment, CS at first birth remained associated with an increased risk of placenta previa (odds ratio = 1.60; 95% CI 1.44 to 1.76). In the meta-analysis of 37 previously published studies from 21 countries, the overall pooled random effects odds ratio was 2.20 (95% CI 1.96-2.46). Our results from the current study is consistent with those of the meta-analysis as the pooled odds ratio for the six population-based cohort studies that analyzed second births only was 1.51 (95% CI 1.39-1.65).   Conclusions  There is an increased risk of placenta previa in the subsequent pregnancy after CS delivery at first birth, but the risk is lower than previously estimated. Given the placenta previa rate in England and the adjusted effect of previous CS, 359 deliveries by CS at first birth would result in one additional case of placenta previa in the next pregnancy.  Keywords Cesarean Section Birth Interval Placenta Previa Hospital Episode Statistics Previous Cesarean Section  Background Placenta previa can have serious adverse consequences for both mother and baby, including an increased risk of maternal and neonatal mortality[ 1 – 3 ], fetal growth restriction and preterm delivery[ 4 ], antenatal and intrapartum hemorrhage[ 5 – 7 ], and women may require a blood transfusion[ 8 ] or even an emergency hysterectomy. It is a relatively uncommon condition, with an overall incidence in England of 6.3 per 1000 births[ 9 ], but incidence rates are higher among women with advanced maternal age, multiple gestation, high parity, or who smoke or use illegal drugs[ 10 ]. The risk of placenta previa is also reported to be higher among women with previous uterine surgery, including cesarean section[ 11 ]. In England, cesarean sections constituted 25% of National Health Service (NHS) deliveries during 2010, and the rates have been rising for both primary and emergency CS[ 9 ]. The risk of placenta previa in a pregnancy after a CS delivery has been reported to be between 1.5 and 6 times higher than after a vaginal delivery. A meta-analysis of studies published before 2000 of previous CS as a risk factor for placenta previa found an overall odds ratio of 2.7 [ 10 ]. However, the overall odds ratio was lower in studies that had better adjustment for confounders[ 10 ]. A recent study from the USA that was not included in the meta-analysis, and which used a population-based cohort of 11 million pregnancies, found an adjusted odds ratio of 1.8 for all pregnancies[ 12 ] and an adjusted odds ratio of 1.5 for second births only[ 13 ]. Evidence about the risk of placenta previa following a previous CS in UK women is limited to results published 25 years ago[ 14 ]. We used the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), an administrative database of all admissions to NHS hospitals in England, to define a population-based cohort and to quantify the association between CS at first birth and the risk of developing placenta previa in the subsequent pregnancy. We also performed a meta-analysis of the reported results in peer-reviewed articles since 1980.  Methods  The cohort study  We used the HES dataset for nine financial years from April 2000 to February 2009 for the cohort study. In HES, individual patients are allocated the same identifier for each episode of care[ 9 ] and core fields contain patient demographics, clinical information, and hospital administrative data. Diagnostic information is coded using the International Classification of Diseases 10 th revision (ICD10) and operative procedures are coded using the UK Office for Population Censuses and Surveys classification, 4 th revision (OPCS4). For delivery episodes, the HES dataset also has an additional "maternity tail" which includes parity, birth weight, gestational age, method of delivery, and pregnancy outcome. However, not all records that describe a delivery episode have data entered into this tail.  All women who gave birth to a singleton first and second baby from 1 st April 2000 to 28 th February 2009 were eligible for inclusion. A delivery was defined as an episode of care that included a relevant OPCS4 code (R17-R25) or ICD10 code (O80-O84) for the mode of delivery, or a maternity tail with a valid date of birth for a baby. Deliveries were coded as a cesarean section by the relevant OPCS4 codes (R17 for primary CS or R18 for emergency CS) or if OPCS4 codes were not available, by the delivery method specified in the maternity tail. If neither of the sets of codes were available (0.5% of delivery episodes), vaginal delivery was assumed.  We confined the analysis to NHS trusts (acute hospital organizations) that had a reasonable level of data completeness on parity, defined as having parity information in the maternity tail for more than 50% of the delivery episodes in at least seven of the nine years covered in the study. NHS trusts were included if the proportion of nulliparous women in that trust was between 25% and 55% (which corresponded to the overall rate in England and Wales ± 15%[ 15 ]) to remove hospitals with poor data quality. Women were allocated to the NHS trusts that existed in February 2009 to take account of previous organizational mergers.  We used the HES patient identifier to trace the second births of those women who had been recorded as nulliparous and who had singleton first births in identified NHS trusts. Diagnostic information for the second birth was taken from the core HES diagnosis fields. Cases of placenta previa were identified by the ICD10 code O44. Pregnancy complications were identified using ICD10 codes O10, O11, O16 for pre-existing hypertension; O13 for gestational hypertension; O14 and O15 for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia; O24.4 and O24.9 for gestational diabetes; and O40 for polyhydramnios.  The effect of previous CS delivery on the risk of placenta previa was estimated using unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios. Multiple logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios and the risk of placenta previa adjusted for maternal age (<20, 20-29, 30-39, ≥40), maternal ethnicity (White, Asian, Black and Other), deprivation, inter-birth interval (<1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, ≥5 years), placenta previa at first birth and indicators for pregnancy complications (i.e., pre-existing hypertension, gestational hypertension including pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, gestational diabetes and polyhydramnios). Deprivation was measured using the 2004 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) rank of the English Super Output Areas. The IMD combines a range of economic, social and housing indicators into a single deprivation score for each small area in England [ 16 ]. Categories were defined by partitioning the ranks of the 32,480 areas into quintiles (0-20th percentiles, 20-40th percentiles, etc.) and labeled 1 (least deprived) to 5 (most deprived). Women were allocated a category based on their region of residence. We calculated the number needed to harm using the adjusted estimates from the logistic regression[ 17 ].  We examined whether the effect of CS on placenta previa rates was related to the level of other risk factors, such as whether the effect of CS on the placenta previa risk differed between younger and older women. The significance of an interaction term between previous CS and other risk factors was assessed with the likelihood ratio test. All analyses were done in Stata/SE 10.0.  The study is exempt from IRB and UK NREC approval as it involved analysis of an existing dataset comprising information on delivery episodes for women who cannot be identified directly or through the HES patient numbers linked to them.   Review of literature and meta-analysis  We searched Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Cinahl and the Cochrane Library for the period January 1980 to January 2011 to identify studies that examined the relationship between previous cesarean section and placenta previa. The keywords of "placenta previa"/"placenta praevia" and "cesarean"/"caesarean" were searched in MESH headings, titles and abstracts to locate relevant articles. We also checked the references of the selected articles and previous reviews. We only included articles written in English and limited the search to peer-reviewed journals.  We selected studies in which placenta previa was diagnosed or recorded at third trimester or during delivery. If two or more relevant articles used the same data source in overlapping years, we selected the study that adjusted the effect size by age or parity, and if there is still replication, the study with the larger sample size.  Estimated log odds ratios and standard errors of log odds ratios were calculated from raw data presented in the included papers. The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, and summarized the degree of consistency across the study results using the I 2 measure, the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance[ 18 ]. Meta-regression was used to assess whether the effect size was associated with date of publication, study design (cohort vs. case-control), source of data (population vs. hospital based), method of diagnosis of placenta previa (confirmed at delivery vs. recorded at hospital or birth registry databases), and whether the results were adjusted for age and parity. We also did a subgroup analysis of population-based cohort studies focusing on the association between first-birth cesarean delivery and second-birth placenta previa and compared the magnitude of this association with the results from our cohort.   Results  The cohort study  Between April 2000 and February 2009, there were 4,987,245 singleton delivery episodes in 146 English NHS trusts. It was necessary to exclude 76 NHS trusts due to incomplete parity information. This left 2,484,468 (49.8%) singleton delivery episodes in 70 NHS trusts. Of these, 958,882 (38.6%) women were nulliparous and 399,674 had had a second singleton birth by February 2009. The overall rate of placenta previa for the cohort at first birth was 3.6 and at second birth was 5.3 per 1000 births. The proportion of women who had undergone a CS at first birth was 21.5%. The median birthweight at second birth was 3448 grams (Interquartile range: 3110 -3780 grams).  The rate of placenta previa at second birth was 4.4 per 1000 births for women with vaginal delivery at first birth and 8.7 for women with CS at first birth (unadjusted odds ratio = 1.88). We found that this increased risk of placenta previa persisted after other risk factors were taken into account (adjusted odds ratio = 1.60) (Table 1 ). The strongest association between a maternal characteristic and the risk of placenta previa was for women who had placenta previa at first birth (adjusted odds ratio = 4.77). Women with advanced maternal age, with polyhydramnios, with very short birth intervals of less than one year, and with birth intervals of more than four years also had higher placenta previa risks. Women with pre-existing hypertension had lower placenta previa risks. Using these estimates, we expect that 359 CS deliveries at first birth would result in one additional case of placenta previa at second birth.

Review of literature and meta-analysis  We identified 2077 articles of which 74 were of potential relevance to merit a full-text review. 41 articles were selected for inclusion in the review, and an additional eight articles were retrieved from reference lists [ 8 , 12 , 13 , 19 – 64 ]. Among the 49 articles, 12 used overlapping datasets with other studies and were excluded. Study characteristics are presented in Table 2 and the meta-analysis results from the selected 37 studies are given in Figure 1 . The overall pooled random effects odds ratio was 2.20 (95% CI 1.96-2.46). The spread of the odds ratios reported in the individual studies were larger than can be expected by chance alone (I 2 = 87.6%).

In bi-variate meta-regressions of various study characteristics on the reported odds ratios (Table 3 ), significantly smaller effect size of previous cesarean section on placenta previa was associated with recent studies (p = 0.04), population-based studies (p = 0.03), and those that adjusted for age and parity (p = 0.04). The odds ratios reported in the individual studies were not associated with type of study design (cohort vs. case-control) and method of diagnosis of placenta previa (data record in database vs. confirmation at delivery). Heterogeneity across studies remained in subgroup analyses by study design, setting and timing of diagnosis of placenta previa. Results from studies that adjusted for age and parity were less heterogeneous (I 2 = 52.3%) and the variation in the results from studies that analyzed first two births were due to chance alone (I 2 = 0%).

The pooled odds ratio and association of study characteristics on the odds ratio remained similar after inclusion of the current study in the meta-analysis. The subgroup of studies analyzing first two births had significantly smaller effect sizes (p = 0.04).   Discussion and Conclusions Among women in England, cesarean section in the first delivery increased the risk of placenta previa in the subsequent delivery by 60%. There was no evidence that the effect of CS on placenta previa rates varied among different groups of women or by the time between two pregnancies. The risks of placenta previa in the second pregnancy also increased by previous placenta previa, advanced maternal age and with birth intervals of less than one year or more than four years. Women with pre-existing hypertension were less likely to have placenta previa. Our results are consistent with recent studies from other countries which typically found odds ratios ranging from 1.4 to 1.7.  Strengths and limitations of this study  This is the first study of placenta previa risk in England using a large, population-based cohort of nearly 400,000 women with first two births. It included half of all singleton NHS hospital deliveries between April 2000 and February 2009. Due to its comprehensive coverage, the HES database is a valuable resource particularly for studies of relatively uncommon conditions such as placenta previa.  In this study we focused only on the effect of a CS delivery at first birth on a second pregnancy. This has two benefits. First, it corresponds to the information typically required by women and obstetricians. For example, the average achieved family size in the UK is approximately two[ 65 ], and so the effect of CS on the second birth is more relevant and accurate than a relative risk based on all pregnancies that may include women with multiple previous CS. Second, estimates based on all pregnancies will be influenced by the proportions of women in 2 nd , 3 rd , 4 th ... pregnancies contained in the study sample. Study samples may also differ in the observed sequences of modes of delivery (for example, due to differences in the propensity of local women to opt for trial of labor). Both factors will reduce the comparability of the estimates across studies. We note that, while there is a wide range of reported relative risks, there is consistency in the effect sizes for studies limited to second births.  It is possible that the women with incomplete data in the maternity tail differed from women included in the study in terms of their characteristics and pregnancy risks. However, the distributions of maternal age and mode of delivery were similar in the episodes with good quality data and omitted episodes, which suggests the risk of selection bias is likely to be small.  The coding of the diagnoses and procedures in administrative databases is potentially inaccurate. However, this is unlikely to have had a major effect in our study because previous studies have reported high-levels of agreement in the coding of cesarean section between administrative databases and medical reviews (kappa > 0.98, where stated) [ 66 – 68 ]. Furthermore, cesarean deliveries were defined using the first three characters of the full 4-character OPCS codes, and broader categories rather than specific codes have been shown to be more reliable[ 69 ].  Just like other population-based studies, we were not able to confirm the grade and severity of placenta previa [ 70 , 71 ]. We were also not able to control for behavioral risk factors, such as maternal smoking and alcohol and drug use, and previous abortions [ 40 , 72 – 74 ]. However, the effects of these risk factors as reported in the literature are small compared to the effect of prior CS, maternal age and parity[ 10 ].   Comparison with other studies  In the previous meta-analysis of 21 studies, the pooled odds ratios of previous CS as a risk factor for placenta previa was found to be 2.7 (95% CI: 2.3 to 3.2). The same study emphasized that the odds ratios were highly variable by setting, study design, sample size and quality. For well-designed studies, the pooled odds ratio was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.7 to 2.2)[ 10 ].  Since this review, a number of studies have been published. 13 of the 37 studies included in our meta-analysis are post-2000 and cover approximately 12 million women. The pooled odds-ratio of 2.2 (95% CI: 2.0 to 2.5) from this meta-analysis is less than the previous review, and reflects the fact that studies with recent publication dates found smaller effect sizes.  Our results for the English cohort are in agreement with other recent, population-based cohorts analyzing second-births only. In the largest population-based cohort study of over 11 million singleton deliveries between 1995 and 2000 in the USA, the adjusted odds ratio of the effect of previous CS on placenta previa at second-birth was 1.5[ 75 ]. Other population-based cohort studies published in the last decade reported adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.4 to 1.7, using Missouri state birth certificates data[ 26 ], Washington state Birth Events data[ 8 ], South Australian Perinatal Data[ 37 ] and Medical Birth Registry of Norway[ 49 ]. A population-based study using data from the Swedish Birth Registry found a higher adjusted odds ratio of 1.8, but this study did not adequately control for risk factors[ 76 ].  A few studies have investigated whether the effect of a previous CS on the risk of placenta previa was modified by other risk factors. The Missouri cohort study found that the effect of CS was 70% higher for women with a second pregnancy within a year after the first delivery[ 26 ]. We did not find evidence to support the hypothesis that inter-pregnancy interval influences the size of effect of first birth CS. Our results are consistent with the Washington state cohort study that found the size of effect of CS was not influenced by maternal age at second birth [ 8 ].   Implications for policy and practice  Cesarean section rates are rising worldwide, and an increase in the longer term complications of CS should be anticipated. The presumed short and long term safety of CS is probably one of the factors underlying both the growing rate of CS and the wide variation in CS rates not accounted for by case mix. There is a need for better understanding of the relative risks associated with vaginal and CS births to support decision-making by mothers and clinicians[ 77 ].  The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health recommends that women with a prior CS should have placental localization in current pregnancy to exclude placenta previa[ 78 ]. If placenta previa is diagnosed, there must be further investigation to exclude placenta accreta, a potentially life-threatening condition. In high-income countries, advanced radiological facilities can help to diagnose this serious condition in antenatal care and to plan delivery in a tertiary care unit. However, in low or middle-income countries, placental conditions may be encountered first time at the CS with its serious consequences and it is imperative that senior and experienced doctors are involved in the care of women with placenta previa from the outset.  Our study has demonstrated that, in addition to women with previous CS, women with advanced maternal age, women with birth intervals of less than one year and women who had a previous placenta previa are at a higher risk of developing placenta previa. Nonetheless, our study suggests that the absolute risk remains small. Women who had placenta previa in their previous pregnancy were at the greatest risk of placenta previa in a current pregnancy but less than 5 in 100 of women with a previous placenta previa would be expected to have this complication again. Clinicians should consider and communicate these factors when counseling their patients using appropriate and simplified risk statistics[ 79 ]. Our study quantifies this risk and provides data that can be used to reassure women, attending for pre-conception counseling clinics or antenatal clinics as well as in pre-operative consent discussions for women undergoing CS.
