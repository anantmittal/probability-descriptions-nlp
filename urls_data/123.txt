The Results of Laser Eye  Surgery Examined  LASIK eye surgery results have continued to improve since the procedure was FDA approved in 1996.  Even in 2014, some potential LASIK candidates still ask Is LASIK Safe? LASIK eye surgery is one of the most popular elective procedures performed today, and offers many benefits that should improve your overall quality of life. Due to the latest technology and the skills of experienced LASIK surgeons millions of Americans are less dependent on their contact lenses and glasses.  Today, most patients achieve 20/20 vision after LASIK eye surgery, but results are not the same for everyone. In some cases, patients may still need to wear glasses or contact lenses following LASIK eye surgery, however the post-operative prescription and visual acuity level will typically be much lower than prior to having LASIK performed. The surgery has an excellent safety record, but like with any surgery post-operative complications can occur.   A very small percentage of patients may require an enhancement or touch up procedure to improve their vision to the desired level. Additionally, due to presbyopia , some LASIK eye surgery patients may still need reading glasses once they reach middle-age (40 to 50) due to a normal age related loss of near vision.  Overall, LASIK eye surgery is safe and has a significantly high success rate, but it is important to discuss and consider all the risks with your surgeon prior to undergoing the LASIK procedure.  Is LASIK Considered Safe by the FDA?  Since 1996, LASIK eye surgery has been approved and considered safe by the FDA.. LASIK has a remarkable success rate, with 96% of patients achieving 20/20 vision or better, according to the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery.  LASIK eye surgery is a permanent procedure that corrects vision problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism .  LASIK involves using an excimer laser (a cool beam of light) to reshape the cornea in order to decrease or eliminate the need for glasses or contact lenses. Normally, your cornea (front part of the eye) focuses light onto the retina (back part of the eye) to create an image. If the cornea is imperfectly shaped or if the eyeball is longer or shorter than normal, a distorted image is projected onto the retina resulting in blurry vision.   During LASIK surgery, the surgeon creates a tiny flap on the surface of the eye and then the excimer laser (cool beam of light) gently reshapes the exposed cornea. Each pulse of the laser removes 39-millionths of an inch of tissue, enabling surgeons to achieve remarkable accuracy while maintaining excellent control throughout the LASIK procedure. The flap is then replaced, adhering naturally and securely to the eye, and you are on your way to better vision.  For decades, the only solution to nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism was corrective eyewear, however now LASIK eye surgery offers an alternative option for those who wish to reduce or eliminate their dependence on glasses or contacts.

LASIK Surgery Can Save You Money  Many people who inquire about LASIK eye surgery are sometimes discouraged by the cost of the procedure. Often they question, "Is LASIK worth it?" While we can breakdown the question financially, only you can really answer this question.  Only you know the day to day struggles you face with glasses and contacts.  Have you ever lost a contact or woke up in the middle of the night and struggled to find your glasses?  What about seeing the alarm clock?  If you are active, what would life be like not worrying about contacts falling out?  Or if you are one of the thousands of people whose eye don’t tolerate contacts, what would it be like to not have to take your glasses off when you enter a warm house in the winter because they fog up?  Have you ever worried about losing your glasses while on vacation?  All of these questions along with the financial cost of LASIK will ultimately determine “Is LASIK worth it” for you?   The national average cost of LASIK surgery is $2,259 per eye. Understandably, prospective patients may find the price of LASIK unsettling, however, most people will save money over time by having the procedure, especially those who wear contacts.  It’s also becoming increasingly popular to spread out the cost of the procedure over time by using pretax dollars set aside in Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) or Health Savings Accounts (HSA) allowed by employers.  Utilizing an FSA or HSA account allows the person to set aside a determined amount ($2,550 for FSA and $3,300 for HSA for a single person or $6,550 for HSA for a family).  Another extremely popular method of paying for the procedure is to utilize financing options offered by the provider.  Providers will often offer 6 and 12 months financing with 0% interest to qualified applicants.  When comparing the long-term cost of contacts, exams, and eyeglasses versus the one-time cost of LASIK eye surgery, it is evident that the initial expense of LASIK is lower than the annual cost of contacts, exams and eyeglasses combined over time. The cost of contact lenses quickly adds up due to regular replacements when compared to eyeglasses. A box of contacts usually contains about six lenses and can range from $25 to $80. Disposable contacts need to be replaced more frequently than others; they require patients to purchase several boxes of contact lenses each year. The cost of contact lenses can vary depending on a patient’s prescription and the type of lenses they wear.  Toric lenses, which correct astigmatism, are more expensive than other contact lenses. Toric lenses can cost up to $80 a box and an annual supply requires several boxes. When patients with astigmatism are interested in saving money, many of them consider LASIK, since purchasing Toric lenses may exceed several hundred dollars annually.  Night and Day contact lenses allow patients to sleep without removing the lenses for up to 7 days and typically last for 30 days, giving patients the closest experience to eliminating glasses other than LASIK. While sleeping in contacts provides a temporary experience of not needing glasses, it does come with risks as researchers found the incident of eye infections is greater in people who sleep in contacts.  While extended wear contact lenses have been approved for up to 30 days, most eye care professionals will still recommend their patients remove their contacts daily.  Longer lasting contacts are often more expensive and patients who buy Night and Day lenses are spending around $70 a box. Although Night and Day contact lenses may last longer, patients are still required to spend hundreds of dollars annually while still falling short of a permanent vision correction solution. In other words, patients will be required to continue buying contact lenses for the rest of their life if they wish to reduce their dependence on glasses.  LASIK may be an option to eliminate the need for eyeglasses and contacts  potentially saving them thousands of dollars over time. For this reason and many more, most people who have undergone LASIK believe LASIK is worth the higher initial cost over time and thus believe LASIK is worth it.  Is LASIK Worth It? Compare the Cost of LASIK to Glasses & Contacts  Between buying eyeglasses, contact lenses and paying the fees for visits to the eye doctor, the cost of vision correction adds up quickly and does not provide a permanent fix. Patients who wear more expensive lenses may end up paying close to $900 each year after all the add-ons offered like anti-reflective coatings, high-index plastic, polycarbonate lenses, polarized lenses and whether or not to get single vision or progressive lenses.  Most people replace their eye glasses annually or every other year and are forced to cover all the fees all over again.  At QualSight, the price for Traditional LASIK surgery is typically less than $995 per eye and more advanced technology such as Custom LASIK is less than $1,450 per eye. Even though the initial cost of LASIK is higher initially, it is typically a one-time fee and over time LASIK is worth it when it comes to saving money.

		            April 14, 2014   Fox News       Facebook 0  Twitter 0  livefyre  Email  Print         LASIK eye surgery to correct a person’s vision has been in use since the mid-1990s, but lingering questions as to the long-term effects still come to mind for past and potential patients. But LASIK recipients can rest easy: Studies have shown that the surgeries have little negative effect and in fact, are now safer and more beneficial than ever.  “LASIK is an FDA-approved procedure… if there were long-term issues with the procedure, the FDA would pull the procedure off the market, right? And that is absolutely not the case,” Dr. Marc Werner, an ophthalmologist at the Stahl Eye Center in New York City, told FoxNews.com. “We still have lots of people we started on 18 to 19 years ago who are perfect. It’s still a very good procedures with long-term results.”  In a 2008 retrospective study of LASIK procedures, Spanish researchers followed up with 70 patients for 10 years and found that, overall, participants had healthy corneas and that their vision remained accurate.  “The question is: Has the technology improved over the last 18 years? Absolutely. It’s a safer procedure with better results,” Werner said.  LASIK, laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, is a surgical procedure that utilizes a laser to permanently change the shape of the cornea to correct vision. Nearsightedness and farsightedness are both caused by distortions in the cornea.   More On This...      LASIK eye surgery safe in long-term, experts say         Surgical tool simplified hysterectomies, but had hidden cancer risk         Ancient daddy longlegs had extra eyes        During the procedure, a flap is created in the cornea so that a computer-controlled excimer laser can vaporize a portion of the stroma, which is located in the middle of the cornea. The flap is then closed again, correcting the curvature of the cornea, and improving vision.  In the mid-1990s, surgeons used a surgical blade to create a flap in the cornea. But now, the majority of ophthalmic surgeons use a femtosecond laser. The laser separates tissues by creating a layer of bubbles, then making an incision to create the flap. If the surgery is disrupted, the air bubbles dissolve and no tissue is removed, unlike with a blade.  In addition to improvements in the procedure, the preoperative testing process has become more thorough, with screening tests monitoring multiple elements of the cornea to ensure LASIK is proper for the patient.  According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), people who have experienced vision changes in the past year, have a disease or disorder that may affect wound healing, or actively participating in contact sports may be at risk for complications from LASIK. The procedure is approved for adults for adults age 18 and over.  “The screening process has gotten better in the sense that it could pick up things it couldn’t pick up…10…five years ago,” Dr. Michael Ehrenhaus, director of New York Cornea Consultants and director of Cornea External Disease & Refractive Surgery at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, told FoxNews.com  Ehrenhaus points out that there are fewer long-term studies now as there were at the advent of the surgery because of the proven safety and effectiveness of the procedure.  With the natural aging process, it’s possible a patient will need a touch-up LASIK procedure to fine tune his or her vision in the future, or may need reading glasses later in the life.  “Aging changes occurs within 100 percent of the population,” Dr. Kerry Solomon, director of the Carolina Eyecare Research Institute in Charleston, SC, told FoxNews.com. “…Occasionally things will change in [eye] shape and size.”  Those eye changes also include cataracts, the clouding of the natural lens of the eye. LASIK does not increase the incidence of cataracts – the surgery affects only the cornea, not the lens of the eye.  “With or without LASIK, we all develop [cataracts]… and their occurrence is unrelated to LASIK,” Werner said.  Long-term safety of LASIK has been good and continues to improve with technological developments.  “Most patients do phenomenally well in the long-term. 15 to 20 years after, patients come up and say, ‘This is the best thing I ever did,’” Ehrenhaus said. “If it wasn’t a good procedure, it wouldn’t still be done.”           Advertisement          Trending in Health     1   Man who ate world's hottest chili is hospitalized with excruciating headaches     2   Russian woman dies after given formaldehyde instead of saline drip     3   Quintuplets leave Utah parents feeling 'blessed'     4   Teen dubbed 'butterfly boy' dies of rare skin disease; Ottawa Senators mourn his death     5   E. coli outbreak possibly linked to Panera Bread in NJ       See all Trends    Top Health Centers View All    Back Pain    Cancer    Depression    Heart Disease    Pain Management    Sexual Health    Beauty & Skin    Cold and Flu    Digestive Health    Nutrition    Pregnancy                           Site Index    Sections   Home  Video  Politics  U.S.  Opinion  Entertainment  Tech  Science  Health  Travel  Lifestyle  World  Sports  Weather  On Air     Tools   Live Video  Trending  Newsletters  Alerts  Podcasts  Radio  Apps & Products     About   Careers  College Students  Fox Around the World  Advertise With Us  New Terms of Use  (What's New)  New Privacy Policy  Ad Choices  Help  Email Newsroom  Media Relations  Closed Captioning Policy     Follow   Facebook  Twitter  Google+  Instagram  RSS  Newsletters      Fox News  Back to Top   This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

Please Share!   On this page: LASIK risk factors • List of complications • How common are LASIK complications? • Eyewear after LASIK   See also: Dry eyes and what to do about them • Wavefront-guided LASIK • Results you can expect from LASIK surgery   LASIK and other types of laser eye surgery, such as PRK and LASEK , have excellent safety profiles and very high success rates. They are designed to treat myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness) and astigmatism , and can allow you to live without glasses or contacts.  Sight-threatening complications such as significant loss of vision from LASIK surgery are extremely rare, and many side effects and laser eye surgery complications can be resolved with additional surgery or medical treatment.  Like any other surgery, however, there are potential risks, side effects and limitations you should be fully aware of before electing to undergo the procedure (or any type of procedure, for that matter). Choosing a skilled and experienced LASIK eye surgeon can help reduce these risks and enable you to achieve the best possible results from laser eye surgery.  The first step is to determine if you are a good candidate for vision correction surgery. Your eye doctor will perform a thorough diagnostic eye exam to determine your suitability for LASIK surgery. He or she will evaluate: the shape and thickness of your cornea ; your refractive errors and pupil size; the moistness of your eyes (to check for dry eye syndrome ); your general health and medical history; and any medications you are taking.  Even if you are not a good candidate for LASIK, don't worry  you might still be able to have your vision fixed with other vision correction surgery such as PRK, LASEK or implantable lenses .  LASIK Eye Surgery Risk Factors And Limitations  Not everyone is a suitable candidate for LASIK eye surgery. Certain conditions and anatomical factors can increase your risk of an undesirable outcome or limit optimal LASIK results. These include:   Recommended For You      What's iLASIK?

LASIK Side Effects And Complications  Millions of Americans have had LASIK eye surgery to correct their vision since it was introduced in the United States more than 20 years ago, and experienced LASIK surgeons report that serious complication rates can be held below 1 percent.   Best Candidates    mild/moderate myopia, hyperopia and/or astigmatism, adequate corneal thickness   Procedure time: about 10 minutes per eye  Typical results: 20/20 vision without glasses or contact lenses  Recovery time: a few days to several weeks for vision to stabilize  Cost: about $1,500 to $3,500 per eye      Common LASIK complications and side effects are listed below. Most of these problems can be resolved with medical treatment or additional " enhancement " surgery.  Temporary discomfort and vision disturbances. Discomfort during the first few days following LASIK surgery, such as mild irritation and light sensitivity, is normal and to be expected. During the first few weeks or months you also may experience: halos; glare and starbursts in low-light environments, especially at night; dry eye symptoms; hazy vision; and reduced sharpness of vision. In the vast majority of cases, these problems are temporary and disappear completely within three to six months.  Flap complications. The LASIK procedure involves the creation of a thin hinged flap on the front surface of the cornea. This is lifted during surgery for laser reshaping of the eye. The flap is then replaced to form a natural bandage.  If the LASIK flap is not made correctly, it may fail to adhere properly to the eye's surface or microscopic wrinkles called striae (STRIE-ee) could develop in the flap. These flap complications can cause optical aberrations and distorted vision.  Studies indicate that flap complications occur in from 0.3 to 5.7 percent of LASIK procedures, according to the April 2006 issue of American Journal of Ophthalmology . In a study of 3,009 consecutive LASIK surgeries performed August 2002 through July 2009 using a femtosecond laser for flap creation, flap complications occurred in fewer than one-half of 1 percent (0.37 percent) of these procedures, and all complications were successfully managed within the same surgical session.  Again, remember that you can reduce your risk of LASIK complications by choosing a reputable, experienced eye surgeon.  Some problems associated with LASIK flap complications include:   Left: What someone with post-op starbursts might see at night. Right: Nighttime halos.   Irregular astigmatism. This is caused by an unequally curved corneal surface. Irregular astigmatism also can occur from laser correction that is not centered properly on the eye or from irregular healing. Resulting symptoms may include double vision (diplopia) or "ghost images." In these cases, the eye may need re-treatment or enhancement surgery.  Epithelial ingrowth. This is when cells from the outer layer of the cornea (epithelium) grow under the flap after LASIK surgery. In most cases, epithelial ingrowth is self-limiting and causes no problems. But in some cases (reported to be 1 to 2 percent of LASIK procedures), symptoms of discomfort and/or blurred vision can occur, and additional surgery is needed to lift the flap and remove the epithelial cells.  Diffuse lamellar keratitis (DLK). Nicknamed "Sands of the Sahara," this is inflammation under the LASIK flap that may have several causes. Some inflammation of the cornea after LASIK surgery is normal. But if it is uncontrolled, as in DLK, it can interfere with healing and cause vision loss. If DLK occurs, it usually responds to therapies such as antibiotics and topical steroids. Also, the flap might need to be lifted and cleaned for removal of inflammatory cells and to prevent tissue damage.  Keratectasia or keratoconus. This is a very uncommon bulging of the eye's surface that can occur if too much tissue is removed from the cornea during LASIK or if the cornea prior to LASIK is weak as evidenced from corneal topography mapping. Rarely does keratoconus develop after LASIK with no known risk factors. Enhancement laser surgery is usually not suitable, and gas permeable contact lenses or corneal implants (Intacs) may be prescribed to hold the cornea in place, or a treatment called corneal collagen crosslinking may be performed to strengthen the cornea.    Because hormonal changes during pregnancy can affect your eyes, many surgeons recommend waiting several weeks after your baby is born before having LASIK surgery.  Dry eyes after LASIK. Some people who have LASIK surgery experience a decrease in tear production that can cause eye discomfort and blurred vision. Almost half of all LASIK patients experience some degree of temporary dry eye syndrome, according to the April 2006 issue of American Journal of Ophthalmology .  Dry eye syndrome after LASIK surgery usually is temporary and can be effectively treated with lubricating eye drops or other measures.  Dry eye problems usually disappear when healing of the eye is complete, which can take up to six months. People who already have severe dry eye usually are eliminated as LASIK candidates.  Significant undercorrection, overcorrection or regression. Not everyone will achieve 20/20 vision after LASIK eye surgery, and contact lenses or eyeglasses for some or all activities may still be required in rare cases. If the laser removes too much or too little corneal tissue, or your eye's healing response is not typical, your visual outcome will be less than optimal.  One possible cause of a less-than-perfect outcome is that your eyes did not respond to laser eye surgery in a predictable manner. Another possible cause is that your eyesight may have been optimal shortly after LASIK but regressed over time due to "over-healing."  In most cases, a significant undercorrection or regression can be successfully treated with additional laser vision correction after your surgeon confirms your residual refractive error is stable.  Eye infection. Infections rarely occur after LASIK. Because the corneal flap acts as a natural bandage, eye infections occur less frequently after LASIK than after flap-free corneal refractive procedures like PRK. Still, it is very important to use medicated eye drops as directed after your LASIK procedure to avoid infection and control inflammation as your eyes heal.     LASIK Complications: How They Affect You, How They're Treated   Complications  Symptoms  Treatments   Incomplete corrections (undercorrection, overcorrection, residual astigmatism) or regression of effect  Blurry, less-than-perfect vision  Glasses or contact lenses; eye drops; re-treatment with laser   Decentered ablations  Visual aberrations*  Eye drops; re-treatment with laser   Oversize pupils  Visual aberrations*  Eye drops; re-treatment with laser   Haze  Visual aberrations*  Eye drops; re-treatment with laser   Irregular flap (folds, wrinkles, striae)  Visual aberrations*  Surgical correction; second laser procedure   Dry eye  Dry, itchy or scratchy eyes, often with redness and sense of foreign object in eye, and sometimes pain  Prescription dry eye medication; artificial tears; punctal occlusion (blockage of tear ducts in order to retain tear film on eye), oral flaxseed oil   Diffuse lamellar keratitis (eye inflammation)  Visual aberrations*  Eye drops; surgical rinsing of cells if severe   Epithelial ingrowth  Visual aberrations*  Surgical removal of epithelium   Infection  Redness, oozing of eyes, sometimes pain  Eye drops; oral medications   *Visual aberrations include symptoms such as glare, double vision, ghosting, halos, starbursts, loss of contrast sensitivity, and problems with low-light or night vision. Most patients do not experience these symptoms, and some patients with these complications experience no symptoms and require no treatment.

The safety and effectiveness of LASIK surgery continues to improve, thanks to increasingly sophisticated technology, surgical skill and optimal patient selection.  Complications generally were more common in the early years of LASIK, when studies in the late 1990s indicated that up to 5 percent of people undergoing laser vision correction experienced some type of problem. These days, this number is under 1 percent for serious complications.  A worldwide review of LASIK published in 2009 showed that more than 95 percent of people who had LASIK surgery between 1995 and 2003 were satisfied with their outcome.  Public confidence in LASIK has grown in recent years due to the solid success rate of LASIK surgery outcomes . The U.S. military also has adopted widespread use of laser eye surgery to decrease reliance of troops on corrective eyewear. As of 2008, more than 224,000 military personnel had undergone laser vision correction. Since the procedure first was introduced in the military in 2000, researchers have conducted more than 45 studies regarding safety and effectiveness of LASIK and other procedures.  LASIK outcomes have been overwhelmingly positive. Most military patients see 20/20 or better after the procedure without corrective eyewear, and the rate of complications has been very low. According to one study, only one in 112,500 patients required medical disability retirement due to complications from laser vision correction during this eight-year period.  In another study, 100 percent of pilots and other aircraft personnel from the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps who underwent custom (wavefront-guided) LASIK attained 20/20 uncorrected visual acuity within two weeks after surgery.  When questioned about their satisfaction one month after surgery, 95 percent of these patients said the procedure was helpful to their effectiveness, and 100 percent said they would recommend it to other aviators. Study results were presented at the 2008 ASCRS annual meeting.  Laser eye surgery has successfully treated millions of patients and has high patient satisfaction rates. However, as with any surgery, LASIK involves potential complications. It is important for you to weigh the benefits and risks before choosing to go ahead with surgery.  Eyewear After LASIK  Though the goal of LASIK surgery is to eliminate your need for glasses or contact lenses as much as possible, in some cases you may benefit from wearing glasses (part time or full time) after a LASIK procedure.  For example, for persistent dry eye problems after LASIK, wearing eyeglasses with photochromic lenses can help relieve photophobia (sensitivity to light) associated with dry eyes.  For cases of mild residual refractive error that don't warrant additional surgery, wearing corrective eyeglasses for specific visual tasks such as driving at night is a good choice.  If you can benefit from glasses after LASIK, choose lenses with anti-reflective coating for the best vision and comfort possible.  Also, if you're over age 40, consider progressive lenses to provide enhanced vision for reading as well as sharper distance vision.

There are individuals and organizations on the Internet, funded by LASIK surgeons, posing as "LASIK patient advocates", "LASIK experts", or LASIK education sites. Don't be fooled by these LASIK marketing scams. Any  organization that refers patients to LASIK surgeons, provides a list of LASIK surgeons, or receives money from the LASIK industry  is not looking  out for the best interest of patients.  Information on LASIK surgeon referral sites is biased and unreliable.  LASIK Considerations  LASIK is an unnecessary surgical procedure that carries risk to the organ through which we   get 80% of our  information.  LASIK surgeons routinely fail to inform prospective patients about adverse effects and long-term consequences of LASIK.  LASIK-induced vision loss cannot be corrected by glasses.  Nearsighted patients who decline to have  LASIK retain the ability to read and see up close after the age of 40 by simply removing their glasses.  LASIK is NOT medicine -- it's big business.

At the 2016 World Ophthalmology Congress, leading Lasik surgeon, Peter McDonnell, MD, is quoted admitting that Lasik creates a neurotrophic cornea , which they don't know how to prevent or treat.

It's not without risks  By Alison Smith Squire for MailOnline    Updated: 07:30 EDT, 30 November 2010                    185  View comments     The TV advert for laser eye surgery made it sound so straightforward that Lois ­Roberts didn’t think twice. ‘The idea of just being able to see perfectly as soon as I opened my eyes in the morning seemed fantastic,’ says the law graduate. She’d worn contacts and glasses for short-sightedness since she was 13-years-old and ‘really looked forward to being able to bin them’.       Regret: Lois Roberts now suffers from painfully dry eyes  ‘I also played a lot of sport such as hockey and found wearing glasses ­annoying,’ she says. Her parents thought it was such a good idea that they helped pay for the £1,500 cost as a present for her 21st birthday. Yet, instead of the simple pain-free experience Lois was led to expect, the surgery to correct her short-sightedness left her in agony for days. Worse, three years on, she still has ­painfully dry eyes as a result of damage to the nerves that stimulate tears. Lois has to apply eye drops daily - which in itself is a problem, as ­long-term use can raise the risk of chronic eye inflammation. Dry eyes can also lead to serious infections and, ultimately, even loss of vision. As well as dry eyes, Lois suffers from constant floaters and poorer night vision. ‘The floaters are like clumps of black lines and dots,’ she says. ‘I’ve been reassured they’re harmless, but they are incredibly annoying.’ Floaters occur as a result of a popular form of laser surgery in which a flap is cut into the surface of the cornea — the clear, domed part of the eyeball.    RELATED ARTICLES   Previous  1  Next        Frail and fading, Monica had weeks to live - until a new op added TEN YEARS to her life       Share this article  Share     The flap is lifted so that the laser can remove some of the corneal tissue underneath, to reshape it. But if the flap is folded back down with wrinkles in it or doesn’t adhere to the eye properly, it can result in speckles in vision. Poor night-time vision occurs because part of the cornea has been lasered incorrectly. The good news is that the surgery did correct her short-sightedness ­(previously it was minus 4.5; now she has ‘perfect’ vision). But I’m upset I wasn’t warned enough at my ­initial consultation that anything like this could happen,’ says Lois, from North Wales. ‘I would have thought much harder about it had I known the risks.’ This is far from a unique ­experience. Marketing manager Sarah Carter, 45, is taking legal action after treatment to correct severe short-sightedness (minus 6.5) left her with such dry eyes she needed further surgery. Unfortunately, this operation also went wrong, and the laser damaged the rim of her eyelids. As a result, Sarah, from Maidstone, Kent, ­suffers from painful ingrowing eyelashes, which must be plucked ­several times a month by an ­optician. She is about to undergo further eye surgery at Moorfields Eye Hospital, but there is no ­guarantee of any cure.   Five years since she had the laser eye surgery, she says: ‘I regret ever having it done. It seemed incredibly straightforward and, at the time, I was just fed up of the inconvenience of contact lenses and glasses. ‘But that was nothing compared to the agony I’ve endured since. ‘I can’t wear eye make-up any more, and my days are full of drops, ointment and constant eye irritation.’ ‘I can't wear eye make-up any more, and my days are full of drops, ointment and constant eye irritation’  Every year, 100,000 Britons undergo laser eye surgery, which alters the shape of the cornea to correct long and short-sightedness. First carried out in Britain in 1989, the technique was ­marketed as an end for the need to wear contact lenses and glasses. Since then, a whole range of ­different types of laser surgery have become available. However, some experts are ­concerned that the multi-­million-pound industry glosses over some unpleasant, and sometimes ­serious, side effects. Last year, a Which? report claimed six out of ten ­opticians offering laser eye surgery — including branches of big chains such as ­Optical Express, Optimax and Ultralase — gave unsatisfactory advice and failed to point out the risks. These include not only dry eyes, floaters and poor night vision, but also growths where the eye is cut, double vision, foggy vision, chronic eyelid inflammation and even loss of sight. Shockingly, there is no law preventing any surgeon from ­operating as an ‘eye expert’ — though the Royal College of Ophthalmologists awards a ­Certificate of Competence after a surgeon has demonstrated ­expertise in laser eye surgery. It ­recommends patients choose a surgeon with a minimum of three months’ formal training in laser eye surgery who performs at least 500 eye laser operations a year.       Laser surgery can have permanent side effects such as dry eyes and poor night vision  The Royal College says at least 75 per cent of patients undergoing laser surgery should end up with 20/20 vision. However, one in three still need glasses — and even when eyesight is successfully corrected, some will also be suffering from some sort of side-effect. The ‘overall risk’ of something going wrong with laser surgery ­— including floaters and dry eyes — is ‘less than 5 per cent’, according to its report published this year. The risk of serious complications — such as losing your eyesight — is less than 0.2 per cent. Worryingly, it admits the risk of complications at individual clinics can be as high as 40 per cent. Retired optometrist Dominic Devlin was so concerned about the lack of information about potential risks, he set up a website to help consumers. ‘As part of my research, I’ve been to consultations and have been ­surprised how little is made of potential problems that might occur,’ he says. Mr Devlin is also concerned many patients believe laser surgery is a permanent cure and think they’ll never have to wear glasses again. ‘The truth is laser eye surgery is not a lifetime fix. Side-effects from surgery mean some people will still need glasses for night-time and, as eyesight changes as we grow older, the vast majority will eventually need glasses for reading.’ Furthermore, he says, surgery can be much more painful and the recovery time might take much longer than people are sometimes led to believe. As illustrator David Holroyd, 57, learned to his cost. ‘The surgery lasted only minutes, but was terrifying. Had I known how painful it would be, I never would have had it done’  Eighteen months ago, he ­underwent laser eye surgery for short-sightedness, paying £2,600 for treatment at a private clinic near his Manchester home. ‘I’d seen a TV advert that made it look as if it was something you could have done in your lunch hour,’ he says. ‘I was ­struggling with several pairs of glasses — not only did I need bifocals generally, I also had a pair for reading.’ David says his consultation lasted 20 minutes, the ­surgery sounded straightforward and there was no mention of pain. Yet he claims that within ­seconds of starting the surgery, he was writhing in agony. My head was in a clamp so I couldn’t move, but I could feel every brush of the laser. ‘I’d had local anaesthetic drops put into my eyes, but the doctors could see from my face I was in excruciating pain. ‘I was in too much agony to even speak, let alone tell them to stop. Yet all the doctor said was: “We are aware. Try to keep still.” ‘The surgery lasted only minutes, but was terrifying. Had I known how painful it would be, I never would have had it done.’ ‘Afterwards, I was in bed for three days, followed by two weeks when my sight wasn’t good enough to go out.’ As well as the pain, like Lois and Sarah he has also been left with dry eyes for which he will need drops for the rest of his life. Now, though his sight is much better, he has been told his eyes will be permanently dry. ‘I just feel angry that I wasn’t warned about any of this,’ he says. Mr Devlin is campaigning for a proper independent body where patients can seek advice and complain to if surgery goes wrong. He points out that contact lenses are much more sophisticated and cause fewer problems than they did 20 years ago and may be a safer option than laser surgery. ‘If you have a problem with ­contact lenses or glasses, you can pop back to the opticians where it can be easily rectified,’ he says. ‘But adverse side effects from laser surgery might be ­irreversible and permanent.’ Dominic Devlin’s website can be found at laser-eye-surgery-review.com      Share or comment on this article                                      Three men are charged with gang raping a 22-year-old...

(©Thinkstock)          While most see improvements from Lasik eye surgery, it comes with risks of severe dry eye to vision loss.      About 600,000 Lasik procedures are performed annually in the U.S., according to the Food and Drug Administration. The elective surgery — which clinicians say costs an average of $2,000 per eye, an expense not typically covered by insurance — is used to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism, a visual defect resulting in blurred vision.  The industry boasts a success rate in the high 90 percent range, but not everyone is happy with Lasik.  According to the FDA's own analysis of patient complaints, some people develop debilitating visual issues, such as double vision, glare or vision loss. In laying out the Lasik risks , the agency also notes issues with both overtreatment and undertreatment of patients.     Who should I see to discuss Lasik? Dr. Stephen Slade , a Houston ophthalmologist , was involved in the first FDA trials of Lasik, before laser technology was approved for the procedure in the U.S. in 1998. He suggests people considering the surgery pick a doctor they trust. In particular, Slade recommends seeing an eye doctor who's done thousands of cases, who is respected by peers, even someone who's taught other doctors.  Many surgeons fit that description, he says. He believes a doctor should also be equipped to provide alternative options to Lasik. Slade says an ophthalmologist's staff should be concerned about the patient, and the doctor should answer questions.  Related: 4 Must-Ask Lasik Questions  "I would not go to a place that pressures me," he says. "I also wouldn't want to go to a doctor who told me the surgery was perfect, I wouldn't have to wear glasses anymore, and [who] guaranteed I'd see great after surgery, because that's not true."  He adds that he doesn't know of a surgery with a higher success rate and lower complications. But, as with any surgery, there are risks of Lasik. These include dry eye, hazy or blurred vision and temporary sensitivity to light.            Not everyone is an ideal candidate for Lasik eye surgery. Make sure to discuss the risks and side effects of the procedure before deciding whether to proceed. (©Thinkstock)    Is Lasik eye surgery worth it, and what are the risks? Lasik permanently changes cornea shape, making it harder to measure later. So if you plan to undergo the procedure, first have your doctor fill out a card containing your eye measurements. You can download a refractive surgery information card for this purpose.  A small study published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology in 2008 found about one in five who had Lasik to correct nearsightedness underwent another procedure within 10 years because of undercorrection, overcorrection or regression.  John Ciccone, a spokesman for the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery, puts the overall number for touch-up surgeries at closer to 7 to 10 percent.  Ophthalmologists say lasers are safer and more precise than ever, and the sheer number of cases is making it easier for doctors to predict who will do well with the procedure. "The first thing people need to do is find out if they're a good candidate," Slade says.     Who is a candidate for Lasik surgery? The best candidates are adults with a stable prescription — their eyes aren't worsening. Many medical conditions, including cornea disease, unstable diabetes and various types of arthritis reduce the chances of a successful procedure.  Dr. David Whiting , an ophthalmologist based near Minneapolis , says 85 to 90 percent of his patients who want Lasik are good candidates. But Whiting, who has done more than 100,000 Lasik procedures, concedes there's a gray area.     Will laser eye surgery lead to follow-up treatment? In addition to Lasik eye surgery risks and complications that some suffer, many require glasses or contacts right after Lasik.  Ciccone says most who get Lasik do so to correct nearsightedness, and many have presbyopia, a common condition with age in which the eyes lose their ability to focus up close.  For those with presbyopia, the same Lasik procedure that grants distance vision also prompts the need for reading glasses. "They didn't realize they were presbyopic to begin with, they were using their nearsightedness to read," Ciccone says.  Some solve the problem by fixing one eye for distance and another for close-up, or what's called monovision. About 25 percent of Lasik patients over 40 opt for this, Whiting says. Of those — maybe one in 10 — need Lasik on just one eye.  Related: 5 Lasik Alternatives  For most, Lasik opened their eyes in a way glasses and contacts couldn't. It's also become safer following millions of completed procedures.  "It's not an iffy procedure," says ophthalmologist Dr. Alan Brown in Wilmington, North Carolina, who received Lasik surgery on his eyes.  But because Lasik was only approved in 1998 by the FDA, the agency says the long-term safety and effectiveness of the procedure remains unknown.  Have you undergone Lasik eye surgery?

Will it keep increasing? I never used glasses for such a lower prescription but now in this job I have started to feel pain on the back of my left eye when I focus on screen and it remains after I stop seeing it, I have this pain for about 2 weeks now and ophthalmologist has only answer , "Don't use computer at night, night is for sleep, and also try to change your job description, glasses wont help etc". I don't agree,  and I am sure this strain or CVS has something to do with LASIK, I forced him into giving me prescription for glasses, he gave me 0.5 in both eyes and said, "We docs don't give full prescription or your prescription may further increase, let eye fight a bit." When I feel strain I feel it in my temples, shoulder, back, neck and sometimes behind head too. Pain doesn't let me work. . By using glasses things seem to get better for one week, but now its looks like they are getting back to same. Strain is moving from eye to other parts of body again like shoulder, neck etc. It looks like CVS (computer vision syndrome) but I am sure it has something to do with LASIK. Any idea what should I do to prevent CVS in my one eye and to prevent my prescription increase further?     reply to Ammar          Srini  2 years ago   Subject: lasek done 2 weeks ago      Hi  I am 33 male and working as software consultant I done lasek 2 weeks ago , from past 2 days I feeling double vision and hazeness, I have to work on computer 8 hours a day, it's comman issue after lasek or its like a complication , Iam worried about my vision. Can some one please suggest me on this??     reply to Srini          Emily  1 year ago   Subject: Eye strain after surgery      Srini, using computer screens for a long period of time can cause eye strain, which is not good after eye surgury. Usually it is due to bright light and lower rate of blinking that dries out the eye. Posture and strained focus on one point (the computer) can also be an issue. This can be curbed by wearing sunglasses, using eyedrops correctly, and pausing each 20 minutes to focus on something across the room. Consider talking to a doctor or consultant about eyesight office hazards, and someone who can help with surgical complications.     reply to Emily          monica  1 year ago   Subject: lasik surgery went wrong      I understand how you feel. I had the surgery done in 2014 and I feel I made a biggest mistake in my life. I wish I could have read all about the Lasik surgery before I go under knife. The worse is the doctor don't care if any you have trouble with your eyes after surgery. I called my doctor and told him about my eyes he did not care . All they care is to make money and pay their own bills. They don't care if you have problem with complications , once you signed the contest you are done. So if any body reads this its true don't fall for this advertising that you can see well . It is nothing but illusion . Stick with your contact lenses or glasses, it is the best. I know that doctor says  you will enjoy seeing with out help of contact lenses. it is not true you still need contact lenses after that . every thing so blurry . At the time of surgery my instinct was telling me not to do it and I told to my doctor I do not want to proceed even though I paid in advance and he said I can not give your money back so might as well do the Lasik . I felt I was so much pressured to do the surgery now I do not where to go or who do I complain about my doctor. I lost my money and I lost my vision.     reply to monica          Nancy Burleson MD  1 year ago   Subject: If your vision does not      If your vision does not improve, seek a second opinion with an opthalmologist that treats complications of Lasik.

Even with all the information you provided, we're not in a position to do what only an eye doctor should and weigh in on your specific case. For clarification on whether or not you're a candidate for LASIK, you'll want to speak with an eye doctor you trust and get a second opinion if you feel additional perspective is warranted.

Paul  3 years ago   Subject: Lasik...the good and bad      I began needing glasses in the 3rd Grade.  I wore contacts from 10th Grade until my eyes became too sensitive to them.  I had Lasik performed on both eyes in 1997 and enjoyed great vision (except at night due to astigmatism) until about two years ago.  I will be 52 next month.  I do a lot of computer work and that puts a lot of strain on my eyes.  I have been suffering with blurry vision and headaches.  I finally had enough and got prescription computer glasses for the 1 1/2 to 3 feet away range.  I also got prescription progressive bifocals for driving at night due to astigmatism and some return of nearsightedness.  Both have helped but I still cannot seem to get both eyes corrected properly for astigmatism and I wonder if the monovision from lasik is the problem.  I have had my correction changed twice and it is still not right.  I get dizzy from my eyes fighting back and forth to focus when wearing the driving glasses.  One day the prescription seems ok and the next, one eye seems blurry and weak.  I also have been noticing blue flashes of light when watching tv or at the theater.  It is always in my left eye and seems to follow the curvature of the cornea...from about the 11 o'clock position down to 7 o'clock.   I am thinking it may be the bluish-white light from the tv hitting a refractive surface/scar tissue from the lasik surgery.  Like light shimmering off a facet of a diamond.  Just a guess...  If I had to do it again, I would definitely have Lasik.  To this day, during daylight hours, I can see very well into the distance.  My eyes are now undergoing changes from aging, but, glasses are correcting that, I have still have the freedom to swim and bike and do many other things without glasses getting in the way or a contact drying out or falling out.     reply to Paul          Deepak  3 years ago   Subject: Advice required      I am 22 year old male. 10 years ago, I had a condition called retinal vasculitis.

  Angie's List   Subject: Re: alternatives to LASIK      Hi Deepak,  Unfortunately, I can't say offhand, and I don't want to speculate. However, I would expect another eye doctor could look at the specifics of your case and properly advise you. In general, it's always a good idea to seek a second opinion if a medical provider can't, or won't, answer your questions.        -Michael Schroeder, senior writer, Angie's List     reply to Michael Schroeder          Gabriele  4 years ago   Subject: t      True enough, free government grants are intended increase the economy of the nation by way of helping people and organizations.

I failed my driver's vision test with Texas DPS.  Now I am seeing 20/20 out of each eye and 20/15 when both are used.  I renewed my driver's license with no restrictions 3 hours ago and I am vaery happy about that!  I did lose some close up vision and need reading glasses for very small print like ingrediants on certain products.  I do not need reading glasses for books with normal print size.  The technology is here now.  If you are a candidate I say get 'er done!  It's like all of the road signs are shouting at me and typing in all caps at the same time!  From a half a mile away!  I love my new eyes. eric     reply to eric          Ronadl Kauffman  6 years ago   Subject: Lasik      After having lasik done I was diagnosed with cataracts. I have had one eye corrected, with the other one not yet being degraded to the point of having surgery. When I went in to have the 1st eye fixed I was informed that my eyesight would have had a better chance of being corrected to 20/20 if I had not had lasik. The lasik has been good, but I wish I had been informed that as you get older & cataracts are more likely that it is better not to have lasik.     reply to Ronadl Kauffman          rkcorp  6 years ago   Subject: 12 years and going strong      quick, off the top of my head story....i had Lasiks done in 2000 in california by a canadian company, lasiksvision, that at the time was opening locations all over the place. i paid a grand for both eyes. it was their grand opening promotion. my sister had it done a couple weeks after me. so did a friend. I'm still glasses-free 12 years later. my sister just got herself some glasses for night time driving and the optometrist couldn't even detect that Lasiks was done. the friend didn't fair as well. he had problems straight off the Bausch-Lomb machine. his experience sounds very similar to most of the ones I've read above, so i won't repeat here. but i will add... he wears glasses now and is fine. but of course, wishes he never had gone thru the experience. however, he had whacky eyes to begin with, was in hi late 40s, and had a hardcore coke bottle rx. somehow he was told he was a good candidate, but in all reality, from the start, i don't think he was. the bummer at the time was, he's the one who was all gung-ho about it and got my sister and i to go for it!  my experience has been very good. i was early 30s at the time. i saw perfectly straight off the table... altho the doctor was yelling at me to stop straining and close my eyes! i was reading license plates and street signs all the way home. the doctors and nurses set up my post operative side-effects really well. i had the halo effect for about a year and was dropping eye drops frequently that first year as well. but it was nothing compared to being able to read the clock straight out of bed, snorkel without glasses, drive without glasses, on and on. when i wore contact lenses my eyes were so bloodshot and dry ALL time time. this was a miracle procedure for me. my vision was perfect and dropping a few drops thru out the day was no burden at all. 12 years on now... tired eyes usually means a couple eye drops are in order. this was the best thing i think i ever did for myself.  had i read all these negative experiences, i doubt i would have gone for it. but i had friends who were going to canada at the time to have this done and they couldn't say enough positive things about it! i also don't think i would do it past the age of 40. by that time, age related eye changes are a huge factor and if you can't have a result that will allow you to NOT wear glasses, it's not really worth the money to have the procedure just for a slightly different rx. in my opinion. if you are in your 20s or 30s, with a stable eye rx, healthy, and find a doctor who has done this a mazillion times.... i wouldn't rule it out as an option. both my sister and i highly recommend. 12 years glass free and counting.     reply to rkcorp          Susan Marren  6 years ago   Subject: Get a second opinion      As with any surgery, a second opinion is necessary.  If you have big pupils, you WILL see haloes. If you have borderline dry eye, it WILL be worse after LASIK. If you are over 40, you may well have problems needing reading glasses.  LASIK is surgeon-dependent. You are not legally blind if you can be corrected with glasses.  For someone with severe nearsightedness, consider waiting until you need cataract surgery if you are older.  A good second opinion should pick up any incipient keratoconus, dry eye, and make recommendations for those with big pupils or who are older.  When you get older, your up close vision becomes more important. If you want to go monovision, be sure you try it with contacts first because not everyone can stand it. The better your binocularity, the less likely you can tolerate one eye being blurred all the time. And contacts can also help you decide which eye to correct for far away.  Don't let them guess.  I am a retired optometric educator, a profession that has been unfairly scorned by Angie's List, but we do know a lot more than many think.  Lasik is best for the person who wants to wake up able to see but who doesn't think he or she will get perfect vision.     reply to Susan Marren          Paula Cofer  6 years ago   Subject: LASIK is a harmful surgery      Go to LasikComplications.com and read Top Ten Reasons Not to Have LASIK.

I can say without reservations it was the best money I ever spent. It's 12 years later and because of age I am starting to have less than 20/20 vision in my left eye. The right eye still sees 20/15. I will need reading glasses as I age, but my Dr told me that I would before I had the surgery at some point in the future.      reply to Lonnie          Paul  6 years ago   Subject:      Remember, you get what you paid for. I had my my eyes done 4 years ago with no problems. I also avoided cheap newspaper ads and used my own eye specialist. My eyes are worth much more than $450 an eye.

Waking up that first morning and seeing the alarm clock brought me to tears.  My life is no longer controlled by glasses and contacts.  I especially realized that when I packed for the first vacation following surgery.  Realizing I didn't have to pack 14 pair of contacts, solution and glasses, was just 1 of many little reminders of how happy I am with the outcome.  I have had NO side effects.  My husband had the surgery 2 years before I did and we're both so happy with the results.      reply to Jennifer          S.

It was wonderful!! I was ecstatic! But, as time wore on, and now it's been 6 years since I had LASIK, my vision has since deteriorated. No one told me LASIK wasn't permanent. I thought I'd see 20/20 forever. Now I'm back to wearing glasses. Wish I would have known that before I plumped down the $3,000. If I knew $3,000 would only have me glasses-free for 5 years I wouldn't have undergone the procedure.     reply to S. Smith         View More Replies - 1  Hide Replies  Loading...

Six years in and my vision started to revert. I went to another well known Dr. for his opinion and he said I had cataracts ( I was now 54 y/o ) I went back to the well known Dr that did the surgery and he said that the monvision would be done again for for the same fee minus a 10% discount. He never said a word about the cataracts after his exam. I asked for my medical records and never went back. Now I do not know if I can trust having cataract surgery done.     reply to nan brinkley          Jim Jerge  6 years ago   Subject:      I had lasik on both eyes approximately 10 years ago at the age of 56.  I was wearing tri focals prior to lasik and required reading glasses following the procedure. I was happy with the results for approximately  4 years when my vision began to deteriorate and eventually I was wearing tri focals again.  I was not eligible for a "touch up" because I had developed cataracts.  I did not have cataracts prior to lasik.  The cataracts are now obscuring my vision and I am awaiting a lens implant, but I can not get the info about my cornea prior to the cataract surgery.  I'm being told that due to the lasik I am not a candidate for the most recent multi focal lens.  In addition, the results for lasik patients is often not as good as for non-lasik patients.      reply to Jim Jerge          Jeff Williams  3 years ago   Subject: Cataracts and Laski      I had cataract surgery April 2014 both eyes - I was told I legally blind. Prior to surgery I was told that I was not a candidate for the multi-focal lens. I was also told I would still need reading glasses. I was told that my long distance vision after surgery would be more crisp with glasses. I passed my vision exam for my drivers drivers license renewal but I had to close one eye as my left eye was still swollen after surgery a month prior. It is now eight months later and I am considering Lasik to correct the astigmatism which is supposed to increase or correct the crispness of my long distance vision. I will be 70 next June. I am still undecided on Lasik but struggle with my glasses - distortion and bluriness unless looking straight ahead. I have a mild astigmatism RX with a blended 2.50 reading glasses in my glasses. I'd love to just have reading glasses after Laski. What to do! I'm going for a second opinion.     reply to Jeff Williams          Nancy PH  6 years ago   Subject:      To Bryan Rickerson:  I had worn glasses since I was 10 years old & in 2006 I had custom Lasik on my right eye for correction & PTK (which was tweaked for correction) on the left to treat anterior membrane dystrophy.  The right eye ended up under-corrected.  I opted to keep it that way since it preserved my near vision, so I now have monovision.  Which is great!  I only wear glasses for very up-close work or driving at night in fog in an unfamiliar location.  However, I was still left with an exquisitely  painful area in my left eye from the AMD which is exacerbated by dryness, especially upon awakening.  Neither of my eyes seems to produce enough tears at night, frequent eye drops did not help - not to mention the sleep disruption from using them.  I started using Muro 128 5% Sterile Ophthalmic Eye Ointment at night (per my ophthalmologist), which help a lot.  Coincidentally, I also take a medication for another condition which causes dry mouth, especially at night, & complained to my primary doctor about it.  I was tested for Sjogren’s disease, which was negative.   Still she still started me on Evoxac at night, a cholinergic agent used to treat dry mouth in patients with Sjogren's syndrome.  Side effects are many (as with all medications), but besides helping with dry mouth, it also seems to produce enough tears to prevent my left eye pain upon awakening.  A Godsend!  I rarely have pain upon awakening & rarely use the Muro 128, never use eye drops at night.  Even with  this problem, I would still have had both  surgeries done again.  I was not able to even walk around safely without glasses before.  One has to make trade-offs in most things in life or take no risks at all.      reply to Nancy PH          Steve Richfield  6 years ago   Subject:      Clearly more serious research is needed for both LASIK and cataract implants. As things now stand, any research that the providers do will promptly be used against them in court by people who have had problems with their procedures. Hence, there is NO research money available except to improve procedures. I have problems with both eyes, but am waiting as long as I can for things to improve before either having LASIK that will threaten future implants, or getting implants that will make it impossible to upgrade as future technology becomes available. Note that Aspheric Crystalens, the premier implant, has only been available since January.  Is anyone here interested in forming an independent study group to close on these and related issues?      reply to Steve Richfield          ST  6 years ago   Subject:      I had LASIK on both eyes approximately 11 years ago.  It was wonderful because I could see the clock next to my bed when I awoke.  However, I now have cataracts in both eyes, and the optomologist wants me to wait on surgery as long as I can.  He says that the surgery is more problematic for those who have had LASIK.  Just a thought -      reply to ST          DE  6 years ago   Subject:      I have to agree with the first responder.  10 years after having RK (Radial Keratotomy)my vision started to rapidly decrease.  After consulting many different specialists, it was determined that I suffered from keratoconus (basically, a sagging and bulging cornea).  I'm sure the RK either brought on, or accentuated the problem.  Now I'm struggling just to see properly, and have to be fitted with very special...very EXPENSIVE...contacts, and am considering corneal replacements in my future.  Make SURE you have a complete understanding of the health of your eyes before ever considering any type of surgery.  What may be great now, could become a major complication in your future.      reply to DE          CJC  6 years ago   Subject:      The best money I have ever spent was on LASIK surgery over three years ago.  I now can see 20/15 with both eyes (20/20 for each) and couldn't be happier.  No dry eyes, no hazy vision, and my night vision was perfectly fine after recovering for a few months.  But I also did my homework in choosing a surgeon, not even considering a "cheap" solution.  As soon as people start thinking LASIK is a commodity, then they'll start getting equivalent results.      reply to CJC          David T  6 years ago   Subject:      I had LASIK done on both eyes, I have Monovision.  My son and wife also had Lasik and only my wife had to have it TWEAKED.  We all three are very happy with the results. For me it was a miracle.  I had been using glasses/contacts since 1965 and it was in 2003/2004 that I no longer needed them and could play with my grandkids in the pool and beach.  I know that it was not for everyone, but for us it was Great.      reply to David T          Bryan Rickerson  6 years ago   Subject:      Last April, I had Epi-Lasik done on both of my eyes from a nationwide chain of lasik specialists.  I have noticed several side effects that haven't gone away.  However, as many of these side effects are LESS severe than the contact lenses I used to wear, I can say that I thoroughly enjoy having clear vision.  I do wake up in the morning with painfully dry eyes, and sometimes have to wake up in the middle of the night to put drops in. However, I do not have to reach for glasses just to see an alarm clock.  I am the positive statistic. I did the research, took the risk, and it (so far) has paid off for me.      reply to Bryan Rickerson          John H  6 years ago   Subject:      Great article, but it only covers the surface. The Lasik profession tells people they have 20/20, but it may be less. In my case it is less. Good article, but more needs to be investigated. I suspect 50% of the outcomes are substandard.      reply to John H          CB  6 years ago   Subject:      I had the RK surgery many years ago and by ten years later, suffered what is called corneal dystrophy, which is common in patients who have refractive surgeries.  I had the misfortune to be advised by a couple of doctors that I needed to have a transplant.  I felt helpless and went on the advice, I now have been living legally blind for the last 7 years since my transplant, with no hope of improvement, and if anything, constantly having severe changes in my eyes due to unstable corneas.  I also came to find out that I should not have been a candidate for a transplant, there were many other non-surgical options out there - but now it's too late.  My advice is - DO NOT have these surgeries, there has not been enough time to really know what the long term effects will be.  I am the statistic and it is not worth losing your sight over what seems like a temporary miracle.      reply to CB          jinnybrow  6 years ago   Subject:      Is it possible for Angie's List to do the same kind of article about Lasik 2, the second level procedure?

I wear glasses now (15+ years later) and won't get my left cataract fixed until I have to.  My vision in the right eye after cataract surgery is now 20/200 - not great! Investigate this aspect completely before having the surgery.      reply to MEA          James J. Salz, M. D.  6 years ago   Subject:      The email responses illustrate that although LASIK is highly successful with a very low incidence of complications, it is not risk free and it is not appropriate for all eyes. Dr. Slade gives good advice as to how to look for a good surgeon, there is no hurry, get more than one opinion.  Many patients who have had problems were most likely not good candidates and should not have had the surgery. One excellent way to find a good surgeon is to contact an eye surgeon in your area who does not perform LASIK and ask him or her for a recommendation. They know the good surgeons.      reply to James J. Salz, M. D.          K  6 years ago   Subject:      I have worked with LASIK doctors for over 10 years now. Just for clarification. Over 90% of patients are extremely happy with their procedure. The surgery is not complicated or painful. When surveyed, patients often site it as one of the 5 best things they have done in their life, after marriage, children, and graduating college. The actual procedure takes about 10-15 minutes. A re-treatment or enhancement means you will have the surgery again. Most good surgeons have a re-treatment/enhancement rate of 5% or less. Normally those requiring re-treatment are those with more complicated prescriptions. Although very few need re-treatment it is not the end of the world. It is just another 10-15 minute procedure. Most doctors will do re-treatments within a year at no charge if needed. RK and PRK are not LASIK and experience for the patient is quite different. You can't compare them to one another. Both RK and PRK are more invasive then LASIK. RK was a procedure performed in the early 80's. PRK in the late 80's to early 90's and LASIK from the mid 90's until today. LASIK has only gotten better and safer over the years. In the past, there was new technology that improved outcomes every couple years, there is very little in the research pipeline right now, so if you are waiting until it gets even better, you will be waiting a long time. LASIK corrects over 90% to 20/40, the majority to 20/20. There are two commponents to the surgery: 1) the creation of the flap and 2) the actual laser treatment. For the creation of the flap, the surgeon can use a keratome or a femtosecond laser. Most complications occur with the keratome method and I recommend a femtosecond laser. For the laser treatement, you can have standarad of custom treatment. A standard treatement treats your prescription but doesn't look at all the irregularities of your eye. Custom treats not only your prescription, but also the other irregularities of your eye that make your vision unique.  I had LASIK in 99. Still 20/20 today and ranks in the top 4 events of my life. That is why I am in this industry. If I were in my 20's or 30's, I would get the surgery as soon as possible, assuming my vision is stable, to get the most out of it and select custom and a femtosecond laser. If I was over 40 and considering it, I would still do it, but know I will have to wear reading glasses or have only one eye corrected to see at a distance. If I was over 50, I would talk to my doctor about my options - could go either way here. If I was over 60, I would wait until I developed a cataract and opt for a Premium IOL at that time since insurance would cover a portion of the cost.      reply to K          Candice M  6 years ago   Subject:      I had my vision corrected in April 2000 at the age of 20 at what was then one of the leading clinics in MN (I no longer live in MN so I can't speak for their status now.)  We paid for the expertise, but it was worth every penny to me, being able to see to swim, exercise, etc. I had been legally blind since I was 6 or 7.  It's not perfect - my vision is 20/20 and 20/30, which, to me, is great!  But I've experienced halos at night and occasional haziness (particularly when I'm tired.)  However, that isn't much different that what I experienced when I wore contacts or glasses - looking through those was very similar.      reply to Candice M          Margot  6 years ago   Subject:      I didn't notice a reference to ORTHO K treatment. It is also known by another name, but I forget what it is. You sleep in hard contact lenses that reshape your cornea. In the a.m., you take them out and zip around without need of contacts or glasses. For some, you can go every other night with sleeping in the lenses. I did this for five years and it worked great for me, with the exception that sometimes it was hard to put a lens in, and increasingly I had to use eye drops. Now I'm back to glasses: trifocals      reply to Margot          S  6 years ago   Subject:      The doctor is the most critical part of getting a good Lasik procedure. Mine was done over 10 years ago in San Diego by a famous (now dead) doctor who even invented a better tool for eye surgery. I wish I could go back to him for any additional work, if needed later. I'd be most interested in finding a really good eye surgeon in East Texas now that we retired here. I hope Angie's List will recommend one or more.      reply to S          Karen  6 years ago   Subject:      I forgot to mention that when I complain to my expensive doctor's office about these side effects, they do not note them in my file.  This makes me think that they are not reporting them as complications.  I have read other things that suggest this is their practice - as long as you can read 20/20, even if you have to squint and it looks inferior because of the increased glare, you get reported as a complete success.      reply to Karen          Karen  6 years ago   Subject:      I had Lasik two years ago and although the surgery was generally successful (I now see about 20/15), I have permanent side effects: 1) slightly dry eyes (no big deal), b) starbursts around lights (enough to make me nervous about driving at night, which I rarely do at this point in my life), c) halo effect (fuzzy light around the edges of any lighter objects in my view, including white letters on movie screens, sunlight-filled windows, etc.); and d) a general sensitivity to very bright light.  My surgeon (who had done many surgeries, is well respected and charged lots of money) made it sound as if any problems with the surgery could be corrected, but now they tell me that these problems cannot be corrected.  Overall, I'm still probably slightly happier with my life now (no need for contacts, etc.) but given the expense and the risk of future complications, I wish I had not done it.      reply to Karen          Moore  6 years ago   Subject:      I had two rounds of Lasik surgery in 2001.  I would be 20/20 in the operating room, but by the next morning vision would start sliding back.  The Dr. refused to redo it again, so I wore glasses until my cataracts were removed four years later.  It was hard for the surgeon to figure out my base vision but I ended up with 20/30 vision, which is wonderful to this person who grew up in Coke bottle glasses with ulcers on both sides of my nose.  I now wear glasses to read only.      reply to Moore          JM  6 years ago   Subject:      First of all, I have to say that I’m not in a position to give unbiased information about refractive surgery. Before lasik, I was a happy, positive, productive person.  I wore glasses or contacts and presbyopia was setting in, so I thought it would be much less expensive in the long run and more convenient to get lasik and then simply need reading glasses rather than needing to have contacts, glasses, bifocals, etc. and be juggling them all.  What I wouldn’t give to be able to pop in some contacts or put on some glasses and be able to see again.  Very seriously, the ONLY reason I have lived through this is because of the overwhelming support and understanding of the compassionate people on a support site for lasik victims called lasermyeye.org,  two friends who had experience with massive depression, and my family who has so kindly cared for me while this terrible decision has also ruined the life they once knew I went to a very well-known clinic where the doctor had performed thousand of procedures and was highly respected and had been in business for many years.  Initially, my  damaged  vision was my biggest problem.  That was what sent me into a massive, suicidal depression for months. Then the dry eye set in.  Since lasik, my dry eyes are painful every minute of the day.  I begin the day flooding them with drops while my husband brings me a warm cloth to lay over them.  I then go into the bathroom where I’m unable to see details of my face in the mirror.   I look clown like if I try to apply makeup.  I put flax seed on toast for breakfast to try to help with dry eye and then I take fish oil pills after that.  After breakfast I refill the two humidifiers that run nonstop in my house.  I have finally accepted that I will no longer be able to participate in the hobbies I used to enjoy due to my vision issues, but living with the pain of dry eye is something you simply cannot understand until you have experienced it.  It is not a problem that is solved by putting some eye drops in.  The pain often emanates from the socket and it’s often tempting to gouge your eyeballs out.  I once thought it was inconvenient to travel with contacts, solution, soap and glasses.  Now when I travel (which is ONLY when necessary),  I take several strengths of reader glasses, bifocals, fish oil, drops, a humidifier, swim goggles, onion goggles, anti-anxiety medication.  I am almost never able to see in the dim lighting of most hotel rooms.  Our oldest daughter graduated from college and we helped her move to Midland, Texas  (better known as hell for dry eye patients) for her new job.   I struggled to get through the days, trying to hide my pain from her so that this could be an exciting experience for her.  There is never a minute of the day that I forget about my eyes - NOT ONE MINUTE.  Please don’t let yourself be put in this same situation.  I don’t want one more person joining this blog because they’re in pain. I have no confidence in myself anymore because I can’t believe I made a decision that ruined not only my life, but that of my family.  My children just want their old Mom back and that will never happen.  It’s one thing to ruin my own life, but entirely another thing to have affected so many people I love.  At the end of the day, any refractive surgery is unpredictable.  PLEASE hear what I’m trying to tell those of you who are here to gather information to make a decision as to whether or not to have lasik or prk.  Read between the lines and hear the sadness; do not think that it can’t happen to you.  We were all normal people JUST LIKE YOU and now our lives are changed forever.  Some people have coped much better than I have and that seems to be associated with the ability to find good care, which I have not been successful in doing.  My life, as well as many others, is consumed daily with dealing with the vision and dry eye problems.  It’s not even possible to adjust because it is such a dynamic situation.  Vision changes daily and may worsen with time and the same is true for dry eye.  The games this situation plays with your head can make you crazy.  Do I use lots of drops or will that make my body think I don’t need to produce as many, continuing the dry eye cycle?  If I use fewer drops, will that damage my  cornea further?  Will restasis help, is it worth the cost or will we discover horrible side effects from it down the road?  Should I get punctual plugs?  Oops, one fell out; or is part of it still in the canal?  Research, research, research….   What foods help dry eye?  Okay, I need more potassium; what foods have that?  Who do I trust now?  Do I try rgps or will they be to painful to wear?  Is it worth the cost to go to Dr. G?  I spent $4000 for this??!  I feel like a freak wearing these goggles, but sometimes they‘re the only thing that gives me relief from the pain.  Will I be need cataract surgery that will ruin my vision even more or worse yet, will I need a cornea transplant because my corneas were too thin to have been operated on in the first place???  I’m amazed that my husband has stuck with me through this.  What have I done to my family??! I have read of so many younger people who have been forced to change careers because of the damage from refractive surgery.  Do not simply read over the information that you do not want to hear.  I would have given anything to have been fortunate enough to come across this information  before I chose to have lasik.  There is no way I would have had the surgery if I had known of any of these complications.  Count your lucky stars that you found this site and do not ignore the information you find and dismiss it because it does not support your desire.  When they tell you no one has ever been blinded by refractive surgery, know that they don’t count people who end up with ectasia that requires a cornea transplant.  It doesn’t matter if you see 6 “E’s” on the chart, or starbursts around it, or if it is blurry or if you’re in terrible pain, the doctors will say you’re great.  Also,  no one EVER asked me if I was satisfied with my surgery.   As others have said more eloquently than I, all of the data is skewed.  It is not possible for me to convey how utterly miserable the consequences of this surgery can be.  Although I am no longer imminently suicidal, I would still welcome death as a relief.  I am simply trying to hold on a few more years for my children.  I realized that even though I can’t do any of the things their old Mom did, I can still love them more than anyone on earth and they need that until their own lives are more grounded.  I now live in constant pain from both vision and dry eye problems.  I live in fear of the future because it will all get worse.  I WAS YOU - DON’T HAVE REFRACTIVE SUGERY!!  I BEG YOU!!!      reply to JM          Karina  3 years ago   Subject: I am having the same problem or worst      Please email me im having all the problems mentioned not exaggerating really, and much more. Starburst, never ending light streaks day or night.... from sun reflections car headlights (at night)and lights. How have you managed to stay alive,  I'm finding it real hard and I too am a mother of two beautiful children that I live with all my heart and soul.     reply to Karina          LisaO  3 years ago   Subject: I'm so sorry JM      what a horrible circumstance JM. I'm truly sorry for you.  Nobody should have to endure what you've described.  I hope that your situation has somehow improved since your comment is from two years ago.     reply to LisaO          STexas  6 years ago   Subject:      I had this surgery done approximately 1 year ago.  Unlike the comment above from someone who works with an ophthalmologist, the procedure was quite painful – like sand in my eyes for several days.  I feel that this was minimized by the ophthalmologist.  Nevertheless, the pain resolved in short order and my DISTANCE vision is better than 20/20.  The other issue – and I feel as if I was adequately forewarned regarding this issue and I minimized it – is now my close-up vision is horrible. I can no longer read anything without reading glasses.  This is a much bigger problem than I ever imagined.  I love to read for pleasure and I need to read for work and lastly, I love to work on projects around my house and now I am constantly hunting for reading glasses.  I have taken to strategically placing reading glasses all over my house, car, and office. So, I got what I wanted however, if you are over 40 years old and are considering the surgery be prepared to need reading glasses.      reply to STexas          S. Smith  3 years ago   Subject: Stexas, I had the same      Stexas, I had the same situation. Before LASIK I was near-sighted, and could see perfectly fine up close. I could read the tiniest of print. After LASIK corrected my distance vision, I could no longer see up close. I wish I would have been informed of this prior to the surgery, but I was not. I also was not told that LASIK was not permanent. I'm not an opthamologist- I figured if they lasered your cornea and changed the shape of it, it was a permanent solution. I thought my distance vision would remain 20/20 just like it did right after the procedure. It did not. About 5 years after LASIK my distance vision began to deteriorate. I'm now back to wearing glasses for distance.     reply to S. Smith          Jon  6 years ago   Subject:      In Lasik or PRK, they are essentially burning away cells in the reshaping of the cornea. There is a protective (epithelial) layer of cells over the cornea that must be removed before the reshaping happens. Lasik involves cutting and pulling back a hinged flap of that epithelial layer, but doing so takes some of the corneal cells with it, leaving less material to shape. PRK uses a chemical and/or abrasive tool to completely remove a thinner layer of cells leaving more cornea to work with. The flap created during Lasik is put back in place as a natural bandage, although there seems to be debate over whether that flap really heals, or if it is just held in place by surface tension. The removal of cells in PRK forces the eye to regrow that top layer resulting in a much slower and painful healing process, but potentially a more stable eye/cornea surface.  I did a lot of the research and went to the best Doctor around. Dr. Scott MacRae who is a leading researcher in refractive surgery, has several patents on the technology, "wrote the book on Lasik (literally)", trains other Doctors, etc. His office gives a short seminar typically every Saturday for potential patients to learn about the different options and the risks involved. The price there is expensive but not unreasonable considering you don't want to go "bargain basement" on an eye procedure.  I was given a lot of warning and material on the known risks and success statistics. Being effectively blind without glasses or contacts (beyond 20/400), AND having an astigmatism that they could never correct quite right with lenses, I was willing to take the risk. I was not a candidate for Lasik due to the severity of my prescription (-7 diopters + astigmatism) and the amount of cornea I had to work with. I was however "approved" for PRK with custom astigmatism correction and decided to try it on just one eye. The procedure was painless and quick, and getting up off of the table I had fuzzy vision of probably 20/40 or maybe slightly worse. Healing was quite painful for a week or so but the vicodin and other drugs helped. Within a month or so I had 20/20 vision in that eye which healed cleanly and completely with no scarring (phew). Follow up visits were thorough and frequent, then monthly, every 3 months etc. For some people the dry eye and the halos/star-bursts around lights at night go away. Several of my friends had Lasik at the same office with great results (so far).  3 years later - I have piece of mind for never having to worry about losing a contact or breaking/forgetting glasses and being effectively blind as a result. I can see when I wake up and if I'm outside on a bright sunny day I feel like I can see for miles in the treated eye. For me the dry eye is very manageable with only needing drops in the morning occasionally. However, the halos and star-bursts have never lessened or gone away, and this can be very distracting in situations like a movie theater, and more importantly, driving. Additionally, my vision at night has less contrast. I still wear a contact in the other eye which thankfully my brain can use to dominate and mostly ignore the halos/starbursts. But, due to my fear of the halos and starbursts affecting my night driving further, I will NEVER have the procedure done on the other eye. I don't regret treating the single eye, but I have a feeling I would regret doing both.  There is a lens implant alternative that is similar to cataract surgery but is about twice the cost of laser surgery, and like any surgery, carries risk of infection. The pros are that it is relatively easily reversible and doesn't change your eye permanently the way these laser procedures do. I will continue to follow research on this implant technology and consider it for the future. I would NOT recommend anyone having the laser procedure done to both eyes, but would suggest CONSIDERING a single eye treatment.      reply to Jon          D  6 years ago   Subject:      Know the risks! You are not allowed to get ANY of these laser procedures without signing lots of paper work saying that you KNOW and UNDERSTAND the risks of the procedure. That paperwork clearly states how many patients have dry eye, halos, starburst, etc... No risk, no reward.      reply to D          Tosh  6 years ago   Subject:      I had a Lasik when I was 63 in 2001. Having had an extreme near sightedness all my life, this was a way to see the world clearly. It worked fine for several years.(I could not achieve  20/20 but enough to pass driving test without lenses) However because of my age, I did develop cataracts. When a cataract surgery was necessary, I needed a specialist care, though my ophthalmologist has done many of this surgery before.  She had to collect my lasik procedure records from 2001 from my NY doctor and advised me that my cornea shape (slightly flattened) made it complicated, and that I was a high risk patient. After discussing the risks and determining that I would not end up worse than where I was, I went ahead and now at 73, for the first time in my life, I discovered the far-sightedness. My advice would be that if you find a very good doctor, determine how many years you have until you start getting the conditions caused by aging?  I had only seven years or so of benefits. By nephew and niece came to NYC from Japan to have lasik done and they are both 20/20 since 1992. They were in their early 30s. For them, lasik really improved their lives and my nephew loves the freedom of vision when he races his motorcycles. I do not think this type of long term impact was not well known in 2001.      reply to Tosh          Amanda Zeller, O.D.  6 years ago   Subject:      I am an optometrist, and I have seen many many patients who had bad LASIK outcomes. I cannot recommend this procedure to any patient after what I've seen in my exam chair. The rigid contact lenses required to correct corneas butchered by LASIK are complicated to fit, very expensive, and much less comfortable than most people's glasses or soft contact lenses. As a glasses-wearing myope myself, I would NEVER risk ruining my eyes with LASIK.      reply to Amanda Zeller, O.D.          Eric  6 years ago   Subject:      Most of those who are middle aged with presbyopia need to look at getting progressive bifocals. With some practice you can then focus on things at a variety of distances, not just things in the distance. For most of us that's far more important than the perfect distance vision promised (and sometimes delivered) by Lasik. And there are is no (zero) possibility of permanent damage caused by wearing glasses... good 'nuff for me, thank you.      reply to Eric          John Christensson  5 years ago   Subject: Foggy glasses      This is a common misconception.  How many lives have been lost because of foggy glasses?  Nobody knows, but some at least.  Lives lost because of LASIK: None.     reply to John Christensson          John Denning  6 years ago   Subject:      I'm glad to see that issues with this procedure are finally getting the proper coverage they deserves.  More than a decade ago I was an enlisted soldier assigned to the ophthalmology department at Walter Reed.  When bored, which was several hours a day, I would typically read research and journal articles about eye-related topics. The military had it down pat in the early 1990s that refractive surgery had highly variable outcomes that were often unstable over time... thus why Uncle Sam forbade anyone who had flight status from getting corrective surgery      reply to John Denning        View Comments - 68  Hide Comments   Post New Comment   Name *     email@youremail.com *   The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

Reuters   Share         World  eyes  Lasik I walked into Dr. Joseph A. Rudick’s Manhattan offices almost entirely unaware of what Lasik eye surgery was, save for the countless rave reviews I heard from friends and family. "It’s totally painless," I remember being told. "You’ll have brand new eyes overnight!" All I knew was that I had one more strip of daily contacts to go through, a broken pair of glasses and another one missing somewhere in New York City. I vowed to myself I wasn’t going to buy another box of contacts—sticking something in my eye was my least favorite part of every single day, and I typically forgot to take them out virtually every night before falling asleep. And each week, I heard of another friend or coworker having lasik, or the PRK laser procedure, another form of corrective eye vision surgery, then glowing about how incredible life is from that point on. Even Rudick spoke to Lasik’s near-stainless reputation as one of the most advanced, life-changing, even utopian of procedures ever since the first surgery was performed in America in 1991. It’s not like anyone was lying, either: one month after having Lasik eye surgery, I can attest to its incredible outcomes and boost to quality-of-life. But I do wish someone, anyone, warned me of what the first 24 hours after having lasers shot in your eyes feels like.

Reuters  After being reviewed and determined a perfect candidate for Lasik, I signed off on some forms noting the potential risks and complications that may occur after having laser eye surgery. The possible side effects read just like one of those commercials for a new prescription drug that ends with a one-minute voiceover narrating symptoms like heart failure, kidney rupturing and death, as a woman jogs with her golden retriever through a beautiful green field. Dry eye syndrome. Debilitating visual symptoms. Loss of vision. Basically, every thing you wouldn’t want to ever happen to your eyes in some unfortunate worst-case scenario is possible when going under the laser.  Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now The FDA warns against "eye centers that advertise, '20/20 vision or your money back' or 'package deals’ on its Lasik information site, noting quite poignantly "there are never any guarantees in medicine." There also are sites like LasikComplications.com , which purports there to be a link between the surgery and blindness, corneal transplants and even suicide after having the operation done. But Rudick’s office was highly rated citywide, and I felt that I was in some of the best hands performing this surgery in the nation. My own father had Lasik eye surgery more than a decade ago, when the laser machines were less advanced (albeit still highly successful). So I signed off and prepared to have surgery in a week. I let the surgeon and his receptionists know I wouldn’t have anyone available to pick me up as it was in the middle of the week and my apartment was at least an hour away, but was reassured they’d order me an Uber on my way home from the procedure. I won’t go into too much detail about the actual surgery, largely because it only lasted a total of three minutes or so. Each eye took about thirty seconds, after both receive a healthy dose of numbing solution before going under. I was given a blanket to wrap myself in as my face and eye were strapped in and held with restraints, and a teddy bear whose name the nurse said was "See-more." After having the surgery, I immediately was able to sit up and see the entire room around me. See-more was colorful and clear laying on my lap. The time on the clock above the wooden door on the other side of the room read 2:47 with crystal clear clarity. The surgeon then doused my eyes in multiple solutions, and I was given goggles and sunglasses to protect my eyes from the lights. “Your vision is going to get pretty blurry over the next few hours,” Rudick told me. "Go home and try to go straight to sleep." My sight was rapidly dissipating as I was escorted into the hallway, exiting the surgeon’s office and being left alone in the general lobby. I hadn’t reminded anyone for an Uber, and felt uncomfortable going back in and relying on someone to help me get back home to Brooklyn. Out of my entire Lasik experience, going alone was my biggest mistake. By the time I was standing in the lobby, I could barely look at the screen on my phone. The words were too bright, and all of the colors were beginning to run together. I managed to order an Uber and pushed my phone into my pocket, waiting for it to buzz. My first Uber finally arrived 10 minutes later, with the driver frantically calling to say he was outside of my address. I walked out of the building, immediately feeling the burst of light stab through my sunglasses and into my wounded eyes. My eyes felt scratchy and dry as I squinted around in search of a black SUV that was supposed to be for me. I spoke with the driver on the phone for a good five minutes before learning he actually was nowhere near my dropped location, and would have to make three different turns around two blocks to get to where I was standing. He then decided to hang up on me and cancel the trip. By this point, my eyes were dry, and my vision was so blurred, I felt completely helpless. Fortunately, a second Uber driver proved to be the ultimate hero, picking me up moments later and taking me to a bodega before going home to buy me snacks that he chose to pay for. I begged him to at least take my cash into the store, but he left the car running and came back with Doritos, Diet Coke and Twizzlers. My eyes were shut throughout the entire drive home, and the driver helped me into my apartment before heading off.    A patient going through free eye surgery at the Phyo charity clinic in Yangon September 4, 2014.  Reuters  That first night after having Lasik surgery was one of the most uncomfortable experiences I’ve ever had in my life. It felt as though my eyelids were glued to my corneas, as bugs crawled between the skin, scratching every inch over and over again. If I opened them, I was met with immediate pain. I couldn’t sleep, or even move much, out of fear I was going to break or smash into something. I did not fully open my eyes until the next morning at about 9 a.m., after slowly taking off the goggles I had been wearing since immediately after the surgery. My eyes were bloodshot and teary as I looked at myself in the mirror, but I noticed the immediate accuracy in my vision the second I saw my face. I could see the red capillaries in my eyes that had burst from the pressure during the procedure, and the lashes on my eyelids. I went back to my surgeon that morning to learn the operation was a success. In fact, it went even better than expected: I was found to have an eyesight of 20/15, better than perfect eye vision. Rudick informed me the redness was perfectly normal and would disappear in a few days. It did. All in all, Lasik is an incredible surgery with the enormous potential to give someone back their eyesight for a lifetime overnight. But it’s no miracle: the operation requires a patient's understanding there is a small risk involved with major implications. Despite what one may be told before the procedure, there certainly is a great deal of discomfort in the proceeding hours and days, though every person’s recovery is different. And unlike other options, Lasik is virtually never covered by insurance, and costs a much prettier penny upfront than glasses or contacts. Still, there’s something incredible about being given the ability to see the world without any help in 24 hours. "It’s like pregnancy," my mother said. "The result is so beautiful, it almost makes you forget about the trauma."

Over the next four months, I received 20 ads from the same company – each offering the same deal for the “safe, FDA approved” surgery. “Individual results will vary,” each ad said in the fine print. None mentioned that those variable results could include seven categories of vision-threatening complications or 17 types of non-vision-threatening side-effects, such as “increased sensitivity to light”, “eye irritation related to drying of the corneal surface”, “pain or a foreign body sensation”, or increased susceptibility “to trauma from impact”. (Bargain offers notwithstanding, average all-in costs also exceed US$2,000 per eye.) All surgeries carry risk, and the risks associated with laser in-situ keratomileusis, or LASIK, are listed on the standard consent form that all patients must sign. For many, the rapid procedure goes off without a hitch and leaves no residual effects. Scrupulous centres also turn away the roughly one-fifth of patients who are not good candidates. But a quarter of a century after the first ‘flap and zap’ vision-correcting surgery, controversy continues to rage over whether regulatory authorities and industry officials have repeatedly downplayed or ignored the prevalence of dry eye disease, chronic pain and other potentially serious side-effects. Has the public, in other words, been told enough to make an informed decision about an elective surgery that can’t be undone? In response to mounting pressure from patient advocates who say they haven’t, the US Food and Drug Administration co-sponsored a quality-of-life study to help quell the debate. The recently released preliminary results of that study, however, appear to be doing exactly the opposite. Advertisement Early procedures How did it get to this point? Excimer lasers, as they’re known, were first used to perform a precursor method called photorefractive keratectomy (or PRK) in the late 1980s. During the procedure, a doctor removes the thin outer layer of corneal tissue and then uses the laser to create a precise vision-correcting divot on the surface. The painful method can mean several weeks of recovery time per eye, but it doesn’t cut through the corneal nerves like LASIK does. Surgeons soon began gravitating toward the faster LASIK method, which cuts a hinged flap in the cornea to alter its light-refracting properties. From 1996 until his retirement in 2000, Morris Waxler was chief of the Diagnostic and Surgical Devices Branch that regulated corneal resurfacing lasers within the FDA’s Division of Ophthalmic Devices. He was at the helm when the FDA branch gave the green light to the first LASIK laser in July 1998. Advertisement The approval, Waxler said, was intended in part to stem major compliance problems and bring some order to the increasingly chaotic industry while reasserting the FDA’s regulatory authority. In the process, he alleged, the agency wasn’t as attentive as it should have been to the surgery’s long-term risks, including chronic eye pain. “We were hard-pressed to know what to do about these problems,” Waxler said. The assumption was that the pain would persist for a few months, maybe, or a year. “So we figured we would handle it in the labelling and that ‘caveat emptor’ – ‘buyer beware’ – would rule the day, and we assumed that refractive surgeons and clinics would be honest and tell their patients ‘You’re going to have pain’, and that’s turned out not to be correct.” Carlos Belmonte, founder of the Institute of Neurosciences in Alicante, Spain, and a pioneer in studying the physiological basis of eye pain, explains that corneal nerves don’t completely regenerate after LASIK surgery. “The main risk is that in a very small percentage of cases, this regeneration is pathological, and then you get this neuropathic pain and that is a disaster,” he said. “But this is a risk that happens in surgery.” Advertisement In 2007, Belmonte published a study that suggested a form of dry eye pain called ‘phantom’ cornea could occur after LASIK-mediated damage to the corneal nerves. At the same time, Boston ophthalmologist Perry Rosenthal was compiling multiple case reports suggesting that a similar post-LASIK phenomenon was appearing regularly in patients with severe eye pain who had been referred to his clinic. Other researchers have documented phantom pain among patients who have had eye amputations or corneal transplants. Waxler retired in 2000 and is now an independent regulatory consultant. He gave little additional thought to LASIK until a patient whose eyes had been damaged by the surgery called him about six years ago and angrily asked why it had been approved. Waxler listened, and began talking to other patients with similar stories. “I said, ‘Well, how could this happen?’” he recalled. Based on his review of medical studies and documents on the FDA’s website, he alleges that many of the problems had been reported all along, but labelled as ‘symptoms’, a category deemed less serious than ‘adverse events’. Waxler made headlines in 2010 and 2011 when he went public to contend that the original studies actually documented an adverse event rate of about 20 per cent. The FDA later responded that symptoms like glare and dry eye are too mild to be considered adverse events. Advertisement Meanwhile, more patient advocates were going public with their own stories and documenting them on Facebook groups and multiple websites. One, lasikcomplications.com , created a page to track LASIK-linked suicides and attempted suicides, based on news accounts and patient reports filed with the FDA. At a public meeting of the FDA Ophthalmic Devices Panel in April 2008, nearly 20 individuals spoke out against the LASIK procedure: optometrists who had treated patients after the surgery, patients recounting their own ordeals, and two speakers testifying about patients who had killed themselves. New Jersey financial administrator Matthew Kotsovolos, now 46, was among those who testified. He describes his own misery after a 2006 LASIK eye surgery as “a pain that I am confident that most people do not recognise as existing in this world”. His surgeon considered the procedure a success because Kotsovolos’s uncorrected vision improved to 20/20. Even so, he suffered from constant, debilitating eye pain. “So I pretty much lived in Hell.” Advertisement Exploring outcomes In October 2009, the FDA, the National Eye Institute and the Department of Defense responded to the lingering controversy by launching the LASIK Quality of Life Collaboration Project “to help better understand the potential risk of severe problems that can result from LASIK”. The collaborative effort tested a web-based questionnaire on 242 naval personnel – most of them male – who received free LASIK at the US Naval Medical Center in San Diego. A subsequent phase then surveyed 292 civilian patients, split roughly between male and female, who had LASIK surgery at five other clinical centres. In October 2014, Malvina Eydelman, director of the FDA’s Division of Ophthalmic and Ear, Nose and Throat Devices, presented the preliminary results from both phases of the study. Advertisement The study agreed with most previous surveys in suggesting a patient satisfaction rate of more than 90 per cent. As Waxler and other critics have repeatedly emphasised, however, satisfaction rates cannot take the place of safety profiles. In that regard, the FDA’s study results were more mixed. Although the prevalence of patients with ghosting (seeing a faint double image) dropped significantly after surgery, for example, more than one-third still had halos and starbursts. In addition, up to 4 per cent had “very or extremely bothersome” visual symptoms, and up to 1 per cent “experienced a lot of difficulty with or were unable to do usual activities due to visual symptoms” three months after LASIK. Among respondents who lacked symptoms before LASIK, roughly 30 per cent reported new dry eye symptoms and 45 per cent reported new visual symptoms three months after the surgery. Advertisement Instead of a randomised epidemiological study of eye pain, visual symptoms and satisfaction among the existing pool of LASIK patients, Waxler alleges that the “best-case” study used highly specific inclusion criteria for patients and LASIK devices, sharply limiting its applicability to the general population. Even so, he asserts that the FDA and refractive surgery industry have spun the study “as support for the safety and effectiveness of LASIK when in fact it confirms LASIK patients’ problems”. In response to a request for comment, a spokesperson for the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery offered a November 2014 press release as the society’s official statement. That release characterised the preliminary FDA-led study results as “overwhelmingly positive”, while ASCRS President Richard Lewis called the high rate of success for LASIK “unprecedented as a surgical procedure” and said the collaborative research effort confirms “the remarkable efficacy of LASIK”. The press release notes that “no surgery is 100 per cent risk free” and quotes Lewis as saying: “Our understanding of those at risk for dry eyes and visual disturbances from LASIK procedures is critical and evolving…Identifying individuals at high risk for complications of LASIK is valuable. However, this must be determined in a well-controlled and timely trial.” Advertisement Separate reports suggest that many post-surgical problems will eventually resolve. Few studies, however, have followed patients beyond six months or a year to find out for sure. Rosenthal’s observations of 21 patients with post-LASIK chronic eye pain, for example, suggest that the pain didn’t even begin until a year or more after the surgery for eight of them. A separate survey by The Cornea Research Foundation found that post-LASIK dry eye symptoms actually worsened at the one-year mark before recovering somewhat at two years. A survey of nearly 800 adults conducted by the Consumer Reports National Research Center and reviews in the American Journal of Ophthalmology , Cornea and Ocular Surface have similarly suggested that chronic dry eye and other symptoms are relatively common six months after LASIK. A new review in the journal Molecular Pain asserts that the percentage of patients reporting “persistent eye symptoms” has ranged from 20 per cent to 55 per cent, and the authors invoke corneal nerve damage as one potential contributor. A recent investigative report from Consumers Digest details a range of other potential flaws in the clinical trials and reporting system used to assess LASIK’s safety. The FDA has not yet released its six-month results from the second group of patients surveyed. Under the heading ‘Public Health Impact’, however, Eydelman’s slide presentation concluded: “Given the large number of patients undergoing LASIK annually, dissatisfaction and disabling symptoms may occur in a significant number of patients.” Advertisement Based on industry estimates that more than 40 million patients have undergone LASIK worldwide, the tally of those with chronic eye symptoms could run well into the millions. Although demand for the surgery has fallen over the past five years, Waxler said the market for eye drops that treat dry-eye-associated discomfort has “exploded”, and some manufacturers are specifically aiming their ads at LASIK patients. “It’s no happenstance,” he said. Waxler filed a petition in 2011 asking his former employer to rescind its approval of LASIK. Three years later, the FDA shot him down, responding that his allegations were unfounded and that data submitted to the agency suggested the surgery’s benefits outweighed the risks. Waxler filed another petition in July 2014 asking the FDA to reconsider. But he’s tired, he said, and has done all he can do: “I have no magical wand to fix this.” Activists haven’t given up, however. In December 2014, three consumer advocates launched a new petition drive to force the FDA to add a ‘black box’ warning label to LASIK lasers, citing the agency’s own study results to argue that the high incidence of visual and dry eye symptoms represents an epidemic caused by an unnecessary surgery. And in May 2015, more than 1,000 LASIK patients and their supporters signed a letter urging the federal agency to reopen Waxler’s petition for consideration. Advertisement Where does the FDA go from here? In response to questions about Eydelman’s scientific presentation and the agency’s next steps, an FDA spokesperson told me the researchers were preparing the manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and couldn’t comment publicly about any findings until its publication. And when might that be? She couldn’t say. This article first appeared on Mosaic and republished here under Creative Commons license.

The truth is, there has never been a case of blindness as a result of LASIK eye surgery complications reported in the United States. The risk of going blind from a LASIK complication is actually comparable to the risk of blindness from wearing contacts.  Myth: The more procedures a LASIK surgeon has performed, the better chance of a positive outcome.  Actually, while the experience of the LASIK surgeon is important, there is a tapering learning curve. Once a LASIK eye surgeon has passed that initial learning curve, typically 200-300 procedures, the quality of the LASIK surgery becomes more impressive and important than simply comparing the surgeon's quantity of eyes done. Personalized, quality care and a track record of positive outcomes is what you should look for in a LASIK surgeon.   Myth: All Laser LASIK ( IntraLase or Bladeless ) is the safest procedure.  Every LASIK procedure involves creating a flap in the surface of the cornea. IntraLase procedures utilize a laser to create that flap instead of the microkeratome blade used in regular LASIK. IntraLase carries its own risks, such as light sensitivity, which although infrequent does not make IntraLase a safer or better procedure. Your LASIK surgeon and yourself will assess your needs and determine the procedure that is right for you during your free consultation. We offer contracted prices on both microkeratome and IntraLase procedures, allowing you choice, quality, and savings.  Myth: Everybody is eligible for LASIK eye surgery.  While many wish to have LASIK performed, a percentage of people are not good candidates for the surgery. In fact, about 30% of potential patients evaluated by an ophthalmologist are routinely rejected as candidates for the procedure. There are various factors that can disqualify a person, so the best way to learn if you are a candidate is to attend a LASIK exam. During this appointment, the surgeon will perform a full comprehensive eye exam to determine if LASIK eye surgery is an option for you. QualSight offers FREE LASIK exams with the best credentialed surgeons, allowing those interested in having LASIK to learn if they are a candidate without having to pay for an evaluation.  Myth: LASIK Eye Surgery is painful.  LASIK is the most popular elective procedure performed today, largely due to the ease of the surgery itself. Eye drops are used to numb the eyes and keep them comfortable during LASIK, which takes only about 15 minutes for both eyes. You will feel some pressure briefly, but laser reshaping of the eye is pain-free. If you feel nervous prior to your procedure, your surgeon may give you a mild sedative to help you relax.

The Results of Laser Eye  Surgery Examined  LASIK eye surgery results have continued to improve since the procedure was FDA approved in 1996.  Even in 2014, some potential LASIK candidates still ask Is LASIK Safe? LASIK eye surgery is one of the most popular elective procedures performed today, and offers many benefits that should improve your overall quality of life. Due to the latest technology and the skills of experienced LASIK surgeons millions of Americans are less dependent on their contact lenses and glasses.  Today, most patients achieve 20/20 vision after LASIK eye surgery, but results are not the same for everyone. In some cases, patients may still need to wear glasses or contact lenses following LASIK eye surgery, however the post-operative prescription and visual acuity level will typically be much lower than prior to having LASIK performed. The surgery has an excellent safety record, but like with any surgery post-operative complications can occur.   A very small percentage of patients may require an enhancement or touch up procedure to improve their vision to the desired level. Additionally, due to presbyopia , some LASIK eye surgery patients may still need reading glasses once they reach middle-age (40 to 50) due to a normal age related loss of near vision.  Overall, LASIK eye surgery is safe and has a significantly high success rate, but it is important to discuss and consider all the risks with your surgeon prior to undergoing the LASIK procedure.  Is LASIK Considered Safe by the FDA?  Since 1996, LASIK eye surgery has been approved and considered safe by the FDA.. LASIK has a remarkable success rate, with 96% of patients achieving 20/20 vision or better, according to the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery.  LASIK eye surgery is a permanent procedure that corrects vision problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism .  LASIK involves using an excimer laser (a cool beam of light) to reshape the cornea in order to decrease or eliminate the need for glasses or contact lenses. Normally, your cornea (front part of the eye) focuses light onto the retina (back part of the eye) to create an image. If the cornea is imperfectly shaped or if the eyeball is longer or shorter than normal, a distorted image is projected onto the retina resulting in blurry vision.   During LASIK surgery, the surgeon creates a tiny flap on the surface of the eye and then the excimer laser (cool beam of light) gently reshapes the exposed cornea. Each pulse of the laser removes 39-millionths of an inch of tissue, enabling surgeons to achieve remarkable accuracy while maintaining excellent control throughout the LASIK procedure. The flap is then replaced, adhering naturally and securely to the eye, and you are on your way to better vision.  For decades, the only solution to nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism was corrective eyewear, however now LASIK eye surgery offers an alternative option for those who wish to reduce or eliminate their dependence on glasses or contacts.

LASIK Surgery Can Save You Money  Many people who inquire about LASIK eye surgery are sometimes discouraged by the cost of the procedure. Often they question, "Is LASIK worth it?" While we can breakdown the question financially, only you can really answer this question.  Only you know the day to day struggles you face with glasses and contacts.  Have you ever lost a contact or woke up in the middle of the night and struggled to find your glasses?  What about seeing the alarm clock?  If you are active, what would life be like not worrying about contacts falling out?  Or if you are one of the thousands of people whose eye don’t tolerate contacts, what would it be like to not have to take your glasses off when you enter a warm house in the winter because they fog up?  Have you ever worried about losing your glasses while on vacation?  All of these questions along with the financial cost of LASIK will ultimately determine “Is LASIK worth it” for you?   The national average cost of LASIK surgery is $2,259 per eye. Understandably, prospective patients may find the price of LASIK unsettling, however, most people will save money over time by having the procedure, especially those who wear contacts.  It’s also becoming increasingly popular to spread out the cost of the procedure over time by using pretax dollars set aside in Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) or Health Savings Accounts (HSA) allowed by employers.  Utilizing an FSA or HSA account allows the person to set aside a determined amount ($2,550 for FSA and $3,300 for HSA for a single person or $6,550 for HSA for a family).  Another extremely popular method of paying for the procedure is to utilize financing options offered by the provider.  Providers will often offer 6 and 12 months financing with 0% interest to qualified applicants.  When comparing the long-term cost of contacts, exams, and eyeglasses versus the one-time cost of LASIK eye surgery, it is evident that the initial expense of LASIK is lower than the annual cost of contacts, exams and eyeglasses combined over time. The cost of contact lenses quickly adds up due to regular replacements when compared to eyeglasses. A box of contacts usually contains about six lenses and can range from $25 to $80. Disposable contacts need to be replaced more frequently than others; they require patients to purchase several boxes of contact lenses each year. The cost of contact lenses can vary depending on a patient’s prescription and the type of lenses they wear.  Toric lenses, which correct astigmatism, are more expensive than other contact lenses. Toric lenses can cost up to $80 a box and an annual supply requires several boxes. When patients with astigmatism are interested in saving money, many of them consider LASIK, since purchasing Toric lenses may exceed several hundred dollars annually.  Night and Day contact lenses allow patients to sleep without removing the lenses for up to 7 days and typically last for 30 days, giving patients the closest experience to eliminating glasses other than LASIK. While sleeping in contacts provides a temporary experience of not needing glasses, it does come with risks as researchers found the incident of eye infections is greater in people who sleep in contacts.  While extended wear contact lenses have been approved for up to 30 days, most eye care professionals will still recommend their patients remove their contacts daily.  Longer lasting contacts are often more expensive and patients who buy Night and Day lenses are spending around $70 a box. Although Night and Day contact lenses may last longer, patients are still required to spend hundreds of dollars annually while still falling short of a permanent vision correction solution. In other words, patients will be required to continue buying contact lenses for the rest of their life if they wish to reduce their dependence on glasses.  LASIK may be an option to eliminate the need for eyeglasses and contacts  potentially saving them thousands of dollars over time. For this reason and many more, most people who have undergone LASIK believe LASIK is worth the higher initial cost over time and thus believe LASIK is worth it.  Is LASIK Worth It? Compare the Cost of LASIK to Glasses & Contacts  Between buying eyeglasses, contact lenses and paying the fees for visits to the eye doctor, the cost of vision correction adds up quickly and does not provide a permanent fix. Patients who wear more expensive lenses may end up paying close to $900 each year after all the add-ons offered like anti-reflective coatings, high-index plastic, polycarbonate lenses, polarized lenses and whether or not to get single vision or progressive lenses.  Most people replace their eye glasses annually or every other year and are forced to cover all the fees all over again.  At QualSight, the price for Traditional LASIK surgery is typically less than $995 per eye and more advanced technology such as Custom LASIK is less than $1,450 per eye. Even though the initial cost of LASIK is higher initially, it is typically a one-time fee and over time LASIK is worth it when it comes to saving money.

		            April 14, 2014   Fox News       Facebook 0  Twitter 0  livefyre  Email  Print         LASIK eye surgery to correct a person’s vision has been in use since the mid-1990s, but lingering questions as to the long-term effects still come to mind for past and potential patients. But LASIK recipients can rest easy: Studies have shown that the surgeries have little negative effect and in fact, are now safer and more beneficial than ever.  “LASIK is an FDA-approved procedure… if there were long-term issues with the procedure, the FDA would pull the procedure off the market, right? And that is absolutely not the case,” Dr. Marc Werner, an ophthalmologist at the Stahl Eye Center in New York City, told FoxNews.com. “We still have lots of people we started on 18 to 19 years ago who are perfect. It’s still a very good procedures with long-term results.”  In a 2008 retrospective study of LASIK procedures, Spanish researchers followed up with 70 patients for 10 years and found that, overall, participants had healthy corneas and that their vision remained accurate.  “The question is: Has the technology improved over the last 18 years? Absolutely. It’s a safer procedure with better results,” Werner said.  LASIK, laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, is a surgical procedure that utilizes a laser to permanently change the shape of the cornea to correct vision. Nearsightedness and farsightedness are both caused by distortions in the cornea.   More On This...      LASIK eye surgery safe in long-term, experts say         Surgical tool simplified hysterectomies, but had hidden cancer risk         Ancient daddy longlegs had extra eyes        During the procedure, a flap is created in the cornea so that a computer-controlled excimer laser can vaporize a portion of the stroma, which is located in the middle of the cornea. The flap is then closed again, correcting the curvature of the cornea, and improving vision.  In the mid-1990s, surgeons used a surgical blade to create a flap in the cornea. But now, the majority of ophthalmic surgeons use a femtosecond laser. The laser separates tissues by creating a layer of bubbles, then making an incision to create the flap. If the surgery is disrupted, the air bubbles dissolve and no tissue is removed, unlike with a blade.  In addition to improvements in the procedure, the preoperative testing process has become more thorough, with screening tests monitoring multiple elements of the cornea to ensure LASIK is proper for the patient.  According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), people who have experienced vision changes in the past year, have a disease or disorder that may affect wound healing, or actively participating in contact sports may be at risk for complications from LASIK. The procedure is approved for adults for adults age 18 and over.  “The screening process has gotten better in the sense that it could pick up things it couldn’t pick up…10…five years ago,” Dr. Michael Ehrenhaus, director of New York Cornea Consultants and director of Cornea External Disease & Refractive Surgery at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, told FoxNews.com  Ehrenhaus points out that there are fewer long-term studies now as there were at the advent of the surgery because of the proven safety and effectiveness of the procedure.  With the natural aging process, it’s possible a patient will need a touch-up LASIK procedure to fine tune his or her vision in the future, or may need reading glasses later in the life.  “Aging changes occurs within 100 percent of the population,” Dr. Kerry Solomon, director of the Carolina Eyecare Research Institute in Charleston, SC, told FoxNews.com. “…Occasionally things will change in [eye] shape and size.”  Those eye changes also include cataracts, the clouding of the natural lens of the eye. LASIK does not increase the incidence of cataracts – the surgery affects only the cornea, not the lens of the eye.  “With or without LASIK, we all develop [cataracts]… and their occurrence is unrelated to LASIK,” Werner said.  Long-term safety of LASIK has been good and continues to improve with technological developments.  “Most patients do phenomenally well in the long-term. 15 to 20 years after, patients come up and say, ‘This is the best thing I ever did,’” Ehrenhaus said. “If it wasn’t a good procedure, it wouldn’t still be done.”           Advertisement          Trending in Health     1   Man who ate world's hottest chili is hospitalized with excruciating headaches     2   Russian woman dies after given formaldehyde instead of saline drip     3   Quintuplets leave Utah parents feeling 'blessed'     4   Teen dubbed 'butterfly boy' dies of rare skin disease; Ottawa Senators mourn his death     5   E. coli outbreak possibly linked to Panera Bread in NJ       See all Trends    Top Health Centers View All    Back Pain    Cancer    Depression    Heart Disease    Pain Management    Sexual Health    Beauty & Skin    Cold and Flu    Digestive Health    Nutrition    Pregnancy                           Site Index    Sections   Home  Video  Politics  U.S.  Opinion  Entertainment  Tech  Science  Health  Travel  Lifestyle  World  Sports  Weather  On Air     Tools   Live Video  Trending  Newsletters  Alerts  Podcasts  Radio  Apps & Products     About   Careers  College Students  Fox Around the World  Advertise With Us  New Terms of Use  (What's New)  New Privacy Policy  Ad Choices  Help  Email Newsroom  Media Relations  Closed Captioning Policy     Follow   Facebook  Twitter  Google+  Instagram  RSS  Newsletters      Fox News  Back to Top   This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2018 FOX News Network, LLC.

On this page: LASIK risk factors • List of complications • How common are LASIK complications? • Eyewear after LASIK   See also: Dry eyes and what to do about them • Wavefront-guided LASIK • Results you can expect from LASIK surgery   LASIK and other types of laser eye surgery, such as PRK and LASEK , have excellent safety profiles and very high success rates. They are designed to treat myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness) and astigmatism , and can allow you to live without glasses or contacts.  Sight-threatening complications such as significant loss of vision from LASIK surgery are extremely rare, and many side effects and laser eye surgery complications can be resolved with additional surgery or medical treatment.  Like any other surgery, however, there are potential risks, side effects and limitations you should be fully aware of before electing to undergo the procedure (or any type of procedure, for that matter). Choosing a skilled and experienced LASIK eye surgeon can help reduce these risks and enable you to achieve the best possible results from laser eye surgery.  The first step is to determine if you are a good candidate for vision correction surgery. Your eye doctor will perform a thorough diagnostic eye exam to determine your suitability for LASIK surgery. He or she will evaluate: the shape and thickness of your cornea ; your refractive errors and pupil size; the moistness of your eyes (to check for dry eye syndrome ); your general health and medical history; and any medications you are taking.  Even if you are not a good candidate for LASIK, don't worry  you might still be able to have your vision fixed with other vision correction surgery such as PRK, LASEK or implantable lenses .  LASIK Eye Surgery Risk Factors And Limitations  Not everyone is a suitable candidate for LASIK eye surgery. Certain conditions and anatomical factors can increase your risk of an undesirable outcome or limit optimal LASIK results. These include:   Recommended For You      What's iLASIK?

LASIK Side Effects And Complications  Millions of Americans have had LASIK eye surgery to correct their vision since it was introduced in the United States more than 20 years ago, and experienced LASIK surgeons report that serious complication rates can be held below 1 percent.   Best Candidates    mild/moderate myopia, hyperopia and/or astigmatism, adequate corneal thickness   Procedure time: about 10 minutes per eye  Typical results: 20/20 vision without glasses or contact lenses  Recovery time: a few days to several weeks for vision to stabilize  Cost: about $1,500 to $3,500 per eye      Common LASIK complications and side effects are listed below. Most of these problems can be resolved with medical treatment or additional " enhancement " surgery.  Temporary discomfort and vision disturbances. Discomfort during the first few days following LASIK surgery, such as mild irritation and light sensitivity, is normal and to be expected. During the first few weeks or months you also may experience: halos; glare and starbursts in low-light environments, especially at night; dry eye symptoms; hazy vision; and reduced sharpness of vision. In the vast majority of cases, these problems are temporary and disappear completely within three to six months.  Flap complications. The LASIK procedure involves the creation of a thin hinged flap on the front surface of the cornea. This is lifted during surgery for laser reshaping of the eye. The flap is then replaced to form a natural bandage.  If the LASIK flap is not made correctly, it may fail to adhere properly to the eye's surface or microscopic wrinkles called striae (STRIE-ee) could develop in the flap. These flap complications can cause optical aberrations and distorted vision.  Studies indicate that flap complications occur in from 0.3 to 5.7 percent of LASIK procedures, according to the April 2006 issue of American Journal of Ophthalmology . In a study of 3,009 consecutive LASIK surgeries performed August 2002 through July 2009 using a femtosecond laser for flap creation, flap complications occurred in fewer than one-half of 1 percent (0.37 percent) of these procedures, and all complications were successfully managed within the same surgical session.  Again, remember that you can reduce your risk of LASIK complications by choosing a reputable, experienced eye surgeon.  Some problems associated with LASIK flap complications include:   Left: What someone with post-op starbursts might see at night. Right: Nighttime halos.   Irregular astigmatism. This is caused by an unequally curved corneal surface. Irregular astigmatism also can occur from laser correction that is not centered properly on the eye or from irregular healing. Resulting symptoms may include double vision (diplopia) or "ghost images." In these cases, the eye may need re-treatment or enhancement surgery.  Epithelial ingrowth. This is when cells from the outer layer of the cornea (epithelium) grow under the flap after LASIK surgery. In most cases, epithelial ingrowth is self-limiting and causes no problems. But in some cases (reported to be 1 to 2 percent of LASIK procedures), symptoms of discomfort and/or blurred vision can occur, and additional surgery is needed to lift the flap and remove the epithelial cells.  Diffuse lamellar keratitis (DLK). Nicknamed "Sands of the Sahara," this is inflammation under the LASIK flap that may have several causes. Some inflammation of the cornea after LASIK surgery is normal. But if it is uncontrolled, as in DLK, it can interfere with healing and cause vision loss. If DLK occurs, it usually responds to therapies such as antibiotics and topical steroids. Also, the flap might need to be lifted and cleaned for removal of inflammatory cells and to prevent tissue damage.  Keratectasia or keratoconus. This is a very uncommon bulging of the eye's surface that can occur if too much tissue is removed from the cornea during LASIK or if the cornea prior to LASIK is weak as evidenced from corneal topography mapping. Rarely does keratoconus develop after LASIK with no known risk factors. Enhancement laser surgery is usually not suitable, and gas permeable contact lenses or corneal implants (Intacs) may be prescribed to hold the cornea in place, or a treatment called corneal collagen crosslinking may be performed to strengthen the cornea.    Because hormonal changes during pregnancy can affect your eyes, many surgeons recommend waiting several weeks after your baby is born before having LASIK surgery.  Dry eyes after LASIK. Some people who have LASIK surgery experience a decrease in tear production that can cause eye discomfort and blurred vision. Almost half of all LASIK patients experience some degree of temporary dry eye syndrome, according to the April 2006 issue of American Journal of Ophthalmology .  Dry eye syndrome after LASIK surgery usually is temporary and can be effectively treated with lubricating eye drops or other measures.  Dry eye problems usually disappear when healing of the eye is complete, which can take up to six months. People who already have severe dry eye usually are eliminated as LASIK candidates.  Significant undercorrection, overcorrection or regression. Not everyone will achieve 20/20 vision after LASIK eye surgery, and contact lenses or eyeglasses for some or all activities may still be required in rare cases. If the laser removes too much or too little corneal tissue, or your eye's healing response is not typical, your visual outcome will be less than optimal.  One possible cause of a less-than-perfect outcome is that your eyes did not respond to laser eye surgery in a predictable manner. Another possible cause is that your eyesight may have been optimal shortly after LASIK but regressed over time due to "over-healing."  In most cases, a significant undercorrection or regression can be successfully treated with additional laser vision correction after your surgeon confirms your residual refractive error is stable.  Eye infection. Infections rarely occur after LASIK. Because the corneal flap acts as a natural bandage, eye infections occur less frequently after LASIK than after flap-free corneal refractive procedures like PRK. Still, it is very important to use medicated eye drops as directed after your LASIK procedure to avoid infection and control inflammation as your eyes heal.

Most patients do not experience these symptoms, and some patients with these complications experience no symptoms and require no treatment.

The safety and effectiveness of LASIK surgery continues to improve, thanks to increasingly sophisticated technology, surgical skill and optimal patient selection.  Complications generally were more common in the early years of LASIK, when studies in the late 1990s indicated that up to 5 percent of people undergoing laser vision correction experienced some type of problem. These days, this number is under 1 percent for serious complications.  A worldwide review of LASIK published in 2009 showed that more than 95 percent of people who had LASIK surgery between 1995 and 2003 were satisfied with their outcome.  Public confidence in LASIK has grown in recent years due to the solid success rate of LASIK surgery outcomes . The U.S. military also has adopted widespread use of laser eye surgery to decrease reliance of troops on corrective eyewear. As of 2008, more than 224,000 military personnel had undergone laser vision correction. Since the procedure first was introduced in the military in 2000, researchers have conducted more than 45 studies regarding safety and effectiveness of LASIK and other procedures.  LASIK outcomes have been overwhelmingly positive. Most military patients see 20/20 or better after the procedure without corrective eyewear, and the rate of complications has been very low. According to one study, only one in 112,500 patients required medical disability retirement due to complications from laser vision correction during this eight-year period.  In another study, 100 percent of pilots and other aircraft personnel from the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps who underwent custom (wavefront-guided) LASIK attained 20/20 uncorrected visual acuity within two weeks after surgery.  When questioned about their satisfaction one month after surgery, 95 percent of these patients said the procedure was helpful to their effectiveness, and 100 percent said they would recommend it to other aviators. Study results were presented at the 2008 ASCRS annual meeting.  Laser eye surgery has successfully treated millions of patients and has high patient satisfaction rates. However, as with any surgery, LASIK involves potential complications. It is important for you to weigh the benefits and risks before choosing to go ahead with surgery.  Eyewear After LASIK  Though the goal of LASIK surgery is to eliminate your need for glasses or contact lenses as much as possible, in some cases you may benefit from wearing glasses (part time or full time) after a LASIK procedure.  For example, for persistent dry eye problems after LASIK, wearing eyeglasses with photochromic lenses can help relieve photophobia (sensitivity to light) associated with dry eyes.  For cases of mild residual refractive error that don't warrant additional surgery, wearing corrective eyeglasses for specific visual tasks such as driving at night is a good choice.  If you can benefit from glasses after LASIK, choose lenses with anti-reflective coating for the best vision and comfort possible.  Also, if you're over age 40, consider progressive lenses to provide enhanced vision for reading as well as sharper distance vision.

Report a LASIK problem to the FDA  Read what other injured LASIK patients have reported to the FDA  BEWARE of Wolves in Sheep's Clothing  When  there is LASIK industry money involved, you can be sure that risks and complications are downplayed or hidden.  There are individuals and organizations on the Internet, funded by LASIK surgeons, posing as "LASIK patient advocates", "LASIK experts", or LASIK education sites. Don't be fooled by these LASIK marketing scams. Any  organization that refers patients to LASIK surgeons, provides a list of LASIK surgeons, or receives money from the LASIK industry  is not looking  out for the best interest of patients.  Information on LASIK surgeon referral sites is biased and unreliable.  LASIK Considerations  LASIK is an unnecessary surgical procedure that carries risk to the organ through which we   get 80% of our  information.  LASIK surgeons routinely fail to inform prospective patients about adverse effects and long-term consequences of LASIK.  LASIK-induced vision loss cannot be corrected by glasses.  Nearsighted patients who decline to have  LASIK retain the ability to read and see up close after the age of 40 by simply removing their glasses.  LASIK is NOT medicine -- it's big business.

At the 2016 World Ophthalmology Congress, leading Lasik surgeon, Peter McDonnell, MD, is quoted admitting that Lasik creates a neurotrophic cornea , which they don't know how to prevent or treat.  Wouldn't that require that they stop doing Lasik? Afterall, they are bound by the Hippocratic oath to "Do no harm".  Quote: "A third hot topic within refractive surgery is the neurotrophic cornea, Dr. McDonnell said. However, there is much that remains to be done. “Our limited knowledge translates into a limited ability to prevent and treat this,” he said."

Link to article 9/1/2015: EXPLOSIVE ARTICLE  in October, 2015 issue of Consumers Digest by reporter Catherine Elton. Three former FDA officials  are now speaking out against Lasik. Excerpt: "Waxler and Beers say the clinical trials that were used to apply for FDA approval of Lasik devices had flaws that call into question whether the procedure should have been approved from the beginning." 2/24/2015: IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR THE AAO AND ASCRS In a 2010 televised debate with Dr. Morris Waxler, LASIK surgeon, Dr. Stephen Slade said, “The patients that have had problems with older forms of LASIK, or even other forms of refractive surgery, again, are our focus, and we will do everything for them that we possibly can.” Refractive surgeons ‘should’ take ownership of the problems they create. LASIK patient advocates ask the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) and the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS)   to earmark foundation funds to assist post-refractive surgery patients  who have experienced poor outcomes with the burdensome  costs of rehabilitation, including rigid contact lenses, corrective procedures, dry eye treatments, and other costly therapies.

     LASIK annually, dissatisfaction and disabling 
       symptoms may occur in a significant number of 
       patients ." • Up to 46% of subjects who were symptom-free before LASIK reported visual symptoms ( halos , starbursts , glare, and ghosting ) after LASIK. • Up to 28% of subjects with no symptoms of dry eyes before LASIK developed dry eye symptoms after LASIK. • Nearly 5% of subjects were dissatisfied with their vision after Lasik.

March 2014 - Survey of physicians who've had laser eye surgery confirms high rates of adverse effects, consistent with  LASIK critics' assertions Pasquali et al performed   a survey of physicians who underwent laser eye surgery from 2000 to 2012, which was published in the Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (JCRS). In a colossal failed attempt to spin the survey results in favor of LASIK,  JCRS editor Nick Mamalis, MD revealed the following high rates of post-surgical adverse effects reported by physician-respondents: " eyes feeling irritated (50%), glare (43%), halos (41%), and [trouble] seeing in dim light (35.2%) ." Source:

In the editorial, Mamalis  refers to the LASIK industry's  hastily thrown together LASIK WORLD LITERATURE REVIEW , calling it "an exhaustive review". In their haste to counter negative press surrounding a 2008 FDA hearing on LASIK problems, perhaps the authors forgot to mention   that the articles retained in the literature review  confirm double-digit rates of persistent dry eyes and night vision problems after LASIK .

"There is a high risk of potential traumatic flap problems after LASIK and it is not recommended in army service ". (Xiao et al, 2012) "Laser in situ keratomileusis is another surgery in which the flap is prone to traumatic dislocation because the interface does not seem to heal except at the edges." (Canto et al, 2011) "Although LASIK remains the most popular refractive surgical procedure, it is becoming apparent that corneal surfaces, cut to create the midstromal flap during surgery, fail to fully reunite postoperatively ; surgeons can simply peel back an anterior corneal flap several years later. Such patients... are at risk for progressive visual disability due to general corneal weakness that may progress to ectasia or even traumatic displacement of the insecure flap ."

It's not without risks  By Alison Smith Squire for MailOnline    Updated: 07:30 EDT, 30 November 2010                    185  View comments     The TV advert for laser eye surgery made it sound so straightforward that Lois ­Roberts didn’t think twice. ‘The idea of just being able to see perfectly as soon as I opened my eyes in the morning seemed fantastic,’ says the law graduate. She’d worn contacts and glasses for short-sightedness since she was 13-years-old and ‘really looked forward to being able to bin them’.       Regret: Lois Roberts now suffers from painfully dry eyes  ‘I also played a lot of sport such as hockey and found wearing glasses ­annoying,’ she says. Her parents thought it was such a good idea that they helped pay for the £1,500 cost as a present for her 21st birthday. Yet, instead of the simple pain-free experience Lois was led to expect, the surgery to correct her short-sightedness left her in agony for days. Worse, three years on, she still has ­painfully dry eyes as a result of damage to the nerves that stimulate tears. Lois has to apply eye drops daily - which in itself is a problem, as ­long-term use can raise the risk of chronic eye inflammation. Dry eyes can also lead to serious infections and, ultimately, even loss of vision. As well as dry eyes, Lois suffers from constant floaters and poorer night vision. ‘The floaters are like clumps of black lines and dots,’ she says. ‘I’ve been reassured they’re harmless, but they are incredibly annoying.’ Floaters occur as a result of a popular form of laser surgery in which a flap is cut into the surface of the cornea — the clear, domed part of the eyeball.    RELATED ARTICLES   Previous  1  Next        Frail and fading, Monica had weeks to live - until a new op added TEN YEARS to her life       Share this article  Share     The flap is lifted so that the laser can remove some of the corneal tissue underneath, to reshape it. But if the flap is folded back down with wrinkles in it or doesn’t adhere to the eye properly, it can result in speckles in vision. Poor night-time vision occurs because part of the cornea has been lasered incorrectly. The good news is that the surgery did correct her short-sightedness ­(previously it was minus 4.5; now she has ‘perfect’ vision). But I’m upset I wasn’t warned enough at my ­initial consultation that anything like this could happen,’ says Lois, from North Wales. ‘I would have thought much harder about it had I known the risks.’ This is far from a unique ­experience. Marketing manager Sarah Carter, 45, is taking legal action after treatment to correct severe short-sightedness (minus 6.5) left her with such dry eyes she needed further surgery. Unfortunately, this operation also went wrong, and the laser damaged the rim of her eyelids. As a result, Sarah, from Maidstone, Kent, ­suffers from painful ingrowing eyelashes, which must be plucked ­several times a month by an ­optician. She is about to undergo further eye surgery at Moorfields Eye Hospital, but there is no ­guarantee of any cure.   Five years since she had the laser eye surgery, she says: ‘I regret ever having it done. It seemed incredibly straightforward and, at the time, I was just fed up of the inconvenience of contact lenses and glasses. ‘But that was nothing compared to the agony I’ve endured since. ‘I can’t wear eye make-up any more, and my days are full of drops, ointment and constant eye irritation.’ ‘I can't wear eye make-up any more, and my days are full of drops, ointment and constant eye irritation’  Every year, 100,000 Britons undergo laser eye surgery, which alters the shape of the cornea to correct long and short-sightedness. First carried out in Britain in 1989, the technique was ­marketed as an end for the need to wear contact lenses and glasses. Since then, a whole range of ­different types of laser surgery have become available. However, some experts are ­concerned that the multi-­million-pound industry glosses over some unpleasant, and sometimes ­serious, side effects. Last year, a Which? report claimed six out of ten ­opticians offering laser eye surgery — including branches of big chains such as ­Optical Express, Optimax and Ultralase — gave unsatisfactory advice and failed to point out the risks. These include not only dry eyes, floaters and poor night vision, but also growths where the eye is cut, double vision, foggy vision, chronic eyelid inflammation and even loss of sight. Shockingly, there is no law preventing any surgeon from ­operating as an ‘eye expert’ — though the Royal College of Ophthalmologists awards a ­Certificate of Competence after a surgeon has demonstrated ­expertise in laser eye surgery. It ­recommends patients choose a surgeon with a minimum of three months’ formal training in laser eye surgery who performs at least 500 eye laser operations a year.       Laser surgery can have permanent side effects such as dry eyes and poor night vision  The Royal College says at least 75 per cent of patients undergoing laser surgery should end up with 20/20 vision. However, one in three still need glasses — and even when eyesight is successfully corrected, some will also be suffering from some sort of side-effect. The ‘overall risk’ of something going wrong with laser surgery ­— including floaters and dry eyes — is ‘less than 5 per cent’, according to its report published this year. The risk of serious complications — such as losing your eyesight — is less than 0.2 per cent. Worryingly, it admits the risk of complications at individual clinics can be as high as 40 per cent. Retired optometrist Dominic Devlin was so concerned about the lack of information about potential risks, he set up a website to help consumers. ‘As part of my research, I’ve been to consultations and have been ­surprised how little is made of potential problems that might occur,’ he says. Mr Devlin is also concerned many patients believe laser surgery is a permanent cure and think they’ll never have to wear glasses again. ‘The truth is laser eye surgery is not a lifetime fix. Side-effects from surgery mean some people will still need glasses for night-time and, as eyesight changes as we grow older, the vast majority will eventually need glasses for reading.’ Furthermore, he says, surgery can be much more painful and the recovery time might take much longer than people are sometimes led to believe. As illustrator David Holroyd, 57, learned to his cost. ‘The surgery lasted only minutes, but was terrifying. Had I known how painful it would be, I never would have had it done’  Eighteen months ago, he ­underwent laser eye surgery for short-sightedness, paying £2,600 for treatment at a private clinic near his Manchester home. ‘I’d seen a TV advert that made it look as if it was something you could have done in your lunch hour,’ he says. ‘I was ­struggling with several pairs of glasses — not only did I need bifocals generally, I also had a pair for reading.’ David says his consultation lasted 20 minutes, the ­surgery sounded straightforward and there was no mention of pain. Yet he claims that within ­seconds of starting the surgery, he was writhing in agony. My head was in a clamp so I couldn’t move, but I could feel every brush of the laser. ‘I’d had local anaesthetic drops put into my eyes, but the doctors could see from my face I was in excruciating pain. ‘I was in too much agony to even speak, let alone tell them to stop. Yet all the doctor said was: “We are aware. Try to keep still.” ‘The surgery lasted only minutes, but was terrifying. Had I known how painful it would be, I never would have had it done.’ ‘Afterwards, I was in bed for three days, followed by two weeks when my sight wasn’t good enough to go out.’ As well as the pain, like Lois and Sarah he has also been left with dry eyes for which he will need drops for the rest of his life. Now, though his sight is much better, he has been told his eyes will be permanently dry. ‘I just feel angry that I wasn’t warned about any of this,’ he says. Mr Devlin is campaigning for a proper independent body where patients can seek advice and complain to if surgery goes wrong. He points out that contact lenses are much more sophisticated and cause fewer problems than they did 20 years ago and may be a safer option than laser surgery. ‘If you have a problem with ­contact lenses or glasses, you can pop back to the opticians where it can be easily rectified,’ he says. ‘But adverse side effects from laser surgery might be ­irreversible and permanent.’ Dominic Devlin’s website can be found at laser-eye-surgery-review.com      Share or comment on this article                                      Three men are charged with gang raping a 22-year-old...

(©Thinkstock)          While most see improvements from Lasik eye surgery, it comes with risks of severe dry eye to vision loss.      About 600,000 Lasik procedures are performed annually in the U.S., according to the Food and Drug Administration. The elective surgery — which clinicians say costs an average of $2,000 per eye, an expense not typically covered by insurance — is used to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism, a visual defect resulting in blurred vision.  The industry boasts a success rate in the high 90 percent range, but not everyone is happy with Lasik.  According to the FDA's own analysis of patient complaints, some people develop debilitating visual issues, such as double vision, glare or vision loss. In laying out the Lasik risks , the agency also notes issues with both overtreatment and undertreatment of patients.     Who should I see to discuss Lasik? Dr. Stephen Slade , a Houston ophthalmologist , was involved in the first FDA trials of Lasik, before laser technology was approved for the procedure in the U.S. in 1998. He suggests people considering the surgery pick a doctor they trust. In particular, Slade recommends seeing an eye doctor who's done thousands of cases, who is respected by peers, even someone who's taught other doctors.  Many surgeons fit that description, he says. He believes a doctor should also be equipped to provide alternative options to Lasik. Slade says an ophthalmologist's staff should be concerned about the patient, and the doctor should answer questions.  Related: 4 Must-Ask Lasik Questions  "I would not go to a place that pressures me," he says. "I also wouldn't want to go to a doctor who told me the surgery was perfect, I wouldn't have to wear glasses anymore, and [who] guaranteed I'd see great after surgery, because that's not true."  He adds that he doesn't know of a surgery with a higher success rate and lower complications. But, as with any surgery, there are risks of Lasik. These include dry eye, hazy or blurred vision and temporary sensitivity to light.            Not everyone is an ideal candidate for Lasik eye surgery. Make sure to discuss the risks and side effects of the procedure before deciding whether to proceed. (©Thinkstock)    Is Lasik eye surgery worth it, and what are the risks? Lasik permanently changes cornea shape, making it harder to measure later. So if you plan to undergo the procedure, first have your doctor fill out a card containing your eye measurements. You can download a refractive surgery information card for this purpose.  A small study published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology in 2008 found about one in five who had Lasik to correct nearsightedness underwent another procedure within 10 years because of undercorrection, overcorrection or regression.  John Ciccone, a spokesman for the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery, puts the overall number for touch-up surgeries at closer to 7 to 10 percent.  Ophthalmologists say lasers are safer and more precise than ever, and the sheer number of cases is making it easier for doctors to predict who will do well with the procedure. "The first thing people need to do is find out if they're a good candidate," Slade says.     Who is a candidate for Lasik surgery? The best candidates are adults with a stable prescription — their eyes aren't worsening. Many medical conditions, including cornea disease, unstable diabetes and various types of arthritis reduce the chances of a successful procedure.  Dr. David Whiting , an ophthalmologist based near Minneapolis , says 85 to 90 percent of his patients who want Lasik are good candidates. But Whiting, who has done more than 100,000 Lasik procedures, concedes there's a gray area.     Will laser eye surgery lead to follow-up treatment? In addition to Lasik eye surgery risks and complications that some suffer, many require glasses or contacts right after Lasik.  Ciccone says most who get Lasik do so to correct nearsightedness, and many have presbyopia, a common condition with age in which the eyes lose their ability to focus up close.  For those with presbyopia, the same Lasik procedure that grants distance vision also prompts the need for reading glasses. "They didn't realize they were presbyopic to begin with, they were using their nearsightedness to read," Ciccone says.  Some solve the problem by fixing one eye for distance and another for close-up, or what's called monovision. About 25 percent of Lasik patients over 40 opt for this, Whiting says. Of those — maybe one in 10 — need Lasik on just one eye.  Related: 5 Lasik Alternatives  For most, Lasik opened their eyes in a way glasses and contacts couldn't. It's also become safer following millions of completed procedures.  "It's not an iffy procedure," says ophthalmologist Dr. Alan Brown in Wilmington, North Carolina, who received Lasik surgery on his eyes.  But because Lasik was only approved in 1998 by the FDA, the agency says the long-term safety and effectiveness of the procedure remains unknown.  Have you undergone Lasik eye surgery?

Will it keep increasing? I never used glasses for such a lower prescription but now in this job I have started to feel pain on the back of my left eye when I focus on screen and it remains after I stop seeing it, I have this pain for about 2 weeks now and ophthalmologist has only answer , "Don't use computer at night, night is for sleep, and also try to change your job description, glasses wont help etc". I don't agree,  and I am sure this strain or CVS has something to do with LASIK, I forced him into giving me prescription for glasses, he gave me 0.5 in both eyes and said, "We docs don't give full prescription or your prescription may further increase, let eye fight a bit." When I feel strain I feel it in my temples, shoulder, back, neck and sometimes behind head too. Pain doesn't let me work. . By using glasses things seem to get better for one week, but now its looks like they are getting back to same. Strain is moving from eye to other parts of body again like shoulder, neck etc. It looks like CVS (computer vision syndrome) but I am sure it has something to do with LASIK. Any idea what should I do to prevent CVS in my one eye and to prevent my prescription increase further?     reply to Ammar          Srini  2 years ago   Subject: lasek done 2 weeks ago      Hi  I am 33 male and working as software consultant I done lasek 2 weeks ago , from past 2 days I feeling double vision and hazeness, I have to work on computer 8 hours a day, it's comman issue after lasek or its like a complication , Iam worried about my vision. Can some one please suggest me on this??     reply to Srini          Emily  1 year ago   Subject: Eye strain after surgery      Srini, using computer screens for a long period of time can cause eye strain, which is not good after eye surgury. Usually it is due to bright light and lower rate of blinking that dries out the eye. Posture and strained focus on one point (the computer) can also be an issue. This can be curbed by wearing sunglasses, using eyedrops correctly, and pausing each 20 minutes to focus on something across the room. Consider talking to a doctor or consultant about eyesight office hazards, and someone who can help with surgical complications.     reply to Emily          monica  1 year ago   Subject: lasik surgery went wrong      I understand how you feel. I had the surgery done in 2014 and I feel I made a biggest mistake in my life. I wish I could have read all about the Lasik surgery before I go under knife. The worse is the doctor don't care if any you have trouble with your eyes after surgery. I called my doctor and told him about my eyes he did not care . All they care is to make money and pay their own bills. They don't care if you have problem with complications , once you signed the contest you are done. So if any body reads this its true don't fall for this advertising that you can see well . It is nothing but illusion . Stick with your contact lenses or glasses, it is the best. I know that doctor says  you will enjoy seeing with out help of contact lenses. it is not true you still need contact lenses after that . every thing so blurry . At the time of surgery my instinct was telling me not to do it and I told to my doctor I do not want to proceed even though I paid in advance and he said I can not give your money back so might as well do the Lasik . I felt I was so much pressured to do the surgery now I do not where to go or who do I complain about my doctor. I lost my money and I lost my vision.     reply to monica          Nancy Burleson MD  1 year ago   Subject: If your vision does not      If your vision does not improve, seek a second opinion with an opthalmologist that treats complications of Lasik.

Even with all the information you provided, we're not in a position to do what only an eye doctor should and weigh in on your specific case. For clarification on whether or not you're a candidate for LASIK, you'll want to speak with an eye doctor you trust and get a second opinion if you feel additional perspective is warranted.  Make sure to fully discuss potential benefits, risks and alternatives to the procedure.     reply to Michael Schroeder         View More Replies - 1  Hide Replies  Loading...        Paul  3 years ago   Subject: Lasik...the good and bad      I began needing glasses in the 3rd Grade.  I wore contacts from 10th Grade until my eyes became too sensitive to them.  I had Lasik performed on both eyes in 1997 and enjoyed great vision (except at night due to astigmatism) until about two years ago.  I will be 52 next month.  I do a lot of computer work and that puts a lot of strain on my eyes.  I have been suffering with blurry vision and headaches.  I finally had enough and got prescription computer glasses for the 1 1/2 to 3 feet away range.  I also got prescription progressive bifocals for driving at night due to astigmatism and some return of nearsightedness.  Both have helped but I still cannot seem to get both eyes corrected properly for astigmatism and I wonder if the monovision from lasik is the problem.  I have had my correction changed twice and it is still not right.  I get dizzy from my eyes fighting back and forth to focus when wearing the driving glasses.  One day the prescription seems ok and the next, one eye seems blurry and weak.  I also have been noticing blue flashes of light when watching tv or at the theater.  It is always in my left eye and seems to follow the curvature of the cornea...from about the 11 o'clock position down to 7 o'clock.   I am thinking it may be the bluish-white light from the tv hitting a refractive surface/scar tissue from the lasik surgery.  Like light shimmering off a facet of a diamond.  Just a guess...  If I had to do it again, I would definitely have Lasik.  To this day, during daylight hours, I can see very well into the distance.  My eyes are now undergoing changes from aging, but, glasses are correcting that, I have still have the freedom to swim and bike and do many other things without glasses getting in the way or a contact drying out or falling out.     reply to Paul          Deepak  3 years ago   Subject: Advice required      I am 22 year old male. 10 years ago, I had a condition called retinal vasculitis.

  Angie's List   Subject: Re: alternatives to LASIK      Hi Deepak,  Unfortunately, I can't say offhand, and I don't want to speculate. However, I would expect another eye doctor could look at the specifics of your case and properly advise you. In general, it's always a good idea to seek a second opinion if a medical provider can't, or won't, answer your questions.        -Michael Schroeder, senior writer, Angie's List     reply to Michael Schroeder          Gabriele  4 years ago   Subject: t      True enough, free government grants are intended increase the economy of the nation by way of helping people and organizations.

I needed it to pass my driver's license vision test.  I paid about $1500 per eye both for distance clarity (plus $500 for eyedrop meds).  Yes it was unconfortable but not painful.  Mornings require more care and eyedrops than other times of the day.  I do not want to endorse anyone, but I live in Dallas and went to the #1 lasik doc here.  I was seeing around 20/100 or worse.  I failed my driver's vision test with Texas DPS.  Now I am seeing 20/20 out of each eye and 20/15 when both are used.  I renewed my driver's license with no restrictions 3 hours ago and I am vaery happy about that!  I did lose some close up vision and need reading glasses for very small print like ingrediants on certain products.  I do not need reading glasses for books with normal print size.  The technology is here now.  If you are a candidate I say get 'er done!  It's like all of the road signs are shouting at me and typing in all caps at the same time!  From a half a mile away!

I have had one eye corrected, with the other one not yet being degraded to the point of having surgery. When I went in to have the 1st eye fixed I was informed that my eyesight would have had a better chance of being corrected to 20/20 if I had not had lasik. The lasik has been good, but I wish I had been informed that as you get older & cataracts are more likely that it is better not to have lasik.     reply to Ronadl Kauffman          rkcorp  6 years ago   Subject: 12 years and going strong      quick, off the top of my head story....i had Lasiks done in 2000 in california by a canadian company, lasiksvision, that at the time was opening locations all over the place. i paid a grand for both eyes. it was their grand opening promotion. my sister had it done a couple weeks after me. so did a friend. I'm still glasses-free 12 years later. my sister just got herself some glasses for night time driving and the optometrist couldn't even detect that Lasiks was done. the friend didn't fair as well. he had problems straight off the Bausch-Lomb machine. his experience sounds very similar to most of the ones I've read above, so i won't repeat here. but i will add... he wears glasses now and is fine. but of course, wishes he never had gone thru the experience. however, he had whacky eyes to begin with, was in hi late 40s, and had a hardcore coke bottle rx. somehow he was told he was a good candidate, but in all reality, from the start, i don't think he was. the bummer at the time was, he's the one who was all gung-ho about it and got my sister and i to go for it!  my experience has been very good. i was early 30s at the time. i saw perfectly straight off the table... altho the doctor was yelling at me to stop straining and close my eyes! i was reading license plates and street signs all the way home. the doctors and nurses set up my post operative side-effects really well. i had the halo effect for about a year and was dropping eye drops frequently that first year as well. but it was nothing compared to being able to read the clock straight out of bed, snorkel without glasses, drive without glasses, on and on. when i wore contact lenses my eyes were so bloodshot and dry ALL time time. this was a miracle procedure for me. my vision was perfect and dropping a few drops thru out the day was no burden at all. 12 years on now... tired eyes usually means a couple eye drops are in order. this was the best thing i think i ever did for myself.  had i read all these negative experiences, i doubt i would have gone for it. but i had friends who were going to canada at the time to have this done and they couldn't say enough positive things about it! i also don't think i would do it past the age of 40. by that time, age related eye changes are a huge factor and if you can't have a result that will allow you to NOT wear glasses, it's not really worth the money to have the procedure just for a slightly different rx. in my opinion. if you are in your 20s or 30s, with a stable eye rx, healthy, and find a doctor who has done this a mazillion times.... i wouldn't rule it out as an option. both my sister and i highly recommend. 12 years glass free and counting.     reply to rkcorp          Susan Marren  6 years ago   Subject: Get a second opinion      As with any surgery, a second opinion is necessary.  If you have big pupils, you WILL see haloes. If you have borderline dry eye, it WILL be worse after LASIK. If you are over 40, you may well have problems needing reading glasses.  LASIK is surgeon-dependent. You are not legally blind if you can be corrected with glasses.  For someone with severe nearsightedness, consider waiting until you need cataract surgery if you are older.  A good second opinion should pick up any incipient keratoconus, dry eye, and make recommendations for those with big pupils or who are older.  When you get older, your up close vision becomes more important. If you want to go monovision, be sure you try it with contacts first because not everyone can stand it. The better your binocularity, the less likely you can tolerate one eye being blurred all the time. And contacts can also help you decide which eye to correct for far away.  Don't let them guess.  I am a retired optometric educator, a profession that has been unfairly scorned by Angie's List, but we do know a lot more than many think.  Lasik is best for the person who wants to wake up able to see but who doesn't think he or she will get perfect vision.     reply to Susan Marren          Paula Cofer  6 years ago   Subject: LASIK is a harmful surgery      Go to LasikComplications.com and read Top Ten Reasons Not to Have LASIK.

I too had blepheritis along with chonic corneal erosions which was the reason for the surgery. Had to have it done twice after a 4 month regime of antibiotics. I now need both eyes done. This was early 90s. The doctor who invented this Dr.Margerite McDonald was my surgerion @LSU Lions Eye Center in New Orleans. If I were insured or financialy able I would have it done again.      reply to rhonda white          Lonnie  6 years ago   Subject:      I had LASIK in July 1998, at the time it was covered by my insurance 80%. I can say without reservations it was the best money I ever spent. It's 12 years later and because of age I am starting to have less than 20/20 vision in my left eye. The right eye still sees 20/15. I will need reading glasses as I age, but my Dr told me that I would before I had the surgery at some point in the future.      reply to Lonnie          Paul  6 years ago   Subject:      Remember, you get what you paid for. I had my my eyes done 4 years ago with no problems. I also avoided cheap newspaper ads and used my own eye specialist. My eyes are worth much more than $450 an eye. Also, my doctor was the only doctor i met so far that had the procedure done on himself.      reply to Paul          Jennifer  6 years ago   Subject:      I had LASIK 1 year ago on both eyes and can say with total honesty, it was the best $4300 I have EVER spent.  Waking up that first morning and seeing the alarm clock brought me to tears.  My life is no longer controlled by glasses and contacts.  I especially realized that when I packed for the first vacation following surgery.  Realizing I didn't have to pack 14 pair of contacts, solution and glasses, was just 1 of many little reminders of how happy I am with the outcome.  I have had NO side effects.  My husband had the surgery 2 years before I did and we're both so happy with the results.      reply to Jennifer          S. Smith  3 years ago   Subject: Jennifer, I was just like you      Jennifer, I was just like you. A year after surgery like you said, I was no longer controlled by glasses and/or contacts. It was wonderful!! I was ecstatic! But, as time wore on, and now it's been 6 years since I had LASIK, my vision has since deteriorated. No one told me LASIK wasn't permanent. I thought I'd see 20/20 forever. Now I'm back to wearing glasses. Wish I would have known that before I plumped down the $3,000. If I knew $3,000 would only have me glasses-free for 5 years I wouldn't have undergone the procedure.     reply to S. Smith         View More Replies - 1  Hide Replies  Loading...

Six years in and my vision started to revert. I went to another well known Dr. for his opinion and he said I had cataracts ( I was now 54 y/o ) I went back to the well known Dr that did the surgery and he said that the monvision would be done again for for the same fee minus a 10% discount. He never said a word about the cataracts after his exam. I asked for my medical records and never went back. Now I do not know if I can trust having cataract surgery done.     reply to nan brinkley          Jim Jerge  6 years ago   Subject:      I had lasik on both eyes approximately 10 years ago at the age of 56.  I was wearing tri focals prior to lasik and required reading glasses following the procedure. I was happy with the results for approximately  4 years when my vision began to deteriorate and eventually I was wearing tri focals again.  I was not eligible for a "touch up" because I had developed cataracts.  I did not have cataracts prior to lasik.  The cataracts are now obscuring my vision and I am awaiting a lens implant, but I can not get the info about my cornea prior to the cataract surgery.  I'm being told that due to the lasik I am not a candidate for the most recent multi focal lens.  In addition, the results for lasik patients is often not as good as for non-lasik patients.      reply to Jim Jerge          Jeff Williams  3 years ago   Subject: Cataracts and Laski      I had cataract surgery April 2014 both eyes - I was told I legally blind. Prior to surgery I was told that I was not a candidate for the multi-focal lens. I was also told I would still need reading glasses. I was told that my long distance vision after surgery would be more crisp with glasses. I passed my vision exam for my drivers drivers license renewal but I had to close one eye as my left eye was still swollen after surgery a month prior. It is now eight months later and I am considering Lasik to correct the astigmatism which is supposed to increase or correct the crispness of my long distance vision. I will be 70 next June. I am still undecided on Lasik but struggle with my glasses - distortion and bluriness unless looking straight ahead. I have a mild astigmatism RX with a blended 2.50 reading glasses in my glasses. I'd love to just have reading glasses after Laski. What to do! I'm going for a second opinion.     reply to Jeff Williams          Nancy PH  6 years ago   Subject:      To Bryan Rickerson:  I had worn glasses since I was 10 years old & in 2006 I had custom Lasik on my right eye for correction & PTK (which was tweaked for correction) on the left to treat anterior membrane dystrophy.  The right eye ended up under-corrected.  I opted to keep it that way since it preserved my near vision, so I now have monovision.  Which is great!  I only wear glasses for very up-close work or driving at night in fog in an unfamiliar location.  However, I was still left with an exquisitely  painful area in my left eye from the AMD which is exacerbated by dryness, especially upon awakening.  Neither of my eyes seems to produce enough tears at night, frequent eye drops did not help - not to mention the sleep disruption from using them.  I started using Muro 128 5% Sterile Ophthalmic Eye Ointment at night (per my ophthalmologist), which help a lot.  Coincidentally, I also take a medication for another condition which causes dry mouth, especially at night, & complained to my primary doctor about it.  I was tested for Sjogren’s disease, which was negative.   Still she still started me on Evoxac at night, a cholinergic agent used to treat dry mouth in patients with Sjogren's syndrome.  Side effects are many (as with all medications), but besides helping with dry mouth, it also seems to produce enough tears to prevent my left eye pain upon awakening.  A Godsend!  I rarely have pain upon awakening & rarely use the Muro 128, never use eye drops at night.  Even with  this problem, I would still have had both  surgeries done again.  I was not able to even walk around safely without glasses before.  One has to make trade-offs in most things in life or take no risks at all.      reply to Nancy PH          Steve Richfield  6 years ago   Subject:      Clearly more serious research is needed for both LASIK and cataract implants. As things now stand, any research that the providers do will promptly be used against them in court by people who have had problems with their procedures. Hence, there is NO research money available except to improve procedures. I have problems with both eyes, but am waiting as long as I can for things to improve before either having LASIK that will threaten future implants, or getting implants that will make it impossible to upgrade as future technology becomes available. Note that Aspheric Crystalens, the premier implant, has only been available since January.  Is anyone here interested in forming an independent study group to close on these and related issues?      reply to Steve Richfield          ST  6 years ago   Subject:      I had LASIK on both eyes approximately 11 years ago.  It was wonderful because I could see the clock next to my bed when I awoke.  However, I now have cataracts in both eyes, and the optomologist wants me to wait on surgery as long as I can.  He says that the surgery is more problematic for those who have had LASIK.  Just a thought -      reply to ST          DE  6 years ago   Subject:      I have to agree with the first responder.  10 years after having RK (Radial Keratotomy)my vision started to rapidly decrease.  After consulting many different specialists, it was determined that I suffered from keratoconus (basically, a sagging and bulging cornea).  I'm sure the RK either brought on, or accentuated the problem.  Now I'm struggling just to see properly, and have to be fitted with very special...very EXPENSIVE...contacts, and am considering corneal replacements in my future.  Make SURE you have a complete understanding of the health of your eyes before ever considering any type of surgery.  What may be great now, could become a major complication in your future.      reply to DE          CJC  6 years ago   Subject:      The best money I have ever spent was on LASIK surgery over three years ago.  I now can see 20/15 with both eyes (20/20 for each) and couldn't be happier.  No dry eyes, no hazy vision, and my night vision was perfectly fine after recovering for a few months.  But I also did my homework in choosing a surgeon, not even considering a "cheap" solution.  As soon as people start thinking LASIK is a commodity, then they'll start getting equivalent results.      reply to CJC          David T  6 years ago   Subject:      I had LASIK done on both eyes, I have Monovision.  My son and wife also had Lasik and only my wife had to have it TWEAKED.  We all three are very happy with the results. For me it was a miracle.  I had been using glasses/contacts since 1965 and it was in 2003/2004 that I no longer needed them and could play with my grandkids in the pool and beach.  I know that it was not for everyone, but for us it was Great.      reply to David T          Bryan Rickerson  6 years ago   Subject:      Last April, I had Epi-Lasik done on both of my eyes from a nationwide chain of lasik specialists.  I have noticed several side effects that haven't gone away.  However, as many of these side effects are LESS severe than the contact lenses I used to wear, I can say that I thoroughly enjoy having clear vision.  I do wake up in the morning with painfully dry eyes, and sometimes have to wake up in the middle of the night to put drops in. However, I do not have to reach for glasses just to see an alarm clock.  I am the positive statistic. I did the research, took the risk, and it (so far) has paid off for me.      reply to Bryan Rickerson          John H  6 years ago   Subject:      Great article, but it only covers the surface. The Lasik profession tells people they have 20/20, but it may be less. In my case it is less. Good article, but more needs to be investigated. I suspect 50% of the outcomes are substandard.      reply to John H          CB  6 years ago   Subject:      I had the RK surgery many years ago and by ten years later, suffered what is called corneal dystrophy, which is common in patients who have refractive surgeries.  I had the misfortune to be advised by a couple of doctors that I needed to have a transplant.  I felt helpless and went on the advice, I now have been living legally blind for the last 7 years since my transplant, with no hope of improvement, and if anything, constantly having severe changes in my eyes due to unstable corneas.  I also came to find out that I should not have been a candidate for a transplant, there were many other non-surgical options out there - but now it's too late.  My advice is - DO NOT have these surgeries, there has not been enough time to really know what the long term effects will be.  I am the statistic and it is not worth losing your sight over what seems like a temporary miracle.      reply to CB          jinnybrow  6 years ago   Subject:      Is it possible for Angie's List to do the same kind of article about Lasik 2, the second level procedure?

I was very nearsighted and was thrilled initially, but had to have the procedure done twice in both eyes because I regressed.  I wear glasses now (15+ years later) and won't get my left cataract fixed until I have to.  My vision in the right eye after cataract surgery is now 20/200 - not great! Investigate this aspect completely before having the surgery.      reply to MEA          James J. Salz, M. D.  6 years ago   Subject:      The email responses illustrate that although LASIK is highly successful with a very low incidence of complications, it is not risk free and it is not appropriate for all eyes. Dr. Slade gives good advice as to how to look for a good surgeon, there is no hurry, get more than one opinion.  Many patients who have had problems were most likely not good candidates and should not have had the surgery. One excellent way to find a good surgeon is to contact an eye surgeon in your area who does not perform LASIK and ask him or her for a recommendation. They know the good surgeons.      reply to James J. Salz, M. D.          K  6 years ago   Subject:      I have worked with LASIK doctors for over 10 years now. Just for clarification. Over 90% of patients are extremely happy with their procedure. The surgery is not complicated or painful. When surveyed, patients often site it as one of the 5 best things they have done in their life, after marriage, children, and graduating college. The actual procedure takes about 10-15 minutes. A re-treatment or enhancement means you will have the surgery again. Most good surgeons have a re-treatment/enhancement rate of 5% or less. Normally those requiring re-treatment are those with more complicated prescriptions. Although very few need re-treatment it is not the end of the world. It is just another 10-15 minute procedure. Most doctors will do re-treatments within a year at no charge if needed. RK and PRK are not LASIK and experience for the patient is quite different. You can't compare them to one another. Both RK and PRK are more invasive then LASIK. RK was a procedure performed in the early 80's. PRK in the late 80's to early 90's and LASIK from the mid 90's until today. LASIK has only gotten better and safer over the years. In the past, there was new technology that improved outcomes every couple years, there is very little in the research pipeline right now, so if you are waiting until it gets even better, you will be waiting a long time. LASIK corrects over 90% to 20/40, the majority to 20/20. There are two commponents to the surgery: 1) the creation of the flap and 2) the actual laser treatment. For the creation of the flap, the surgeon can use a keratome or a femtosecond laser. Most complications occur with the keratome method and I recommend a femtosecond laser. For the laser treatement, you can have standarad of custom treatment. A standard treatement treats your prescription but doesn't look at all the irregularities of your eye. Custom treats not only your prescription, but also the other irregularities of your eye that make your vision unique.  I had LASIK in 99. Still 20/20 today and ranks in the top 4 events of my life. That is why I am in this industry. If I were in my 20's or 30's, I would get the surgery as soon as possible, assuming my vision is stable, to get the most out of it and select custom and a femtosecond laser. If I was over 40 and considering it, I would still do it, but know I will have to wear reading glasses or have only one eye corrected to see at a distance. If I was over 50, I would talk to my doctor about my options - could go either way here. If I was over 60, I would wait until I developed a cataract and opt for a Premium IOL at that time since insurance would cover a portion of the cost.      reply to K          Candice M  6 years ago   Subject:      I had my vision corrected in April 2000 at the age of 20 at what was then one of the leading clinics in MN (I no longer live in MN so I can't speak for their status now.)  We paid for the expertise, but it was worth every penny to me, being able to see to swim, exercise, etc. I had been legally blind since I was 6 or 7.  It's not perfect - my vision is 20/20 and 20/30, which, to me, is great!  But I've experienced halos at night and occasional haziness (particularly when I'm tired.)  However, that isn't much different that what I experienced when I wore contacts or glasses - looking through those was very similar.      reply to Candice M          Margot  6 years ago   Subject:      I didn't notice a reference to ORTHO K treatment. It is also known by another name, but I forget what it is. You sleep in hard contact lenses that reshape your cornea. In the a.m., you take them out and zip around without need of contacts or glasses. For some, you can go every other night with sleeping in the lenses. I did this for five years and it worked great for me, with the exception that sometimes it was hard to put a lens in, and increasingly I had to use eye drops. Now I'm back to glasses: trifocals      reply to Margot          S  6 years ago   Subject:      The doctor is the most critical part of getting a good Lasik procedure. Mine was done over 10 years ago in San Diego by a famous (now dead) doctor who even invented a better tool for eye surgery. I wish I could go back to him for any additional work, if needed later. I'd be most interested in finding a really good eye surgeon in East Texas now that we retired here. I hope Angie's List will recommend one or more.      reply to S          Karen  6 years ago   Subject:      I forgot to mention that when I complain to my expensive doctor's office about these side effects, they do not note them in my file.  This makes me think that they are not reporting them as complications.  I have read other things that suggest this is their practice - as long as you can read 20/20, even if you have to squint and it looks inferior because of the increased glare, you get reported as a complete success.      reply to Karen          Karen  6 years ago   Subject:      I had Lasik two years ago and although the surgery was generally successful (I now see about 20/15), I have permanent side effects: 1) slightly dry eyes (no big deal), b) starbursts around lights (enough to make me nervous about driving at night, which I rarely do at this point in my life), c) halo effect (fuzzy light around the edges of any lighter objects in my view, including white letters on movie screens, sunlight-filled windows, etc.); and d) a general sensitivity to very bright light.  My surgeon (who had done many surgeries, is well respected and charged lots of money) made it sound as if any problems with the surgery could be corrected, but now they tell me that these problems cannot be corrected.  Overall, I'm still probably slightly happier with my life now (no need for contacts, etc.) but given the expense and the risk of future complications, I wish I had not done it.      reply to Karen          Moore  6 years ago   Subject:      I had two rounds of Lasik surgery in 2001.  I would be 20/20 in the operating room, but by the next morning vision would start sliding back.  The Dr. refused to redo it again, so I wore glasses until my cataracts were removed four years later.  It was hard for the surgeon to figure out my base vision but I ended up with 20/30 vision, which is wonderful to this person who grew up in Coke bottle glasses with ulcers on both sides of my nose.  I now wear glasses to read only.      reply to Moore          JM  6 years ago   Subject:      First of all, I have to say that I’m not in a position to give unbiased information about refractive surgery. Before lasik, I was a happy, positive, productive person.  I wore glasses or contacts and presbyopia was setting in, so I thought it would be much less expensive in the long run and more convenient to get lasik and then simply need reading glasses rather than needing to have contacts, glasses, bifocals, etc. and be juggling them all.  What I wouldn’t give to be able to pop in some contacts or put on some glasses and be able to see again.  Very seriously, the ONLY reason I have lived through this is because of the overwhelming support and understanding of the compassionate people on a support site for lasik victims called lasermyeye.org,  two friends who had experience with massive depression, and my family who has so kindly cared for me while this terrible decision has also ruined the life they once knew I went to a very well-known clinic where the doctor had performed thousand of procedures and was highly respected and had been in business for many years.  Initially, my  damaged  vision was my biggest problem.  That was what sent me into a massive, suicidal depression for months. Then the dry eye set in.  Since lasik, my dry eyes are painful every minute of the day.  I begin the day flooding them with drops while my husband brings me a warm cloth to lay over them.  I then go into the bathroom where I’m unable to see details of my face in the mirror.   I look clown like if I try to apply makeup.  I put flax seed on toast for breakfast to try to help with dry eye and then I take fish oil pills after that.  After breakfast I refill the two humidifiers that run nonstop in my house.  I have finally accepted that I will no longer be able to participate in the hobbies I used to enjoy due to my vision issues, but living with the pain of dry eye is something you simply cannot understand until you have experienced it.  It is not a problem that is solved by putting some eye drops in.  The pain often emanates from the socket and it’s often tempting to gouge your eyeballs out.  I once thought it was inconvenient to travel with contacts, solution, soap and glasses.  Now when I travel (which is ONLY when necessary),  I take several strengths of reader glasses, bifocals, fish oil, drops, a humidifier, swim goggles, onion goggles, anti-anxiety medication.  I am almost never able to see in the dim lighting of most hotel rooms.  Our oldest daughter graduated from college and we helped her move to Midland, Texas  (better known as hell for dry eye patients) for her new job.   I struggled to get through the days, trying to hide my pain from her so that this could be an exciting experience for her.  There is never a minute of the day that I forget about my eyes - NOT ONE MINUTE.  Please don’t let yourself be put in this same situation.  I don’t want one more person joining this blog because they’re in pain. I have no confidence in myself anymore because I can’t believe I made a decision that ruined not only my life, but that of my family.  My children just want their old Mom back and that will never happen.  It’s one thing to ruin my own life, but entirely another thing to have affected so many people I love.  At the end of the day, any refractive surgery is unpredictable.  PLEASE hear what I’m trying to tell those of you who are here to gather information to make a decision as to whether or not to have lasik or prk.  Read between the lines and hear the sadness; do not think that it can’t happen to you.  We were all normal people JUST LIKE YOU and now our lives are changed forever.  Some people have coped much better than I have and that seems to be associated with the ability to find good care, which I have not been successful in doing.  My life, as well as many others, is consumed daily with dealing with the vision and dry eye problems.  It’s not even possible to adjust because it is such a dynamic situation.  Vision changes daily and may worsen with time and the same is true for dry eye.  The games this situation plays with your head can make you crazy.  Do I use lots of drops or will that make my body think I don’t need to produce as many, continuing the dry eye cycle?  If I use fewer drops, will that damage my  cornea further?  Will restasis help, is it worth the cost or will we discover horrible side effects from it down the road?  Should I get punctual plugs?  Oops, one fell out; or is part of it still in the canal?  Research, research, research….   What foods help dry eye?  Okay, I need more potassium; what foods have that?  Who do I trust now?  Do I try rgps or will they be to painful to wear?  Is it worth the cost to go to Dr. G?  I spent $4000 for this??!  I feel like a freak wearing these goggles, but sometimes they‘re the only thing that gives me relief from the pain.  Will I be need cataract surgery that will ruin my vision even more or worse yet, will I need a cornea transplant because my corneas were too thin to have been operated on in the first place???  I’m amazed that my husband has stuck with me through this.  What have I done to my family??! I have read of so many younger people who have been forced to change careers because of the damage from refractive surgery.  Do not simply read over the information that you do not want to hear.  I would have given anything to have been fortunate enough to come across this information  before I chose to have lasik.  There is no way I would have had the surgery if I had known of any of these complications.  Count your lucky stars that you found this site and do not ignore the information you find and dismiss it because it does not support your desire.  When they tell you no one has ever been blinded by refractive surgery, know that they don’t count people who end up with ectasia that requires a cornea transplant.  It doesn’t matter if you see 6 “E’s” on the chart, or starbursts around it, or if it is blurry or if you’re in terrible pain, the doctors will say you’re great.  Also,  no one EVER asked me if I was satisfied with my surgery.   As others have said more eloquently than I, all of the data is skewed.  It is not possible for me to convey how utterly miserable the consequences of this surgery can be.  Although I am no longer imminently suicidal, I would still welcome death as a relief.  I am simply trying to hold on a few more years for my children.  I realized that even though I can’t do any of the things their old Mom did, I can still love them more than anyone on earth and they need that until their own lives are more grounded.  I now live in constant pain from both vision and dry eye problems.  I live in fear of the future because it will all get worse.  I WAS YOU - DON’T HAVE REFRACTIVE SUGERY!!  I BEG YOU!!!      reply to JM          Karina  3 years ago   Subject: I am having the same problem or worst      Please email me im having all the problems mentioned not exaggerating really, and much more.

Unlike the comment above from someone who works with an ophthalmologist, the procedure was quite painful – like sand in my eyes for several days.  I feel that this was minimized by the ophthalmologist.  Nevertheless, the pain resolved in short order and my DISTANCE vision is better than 20/20.  The other issue – and I feel as if I was adequately forewarned regarding this issue and I minimized it – is now my close-up vision is horrible. I can no longer read anything without reading glasses.  This is a much bigger problem than I ever imagined.  I love to read for pleasure and I need to read for work and lastly, I love to work on projects around my house and now I am constantly hunting for reading glasses.  I have taken to strategically placing reading glasses all over my house, car, and office. So, I got what I wanted however, if you are over 40 years old and are considering the surgery be prepared to need reading glasses.      reply to STexas          S. Smith  3 years ago   Subject: Stexas, I had the same      Stexas, I had the same situation. Before LASIK I was near-sighted, and could see perfectly fine up close. I could read the tiniest of print. After LASIK corrected my distance vision, I could no longer see up close. I wish I would have been informed of this prior to the surgery, but I was not. I also was not told that LASIK was not permanent. I'm not an opthamologist- I figured if they lasered your cornea and changed the shape of it, it was a permanent solution. I thought my distance vision would remain 20/20 just like it did right after the procedure. It did not. About 5 years after LASIK my distance vision began to deteriorate. I'm now back to wearing glasses for distance.     reply to S. Smith          Jon  6 years ago   Subject:      In Lasik or PRK, they are essentially burning away cells in the reshaping of the cornea. There is a protective (epithelial) layer of cells over the cornea that must be removed before the reshaping happens. Lasik involves cutting and pulling back a hinged flap of that epithelial layer, but doing so takes some of the corneal cells with it, leaving less material to shape. PRK uses a chemical and/or abrasive tool to completely remove a thinner layer of cells leaving more cornea to work with. The flap created during Lasik is put back in place as a natural bandage, although there seems to be debate over whether that flap really heals, or if it is just held in place by surface tension. The removal of cells in PRK forces the eye to regrow that top layer resulting in a much slower and painful healing process, but potentially a more stable eye/cornea surface.  I did a lot of the research and went to the best Doctor around. Dr. Scott MacRae who is a leading researcher in refractive surgery, has several patents on the technology, "wrote the book on Lasik (literally)", trains other Doctors, etc. His office gives a short seminar typically every Saturday for potential patients to learn about the different options and the risks involved. The price there is expensive but not unreasonable considering you don't want to go "bargain basement" on an eye procedure.  I was given a lot of warning and material on the known risks and success statistics. Being effectively blind without glasses or contacts (beyond 20/400), AND having an astigmatism that they could never correct quite right with lenses, I was willing to take the risk. I was not a candidate for Lasik due to the severity of my prescription (-7 diopters + astigmatism) and the amount of cornea I had to work with. I was however "approved" for PRK with custom astigmatism correction and decided to try it on just one eye. The procedure was painless and quick, and getting up off of the table I had fuzzy vision of probably 20/40 or maybe slightly worse. Healing was quite painful for a week or so but the vicodin and other drugs helped. Within a month or so I had 20/20 vision in that eye which healed cleanly and completely with no scarring (phew). Follow up visits were thorough and frequent, then monthly, every 3 months etc. For some people the dry eye and the halos/star-bursts around lights at night go away. Several of my friends had Lasik at the same office with great results (so far).  3 years later - I have piece of mind for never having to worry about losing a contact or breaking/forgetting glasses and being effectively blind as a result. I can see when I wake up and if I'm outside on a bright sunny day I feel like I can see for miles in the treated eye. For me the dry eye is very manageable with only needing drops in the morning occasionally. However, the halos and star-bursts have never lessened or gone away, and this can be very distracting in situations like a movie theater, and more importantly, driving. Additionally, my vision at night has less contrast. I still wear a contact in the other eye which thankfully my brain can use to dominate and mostly ignore the halos/starbursts. But, due to my fear of the halos and starbursts affecting my night driving further, I will NEVER have the procedure done on the other eye. I don't regret treating the single eye, but I have a feeling I would regret doing both.  There is a lens implant alternative that is similar to cataract surgery but is about twice the cost of laser surgery, and like any surgery, carries risk of infection. The pros are that it is relatively easily reversible and doesn't change your eye permanently the way these laser procedures do. I will continue to follow research on this implant technology and consider it for the future. I would NOT recommend anyone having the laser procedure done to both eyes, but would suggest CONSIDERING a single eye treatment.      reply to Jon          D  6 years ago   Subject:      Know the risks! You are not allowed to get ANY of these laser procedures without signing lots of paper work saying that you KNOW and UNDERSTAND the risks of the procedure. That paperwork clearly states how many patients have dry eye, halos, starburst, etc... No risk, no reward.      reply to D          Tosh  6 years ago   Subject:      I had a Lasik when I was 63 in 2001. Having had an extreme near sightedness all my life, this was a way to see the world clearly. It worked fine for several years.(I could not achieve  20/20 but enough to pass driving test without lenses) However because of my age, I did develop cataracts. When a cataract surgery was necessary, I needed a specialist care, though my ophthalmologist has done many of this surgery before.  She had to collect my lasik procedure records from 2001 from my NY doctor and advised me that my cornea shape (slightly flattened) made it complicated, and that I was a high risk patient. After discussing the risks and determining that I would not end up worse than where I was, I went ahead and now at 73, for the first time in my life, I discovered the far-sightedness. My advice would be that if you find a very good doctor, determine how many years you have until you start getting the conditions caused by aging?  I had only seven years or so of benefits. By nephew and niece came to NYC from Japan to have lasik done and they are both 20/20 since 1992. They were in their early 30s. For them, lasik really improved their lives and my nephew loves the freedom of vision when he races his motorcycles. I do not think this type of long term impact was not well known in 2001.      reply to Tosh          Amanda Zeller, O.D.  6 years ago   Subject:      I am an optometrist, and I have seen many many patients who had bad LASIK outcomes. I cannot recommend this procedure to any patient after what I've seen in my exam chair. The rigid contact lenses required to correct corneas butchered by LASIK are complicated to fit, very expensive, and much less comfortable than most people's glasses or soft contact lenses. As a glasses-wearing myope myself, I would NEVER risk ruining my eyes with LASIK.      reply to Amanda Zeller, O.D.          Eric  6 years ago   Subject:      Most of those who are middle aged with presbyopia need to look at getting progressive bifocals. With some practice you can then focus on things at a variety of distances, not just things in the distance. For most of us that's far more important than the perfect distance vision promised (and sometimes delivered) by Lasik. And there are is no (zero) possibility of permanent damage caused by wearing glasses... good 'nuff for me, thank you.      reply to Eric          John Christensson  5 years ago   Subject: Foggy glasses      This is a common misconception.  How many lives have been lost because of foggy glasses?  Nobody knows, but some at least.  Lives lost because of LASIK: None.     reply to John Christensson          John Denning  6 years ago   Subject:      I'm glad to see that issues with this procedure are finally getting the proper coverage they deserves.  More than a decade ago I was an enlisted soldier assigned to the ophthalmology department at Walter Reed.  When bored, which was several hours a day, I would typically read research and journal articles about eye-related topics.

Reuters   Share         World  eyes  Lasik I walked into Dr. Joseph A. Rudick’s Manhattan offices almost entirely unaware of what Lasik eye surgery was, save for the countless rave reviews I heard from friends and family. "It’s totally painless," I remember being told. "You’ll have brand new eyes overnight!" All I knew was that I had one more strip of daily contacts to go through, a broken pair of glasses and another one missing somewhere in New York City. I vowed to myself I wasn’t going to buy another box of contacts—sticking something in my eye was my least favorite part of every single day, and I typically forgot to take them out virtually every night before falling asleep. And each week, I heard of another friend or coworker having lasik, or the PRK laser procedure, another form of corrective eye vision surgery, then glowing about how incredible life is from that point on. Even Rudick spoke to Lasik’s near-stainless reputation as one of the most advanced, life-changing, even utopian of procedures ever since the first surgery was performed in America in 1991. It’s not like anyone was lying, either: one month after having Lasik eye surgery, I can attest to its incredible outcomes and boost to quality-of-life. But I do wish someone, anyone, warned me of what the first 24 hours after having lasers shot in your eyes feels like.

Reuters  After being reviewed and determined a perfect candidate for Lasik, I signed off on some forms noting the potential risks and complications that may occur after having laser eye surgery. The possible side effects read just like one of those commercials for a new prescription drug that ends with a one-minute voiceover narrating symptoms like heart failure, kidney rupturing and death, as a woman jogs with her golden retriever through a beautiful green field. Dry eye syndrome. Debilitating visual symptoms. Loss of vision. Basically, every thing you wouldn’t want to ever happen to your eyes in some unfortunate worst-case scenario is possible when going under the laser.  Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now The FDA warns against "eye centers that advertise, '20/20 vision or your money back' or 'package deals’ on its Lasik information site, noting quite poignantly "there are never any guarantees in medicine." There also are sites like LasikComplications.com , which purports there to be a link between the surgery and blindness, corneal transplants and even suicide after having the operation done. But Rudick’s office was highly rated citywide, and I felt that I was in some of the best hands performing this surgery in the nation. My own father had Lasik eye surgery more than a decade ago, when the laser machines were less advanced (albeit still highly successful). So I signed off and prepared to have surgery in a week. I let the surgeon and his receptionists know I wouldn’t have anyone available to pick me up as it was in the middle of the week and my apartment was at least an hour away, but was reassured they’d order me an Uber on my way home from the procedure. I won’t go into too much detail about the actual surgery, largely because it only lasted a total of three minutes or so. Each eye took about thirty seconds, after both receive a healthy dose of numbing solution before going under. I was given a blanket to wrap myself in as my face and eye were strapped in and held with restraints, and a teddy bear whose name the nurse said was "See-more." After having the surgery, I immediately was able to sit up and see the entire room around me. See-more was colorful and clear laying on my lap. The time on the clock above the wooden door on the other side of the room read 2:47 with crystal clear clarity. The surgeon then doused my eyes in multiple solutions, and I was given goggles and sunglasses to protect my eyes from the lights. “Your vision is going to get pretty blurry over the next few hours,” Rudick told me. "Go home and try to go straight to sleep." My sight was rapidly dissipating as I was escorted into the hallway, exiting the surgeon’s office and being left alone in the general lobby. I hadn’t reminded anyone for an Uber, and felt uncomfortable going back in and relying on someone to help me get back home to Brooklyn. Out of my entire Lasik experience, going alone was my biggest mistake. By the time I was standing in the lobby, I could barely look at the screen on my phone. The words were too bright, and all of the colors were beginning to run together. I managed to order an Uber and pushed my phone into my pocket, waiting for it to buzz. My first Uber finally arrived 10 minutes later, with the driver frantically calling to say he was outside of my address. I walked out of the building, immediately feeling the burst of light stab through my sunglasses and into my wounded eyes. My eyes felt scratchy and dry as I squinted around in search of a black SUV that was supposed to be for me. I spoke with the driver on the phone for a good five minutes before learning he actually was nowhere near my dropped location, and would have to make three different turns around two blocks to get to where I was standing. He then decided to hang up on me and cancel the trip. By this point, my eyes were dry, and my vision was so blurred, I felt completely helpless. Fortunately, a second Uber driver proved to be the ultimate hero, picking me up moments later and taking me to a bodega before going home to buy me snacks that he chose to pay for. I begged him to at least take my cash into the store, but he left the car running and came back with Doritos, Diet Coke and Twizzlers. My eyes were shut throughout the entire drive home, and the driver helped me into my apartment before heading off.    A patient going through free eye surgery at the Phyo charity clinic in Yangon September 4, 2014.  Reuters  That first night after having Lasik surgery was one of the most uncomfortable experiences I’ve ever had in my life. It felt as though my eyelids were glued to my corneas, as bugs crawled between the skin, scratching every inch over and over again. If I opened them, I was met with immediate pain. I couldn’t sleep, or even move much, out of fear I was going to break or smash into something. I did not fully open my eyes until the next morning at about 9 a.m., after slowly taking off the goggles I had been wearing since immediately after the surgery. My eyes were bloodshot and teary as I looked at myself in the mirror, but I noticed the immediate accuracy in my vision the second I saw my face. I could see the red capillaries in my eyes that had burst from the pressure during the procedure, and the lashes on my eyelids. I went back to my surgeon that morning to learn the operation was a success. In fact, it went even better than expected: I was found to have an eyesight of 20/15, better than perfect eye vision. Rudick informed me the redness was perfectly normal and would disappear in a few days. It did. All in all, Lasik is an incredible surgery with the enormous potential to give someone back their eyesight for a lifetime overnight. But it’s no miracle: the operation requires a patient's understanding there is a small risk involved with major implications. Despite what one may be told before the procedure, there certainly is a great deal of discomfort in the proceeding hours and days, though every person’s recovery is different. And unlike other options, Lasik is virtually never covered by insurance, and costs a much prettier penny upfront than glasses or contacts. Still, there’s something incredible about being given the ability to see the world without any help in 24 hours. "It’s like pregnancy," my mother said. "The result is so beautiful, it almost makes you forget about the trauma."

Over the next four months, I received 20 ads from the same company – each offering the same deal for the “safe, FDA approved” surgery. “Individual results will vary,” each ad said in the fine print. None mentioned that those variable results could include seven categories of vision-threatening complications or 17 types of non-vision-threatening side-effects, such as “increased sensitivity to light”, “eye irritation related to drying of the corneal surface”, “pain or a foreign body sensation”, or increased susceptibility “to trauma from impact”. (Bargain offers notwithstanding, average all-in costs also exceed US$2,000 per eye.) All surgeries carry risk, and the risks associated with laser in-situ keratomileusis, or LASIK, are listed on the standard consent form that all patients must sign. For many, the rapid procedure goes off without a hitch and leaves no residual effects. Scrupulous centres also turn away the roughly one-fifth of patients who are not good candidates. But a quarter of a century after the first ‘flap and zap’ vision-correcting surgery, controversy continues to rage over whether regulatory authorities and industry officials have repeatedly downplayed or ignored the prevalence of dry eye disease, chronic pain and other potentially serious side-effects. Has the public, in other words, been told enough to make an informed decision about an elective surgery that can’t be undone? In response to mounting pressure from patient advocates who say they haven’t, the US Food and Drug Administration co-sponsored a quality-of-life study to help quell the debate. The recently released preliminary results of that study, however, appear to be doing exactly the opposite. Advertisement Early procedures How did it get to this point? Excimer lasers, as they’re known, were first used to perform a precursor method called photorefractive keratectomy (or PRK) in the late 1980s. During the procedure, a doctor removes the thin outer layer of corneal tissue and then uses the laser to create a precise vision-correcting divot on the surface. The painful method can mean several weeks of recovery time per eye, but it doesn’t cut through the corneal nerves like LASIK does. Surgeons soon began gravitating toward the faster LASIK method, which cuts a hinged flap in the cornea to alter its light-refracting properties. From 1996 until his retirement in 2000, Morris Waxler was chief of the Diagnostic and Surgical Devices Branch that regulated corneal resurfacing lasers within the FDA’s Division of Ophthalmic Devices. He was at the helm when the FDA branch gave the green light to the first LASIK laser in July 1998. Advertisement The approval, Waxler said, was intended in part to stem major compliance problems and bring some order to the increasingly chaotic industry while reasserting the FDA’s regulatory authority. In the process, he alleged, the agency wasn’t as attentive as it should have been to the surgery’s long-term risks, including chronic eye pain. “We were hard-pressed to know what to do about these problems,” Waxler said. The assumption was that the pain would persist for a few months, maybe, or a year. “So we figured we would handle it in the labelling and that ‘caveat emptor’ – ‘buyer beware’ – would rule the day, and we assumed that refractive surgeons and clinics would be honest and tell their patients ‘You’re going to have pain’, and that’s turned out not to be correct.” Carlos Belmonte, founder of the Institute of Neurosciences in Alicante, Spain, and a pioneer in studying the physiological basis of eye pain, explains that corneal nerves don’t completely regenerate after LASIK surgery. “The main risk is that in a very small percentage of cases, this regeneration is pathological, and then you get this neuropathic pain and that is a disaster,” he said. “But this is a risk that happens in surgery.” Advertisement In 2007, Belmonte published a study that suggested a form of dry eye pain called ‘phantom’ cornea could occur after LASIK-mediated damage to the corneal nerves. At the same time, Boston ophthalmologist Perry Rosenthal was compiling multiple case reports suggesting that a similar post-LASIK phenomenon was appearing regularly in patients with severe eye pain who had been referred to his clinic. Other researchers have documented phantom pain among patients who have had eye amputations or corneal transplants. Waxler retired in 2000 and is now an independent regulatory consultant. He gave little additional thought to LASIK until a patient whose eyes had been damaged by the surgery called him about six years ago and angrily asked why it had been approved. Waxler listened, and began talking to other patients with similar stories. “I said, ‘Well, how could this happen?’” he recalled. Based on his review of medical studies and documents on the FDA’s website, he alleges that many of the problems had been reported all along, but labelled as ‘symptoms’, a category deemed less serious than ‘adverse events’. Waxler made headlines in 2010 and 2011 when he went public to contend that the original studies actually documented an adverse event rate of about 20 per cent. The FDA later responded that symptoms like glare and dry eye are too mild to be considered adverse events. Advertisement Meanwhile, more patient advocates were going public with their own stories and documenting them on Facebook groups and multiple websites. One, lasikcomplications.com , created a page to track LASIK-linked suicides and attempted suicides, based on news accounts and patient reports filed with the FDA. At a public meeting of the FDA Ophthalmic Devices Panel in April 2008, nearly 20 individuals spoke out against the LASIK procedure: optometrists who had treated patients after the surgery, patients recounting their own ordeals, and two speakers testifying about patients who had killed themselves. New Jersey financial administrator Matthew Kotsovolos, now 46, was among those who testified. He describes his own misery after a 2006 LASIK eye surgery as “a pain that I am confident that most people do not recognise as existing in this world”. His surgeon considered the procedure a success because Kotsovolos’s uncorrected vision improved to 20/20. Even so, he suffered from constant, debilitating eye pain. “So I pretty much lived in Hell.” Advertisement Exploring outcomes In October 2009, the FDA, the National Eye Institute and the Department of Defense responded to the lingering controversy by launching the LASIK Quality of Life Collaboration Project “to help better understand the potential risk of severe problems that can result from LASIK”. The collaborative effort tested a web-based questionnaire on 242 naval personnel – most of them male – who received free LASIK at the US Naval Medical Center in San Diego. A subsequent phase then surveyed 292 civilian patients, split roughly between male and female, who had LASIK surgery at five other clinical centres. In October 2014, Malvina Eydelman, director of the FDA’s Division of Ophthalmic and Ear, Nose and Throat Devices, presented the preliminary results from both phases of the study. Advertisement The study agreed with most previous surveys in suggesting a patient satisfaction rate of more than 90 per cent. As Waxler and other critics have repeatedly emphasised, however, satisfaction rates cannot take the place of safety profiles. In that regard, the FDA’s study results were more mixed. Although the prevalence of patients with ghosting (seeing a faint double image) dropped significantly after surgery, for example, more than one-third still had halos and starbursts. In addition, up to 4 per cent had “very or extremely bothersome” visual symptoms, and up to 1 per cent “experienced a lot of difficulty with or were unable to do usual activities due to visual symptoms” three months after LASIK. Among respondents who lacked symptoms before LASIK, roughly 30 per cent reported new dry eye symptoms and 45 per cent reported new visual symptoms three months after the surgery. Advertisement Instead of a randomised epidemiological study of eye pain, visual symptoms and satisfaction among the existing pool of LASIK patients, Waxler alleges that the “best-case” study used highly specific inclusion criteria for patients and LASIK devices, sharply limiting its applicability to the general population. Even so, he asserts that the FDA and refractive surgery industry have spun the study “as support for the safety and effectiveness of LASIK when in fact it confirms LASIK patients’ problems”. In response to a request for comment, a spokesperson for the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery offered a November 2014 press release as the society’s official statement. That release characterised the preliminary FDA-led study results as “overwhelmingly positive”, while ASCRS President Richard Lewis called the high rate of success for LASIK “unprecedented as a surgical procedure” and said the collaborative research effort confirms “the remarkable efficacy of LASIK”. The press release notes that “no surgery is 100 per cent risk free” and quotes Lewis as saying: “Our understanding of those at risk for dry eyes and visual disturbances from LASIK procedures is critical and evolving…Identifying individuals at high risk for complications of LASIK is valuable. However, this must be determined in a well-controlled and timely trial.” Advertisement Separate reports suggest that many post-surgical problems will eventually resolve. Few studies, however, have followed patients beyond six months or a year to find out for sure. Rosenthal’s observations of 21 patients with post-LASIK chronic eye pain, for example, suggest that the pain didn’t even begin until a year or more after the surgery for eight of them. A separate survey by The Cornea Research Foundation found that post-LASIK dry eye symptoms actually worsened at the one-year mark before recovering somewhat at two years. A survey of nearly 800 adults conducted by the Consumer Reports National Research Center and reviews in the American Journal of Ophthalmology , Cornea and Ocular Surface have similarly suggested that chronic dry eye and other symptoms are relatively common six months after LASIK. A new review in the journal Molecular Pain asserts that the percentage of patients reporting “persistent eye symptoms” has ranged from 20 per cent to 55 per cent, and the authors invoke corneal nerve damage as one potential contributor. A recent investigative report from Consumers Digest details a range of other potential flaws in the clinical trials and reporting system used to assess LASIK’s safety. The FDA has not yet released its six-month results from the second group of patients surveyed. Under the heading ‘Public Health Impact’, however, Eydelman’s slide presentation concluded: “Given the large number of patients undergoing LASIK annually, dissatisfaction and disabling symptoms may occur in a significant number of patients.” Advertisement Based on industry estimates that more than 40 million patients have undergone LASIK worldwide, the tally of those with chronic eye symptoms could run well into the millions. Although demand for the surgery has fallen over the past five years, Waxler said the market for eye drops that treat dry-eye-associated discomfort has “exploded”, and some manufacturers are specifically aiming their ads at LASIK patients. “It’s no happenstance,” he said. Waxler filed a petition in 2011 asking his former employer to rescind its approval of LASIK. Three years later, the FDA shot him down, responding that his allegations were unfounded and that data submitted to the agency suggested the surgery’s benefits outweighed the risks. Waxler filed another petition in July 2014 asking the FDA to reconsider. But he’s tired, he said, and has done all he can do: “I have no magical wand to fix this.” Activists haven’t given up, however. In December 2014, three consumer advocates launched a new petition drive to force the FDA to add a ‘black box’ warning label to LASIK lasers, citing the agency’s own study results to argue that the high incidence of visual and dry eye symptoms represents an epidemic caused by an unnecessary surgery. And in May 2015, more than 1,000 LASIK patients and their supporters signed a letter urging the federal agency to reopen Waxler’s petition for consideration. Advertisement Where does the FDA go from here? In response to questions about Eydelman’s scientific presentation and the agency’s next steps, an FDA spokesperson told me the researchers were preparing the manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and couldn’t comment publicly about any findings until its publication.

The truth is, there has never been a case of blindness as a result of LASIK eye surgery complications reported in the United States. The risk of going blind from a LASIK complication is actually comparable to the risk of blindness from wearing contacts.  Myth: The more procedures a LASIK surgeon has performed, the better chance of a positive outcome.  Actually, while the experience of the LASIK surgeon is important, there is a tapering learning curve. Once a LASIK eye surgeon has passed that initial learning curve, typically 200-300 procedures, the quality of the LASIK surgery becomes more impressive and important than simply comparing the surgeon's quantity of eyes done. Personalized, quality care and a track record of positive outcomes is what you should look for in a LASIK surgeon.   Myth: All Laser LASIK ( IntraLase or Bladeless ) is the safest procedure.  Every LASIK procedure involves creating a flap in the surface of the cornea. IntraLase procedures utilize a laser to create that flap instead of the microkeratome blade used in regular LASIK. IntraLase carries its own risks, such as light sensitivity, which although infrequent does not make IntraLase a safer or better procedure. Your LASIK surgeon and yourself will assess your needs and determine the procedure that is right for you during your free consultation. We offer contracted prices on both microkeratome and IntraLase procedures, allowing you choice, quality, and savings.  Myth: Everybody is eligible for LASIK eye surgery.  While many wish to have LASIK performed, a percentage of people are not good candidates for the surgery. In fact, about 30% of potential patients evaluated by an ophthalmologist are routinely rejected as candidates for the procedure. There are various factors that can disqualify a person, so the best way to learn if you are a candidate is to attend a LASIK exam. During this appointment, the surgeon will perform a full comprehensive eye exam to determine if LASIK eye surgery is an option for you. QualSight offers FREE LASIK exams with the best credentialed surgeons, allowing those interested in having LASIK to learn if they are a candidate without having to pay for an evaluation.  Myth: LASIK Eye Surgery is painful.  LASIK is the most popular elective procedure performed today, largely due to the ease of the surgery itself. Eye drops are used to numb the eyes and keep them comfortable during LASIK, which takes only about 15 minutes for both eyes. You will feel some pressure briefly, but laser reshaping of the eye is pain-free. If you feel nervous prior to your procedure, your surgeon may give you a mild sedative to help you relax.
