 Newsletter A Breakdown of Miscarriage Rates by Week Medically reviewed by Nicole Galan, RN on  January 20, 2016 — Written by Rena Goldman Miscarriage is a word used to describe the early loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks of pregnancy. It usually happens in the first trimester.  Unfortunately, between 10 and 25 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage.  You may have heard of couples waiting to announce a pregnancy until the risk of having a miscarriage is lower. The further you are into the pregnancy, the less likely you are to miscarry.  Read on for a breakdown of what causes miscarriages. The risk decreases as the pregnancy progresses.  Causes  Dr. Kaylen Silverberg, Texas-based fertility specialist, says miscarriages are very common.  “Women think that when they have one miscarriage, they are doomed to miscarry again,” he says.  But it turns out that your risk isn’t any greater after a miscarriage. Even after two miscarriages, the risk of miscarrying again doesn’t increase.  He says most medical professionals don’t evaluate a woman until she’s had three miscarriages. But there are fertility experts who will do an examination after two.  Here are the five most common miscarriage causes.  Genetics  When the sperm and egg meet, the cells come together. They then begin to divide to start forming the genetic material that makes up a person.  Each of us is supposed to have 46 total chromosomes. That’s 23 from one parent and 23 from the other. If something goes wrong when the cells are dividing, a chromosome may be missing or repeated.  According to Dr. Silverberg, 90 percent of all first trimester miscarriages are because of chromosomal abnormalities.  Infections  Uterus or cervix infections can be dangerous to a developing baby and lead to miscarriage.  Some of these infections include:  chlamydia gonorrhea mycoplasma ureaplasma  Anatomic Problems  This refers to defects of the uterus cavity. If the woman’s uterus didn’t form correctly when she was developing, it may be unable to support a healthy pregnancy.  Clotting Disorders  Clotting disorders are conditions that cause your body to form more blood clots than normal. Examples include lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid syndrome.  In the case of pregnancy, blood clots can form in the placenta. This prevents nutrition and oxygen from getting to the baby-to-be, and prevents waste from being carried away.  Progesterone Deficiency  In luteal phase deficiency or progesterone deficiency, the body isn’t producing enough progesterone. This is the hormone that plays a big part during pregnancy.  Risk Rates  The first trimester of pregnancy is considered weeks 0 to 13. About 80 percent of miscarriages happen in the first trimester.  Weeks 0 to 7  These weeks mark the highest risk. A woman can have a miscarriage in the first week or two without even realizing she’s pregnant. She might think it’s a late period.  Age plays a role in a woman’s risk factor. Here is the miscarriage risk breakdown by age:  Women age 20 to 30: 9 to 17 percent Women age 35 to 39: 20 percent Women age 40 to 44: 40 percent Women age 45 and older: 80 percent  Weeks 7 to 12  Once a pregnancy makes it to 7 weeks with a heartbeat, the risk of having a miscarriage drops to 10 percent.  Weeks 12 to 20  By week 12, the risk may fall to 5 percent. But keep in mind that it doesn’t really go below that because complications can happen during pregnancy.  Signs and Symptoms  The most common signs of a miscarriage are bleeding and cramping that are felt in the abdomen or lower back.  Some women have spotting (light bleeding) during pregnancy. A few drops or light flow of brown or dark red doesn’t necessarily mean trouble. But call the doctor right away if you see bright red blood, particularly in large amounts. Cramping can also happen in normal pregnancies.  Prevention  The majority of miscarriages are the result of genetic abnormalities or other health factors that are beyond our control. For that reason, there isn’t a whole lot you can do for prevention.  The best thing you can do is to keep yourself as healthy as possible before trying to conceive and throughout your pregnancy. Here are some tips to staying healthy during pregnancy:  eat a well-balanced diet exercise regularly avoid alcohol and cigarette smoking avoid caffeine get regular prenatal visits  If you’re worried, you might want to try genetic testing before trying to conceive. Blood is taken from both partners. It’s sent to a laboratory to be evaluated for major genetic disorders.  The Takeaway  It’s important to remember if you have a miscarriage, it’s not your fault. The experience can be physically and emotionally painful. Talk to trusted friends and family, and ask for help when you need it.  Your doctor may be able to recommend a support group or therapist in your area. There are also many online organizations and support groups like March of Dimes that offer a safe place to share your story and grieve with others.

We also expect the pregnancy will end in a healthy, normal, live birth. Medical professionals do not usually talk/warn about miscarriage to their patients. With the advancement of scanning technology, pregnancies can be confirmed earlier. This means women can see their baby and bonding occurs earlier too. When a miscarriage happens unexpectedly, it can be a shocking end to the dreams and expectations of the woman and her partner.  Quote from Dr. Karen Buckingham, an Auckland obstetrician and gynaecologist: ‘And because human pregnancy is a relatively inefficient process, approximately 50% of all conceptions fail – with most miscarriages going unrecog­nised because they occur before or with a woman’s next expected period.’ (Next Magazine June 2012.)  Spontaneous abortion  The World Health Organisation defines miscarriage as ‘the spontaneous abortion of an embryo or fetus weighing 500 grams or less. This typically corresponds to a fetal gestational age of 20 to 22 weeks or less’. Miscarriage in New Zealand is defined as a pregnancy that ends spontaneously before 20 weeks. The baby not usually being born alive and weighing under 400g.  Just knowing 70% of fertilized eggs die before they are 6 days old can help in understanding miscarriage. As we learn about conception and the critical stages of a baby’s development (e.g. A 3 week old embryo has formed the cells that control the beat of the heart) and how much else can go wrong, we can further appreciate what a little miracle a baby really is.  Miscarriage affects one in every four women. The highest risk period is between 4 and 6 weeks. Once 8 or 9 weeks are reached and the baby’s heart beat is seen on a scan there is only a 4% to 5% chance of miscarriage, depending on the speed of the heart-beat. It should be 120 to 160 times per minute. (BMP) The risk then drops to between 5% and 8% and continues to drop as the pregnancy proceeds.  99% of foetal deaths occur in the first 12 to 14 weeks of pregnancy (1st trimester), although the actual miscarriage may not happen for some weeks after the baby dies. Medically this is called a ‘missed abortion’. (The baby is an “embryo” to the 8th week and a “foetus” after that.)  The chance of losing a first pregnancy is greater than later ones. 70% of miscarriages are unexplained.  What happens during miscarriage?  The symptoms you experience will depend on the cause of the miscarriage and how advanced the pregnancy is/was so may take hours, days or even weeks to complete. Usually the foetus, placenta and blood from the uterus leave the body through the vagina. (see ‘ the miscarriage process ’) You may discover during a routine scan that there is no heartbeat, or even an empty foetal sac. Usually, by the time bleeding begins your baby has already died. The exception is around the 6 weeks mark when only a small amount of blood is lost, then there is an 80% your baby will be fine (see ‘ threatening miscarriage ’).

If you're newly pregnant and trying to make sense of the myriad statistics about miscarriage, here's an explanation of each one that hopefully will ease your mind. Miscarriage and Failed Implantation Rate for All Conceptions This is the statistic that can be the most alarming, so it's key to understand what it includes.         As many as 75 percent of fertilized eggs do not go on to result in a full-term pregnancy. This statistic includes both miscarriages and failed implantations that usually pass without the mother ever missing a period or knowing conception took place. If you already know you're pregnant, this is not a number you need to worry about. Because there's only around a 30 percent chance of getting pregnant each menstrual cycle even when you're having regular sex, researchers speculate that fertilized eggs often fail to implant, usually with the woman unaware that conception occurred. Laboratory studies on IVF patients have found that a very large percentage of eggs harbor chromosome abnormalities (the leading cause of miscarriage). An older, widely-quoted study found that in natural cycles, about 22 percent of all conceptions never complete implantation. Considering such evidence, some scientists have speculated that if you factor in fertilized eggs that don't implant along with pregnancies that end in miscarriage, around 70 percent to 75 percent of conceptions end up miscarrying.   But whether these failed implantations can be defined as a "miscarriage" is a matter of opinion. Most doctors consider pregnancy to begin at implantation rather than at fertilization. At the very least, by the time implantation has occurred and the hCG hormone is detectable in the blood and urine (meaning, by the time you know you're pregnant), it's safe to say this statistic is irrelevant.         Miscarriage Rate After Confirmed Implantation In the same study that found 22 percent of conceptions fail to implant, it was also found that 31 percent of pregnancies confirmed after implantation end in miscarriage. That would mean that about one in three pregnancies miscarries. But before you worry too much about those figures, note that this number came from a study of a population of women who were confirmed to be pregnant at the very earliest point that it's scientifically possible to detect a pregnancy. In real life, most women find out they are pregnant at a later point than the participants in this study, and the risk of miscarriage drops as pregnancy progresses. That would mean that most women have a lower risk of miscarriage by the time they confirm their pregnancies. Still, it's worth pointing out that many experts consider this statistic as an argument against taking ultra-sensitive early pregnancy tests before missing a menstrual period. Use of such pregnancy tests increases the risk of detecting a transient, nonviable pregnancy that will miscarry within a few days and otherwise would have just looked like a regular menstrual period. Knowing about such pregnancies can be a source of stress for many women, and if this is true for you, it's worth waiting to test until your period is actually late.         Miscarriage Rate for Confirmed Pregnancies For the general population of pregnant women, this is usually the most relevant statistic. About 15 percent to 20 percent of all women with a verified pregnancy will end up having a miscarriage. Since the general population includes women who weren't trying to get pregnant and might not have been tracking their menstrual periods, many are already a few weeks along—possibly more than halfway through the first trimester—by the time they confirm their pregnancies. As stated above, the further a pregnancy progresses, the lower the risk of miscarriage, so that's the reason for the disparity between this statistic and the one above.  If you're more than five weeks pregnant but still in the first trimester, this statistic is probably the most relevant one for you. But remember that your own personal risk might be higher or lower depending on several other factors, including your age, lifestyle, and past pregnancy history. Seeing the Heartbeat Means a Lower Chance of Miscarriage Most doctors agree that seeing a fetal heartbeat on ultrasound means the risk of miscarriage is much lower. Confirmation of a fetal heartbeat means that the baby has passed the initial stages of development wherein the majority of first trimester miscarriages occur. It's hard to pick a specific number for the risk of miscarriage at this point. Some cite numbers like a 4 percent to 5 percent risk of miscarriage at this point, but studies show a widely varying risk based on individual factors. The one thing that's safe to say, however, is that seeing the baby's heartbeat is a good sign. It means the baby is growing as it should be, and there's little reason to be concerned at this point. Unfortunately, there is one exception to this rule. A slow fetal heart rate (less than 100 beats per minute) may signal an impending miscarriage, though this isn't true in 100 percent of cases. The Majority of Miscarriages Occur in the First Trimester Over 80 percent of miscarriages occur before 12 weeks, so the chances look good for a healthy baby once you've finished the first trimester. Again, many individual factors are in play, but if 15 percent to 20 percent of pregnancies end in miscarriage and 80 percent of miscarriages occur in the first trimester, a safe estimate would be that in the general population the risk of pregnancy loss after 12 weeks is 3 percent to 4 percent. After 20 weeks, when a loss would be termed a stillbirth rather than a miscarriage, the risk is around one in 160. Miscarriage Rate if You Had a Past Miscarriage Most first-time miscarriages are random and do not recur. With one past miscarriage, the odds of miscarrying in your next pregnancy are about 20 percent. This is not much higher than someone without a history of miscarriage. With two previous miscarriages, the risk of another miscarriage is 28 percent, and with three previous miscarriages, the risk increases to 43 percent. It's possible that testing for recurrent miscarriage causes might help in these cases. What Can Lower Your Miscarriage Risk? There's not a whole lot you can do to affect your odds of miscarriage, but research suggests you may have a lower risk of miscarriage if you avoid alcohol , don't smoke , and avoid known occupational hazards . A Word From Verywell When you are pregnant or hope to become pregnant, you may be anxious to ensure you are doing everything right. It's easy to become overwhelmed by the many statistics floating around. Try to focus on doing what is healthy for your body and for nurturing your pregnancy.

Brand names of combination products  IMPORTANT WARNING:   For female patients: Do not take diclofenac and misoprostol if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant or think you may be pregnant while taking diclofenac and misoprostol, stop taking the medication and call your doctor immediately. Diclofenac and misoprostol may cause miscarriage (pregnancy loss), serious bleeding, or premature birth (baby is born too early) if taken during pregnancy. Women who can become pregnant generally should not take diclofenac and misoprostol. However, you and your doctor may decide that diclofenac and misoprostol combination is needed to treat your condition. In that case you must: agree to use a reliable method of birth control during your treatment and for at least 1 month or one menstrual cycle after your treatment; have a negative blood test for pregnancy no longer than 2 weeks before you start taking diclofenac and misoprostol; begin taking the medication only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period. For all patients: People who take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (other than aspirin) such as diclofenac and misoprostol combination may have a higher risk of having a heart attack or a stroke than people who do not take these medications. These events may happen without warning and may cause death. This risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time. Do not use an NSAID such as diclofenac and misoprostol combination if you have recently had a heart attack, unless directed to do so by your doctor. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had heart disease, a heart attack, or a stroke, if you smoke, and if you have or have ever had high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes. Get emergency medical help right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness in one part or side of the body, or slurred speech. If you will be undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG; a type of heart surgery), you should not take diclofenac and misoprostol right before or right after the surgery. NSAIDs such as diclofenac may cause ulcers, bleeding, or holes in the stomach or intestine. Misoprostol is taken in combination with diclofenac to protect the stomach and intestine, but may not prevent all damage to these parts of the body. Problems with the stomach and intestine may develop at any time during treatment, may happen without warning symptoms, and may cause death. The risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time, are older in age, have poor health, smoke, or drink large amounts of alcohol while taking diclofenac and misoprostol. Tell your doctor if you take any of the following medications: anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven); aspirin; other NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); oral steroids such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Rayos); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram (Celexa), fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem, Selfemra, in Symbyax), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Brisdelle, Paxil, Pexeva), and sertraline (Zoloft); or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as desvenlafaxine (Khedezla, Pristiq), duloxetine (Cymbalta), and venlafaxine (Effexor XR). Tell your doctor if you have any bleeding in your stomach or intestines or if you have any of these symptoms: vomiting a substance that is bloody or looks like coffee grounds, blood in the stool, or black and tarry stools. before you begin your treatment with diclofenac and misoprostol. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take diclofenac and misoprostol. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had ulcers or a bleeding disorder. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking diclofenac and misoprostol and call your doctor: stomach pain, heartburn, vomiting a substance that is bloody or looks like coffee grounds, blood in the stool, or black and tarry stools. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will monitor your symptoms carefully and will probably order certain tests to check your body's response to diclofenac and misoprostol. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling so that your doctor can prescribe the right amount of medication to treat your condition with the lowest risk of serious side effects. Do not give this medication to anyone else, especially a woman who is or could become pregnant. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet for diclofenac and misoprostol and the general Medication Guide for NSAIDs when you begin your treatment and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the patient information sheet and Medication Guide. Why is this medication prescribed?   The combination of diclofenac and misoprostol is used to relieve the pain, tenderness, swelling, and stiffness caused by osteoarthritis (arthritis caused by a breakdown of the lining of the joints) and rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis caused by swelling of the lining of the joints) in patients who have a high risk of developing stomach ulcers. Diclofenac is in a class of medications called NSAIDs. It works by stopping the body's production of a substance that causes pain and inflammation. Misoprostol is in a class of medications called prostaglandins. It prevents ulcers caused by diclofenac by protecting the stomach lining and decreasing stomach acid production. How should this medicine be used?   The combination of diclofenac and misoprostol comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food two to four times a day. To help you remember to take diclofenac and misoprostol, take it at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take diclofenac and misoprostol combination exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Do not take tablets that are broken or damaged. Other uses for this medicine   This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. What special precautions should I follow?   Before taking diclofenac and misoprostol, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to diclofenac (Cambia, Flector, Pennsaid, Solaraze, Voltaren XR, Zipsor, Zorvolex), misoprostol (Cytotec), aspirin or other NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); prostaglandins such as alprostadil (Caverject, Edex, Muse), carboprost (Hemabate), dinoprostone (Cervidil, Prepidil, Prostin E2) and mifepristone (Korlym, Mifeprex); any other medications, or any of the inactive ingredients in diclofenac and misoprostol tablets.

Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. Other medications may interact with diclofenac and misoprostol, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list. talk to your doctor if you need to take an antacid during your treatment with diclofenac and misoprostol. You should not take antacids that contain magnesium (Mylanta, others). Your doctor may tell you that you can take an antacid that contains aluminum or calcium. tell your doctor if you have or have ever had any of the conditions mentioned in the IMPORTANT WARNING section or inflammatory bowel disease (swelling of the lining of the intestine that may cause painful or bloody diarrhea and cramping); asthma, especially if you also have frequent stuffed or runny nose or nasal polyps (swelling of the lining of the nose); lupus (a condition in which the body attacks many of its own tissues and organs, often including the skin, joints, blood, and kidneys); hepatic porphyria (an abnormal increase in the amount of certain natural substances made by the liver); heart failure; liver or kidney disease; or swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs. tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking diclofenac and misoprostol. What special dietary instructions should I follow?   Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet. What should I do if I forget a dose?   Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. What side effects can this medication cause?   Diclofenac and misoprostol may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: diarrhea gas or bloating constipation Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms or those mentioned in the IMPORTANT WARNING section, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical help. Do not take any more diclofenac and misoprostol until you speak to your doctor. unexplained weight gain shortness of breath or difficulty breathing swelling in the abdomen, ankles, feet, or legs excessive tiredness lack of energy itching upset stomach loss of appetite pain in the upper right part of the stomach yellowing of the skin or eyes flu-like symptoms pale skin fast heartbeat headache stiff neck sore throat muscle pain confusion sensitivity to light fever blisters rash hives swelling of the eyes, face, lips, tongue, throat, arms, or hands difficulty swallowing hoarseness unusual vaginal bleeding cloudy, discolored, or bloody urine back pain difficult or painful urination Diclofenac and misoprostol may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication. If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online ( http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch ) or by phone (1-800-332-1088). What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?   Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. http://www.upandaway.org In case of emergency/overdose   In case of overdose, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222. Information is also available online at https://www.poisonhelp.org/help . If the victim has collapsed, had a seizure, has trouble breathing, or can't be awakened, immediately call emergency services at 911. Symptoms of overdose may include: stomach pain vomiting diarrhea confusion drowsiness low muscle tone uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body seizures shortness of breath fever fast, pounding, or slow heartbeat dizziness fainting What other information should I know?   Before having any laboratory test, tell your doctor and the laboratory personnel that you are taking diclofenac and misoprostol. Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.

Let us reassure you .         About the Daily Miscarriage Probability Chart  Knowing doesn't have to be scary. The Daily Miscarriage Probability Chart calculates the probability of miscarriage or, conversely, the probability of birth, given how far a woman is in her pregnancy. The underlying model can also account for added risk factors like maternal age, weight, the number of previous miscarriages and the number of previous live births.  The miscarriage probability table displays the probability of a miscarriage occurring on or after a given point in pregnancy. You can therefore find the day-specific odds, or the odds between two points in time, by subtracting the probability associated with date from another. For example, if the model gives the probability of a miscarriage occurring on or after 4 weeks, 0 days is as 25.2%, and the probability of a miscarriage occurring on or after 4 weeks, 1 day as 24.4%, then the probability of a miscarriage occurring at exactly 4 weeks, 0 days is 25.2-24.4 or 0.8%. Probabilities in the table are rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent, so very small probability differences between two dates may not be noticeable in the table.

Click here to get a parameterized URL.  Determining how far along you are Weeks refers to gestational weeks.  If you've had a 1st trimester ultrasound (sometimes referred to as a dating ultrasound) 
  your doctor may have given you a due date and gestational age that differs from those calculated from last menstrual period (LMP).  
  Some women also 
  track ovulation, which may give them yet another possible gestational age.  Gestational age estimated from the dating ultrasound will 
  be the most accurate, followed by gestational age based on ovulation and finally gestational age based on LMP. Still not sure how far along
  you are?  Try the Pregnancy Week By Week Calendar which will give you gestational age based on LMP,
  ovulation or due date.  About the model  Miscarriage is generally recognized as pregnancy loss before 20 weeks gestation.
  That is the definition we are using as well.  This page calculates the cumulative
  probability of pregnancy loss from a given point in pregnancy through 20 weeks gestation.  Beyond 20 weeks gestation pregnancy 
  most often ends in a live birth, and rarely in stillbirth .  
  Thus, we refer to the probability of not miscarrying as the
  probability of birth. Why not include stillbirth data?  Miscarriage and stillbirth are two different types of loss
    with different sets of causes and risk factors.  Most importantly (for modelling purposes)
    the per-week risk of stillbirth actually increases later in pregnancy,
    around the time of birth . 
    In order to model cumulative risk of all types of pregnancy loss, including stillbirth, effectively, we'd need to estimate
    pregnancy length, which we can do but would introduce additional uncertainty and
    decrease accuracy.   The underlying model for this site is derived using meta analysis of the following peer reviewed papers on miscarriage. 
  The model can be be used without additional input, or can be adjusted with any combination
  of maternal age, height/weight (BMI), number of previous miscarriages and
  number of previous births inputs.   Each variable is modeled separately, assumed to be independent
  and assumed to affect the probability of miscarriage uniformly over time.  These assumptions 
  are likely overly strong, as there are likely confounding variables, but is the most reasonable 
  approximation in the absence of additional data.   [1] Tong, S., Kaur, A., Walker, S. P., Bryant, V., Onwude, J. L., and Permezel, M. (2008),

Unfortunately, miscarriages are incredibly common, especially early in pregnancy. Approximately one in every three to five pregnancies ends in miscarriage. Your exact risk of having a miscarriage varies based on your genetics, environment, and other factors.         When reading about miscarriage statistics, it is important to remember that these figures are just numbers. Even if you have a higher than average risk of miscarriage, it does not mean that you will miscarry. In most cases, your odds of having a normal pregnancy are higher than your odds of having a miscarriage. Determining Your Risk If you are not yet pregnant and are concerned about miscarrying, you may be able to lower your risk by addressing some preventable ​ risk factors . Some risk factors are changeable. For example, if you smoke or drink alcohol, quitting either of these practices will reduce your risk of miscarriage. Preventable risk factors include: Smoking: Both smoking and being exposed to secondhand smoke can increase your chances of having a miscarriage. Drinking: Drinking alcohol while pregnant increases the likelihood your child will be born with fetal alcohol syndrome. Regular alcohol consumption can also increase your likelihood of miscarriage.   Your weight: Being underweight or overweight can also increase your odds of miscarrying. Obese women have the greatest risk of miscarriage as compared to overweight and underweight women. Treatable infections: Infections that go untreated are one of the most preventable causes of miscarriage, and are thought to cause approximately 15 percent of miscarriages. Infections associated with miscarriage include malaria, brucellosis, cytomegalovirus, HIV, dengue fever, influenza virus, and bacterial vaginosis         Other risk factors are harder to avoid, such as: Your age: The older you are, the greater your likelihood of miscarrying. For women in their early 40's, the risk of miscarriage is approximately 50 percent. Your partner's age: The age of your child's father may also affect your odds of miscarrying. Reproductive health conditions: Certain reproductive health conditions, like endometriosis and adenomyosis, can increase your odds of miscarrying. Mullerian anomalies, conditions that affect the size and shape of your uterus, can also make it difficult to successfully carry a pregnancy. Genetics: Certain genetic conditions that affect egg and sperm quality can also increase your odds of experiencing a miscarriage. If you have had multiple miscarriages, see a reproductive endocrinologist and ask about genetic testing, which can diagnose any issues your eggs or your partner's sperm may have. History of miscarriages: Approximately 2 percent of women will have two miscarriages in a row, and 1 percent of women, three or more. If you do not have any risk factors, your risk will be in the average range. In most cases, your risk of miscarriage decreases as your pregnancy progresses . After seeing a heartbeat on an ultrasound, your risk of miscarriage will drop, although the miscarriage rates will remain higher for women with specific risk factors.

The Truth About Your Top 10 Pregnancy Worries Pregnancy Anxiety? The Truth About Your Top 10 Pregnancy Worries  Get the bottom line on the fears you'll face while pregnant, and expert tips on how to cope. By Laurie Tarkan  Facebook  Pinterest  Text  Email     Many pregnant women fret too much about the wrong things, and pay too little attention to issues that can genuinely harm their pregnancy and baby. See how your concerns compare to other women's, then learn whether or not your fears are well-founded and—the bottom line—what you can do to have a healthy and happy pregnancy . First comes the excitement, followed immediately by the worry. Once you've adjusted to the fact that you're pregnant, you may find yourself stressing about whether your baby will be born healthy . . . or you might have a miscarriage . . . or you won't be able to stand the pain of labor . . . or be able to breastfeed. The list goes on and on. If you tend toward worrying in the first place, there's plenty of fodder in the news to keep you on high alert ( killer cat litter , toxic sushi, collapsing cribs), and even the more laid-back among you may have moments of anxiety when the nurse is searching for the baby's heartbeat on the ultrasound, it's time for prenatal tests or seemingly strange symptoms arise. Add the surge in pregnancy hormones, and you've got a surefire recipe for angst. But pregnancy risks are generally low, especially for healthy women, and don't warrant a high level of concern on the part of most moms-to-be. To counter excess anxiety, experts advise trying to change the negative chatter in your head and tone down any extreme thoughts. "To do that you need to focus on the evidence that contradicts your worrisome thoughts," says Sari Shepphird, Ph.D., a psychologist in Los Angeles. That's why we asked experts to provide a reality check on 10 of the things pregnant women worry about most, based on a recent March of Dimes survey (the number beside each worry is the percentage of respondents who reported having that concern). "If you keep reminding yourself of the facts, it will reduce speculation, which in turn reduces worry and stress," says Shepphird. Also, she says, instead of worrying about things you can't control (that martini you had before you knew you were pregnant), focus on what you do have control over (how much weight you gain during pregnancy). Here's the bottom line on some of the fears you're likely to face during pregnancy, along with issues you might want to pay more attention to. Plus, we tell you what really counts—the simple things you can do to move past worry and improve your chances of having a healthy pregnancy and baby. 1. Birth defects (78%) REALITY CHECK About 97 of every 100 babies born in the U.S. arrive without a major birth defect, such as spina bifida or Down syndrome. That's the optimist's way of viewing the 3 percent risk of delivering a baby who does have one. Plus, many birth defects, such as club foot, webbed toes and even some heart defects, are minor or very treatable. "Surgical treatments are available nowadays, and many of them are very successful," says Richard Olney, M.D., a clinical geneticist at the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities in Atlanta. If you're not in a higher-risk group, the chances that you'll have a baby with a birth defect may be even lower: Risk factors include diabetes, epilepsy, smoking, drinking alcohol and obesity, although for 70 percent of all birth defects, the cause is unknown. WHAT YOU CAN DO Act as if you're pregnant as soon as you decide you want a child (or even before—half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned). "Most structural birth defects occur as early as a week or two after you miss your period," explains Michael Lu, M.D., associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. Waiting until you know you're pregnant may be too late to prevent these defects. Take at least 400 micrograms of folic acid daily to reduce the risk for neural-tube defects, such as spina bifida; eat a healthy, balanced diet; avoid fish that contain mercury; stop drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes or using recreational or over-the-counter drugs; don't eat undercooked meat or change the cat's litter box (both are possible sources of toxo- plasmosis, an infection that can cause birth defects); lose weight , if needed; and make sure your blood sugar levels are normal. 2. Miscarriage (75%) REALITY CHECK The risk of miscarriage is probably lower than you think. For women younger than 35, it's 10 to 12 percent; for 35- to 39-year-olds, it's 18 percent. (It does rise to 34 percent for women 40 to 44 years old.) But a great many pregnancies are lost so early that a woman never even realizes that she conceived. What's even more reassuring is that by the time you see a heartbeat on an ultrasound (usually by week six or seven), the chance of having a miscarriage drops to less than 5 percent, says Lu. WHAT YOU CAN DO Remind yourself that most miscarriages occur because of chromosomal abnormalities that cannot be prevented; research does not show that exercise, sex or even heavy lifting can cause a miscarriage. One lifestyle caveat: Recent studies have shown that drinking two or more cups of coffee a day may increase your risk, as may contracting certain infections, including sexually transmitted diseases and gum disease. 3. Too much stress (74%) REALITY CHECK Everyday stressors like having to work late, getting stuck in traffic or arguing with your husband are not likely to pose a risk to your pregnancy or your child. But ongoing major stress accompanied by depression (the two often go hand-in-hand) may increase your risk of preterm delivery or having a low-birth-weight baby or a child with long-term behavioral issues. "If you are impaired in some way by the stress—you aren't able to get along with your co-workers or partner, say—that's when it may have an impact," says Tom O'Connor, Ph.D., a professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. "If your stress doesn't reach that level, it may not be significant in terms of pregnancy complications," he says. WHAT YOU CAN DO For ongoing stress or depression, see a cognitive behavioral specialist who can teach you coping strategies, such as questioning the anxiety-causing chatter in your head. She can also teach you relaxation exercises and visualization to lower your stress hormone levels. You can even use the breathing exercises taught in childbirth classes. While practicing deep breathing , imagine what concerns you as you're inhaling; then, while exhaling, picture yourself releasing the thought or concern that is on your mind. You can also use a phrase like "let it go" when you breathe out, says Shepphird. 4. Prematurity (71%) REALITY CHECK Prematurity is a legitimate concern. However, worrisome as pre-term birth is, the great majority of babies in the U.S. are born after 37 weeks, which is considered full term (this may be changing; see " Rethinking 'Full Term' "). An estimated 12 percent are born preterm, which increases their risk of health problems, but keep in mind that 70 percent of them are born between weeks 34 and 37. These so-called "late-term" babies still have increased risks, but they are less vulnerable than the tiniest ones. The biggest risk factors for preterm birth are having had a previous premature delivery, being pregnant with multiples, and having certain uterine or cervical abnormalities. Still, about half of women who deliver prematurely don't fall into any high-risk category. WHAT YOU CAN DO Obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes are risk factors for prematurity, so try to maintain a healthy weight and make sure your blood sugar and blood pressure levels are normal. Avoid smoking, alcohol and recreational drugs (all are linked to prematurity), get good prenatal care and make sure you have all your necessary immunizations and have any infections (even minor ones) treated promptly, as infections are a leading cause of preterm birth. Ongoing major stress can also trigger preterm labor, so be sure to treat any severe anxiety or depression. Many mood-altering medications are considered safe during pregnancy; ask your doctor which ones might be best for you. 5. Labor pain (70%) REALITY CHECK We're not going to tell you labor doesn't hurt—most women rate it as a 7 or 8 out of 10 on the pain scale—but you have options when it comes to easing both your pain and your fear of it. If you want to avoid medication, there's much you can do to reduce the pain and the anxiety surrounding it, such as laboring in a tub of water, changing positions often during labor and practicing relaxation techniques like guided imagery. 10 Ways to Relieve Labor Pain >> Or, you may want to opt for pain meds. If you're worried about the risks, rest assured that today's epidurals are safe and mom-friendly. Though you may have heard that pain medications prolong labor, they don't prolong the first—and longest—stage of labor, and may even shorten it, says Cynthia A. Wong, M.D., a professor of anesthesiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Epidurals do tend to lengthen the shorter "pushing" phase because they dull the otherwise intense urge to push, but there's no convincing evidence that they increase the risk of Cesarean section or low Apgar scores for your newborn. WHAT YOU CAN DO First, educate yourself about all your pain-relief options and their risks and benefits. If you are trying to avoid using medication, research suggests that a birthing coach or doula can help you "go natural" by reminding you to breathe, talking you through the stages of labor and reassuring you that nothing is wrong as the pain intensifies. Also learn what to expect, because the unknown can cause more anxiety. "If you know exactly what is causing the pain, it can reduce your anxiety," says Erika Bleiberg, a doula in Glen Ridge, N.J. Anxiety can cause tension, which can make breathing more dif-ficult and the pain worse, she adds. Sign up early for a childbirth course, such as Lamaze , the Bradley Method or HypnoBirthing; classes fill up fast. Also have a birth plan , but don't make absolute decisions beforehand. "Women get disappointed and feel guilty when they have a plan and things change," Wong says. If you're on the fence and not sure how you'll handle the pain, don't try to be a hero and wait until you can't stand it anymore. It takes at least 20 to 30 minutes between the time you say, "Give me the drugs!" until they've been administered and you feel relief. 6. Eating sushi (61%) REALITY CHECK Most experts recommend avoiding raw fish while pregnant because of the risk of being exposed to bacteria and parasites (these infections are often difficult to treat during pregnancy because some medications can be unsafe). But your actual risk may be quite low. "If sushi chefs are well trained and freeze fish adequately before serving it raw, the risk should be extremely low," says Jeffrey Jones, M.D., of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The other concern, though, is the mercury in some fish: Tuna can be high in this toxin. WHAT YOU CAN DO Rest assured that if you desperately need to quell a sushi craving or you had some sushi before you knew you were pregnant, chances are you're fine. To keep mercury consumption down but still benefit from the healthy omega-3 fatty acids in certain seafood, do not eat more than 6 ounces of fresh tuna a week, but do eat up on things to 12 ounces of canned light tuna or other low-mercury seafood, such as shrimp, wild salmon, catfish, sardines and anchovies. 7. Breastfeeding (60%) REALITY CHECK You may have heard reality TV star Bethenny Frankel (or even one of your friends or family members) say that breastfeeding was "the hardest thing in the world." The truth is, 90 percent or more of women can successfully breastfeed, given patience, realistic expectations and support. Most women think they will click with the baby right away and breastfeed effortlessly. If they don't, many new moms worry that they have an unsolvable problem. "It takes two to three weeks before the mother and baby really know each other and the milk production matches the baby's needs," says Laura Viehmann, M.D., a pediatrician in Pawtucket, R.I. WHAT YOU CAN DO Before you give birth, imagine yourself happily nursing your baby, and have a lactation counselor or doula lined up to provide expert advice if you need it. Also consider visiting a breastfeeding support group before your baby is born. "Women who have seen other women breastfeed are much more able to do so successfully," Viehmann says. Nipple pain is one of the most common reasons women give up on nursing, but this can be avoided with a good latch-on technique ( watch our step-by-step video here ). If you experience even a little pain when nursing, seek help immediately. Another concern new moms have is that the baby is not getting enough milk, but your expectations may be too high. Newborns only drink about 1 1âˆ•2 ounces of milk in the first 24 hours, and only a few ounces a day in the next few days, because you'll produce colostrum— the calorie-dense, nutrient-rich "pre-milk"— before your milk comes in on day four or so. Finally, try to surround yourself with people who will be positive and supportive of your efforts to breastfeed. "It's a lot harder if you have people around you suggesting that you give the baby a bottle," Viehmann says. 8. Losing the pregnancy weight (59%) REALITY CHECK This is a valid concern, especially for the 41 percent of women who gain too much weight during pregnancy and for those who were very overweight before they got pregnant. WHAT YOU CAN DO Stick to the Institutes of Medicine guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy and you'll have an easier time taking it off later. If you're normal weight (your body mass index, or BMI, is 18.5 to 24.9), gain 25 to 35 pounds; if you're underweight (BMI less than 18.5), gain 28 to 40 pounds; if you're overweight (BMI 25 to 29.9), gain 15 to 25 pounds; and if you're obese (BMI 30 or higher) gain 11 to 20 pounds, though some experts believe obese women should stay at the low end of that range. Try to stay active during your pregnancy and start exercising after giving birth as soon as you get the green light from your OB. Studies show that diet and exercise together to 12 ounces of canned light tuna or other low-mercury seafood, such as shrimp, wild salmon, catfish, sardines and anchovies. can help you lose weight postpartum faster than either tactic alone. And breastfeed: Recent research found that if you stay within the prenatal weight-gain guidelines and feed your baby nothing but breast milk for the first six months, you'll likely lose all your pregnancy weight during that time. 9. Heavy lifting (57%) REALITY CHECK There's some evidence that being on your feet all day or having a job that requires heavy lifting may raise your risk of preterm labor, but the research is inconsistent. WHAT YOU CAN DO If you're at increased risk for preterm labor, you will be advised to avoid heavy lifting and prolonged standing. Worried about either? Talk to your boss about switching to a job that allows you to sit more or take more frequent seated breaks. 10. Getting to the hospital on time (55%) REALITY CHECK Though it always makes the news when a woman delivers in a taxi or on the bathroom floor, in real life, it's rare. In a study from England, 137 out of 31,140 babies were born before they arrived at a hospital over a five-year period—that's less than a 1 percent chance. If it's your first baby, you should have plenty of time: From the time your cervix is dilated 4 centimeters (when experts say you should head to the hospital) you still face an average of six hours for the first stage of labor (when your cervix dilates to 10 centimeters) plus another two hours of serious pushing, says Siobhan Dolan, M.D., M.P.H., an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology and women's health at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, N.Y. If it's your second baby, the first stage of labor usually lasts two to 10 hours. WHAT YOU CAN DO Most women don't need to worry about this if they follow the guidelines above. If you had a very quick labor previously or you live far from a hospital, you should check in with your doctor or midwife sooner rather than later, Dolan says. 5 things you SHOULD worry about  In the March of Dimes survey, fewer than half of the pregnant women said they were concerned about the following issues, all of which, experts say, pose serious potential risks. 1. GETTING AN INFECTION Infections can be more serious during pregnancy and lead to complications such as preterm birth. In 2009, 5 percent of pregnant women who reported having the H1N1 virus (the "swine flu") died, and 22 percent were admitted into the intensive care unit. Even a common urinary tract infection can lead to a dangerous kidney infection and preterm birth when you're pregnant, so see your doctor immediately if you have symptoms of infection, such as fever, inflammation or pain. "Things that you might sit on when you're not pregnant should be addressed more quickly when you are," says OB-GYN Siobhan Dolan, M.D., M.P.H. 2. GAINING TOO MUCH WEIGHT A three-state survey found that 41 percent of pregnant women are gaining more than the recommended amount of weight , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Doing so can put you at risk of pregnancy complications, prematurity, birth defects, retaining the weight postpartum and having an overweight child. Try to eat twice as healthy when you're pregnant, not twice as much. 3. NOT EXERCISING ENOUGH Only 23 percent of pregnant women get the recommended 30 minutes or more of moderate exercise a day, according to a recent study. Lack of exercise can contribute to excessive weight gain, loss of strength and stamina just when you're going to need them most, and pregnancy complica- tions. If you're not exercising yet, start with leisurely short walks , then gradually increase your speed and walking time. 4. USING HOME CLEANING PRODUCTS Try to avoid using bleach and other strong chemicals or use them only in well-ventilated areas, says Ted Schettler, M.D., science director of the Science and Environmental Health Network and co-author of In Harm's Way: Toxic Threats to Child Development . The same is true for home improvement projects like painting or refinishing. Find nontoxic alternatives whenever possible, and forgo air fresheners, pesticides and lawn chemicals entirely.

DEVELOPING GESTATIONAL DIABETES About 6 to 8 percent of pregnant women develop gestational diabetes , which can raise the risk of serious pregnancy complications, and the numbers are growing. Plus, new research is showing that even expectant moms with borderline gestational diabetes—elevated blood sugar levels that are below the current cutoff point—have an increased risk of complications like preeclampsia, preterm delivery, having a too-large baby and needing a C-section. Exercise regularly, watch your sugar intake and cut back if you've been diagnosed or told your blood sugar is elevated.            Your Account Newsletter Sweepstakes Log in Join now!

It usually happens in the first trimester.  Unfortunately, between 10 and 25 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage.  You may have heard of couples waiting to announce a pregnancy until the risk of having a miscarriage is lower. The further you are into the pregnancy, the less likely you are to miscarry.  Read on for a breakdown of what causes miscarriages. The risk decreases as the pregnancy progresses.  Causes  Dr. Kaylen Silverberg, Texas-based fertility specialist, says miscarriages are very common.  “Women think that when they have one miscarriage, they are doomed to miscarry again,” he says.  But it turns out that your risk isn’t any greater after a miscarriage. Even after two miscarriages, the risk of miscarrying again doesn’t increase.  He says most medical professionals don’t evaluate a woman until she’s had three miscarriages. But there are fertility experts who will do an examination after two.  Here are the five most common miscarriage causes.  Genetics  When the sperm and egg meet, the cells come together. They then begin to divide to start forming the genetic material that makes up a person.  Each of us is supposed to have 46 total chromosomes. That’s 23 from one parent and 23 from the other. If something goes wrong when the cells are dividing, a chromosome may be missing or repeated.  According to Dr. Silverberg, 90 percent of all first trimester miscarriages are because of chromosomal abnormalities.  Infections  Uterus or cervix infections can be dangerous to a developing baby and lead to miscarriage.  Some of these infections include:  chlamydia gonorrhea mycoplasma ureaplasma  Anatomic Problems  This refers to defects of the uterus cavity. If the woman’s uterus didn’t form correctly when she was developing, it may be unable to support a healthy pregnancy.  Clotting Disorders  Clotting disorders are conditions that cause your body to form more blood clots than normal. Examples include lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid syndrome.  In the case of pregnancy, blood clots can form in the placenta. This prevents nutrition and oxygen from getting to the baby-to-be, and prevents waste from being carried away.  Progesterone Deficiency  In luteal phase deficiency or progesterone deficiency, the body isn’t producing enough progesterone. This is the hormone that plays a big part during pregnancy.  Risk Rates  The first trimester of pregnancy is considered weeks 0 to 13. About 80 percent of miscarriages happen in the first trimester.  Weeks 0 to 7  These weeks mark the highest risk. A woman can have a miscarriage in the first week or two without even realizing she’s pregnant. She might think it’s a late period.  Age plays a role in a woman’s risk factor. Here is the miscarriage risk breakdown by age:  Women age 20 to 30: 9 to 17 percent Women age 35 to 39: 20 percent Women age 40 to 44: 40 percent Women age 45 and older: 80 percent  Weeks 7 to 12  Once a pregnancy makes it to 7 weeks with a heartbeat, the risk of having a miscarriage drops to 10 percent.  Weeks 12 to 20  By week 12, the risk may fall to 5 percent. But keep in mind that it doesn’t really go below that because complications can happen during pregnancy.  Signs and Symptoms  The most common signs of a miscarriage are bleeding and cramping that are felt in the abdomen or lower back.  Some women have spotting (light bleeding) during pregnancy. A few drops or light flow of brown or dark red doesn’t necessarily mean trouble. But call the doctor right away if you see bright red blood, particularly in large amounts. Cramping can also happen in normal pregnancies.  Prevention  The majority of miscarriages are the result of genetic abnormalities or other health factors that are beyond our control. For that reason, there isn’t a whole lot you can do for prevention.  The best thing you can do is to keep yourself as healthy as possible before trying to conceive and throughout your pregnancy. Here are some tips to staying healthy during pregnancy:  eat a well-balanced diet exercise regularly avoid alcohol and cigarette smoking avoid caffeine get regular prenatal visits  If you’re worried, you might want to try genetic testing before trying to conceive. Blood is taken from both partners. It’s sent to a laboratory to be evaluated for major genetic disorders.  The Takeaway  It’s important to remember if you have a miscarriage, it’s not your fault. The experience can be physically and emotionally painful. Talk to trusted friends and family, and ask for help when you need it.  Your doctor may be able to recommend a support group or therapist in your area. There are also many online organizations and support groups like March of Dimes that offer a safe place to share your story and grieve with others.

Miscarriage Statistics by Week And What Affects Your Risk of Miscarriage  Getting Pregnant , Pregnancy Facts , Resources Pin 695 Share 159 Tweet 1 Email After 6 months of trying, we finally conceived, only to miscarriage in the fifth week of pregnancy. This was followed by a long and emotionally exhausting period of keeping track of ovulation , timing the lovemaking, BBT charting and hoping. It took another 9 months before we finally conceived again. I know that this is nothing compared to what many other couples go through, but it was still very tough. When I finally got pregnant again, I became very worried that I would have another miscarriage . I don’t know how many hours I spent on the Internet looking for miscarriage statistics by week of pregnancy . When I experienced bleeding in week 8 of my pregnancy , I panicked. I called my midwife (I had my first prenatal visit scheduled a couple of weeks later) and she asked me to come in for an early ultrasound. I did and I got to see what was going to be my daughter some months later. I saw her little heart beating and I saw the little embryo moving around. It was a fantastic feeling. This little peek inside my womb helped me stop worrying somewhat, but I did continue counting the days until week 12 had passed. I also read and learned quite a bit about miscarriage. If you are feeling anxious like I did, I’d like to help you save a few hours. I have gathered and compiled the most recent miscarriage statistics that I’ve been able to find. At the bottom of the page, you’ll find references to research as well, in case you want to dig deeper. If you are very worried about having a miscarriage, or if you already have had one, you can at least take some comfort in that the newest research shows that there is no need to wait 6 months before trying again. You can start trying again almost immediately. You can read about this in this article about getting pregnant after miscarriage . At the bottom of that article, several moms and dads who have been through a miscarriage share their thoughts and feelings about it. Now to the statistics! Miscarriage Risk By Week And What The Figures Tell You The Stats From Week 3 And On Gestational week (completed) All healthy women Healthy women, one live embryo seen on ultrasound % risk of miscarriage % risk of miscarriage 3-4 weeks 22-75% n/a 5-8 weeks 10% n/a 6 weeks n/a 9.4% 7 weeks n/a 4.2% 8 weeks n/a 1.5% 9 weeks n/a 0.5% 10 weeks n/a 0.7% 8-14 weeks 5% n/a 2nd trimester 3% n/a 3rd trimester 1% n/a References: Tong S, Kaur A, Walker SP, Bryant V, Onwude JL, Permezel M. Miscarriage risk for asymptomatic women after a normal first-trimester prenatal visit. Obstet Gynecol. 2008 Mar;111(3):710-4. Wilcox AJ, Weinberg CR, O’Connor JF, et al. Incidence of early loss of pregnancy. N Engl J Med. Jul 28 1988;319(4):189-94. http://pregnancyloss.info/statistics/ The Early High Percentage of Miscarriage and What It Means According to these figures, the risk of miscarriage right after conception is very high, between 22% and 75%. This wide range reflects that different studies have found different rates of miscarriage. It also reflects – and this is important – that the studies claiming up to a 75% risk of miscarriage include failed implantation . That is, your egg might very well have been fertilized, but one reason or the other, it never implanted properly. Views certainly vary if this should even be called a miscarriage. These very early miscarriages are same times referred to as chemical pregnancies , as in producing the pregnancy hormones, but not being viable pregnancies that could ever go full-term. I guess my first pregnancy (and miscarriage) was a textbook example of a chemical pregnancy. Most women probably won’t even know that they were pregnant, but I knew since we actively tried to conceive and I was tracking my basal body temperature very closely. If I were you, I would not fret too much over the terrible statistics for the first few weeks. The data is highly uncertain and if you do miscarriage, chances are you won’t even know that you were (chemically) pregnant and it is likely that the miscarriage was due to chromosomal abnormalities that make your body stop the pregnancy. Miscarraige Statistics After Pregnancy Has Been Confirmed Instead, focus on miscarriage risks after your pregnancy has been confirmed with a test. As you can see, the risk really falls quickly, and especially so if a live embryo has been seen on ultrasound. An embryo that is alive in week 9 is highly likely to become a baby! And even without knowing if the embryo is alive or not, you can rest assured that the likelihood that your baby is healthy and growing is increasing quickly day by day without a bleeding. How the number of miscarriages and age affect miscarriage risk Miscarrariage statistics for recurrent miscarraiges The miscarriage statistics above all refer to a woman’s first miscarriage . How about the next one? And the next? Recurrent miscarriages are defined as having 3 or more consecutive miscarriages. Only around 1% of all couples will have to endure this, while as many as 20-30 % of all women will knowingly experience a miscarriage (or even up to 75%, but without knowing, as seen in the table above.) Out of the 1% of recurring miscarriages, 50% go unexplained. Studies have also shown that the chances of having a successful pregnancy are about the same after the second and third miscarriage, but after that, the chances go down. It is still of course entirely possible, but after three miscarriages, couples are usually offered an examination to try to explain the miscarriages and possibly offer medication or other help. Miscarriage statistics by age Another factor that has been shown to affect the risk of miscarriage is the age of the parents-to-be . The woman’s age is the most obvious here since there will come a time when her eggs simply can’t be fertilized anymore. But the man’s age actually plays a part too. For a woman, the risk of miscarriage increases dramatically after age 37, with the steepest increase occurring after age 40. By age 45, less than 20% of all recognized pregnancies are viable. The graph below is from a U.S. study of pregnancies conceived via IVF. The risk of miscarriage is a bit lower per age group in this study than some other similar studies – probably because the stats are derived from women who successfully manage to become pregnant through IVF. Not all women who undergo IVF have a successful egg retrieval. The embryos that are transferred to the woman’s womb are chosen because they appear to develop normally and hence the risk of miscarriage for these embryos is a bit lower.  References:Slama et al., 2005. Influence of Paternal Age on the Risk of Spontaneous Abortion. American Journal of Epidemiology The man’s age matters too. If the dad-to-be is over 40 years old, the chances of miscarriage raise significantly. Studies indicate some 25-50% increase in the risk of miscarriage as dad is approaching 40 years old. This all seems pretty dark is you are an “older” couple trying to conceive. Older as in approaching 35 years or older. However, it is not all dark. Once a fetal heartbeat has been confirmed, the risk of miscarriage is much more hopeful! Maternal age Miscarriage risk in week 12 35-37 2.8% 37-39 7.5% 40+ 10.8% References: Spontaneous abortion rate and advanced maternal age: consequences for prenatal diagnosis, The Lancet, Volume 336, Issue 8706, 7 July 1990, Pages 27-29  Other Factors that affects Pregnancy Outcome Has this been a lot to digest? I bet! And to make the situation even more complicated, there are of course other factors than luck, age and earlier miscarriages that will affect your pregnancy outcome. Gladly, many of these factors are within your control . Here are some factors that may increase your risk of miscarriage : Smoking Being underweight before pregnancy High alcohol consumption Severe stress (increasing risk with the number of stressful or traumatic events) and changing partner (which can be quite stressful too!) . And controllable factors that reduce your risk of miscarriage : Vitamin supplementation Eating fresh fruits and vegetables daily Trying to arrange your life so you feel well enough to fly or have sex (Yes really!) Conclusion So what is the conclusion of all this? Miscarriages happen whether we worry or not. Most of the time, they don’t. Trying to let go of the worrying will make your life in early pregnancy happier and may even actually reduce the risk of miscarriage a little bit.  (I know, A LOT easier said than done..!) If you are very worried, ask for an early ultrasound scan . If you can hold out until the 8th week of pregnancy, a live embryo and no bleeding mean that the risk of miscarriage is down to 1.5% if you are younger than 35 years! I don’t have a figure to present for those older than 35 years, but a live embryo is likely to cut your risks very sharply too. Remember that by the time you have a positive pregnancy test , the highest risk of miscarriage is already behind you. Isn’t that great to know? Also, unless you are experiencing bleeding, the risk is already down to below 10% at around the seventh week of pregnancy. Don’t smoke, eat healthy foods, and try to focus on the positive aspects of life. I hope you found this information on miscarriage statistics useful.

I've noticed that no matter how many times I look up miscarriages rates, I walk away feeling only slightly better (at best). I'm the kind of person who finds reassurance in statistics, but for some reason, all of the existing posts weren't doing it for me. And then I realized why: articles on miscarriage focus on the chances you're going to miscarry and all the comments share miscarriage stories--they don't focus on how many people DON'T have miscarriages and go on to have happy, healthy babies! I adapted this week-by-week chart and modified it so that it would focus on the positive rather than the negative! Since I found the positive spin benefiting my peace of mind, I thought it might benefit some of you too. By the way, anyone in this January 2016 club already has a better chance of NOT having a miscarriage than having one... The numbers are on your side!

When pregnancies miscarry it’s almost always because the embryo is defective; not because the mother went clubbing, had sex, didn’t sleep, drank alcohol, went mountaineering, ate a dodgy prawn, or had ambivalent feelings about motherhood. If these things increased the chances of miscarriage, then the world’s population would be much smaller! The fact that babies get born in war zones to women suffering enormous stress and poor nutrition proves that healthy foetuses are pretty resilient and not bothered by bumps, bangs, bad food or mother’s dark state of mind. Miscarriage risk statistics It is more common than many people think, with a large number of women having at least one miscarriage .  Many women miscarry more than once. Considering the frequency of it, about 1 in 36 women will have 2 miscarriages due to nothing more than chance. The chance of it happening decreases as pregnancy progresses. It is thought that as many as half of all pregnancies miscarry before the fertilised egg even implants in the womb. Early after implantation, and before a pregnancy is clinically recognised, around 30% will miscarry. After a pregnancy can be clinically recognised, which is between days 35 – 50, around a quarter of pregnancies will end in miscarriage. However, chance of it happening, decreases dramatically after week 8. Many people wonder if their chances of losing a baby goes up if they’ve already lost a pregnancy. There are many opinions about this, but a Recurrent Miscarriage clinic in London did a study that found miscarriage danger does relate to pregnancy history:  First pregnancy	5%  Last pregnancy terminated 6%  Last pregnancy a live birth 5%  All pregnancies live births 4%  1 previous miscarriage	20%  2 previous miscarriages	28%  3 previous miscarriages	43%  Miscarriage risk factors Aside from nature taking its course and miscarrying a defective foetus, there are other factors that may increase miscarriage danger. Some of these danger factors, such as smoking, can be avoided. Others factors such as diabetes can be controlled and managed to help reduce the danger to pregnancy.  Smoking is believed to increase the chances of not carrying your baby to term by 30 – 50%. So if you’re planning to conceive or are pregnant already, you and your partner now have the perfect incentive to give up the ciggies. Moreover, if you were worried you’d put on weight if you gave up smoking, now it won’t matter so much. Also, as well as reducing your chances of  miscarriage, your lung capacity and efficiency will improve which will become increasingly important as your growing womb pushes up against your lungs.  Coffee is thought to increase the danger of miscarriage if you drink more than four cups a day. Although there isn’t conclusive scientific proof as yet, it would be wise to be on the safe side and switch to herbal teas or hot chocolate.  Age is a factor. Teenagers are more likely to miscarry, as are older women because there’s a greater chance of chromosomal defects.  Some chronic diseases or disorders, including poorly controlled diabetes, certain inherited bloody clotting disorder, certain autoimmune disorders such as Lupus, and certain hormonal disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome can increase the odds of miscarriage. But on a positive note, many of these conditions can be treated or at least managed. For example, if you have a blood-clotting disorder, anticlotting medication may cut your chances of miscarriage by as much as 75%.  Certain infections carry a somewhat higher menace to your baby. They include listeria, mumps, rubella, measles, HIV and gonorrhoea. Your antenatal care should include tests for infections.  If dangerous infections are detected, your doctor or obstetrician will recommend a course of treatment.  Abnormalities of the uterus or cervix increase your danger, including a weak or short cervix.  Some abnormalities are fixable. For example, if a weak cervix has caused a previous miscarriage, a stitch applied at the end of the first trimester in your next pregnancy can stop your cervix from opening early and starting premature labour.  Exposure to toxins might increase your danger, including lead, arsenic, some chemicals, and large doses of radiation or anaesthetic gases  Alcohol consumption is thought by some but not all doctors to increase the chances of miscarriage. Alcohol certainly damages unborn babies so it’s best to give it a miss while you are pregnant and breastfeeding.  Father’s health and age may contribute to miscarriage risk. Father’s age is now believed to be almost as significant as the mother’s, with miscarriage risk increasing with father’s age. Some studies have found that the danger of miscarriage also increases if the father has been exposed to mercury, lead and some industrial chemicals and pesticides.  Hormone imbalance, such as low progesterone during pregnancy can keep the uterus from nourishing the embryo. This can be diagnosed and treated.  Amniocentesis and CSV tests for chromosomal disorders also tend to slightly increase the chances of miscarriage. Amniocentesis carries a 0.5 to 1 percent miscarriage risk within 3 weeks of the test. CVS (chorionic villus sampling) – carries a 1 – 2 per cent risk of causing miscarriage.  Miscarriage risk myths and claims There are lots of myths and bogus claims about miscarriage risk, many of which were used to explain the mysteries of pregnancy before science came up with the truth. From the dark age’s right up to the present day, women have been made to feel guilt, shame and blame for miscarriages. Even though we now know that miscarriage is usually nature stopping the development of a faulty foetus, or due to an often fixable anatomical problem or health condition, women still ask their doctors, “What did I do wrong?” Here are some common myths and claims explained or debunked:  Stress or working too hard. Many women are stressed when they’re pregnant yet go on to have healthy babies. However, recent research suggests stress may be a factor for women who have had multiple miscarriages.  Lifting heavy things such as small children. Pregnant women have always carried an older child on their hip. It’s thought you can safely lift up to 8 or 9 kg without any danger.  And you are likely to automatically drop a heavy item before any harm could occur.  Drinking alcohol. A foetus receives so little of its mother’s blood for the first few weeks of pregnancy that alcohol consumption is not considered a danger in the early stages. Yet women continue to torture themselves over those glasses of wine or tequila shots they enjoyed before they knew they were pregnant. But continuing to drink when you know you’re pregnant is asking for trouble as alcohol can cause Foetal Alcohol Syndrome.  Bad eating habits. Although a shortage of folic acid can cause neural tube defects such as spina bifida, forgetting to take your vitamins or chowing down on a fast food burger won’t generally harm your baby but it will affect you. The baby will take what it needs from your body and you will feel any shortfalls in vitamins and minerals.  Falling over or a blow to the stomach. Baby is cushioned by amniotic fluid so is unlikely to be hurt, especially in the first trimester. However, you should always see a doctor if you are hurt, especially in the second or third trimester as a trauma could cause the placenta to detach and potentially lead to late pregnancy loss. If the blow is domestic abuse, seek immediate help and protection.  Sex does not hurt an unborn baby, although it can be uncomfortable for you in some positions. Don’t be alarmed if there is some blood spotting afterwards. This spotting occurs because the cervix is very soft and its blood vessels are prominent and close to the surface during pregnancy. Unless your doctor advises otherwise (which may be the case if you’ve had recurrent miscarriages or have a condition called placenta previa), there’s no need to move into the spare room.  Exercise. Keeping up your fitness or starting a gentle exercise regimen has big benefits for your health and your baby’s during pregnancy.  It’s thought that as long as you don’t raise your heart rate above 140bpm or overdo intensely physical activities such as martial arts, exercise is not generally a miscarriage risk.  Bad moods or negative feelings about the baby. No matter how dark your thoughts, there’s no way your baby can read them or react to them!  Previous elective abortions. Evidence is mixed on this one. Some studies claim a slight increased risk, while other research identifies no increased chances of miscarriage.  Birth control pills can cause miscarriage.  There is no evidence that taking the pill will cause a miscarriage in an established pregnancy or that taking the pill will increase your future miscarriage risk.  Aspirin increases miscarriage risk. There is some evidence that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can increase the danger but the evidence is mixed. Moreover, low doses of aspirin are sometimes prescribed as part of recurrent miscarriage treatment.  Hot baths or saunas could cause your body temperature to get too high and possibly cause developmental problems but there is no convincing evidence that a long soak in the tub increases the chances of miscarriage. However, some doctors advise pregnant women to steer clear of saunas, just to be on the safe side.

Newsletter A Breakdown of Miscarriage Rates by Week Medically reviewed by Nicole Galan, RN on  January 20, 2016 — Written by Rena Goldman Miscarriage is a word used to describe the early loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks of pregnancy. It usually happens in the first trimester.  Unfortunately, between 10 and 25 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage.  You may have heard of couples waiting to announce a pregnancy until the risk of having a miscarriage is lower. The further you are into the pregnancy, the less likely you are to miscarry.  Read on for a breakdown of what causes miscarriages. The risk decreases as the pregnancy progresses.  Causes  Dr. Kaylen Silverberg, Texas-based fertility specialist, says miscarriages are very common.  “Women think that when they have one miscarriage, they are doomed to miscarry again,” he says.  But it turns out that your risk isn’t any greater after a miscarriage. Even after two miscarriages, the risk of miscarrying again doesn’t increase.  He says most medical professionals don’t evaluate a woman until she’s had three miscarriages. But there are fertility experts who will do an examination after two.  Here are the five most common miscarriage causes.  Genetics  When the sperm and egg meet, the cells come together. They then begin to divide to start forming the genetic material that makes up a person.  Each of us is supposed to have 46 total chromosomes. That’s 23 from one parent and 23 from the other. If something goes wrong when the cells are dividing, a chromosome may be missing or repeated.  According to Dr. Silverberg, 90 percent of all first trimester miscarriages are because of chromosomal abnormalities.  Infections  Uterus or cervix infections can be dangerous to a developing baby and lead to miscarriage.  Some of these infections include:  chlamydia gonorrhea mycoplasma ureaplasma  Anatomic Problems  This refers to defects of the uterus cavity. If the woman’s uterus didn’t form correctly when she was developing, it may be unable to support a healthy pregnancy.  Clotting Disorders  Clotting disorders are conditions that cause your body to form more blood clots than normal. Examples include lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid syndrome.  In the case of pregnancy, blood clots can form in the placenta. This prevents nutrition and oxygen from getting to the baby-to-be, and prevents waste from being carried away.  Progesterone Deficiency  In luteal phase deficiency or progesterone deficiency, the body isn’t producing enough progesterone. This is the hormone that plays a big part during pregnancy.  Risk Rates  The first trimester of pregnancy is considered weeks 0 to 13. About 80 percent of miscarriages happen in the first trimester.  Weeks 0 to 7  These weeks mark the highest risk. A woman can have a miscarriage in the first week or two without even realizing she’s pregnant. She might think it’s a late period.  Age plays a role in a woman’s risk factor. Here is the miscarriage risk breakdown by age:  Women age 20 to 30: 9 to 17 percent Women age 35 to 39: 20 percent Women age 40 to 44: 40 percent Women age 45 and older: 80 percent  Weeks 7 to 12  Once a pregnancy makes it to 7 weeks with a heartbeat, the risk of having a miscarriage drops to 10 percent.  Weeks 12 to 20  By week 12, the risk may fall to 5 percent. But keep in mind that it doesn’t really go below that because complications can happen during pregnancy.  Signs and Symptoms  The most common signs of a miscarriage are bleeding and cramping that are felt in the abdomen or lower back.  Some women have spotting (light bleeding) during pregnancy. A few drops or light flow of brown or dark red doesn’t necessarily mean trouble. But call the doctor right away if you see bright red blood, particularly in large amounts. Cramping can also happen in normal pregnancies.  Prevention  The majority of miscarriages are the result of genetic abnormalities or other health factors that are beyond our control. For that reason, there isn’t a whole lot you can do for prevention.  The best thing you can do is to keep yourself as healthy as possible before trying to conceive and throughout your pregnancy. Here are some tips to staying healthy during pregnancy:  eat a well-balanced diet exercise regularly avoid alcohol and cigarette smoking avoid caffeine get regular prenatal visits  If you’re worried, you might want to try genetic testing before trying to conceive. Blood is taken from both partners. It’s sent to a laboratory to be evaluated for major genetic disorders.  The Takeaway  It’s important to remember if you have a miscarriage, it’s not your fault. The experience can be physically and emotionally painful. Talk to trusted friends and family, and ask for help when you need it.  Your doctor may be able to recommend a support group or therapist in your area. There are also many online organizations and support groups like March of Dimes that offer a safe place to share your story and grieve with others.

We also expect the pregnancy will end in a healthy, normal, live birth. Medical professionals do not usually talk/warn about miscarriage to their patients. With the advancement of scanning technology, pregnancies can be confirmed earlier. This means women can see their baby and bonding occurs earlier too. When a miscarriage happens unexpectedly, it can be a shocking end to the dreams and expectations of the woman and her partner.  Quote from Dr. Karen Buckingham, an Auckland obstetrician and gynaecologist: ‘And because human pregnancy is a relatively inefficient process, approximately 50% of all conceptions fail – with most miscarriages going unrecog­nised because they occur before or with a woman’s next expected period.’ (Next Magazine June 2012.)  Spontaneous abortion  The World Health Organisation defines miscarriage as ‘the spontaneous abortion of an embryo or fetus weighing 500 grams or less. This typically corresponds to a fetal gestational age of 20 to 22 weeks or less’. Miscarriage in New Zealand is defined as a pregnancy that ends spontaneously before 20 weeks. The baby not usually being born alive and weighing under 400g.  Just knowing 70% of fertilized eggs die before they are 6 days old can help in understanding miscarriage. As we learn about conception and the critical stages of a baby’s development (e.g. A 3 week old embryo has formed the cells that control the beat of the heart) and how much else can go wrong, we can further appreciate what a little miracle a baby really is.  Miscarriage affects one in every four women. The highest risk period is between 4 and 6 weeks. Once 8 or 9 weeks are reached and the baby’s heart beat is seen on a scan there is only a 4% to 5% chance of miscarriage, depending on the speed of the heart-beat. It should be 120 to 160 times per minute. (BMP) The risk then drops to between 5% and 8% and continues to drop as the pregnancy proceeds.  99% of foetal deaths occur in the first 12 to 14 weeks of pregnancy (1st trimester), although the actual miscarriage may not happen for some weeks after the baby dies. Medically this is called a ‘missed abortion’. (The baby is an “embryo” to the 8th week and a “foetus” after that.)  The chance of losing a first pregnancy is greater than later ones. 70% of miscarriages are unexplained.  What happens during miscarriage?  The symptoms you experience will depend on the cause of the miscarriage and how advanced the pregnancy is/was so may take hours, days or even weeks to complete. Usually the foetus, placenta and blood from the uterus leave the body through the vagina. (see ‘ the miscarriage process ’) You may discover during a routine scan that there is no heartbeat, or even an empty foetal sac. Usually, by the time bleeding begins your baby has already died. The exception is around the 6 weeks mark when only a small amount of blood is lost, then there is an 80% your baby will be fine (see ‘ threatening miscarriage ’).

If you're newly pregnant and trying to make sense of the myriad statistics about miscarriage, here's an explanation of each one that hopefully will ease your mind. Miscarriage and Failed Implantation Rate for All Conceptions This is the statistic that can be the most alarming, so it's key to understand what it includes.         As many as 75 percent of fertilized eggs do not go on to result in a full-term pregnancy. This statistic includes both miscarriages and failed implantations that usually pass without the mother ever missing a period or knowing conception took place. If you already know you're pregnant, this is not a number you need to worry about. Because there's only around a 30 percent chance of getting pregnant each menstrual cycle even when you're having regular sex, researchers speculate that fertilized eggs often fail to implant, usually with the woman unaware that conception occurred. Laboratory studies on IVF patients have found that a very large percentage of eggs harbor chromosome abnormalities (the leading cause of miscarriage). An older, widely-quoted study found that in natural cycles, about 22 percent of all conceptions never complete implantation. Considering such evidence, some scientists have speculated that if you factor in fertilized eggs that don't implant along with pregnancies that end in miscarriage, around 70 percent to 75 percent of conceptions end up miscarrying.   But whether these failed implantations can be defined as a "miscarriage" is a matter of opinion. Most doctors consider pregnancy to begin at implantation rather than at fertilization. At the very least, by the time implantation has occurred and the hCG hormone is detectable in the blood and urine (meaning, by the time you know you're pregnant), it's safe to say this statistic is irrelevant.         Miscarriage Rate After Confirmed Implantation In the same study that found 22 percent of conceptions fail to implant, it was also found that 31 percent of pregnancies confirmed after implantation end in miscarriage. That would mean that about one in three pregnancies miscarries. But before you worry too much about those figures, note that this number came from a study of a population of women who were confirmed to be pregnant at the very earliest point that it's scientifically possible to detect a pregnancy. In real life, most women find out they are pregnant at a later point than the participants in this study, and the risk of miscarriage drops as pregnancy progresses. That would mean that most women have a lower risk of miscarriage by the time they confirm their pregnancies. Still, it's worth pointing out that many experts consider this statistic as an argument against taking ultra-sensitive early pregnancy tests before missing a menstrual period. Use of such pregnancy tests increases the risk of detecting a transient, nonviable pregnancy that will miscarry within a few days and otherwise would have just looked like a regular menstrual period. Knowing about such pregnancies can be a source of stress for many women, and if this is true for you, it's worth waiting to test until your period is actually late.         Miscarriage Rate for Confirmed Pregnancies For the general population of pregnant women, this is usually the most relevant statistic. About 15 percent to 20 percent of all women with a verified pregnancy will end up having a miscarriage. Since the general population includes women who weren't trying to get pregnant and might not have been tracking their menstrual periods, many are already a few weeks along—possibly more than halfway through the first trimester—by the time they confirm their pregnancies. As stated above, the further a pregnancy progresses, the lower the risk of miscarriage, so that's the reason for the disparity between this statistic and the one above.  If you're more than five weeks pregnant but still in the first trimester, this statistic is probably the most relevant one for you. But remember that your own personal risk might be higher or lower depending on several other factors, including your age, lifestyle, and past pregnancy history. Seeing the Heartbeat Means a Lower Chance of Miscarriage Most doctors agree that seeing a fetal heartbeat on ultrasound means the risk of miscarriage is much lower. Confirmation of a fetal heartbeat means that the baby has passed the initial stages of development wherein the majority of first trimester miscarriages occur. It's hard to pick a specific number for the risk of miscarriage at this point. Some cite numbers like a 4 percent to 5 percent risk of miscarriage at this point, but studies show a widely varying risk based on individual factors. The one thing that's safe to say, however, is that seeing the baby's heartbeat is a good sign. It means the baby is growing as it should be, and there's little reason to be concerned at this point. Unfortunately, there is one exception to this rule. A slow fetal heart rate (less than 100 beats per minute) may signal an impending miscarriage, though this isn't true in 100 percent of cases. The Majority of Miscarriages Occur in the First Trimester Over 80 percent of miscarriages occur before 12 weeks, so the chances look good for a healthy baby once you've finished the first trimester. Again, many individual factors are in play, but if 15 percent to 20 percent of pregnancies end in miscarriage and 80 percent of miscarriages occur in the first trimester, a safe estimate would be that in the general population the risk of pregnancy loss after 12 weeks is 3 percent to 4 percent. After 20 weeks, when a loss would be termed a stillbirth rather than a miscarriage, the risk is around one in 160. Miscarriage Rate if You Had a Past Miscarriage Most first-time miscarriages are random and do not recur. With one past miscarriage, the odds of miscarrying in your next pregnancy are about 20 percent. This is not much higher than someone without a history of miscarriage. With two previous miscarriages, the risk of another miscarriage is 28 percent, and with three previous miscarriages, the risk increases to 43 percent. It's possible that testing for recurrent miscarriage causes might help in these cases. What Can Lower Your Miscarriage Risk? There's not a whole lot you can do to affect your odds of miscarriage, but research suggests you may have a lower risk of miscarriage if you avoid alcohol , don't smoke , and avoid known occupational hazards . A Word From Verywell When you are pregnant or hope to become pregnant, you may be anxious to ensure you are doing everything right. It's easy to become overwhelmed by the many statistics floating around. Try to focus on doing what is healthy for your body and for nurturing your pregnancy.

If you become pregnant or think you may be pregnant while taking diclofenac and misoprostol, stop taking the medication and call your doctor immediately. Diclofenac and misoprostol may cause miscarriage (pregnancy loss), serious bleeding, or premature birth (baby is born too early) if taken during pregnancy. Women who can become pregnant generally should not take diclofenac and misoprostol. However, you and your doctor may decide that diclofenac and misoprostol combination is needed to treat your condition. In that case you must: agree to use a reliable method of birth control during your treatment and for at least 1 month or one menstrual cycle after your treatment; have a negative blood test for pregnancy no longer than 2 weeks before you start taking diclofenac and misoprostol; begin taking the medication only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period. For all patients: People who take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (other than aspirin) such as diclofenac and misoprostol combination may have a higher risk of having a heart attack or a stroke than people who do not take these medications. These events may happen without warning and may cause death. This risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time. Do not use an NSAID such as diclofenac and misoprostol combination if you have recently had a heart attack, unless directed to do so by your doctor. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had heart disease, a heart attack, or a stroke, if you smoke, and if you have or have ever had high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes. Get emergency medical help right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness in one part or side of the body, or slurred speech. If you will be undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG; a type of heart surgery), you should not take diclofenac and misoprostol right before or right after the surgery. NSAIDs such as diclofenac may cause ulcers, bleeding, or holes in the stomach or intestine. Misoprostol is taken in combination with diclofenac to protect the stomach and intestine, but may not prevent all damage to these parts of the body. Problems with the stomach and intestine may develop at any time during treatment, may happen without warning symptoms, and may cause death. The risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time, are older in age, have poor health, smoke, or drink large amounts of alcohol while taking diclofenac and misoprostol. Tell your doctor if you take any of the following medications: anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven); aspirin; other NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); oral steroids such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Rayos); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram (Celexa), fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem, Selfemra, in Symbyax), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Brisdelle, Paxil, Pexeva), and sertraline (Zoloft); or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as desvenlafaxine (Khedezla, Pristiq), duloxetine (Cymbalta), and venlafaxine (Effexor XR). Tell your doctor if you have any bleeding in your stomach or intestines or if you have any of these symptoms: vomiting a substance that is bloody or looks like coffee grounds, blood in the stool, or black and tarry stools. before you begin your treatment with diclofenac and misoprostol. Your doctor will probably tell you not to take diclofenac and misoprostol. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had ulcers or a bleeding disorder. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking diclofenac and misoprostol and call your doctor: stomach pain, heartburn, vomiting a substance that is bloody or looks like coffee grounds, blood in the stool, or black and tarry stools. Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will monitor your symptoms carefully and will probably order certain tests to check your body's response to diclofenac and misoprostol. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling so that your doctor can prescribe the right amount of medication to treat your condition with the lowest risk of serious side effects. Do not give this medication to anyone else, especially a woman who is or could become pregnant. Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet for diclofenac and misoprostol and the general Medication Guide for NSAIDs when you begin your treatment and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm ) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the patient information sheet and Medication Guide. Why is this medication prescribed?   The combination of diclofenac and misoprostol is used to relieve the pain, tenderness, swelling, and stiffness caused by osteoarthritis (arthritis caused by a breakdown of the lining of the joints) and rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis caused by swelling of the lining of the joints) in patients who have a high risk of developing stomach ulcers. Diclofenac is in a class of medications called NSAIDs. It works by stopping the body's production of a substance that causes pain and inflammation. Misoprostol is in a class of medications called prostaglandins. It prevents ulcers caused by diclofenac by protecting the stomach lining and decreasing stomach acid production. How should this medicine be used?   The combination of diclofenac and misoprostol comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food two to four times a day. To help you remember to take diclofenac and misoprostol, take it at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take diclofenac and misoprostol combination exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them. Do not take tablets that are broken or damaged. Other uses for this medicine   This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. What special precautions should I follow?

Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. Other medications may interact with diclofenac and misoprostol, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list. talk to your doctor if you need to take an antacid during your treatment with diclofenac and misoprostol. You should not take antacids that contain magnesium (Mylanta, others). Your doctor may tell you that you can take an antacid that contains aluminum or calcium. tell your doctor if you have or have ever had any of the conditions mentioned in the IMPORTANT WARNING section or inflammatory bowel disease (swelling of the lining of the intestine that may cause painful or bloody diarrhea and cramping); asthma, especially if you also have frequent stuffed or runny nose or nasal polyps (swelling of the lining of the nose); lupus (a condition in which the body attacks many of its own tissues and organs, often including the skin, joints, blood, and kidneys); hepatic porphyria (an abnormal increase in the amount of certain natural substances made by the liver); heart failure; liver or kidney disease; or swelling of the hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs. tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking diclofenac and misoprostol. What special dietary instructions should I follow?   Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet. What should I do if I forget a dose?   Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. What side effects can this medication cause?   Diclofenac and misoprostol may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: diarrhea gas or bloating constipation Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms or those mentioned in the IMPORTANT WARNING section, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical help. Do not take any more diclofenac and misoprostol until you speak to your doctor. unexplained weight gain shortness of breath or difficulty breathing swelling in the abdomen, ankles, feet, or legs excessive tiredness lack of energy itching upset stomach loss of appetite pain in the upper right part of the stomach yellowing of the skin or eyes flu-like symptoms pale skin fast heartbeat headache stiff neck sore throat muscle pain confusion sensitivity to light fever blisters rash hives swelling of the eyes, face, lips, tongue, throat, arms, or hands difficulty swallowing hoarseness unusual vaginal bleeding cloudy, discolored, or bloody urine back pain difficult or painful urination Diclofenac and misoprostol may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication. If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online ( http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch ) or by phone (1-800-332-1088). What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?   Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community.  See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website ( http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p ) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program. It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. http://www.upandaway.org In case of emergency/overdose   In case of overdose, call the poison control helpline at 1-800-222-1222. Information is also available online at https://www.poisonhelp.org/help . If the victim has collapsed, had a seizure, has trouble breathing, or can't be awakened, immediately call emergency services at 911. Symptoms of overdose may include: stomach pain vomiting diarrhea confusion drowsiness low muscle tone uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body seizures shortness of breath fever fast, pounding, or slow heartbeat dizziness fainting What other information should I know?   Before having any laboratory test, tell your doctor and the laboratory personnel that you are taking diclofenac and misoprostol. Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription. It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.

Let us reassure you .         About the Daily Miscarriage Probability Chart  Knowing doesn't have to be scary. The Daily Miscarriage Probability Chart calculates the probability of miscarriage or, conversely, the probability of birth, given how far a woman is in her pregnancy. The underlying model can also account for added risk factors like maternal age, weight, the number of previous miscarriages and the number of previous live births.  The miscarriage probability table displays the probability of a miscarriage occurring on or after a given point in pregnancy. You can therefore find the day-specific odds, or the odds between two points in time, by subtracting the probability associated with date from another. For example, if the model gives the probability of a miscarriage occurring on or after 4 weeks, 0 days is as 25.2%, and the probability of a miscarriage occurring on or after 4 weeks, 1 day as 24.4%, then the probability of a miscarriage occurring at exactly 4 weeks, 0 days is 25.2-24.4 or 0.8%. Probabilities in the table are rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent, so very small probability differences between two dates may not be noticeable in the table.  Take the Probabilities With You  Want to bookmark the Miscarriage Probability Chart with all it's data so you don't have to keep re-entering your maternal info it day after day? Click here to get a parameterized URL.  Determining how far along you are Weeks refers to gestational weeks.  If you've had a 1st trimester ultrasound (sometimes referred to as a dating ultrasound) 
  your doctor may have given you a due date and gestational age that differs from those calculated from last menstrual period (LMP).  
  Some women also 
  track ovulation, which may give them yet another possible gestational age.  Gestational age estimated from the dating ultrasound will 
  be the most accurate, followed by gestational age based on ovulation and finally gestational age based on LMP. Still not sure how far along
  you are?  Try the Pregnancy Week By Week Calendar which will give you gestational age based on LMP,
  ovulation or due date.  About the model  Miscarriage is generally recognized as pregnancy loss before 20 weeks gestation.
  That is the definition we are using as well.  This page calculates the cumulative
  probability of pregnancy loss from a given point in pregnancy through 20 weeks gestation.  Beyond 20 weeks gestation pregnancy 
  most often ends in a live birth, and rarely in stillbirth .  
  Thus, we refer to the probability of not miscarrying as the
  probability of birth. Why not include stillbirth data?  Miscarriage and stillbirth are two different types of loss
    with different sets of causes and risk factors.  Most importantly (for modelling purposes)
    the per-week risk of stillbirth actually increases later in pregnancy,
    around the time of birth . 
    In order to model cumulative risk of all types of pregnancy loss, including stillbirth, effectively, we'd need to estimate
    pregnancy length, which we can do but would introduce additional uncertainty and
    decrease accuracy.   The underlying model for this site is derived using meta analysis of the following peer reviewed papers on miscarriage. 
  The model can be be used without additional input, or can be adjusted with any combination
  of maternal age, height/weight (BMI), number of previous miscarriages and
  number of previous births inputs.   Each variable is modeled separately, assumed to be independent
  and assumed to affect the probability of miscarriage uniformly over time.  These assumptions 
  are likely overly strong, as there are likely confounding variables, but is the most reasonable 
  approximation in the absence of additional data.   [1] Tong, S., Kaur, A., Walker, S. P., Bryant, V., Onwude, J. L., and Permezel, M. (2008),

Unfortunately, miscarriages are incredibly common, especially early in pregnancy. Approximately one in every three to five pregnancies ends in miscarriage. Your exact risk of having a miscarriage varies based on your genetics, environment, and other factors.         When reading about miscarriage statistics, it is important to remember that these figures are just numbers. Even if you have a higher than average risk of miscarriage, it does not mean that you will miscarry. In most cases, your odds of having a normal pregnancy are higher than your odds of having a miscarriage. Determining Your Risk If you are not yet pregnant and are concerned about miscarrying, you may be able to lower your risk by addressing some preventable ​ risk factors . Some risk factors are changeable. For example, if you smoke or drink alcohol, quitting either of these practices will reduce your risk of miscarriage. Preventable risk factors include: Smoking: Both smoking and being exposed to secondhand smoke can increase your chances of having a miscarriage. Drinking: Drinking alcohol while pregnant increases the likelihood your child will be born with fetal alcohol syndrome. Regular alcohol consumption can also increase your likelihood of miscarriage.   Your weight: Being underweight or overweight can also increase your odds of miscarrying. Obese women have the greatest risk of miscarriage as compared to overweight and underweight women. Treatable infections: Infections that go untreated are one of the most preventable causes of miscarriage, and are thought to cause approximately 15 percent of miscarriages. Infections associated with miscarriage include malaria, brucellosis, cytomegalovirus, HIV, dengue fever, influenza virus, and bacterial vaginosis         Other risk factors are harder to avoid, such as: Your age: The older you are, the greater your likelihood of miscarrying. For women in their early 40's, the risk of miscarriage is approximately 50 percent. Your partner's age: The age of your child's father may also affect your odds of miscarrying. Reproductive health conditions: Certain reproductive health conditions, like endometriosis and adenomyosis, can increase your odds of miscarrying. Mullerian anomalies, conditions that affect the size and shape of your uterus, can also make it difficult to successfully carry a pregnancy. Genetics: Certain genetic conditions that affect egg and sperm quality can also increase your odds of experiencing a miscarriage. If you have had multiple miscarriages, see a reproductive endocrinologist and ask about genetic testing, which can diagnose any issues your eggs or your partner's sperm may have. History of miscarriages: Approximately 2 percent of women will have two miscarriages in a row, and 1 percent of women, three or more. If you do not have any risk factors, your risk will be in the average range. In most cases, your risk of miscarriage decreases as your pregnancy progresses . After seeing a heartbeat on an ultrasound, your risk of miscarriage will drop, although the miscarriage rates will remain higher for women with specific risk factors.

The Truth About Your Top 10 Pregnancy Worries Pregnancy Anxiety? The Truth About Your Top 10 Pregnancy Worries  Get the bottom line on the fears you'll face while pregnant, and expert tips on how to cope. By Laurie Tarkan  Facebook  Pinterest  Text  Email     Many pregnant women fret too much about the wrong things, and pay too little attention to issues that can genuinely harm their pregnancy and baby. See how your concerns compare to other women's, then learn whether or not your fears are well-founded and—the bottom line—what you can do to have a healthy and happy pregnancy . First comes the excitement, followed immediately by the worry. Once you've adjusted to the fact that you're pregnant, you may find yourself stressing about whether your baby will be born healthy . . . or you might have a miscarriage . . . or you won't be able to stand the pain of labor . . . or be able to breastfeed. The list goes on and on. If you tend toward worrying in the first place, there's plenty of fodder in the news to keep you on high alert ( killer cat litter , toxic sushi, collapsing cribs), and even the more laid-back among you may have moments of anxiety when the nurse is searching for the baby's heartbeat on the ultrasound, it's time for prenatal tests or seemingly strange symptoms arise. Add the surge in pregnancy hormones, and you've got a surefire recipe for angst. But pregnancy risks are generally low, especially for healthy women, and don't warrant a high level of concern on the part of most moms-to-be. To counter excess anxiety, experts advise trying to change the negative chatter in your head and tone down any extreme thoughts. "To do that you need to focus on the evidence that contradicts your worrisome thoughts," says Sari Shepphird, Ph.D., a psychologist in Los Angeles. That's why we asked experts to provide a reality check on 10 of the things pregnant women worry about most, based on a recent March of Dimes survey (the number beside each worry is the percentage of respondents who reported having that concern). "If you keep reminding yourself of the facts, it will reduce speculation, which in turn reduces worry and stress," says Shepphird. Also, she says, instead of worrying about things you can't control (that martini you had before you knew you were pregnant), focus on what you do have control over (how much weight you gain during pregnancy). Here's the bottom line on some of the fears you're likely to face during pregnancy, along with issues you might want to pay more attention to. Plus, we tell you what really counts—the simple things you can do to move past worry and improve your chances of having a healthy pregnancy and baby. 1. Birth defects (78%) REALITY CHECK About 97 of every 100 babies born in the U.S. arrive without a major birth defect, such as spina bifida or Down syndrome. That's the optimist's way of viewing the 3 percent risk of delivering a baby who does have one. Plus, many birth defects, such as club foot, webbed toes and even some heart defects, are minor or very treatable. "Surgical treatments are available nowadays, and many of them are very successful," says Richard Olney, M.D., a clinical geneticist at the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities in Atlanta. If you're not in a higher-risk group, the chances that you'll have a baby with a birth defect may be even lower: Risk factors include diabetes, epilepsy, smoking, drinking alcohol and obesity, although for 70 percent of all birth defects, the cause is unknown. WHAT YOU CAN DO Act as if you're pregnant as soon as you decide you want a child (or even before—half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unplanned). "Most structural birth defects occur as early as a week or two after you miss your period," explains Michael Lu, M.D., associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. Waiting until you know you're pregnant may be too late to prevent these defects. Take at least 400 micrograms of folic acid daily to reduce the risk for neural-tube defects, such as spina bifida; eat a healthy, balanced diet; avoid fish that contain mercury; stop drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes or using recreational or over-the-counter drugs; don't eat undercooked meat or change the cat's litter box (both are possible sources of toxo- plasmosis, an infection that can cause birth defects); lose weight , if needed; and make sure your blood sugar levels are normal. 2. Miscarriage (75%) REALITY CHECK The risk of miscarriage is probably lower than you think. For women younger than 35, it's 10 to 12 percent; for 35- to 39-year-olds, it's 18 percent. (It does rise to 34 percent for women 40 to 44 years old.) But a great many pregnancies are lost so early that a woman never even realizes that she conceived. What's even more reassuring is that by the time you see a heartbeat on an ultrasound (usually by week six or seven), the chance of having a miscarriage drops to less than 5 percent, says Lu. WHAT YOU CAN DO Remind yourself that most miscarriages occur because of chromosomal abnormalities that cannot be prevented; research does not show that exercise, sex or even heavy lifting can cause a miscarriage. One lifestyle caveat: Recent studies have shown that drinking two or more cups of coffee a day may increase your risk, as may contracting certain infections, including sexually transmitted diseases and gum disease. 3. Too much stress (74%) REALITY CHECK Everyday stressors like having to work late, getting stuck in traffic or arguing with your husband are not likely to pose a risk to your pregnancy or your child. But ongoing major stress accompanied by depression (the two often go hand-in-hand) may increase your risk of preterm delivery or having a low-birth-weight baby or a child with long-term behavioral issues. "If you are impaired in some way by the stress—you aren't able to get along with your co-workers or partner, say—that's when it may have an impact," says Tom O'Connor, Ph.D., a professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. "If your stress doesn't reach that level, it may not be significant in terms of pregnancy complications," he says. WHAT YOU CAN DO For ongoing stress or depression, see a cognitive behavioral specialist who can teach you coping strategies, such as questioning the anxiety-causing chatter in your head. She can also teach you relaxation exercises and visualization to lower your stress hormone levels. You can even use the breathing exercises taught in childbirth classes. While practicing deep breathing , imagine what concerns you as you're inhaling; then, while exhaling, picture yourself releasing the thought or concern that is on your mind. You can also use a phrase like "let it go" when you breathe out, says Shepphird. 4. Prematurity (71%) REALITY CHECK Prematurity is a legitimate concern. However, worrisome as pre-term birth is, the great majority of babies in the U.S. are born after 37 weeks, which is considered full term (this may be changing; see " Rethinking 'Full Term' "). An estimated 12 percent are born preterm, which increases their risk of health problems, but keep in mind that 70 percent of them are born between weeks 34 and 37. These so-called "late-term" babies still have increased risks, but they are less vulnerable than the tiniest ones. The biggest risk factors for preterm birth are having had a previous premature delivery, being pregnant with multiples, and having certain uterine or cervical abnormalities. Still, about half of women who deliver prematurely don't fall into any high-risk category. WHAT YOU CAN DO Obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes are risk factors for prematurity, so try to maintain a healthy weight and make sure your blood sugar and blood pressure levels are normal. Avoid smoking, alcohol and recreational drugs (all are linked to prematurity), get good prenatal care and make sure you have all your necessary immunizations and have any infections (even minor ones) treated promptly, as infections are a leading cause of preterm birth. Ongoing major stress can also trigger preterm labor, so be sure to treat any severe anxiety or depression. Many mood-altering medications are considered safe during pregnancy; ask your doctor which ones might be best for you. 5. Labor pain (70%) REALITY CHECK We're not going to tell you labor doesn't hurt—most women rate it as a 7 or 8 out of 10 on the pain scale—but you have options when it comes to easing both your pain and your fear of it. If you want to avoid medication, there's much you can do to reduce the pain and the anxiety surrounding it, such as laboring in a tub of water, changing positions often during labor and practicing relaxation techniques like guided imagery. 10 Ways to Relieve Labor Pain >> Or, you may want to opt for pain meds. If you're worried about the risks, rest assured that today's epidurals are safe and mom-friendly. Though you may have heard that pain medications prolong labor, they don't prolong the first—and longest—stage of labor, and may even shorten it, says Cynthia A. Wong, M.D., a professor of anesthesiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Epidurals do tend to lengthen the shorter "pushing" phase because they dull the otherwise intense urge to push, but there's no convincing evidence that they increase the risk of Cesarean section or low Apgar scores for your newborn. WHAT YOU CAN DO First, educate yourself about all your pain-relief options and their risks and benefits. If you are trying to avoid using medication, research suggests that a birthing coach or doula can help you "go natural" by reminding you to breathe, talking you through the stages of labor and reassuring you that nothing is wrong as the pain intensifies. Also learn what to expect, because the unknown can cause more anxiety. "If you know exactly what is causing the pain, it can reduce your anxiety," says Erika Bleiberg, a doula in Glen Ridge, N.J. Anxiety can cause tension, which can make breathing more dif-ficult and the pain worse, she adds. Sign up early for a childbirth course, such as Lamaze , the Bradley Method or HypnoBirthing; classes fill up fast. Also have a birth plan , but don't make absolute decisions beforehand. "Women get disappointed and feel guilty when they have a plan and things change," Wong says. If you're on the fence and not sure how you'll handle the pain, don't try to be a hero and wait until you can't stand it anymore. It takes at least 20 to 30 minutes between the time you say, "Give me the drugs!" until they've been administered and you feel relief. 6. Eating sushi (61%) REALITY CHECK Most experts recommend avoiding raw fish while pregnant because of the risk of being exposed to bacteria and parasites (these infections are often difficult to treat during pregnancy because some medications can be unsafe). But your actual risk may be quite low. "If sushi chefs are well trained and freeze fish adequately before serving it raw, the risk should be extremely low," says Jeffrey Jones, M.D., of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The other concern, though, is the mercury in some fish: Tuna can be high in this toxin. WHAT YOU CAN DO Rest assured that if you desperately need to quell a sushi craving or you had some sushi before you knew you were pregnant, chances are you're fine. To keep mercury consumption down but still benefit from the healthy omega-3 fatty acids in certain seafood, do not eat more than 6 ounces of fresh tuna a week, but do eat up on things to 12 ounces of canned light tuna or other low-mercury seafood, such as shrimp, wild salmon, catfish, sardines and anchovies. 7. Breastfeeding (60%) REALITY CHECK You may have heard reality TV star Bethenny Frankel (or even one of your friends or family members) say that breastfeeding was "the hardest thing in the world." The truth is, 90 percent or more of women can successfully breastfeed, given patience, realistic expectations and support. Most women think they will click with the baby right away and breastfeed effortlessly. If they don't, many new moms worry that they have an unsolvable problem. "It takes two to three weeks before the mother and baby really know each other and the milk production matches the baby's needs," says Laura Viehmann, M.D., a pediatrician in Pawtucket, R.I. WHAT YOU CAN DO Before you give birth, imagine yourself happily nursing your baby, and have a lactation counselor or doula lined up to provide expert advice if you need it. Also consider visiting a breastfeeding support group before your baby is born. "Women who have seen other women breastfeed are much more able to do so successfully," Viehmann says. Nipple pain is one of the most common reasons women give up on nursing, but this can be avoided with a good latch-on technique ( watch our step-by-step video here ). If you experience even a little pain when nursing, seek help immediately. Another concern new moms have is that the baby is not getting enough milk, but your expectations may be too high. Newborns only drink about 1 1âˆ•2 ounces of milk in the first 24 hours, and only a few ounces a day in the next few days, because you'll produce colostrum— the calorie-dense, nutrient-rich "pre-milk"— before your milk comes in on day four or so. Finally, try to surround yourself with people who will be positive and supportive of your efforts to breastfeed. "It's a lot harder if you have people around you suggesting that you give the baby a bottle," Viehmann says. 8. Losing the pregnancy weight (59%) REALITY CHECK This is a valid concern, especially for the 41 percent of women who gain too much weight during pregnancy and for those who were very overweight before they got pregnant. WHAT YOU CAN DO Stick to the Institutes of Medicine guidelines for weight gain during pregnancy and you'll have an easier time taking it off later. If you're normal weight (your body mass index, or BMI, is 18.5 to 24.9), gain 25 to 35 pounds; if you're underweight (BMI less than 18.5), gain 28 to 40 pounds; if you're overweight (BMI 25 to 29.9), gain 15 to 25 pounds; and if you're obese (BMI 30 or higher) gain 11 to 20 pounds, though some experts believe obese women should stay at the low end of that range. Try to stay active during your pregnancy and start exercising after giving birth as soon as you get the green light from your OB. Studies show that diet and exercise together to 12 ounces of canned light tuna or other low-mercury seafood, such as shrimp, wild salmon, catfish, sardines and anchovies. can help you lose weight postpartum faster than either tactic alone. And breastfeed: Recent research found that if you stay within the prenatal weight-gain guidelines and feed your baby nothing but breast milk for the first six months, you'll likely lose all your pregnancy weight during that time. 9. Heavy lifting (57%) REALITY CHECK There's some evidence that being on your feet all day or having a job that requires heavy lifting may raise your risk of preterm labor, but the research is inconsistent. WHAT YOU CAN DO If you're at increased risk for preterm labor, you will be advised to avoid heavy lifting and prolonged standing. Worried about either? Talk to your boss about switching to a job that allows you to sit more or take more frequent seated breaks. 10. Getting to the hospital on time (55%) REALITY CHECK Though it always makes the news when a woman delivers in a taxi or on the bathroom floor, in real life, it's rare. In a study from England, 137 out of 31,140 babies were born before they arrived at a hospital over a five-year period—that's less than a 1 percent chance. If it's your first baby, you should have plenty of time: From the time your cervix is dilated 4 centimeters (when experts say you should head to the hospital) you still face an average of six hours for the first stage of labor (when your cervix dilates to 10 centimeters) plus another two hours of serious pushing, says Siobhan Dolan, M.D., M.P.H., an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology and women's health at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, N.Y. If it's your second baby, the first stage of labor usually lasts two to 10 hours. WHAT YOU CAN DO Most women don't need to worry about this if they follow the guidelines above. If you had a very quick labor previously or you live far from a hospital, you should check in with your doctor or midwife sooner rather than later, Dolan says. 5 things you SHOULD worry about  In the March of Dimes survey, fewer than half of the pregnant women said they were concerned about the following issues, all of which, experts say, pose serious potential risks. 1. GETTING AN INFECTION Infections can be more serious during pregnancy and lead to complications such as preterm birth. In 2009, 5 percent of pregnant women who reported having the H1N1 virus (the "swine flu") died, and 22 percent were admitted into the intensive care unit. Even a common urinary tract infection can lead to a dangerous kidney infection and preterm birth when you're pregnant, so see your doctor immediately if you have symptoms of infection, such as fever, inflammation or pain. "Things that you might sit on when you're not pregnant should be addressed more quickly when you are," says OB-GYN Siobhan Dolan, M.D., M.P.H. 2. GAINING TOO MUCH WEIGHT A three-state survey found that 41 percent of pregnant women are gaining more than the recommended amount of weight , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Doing so can put you at risk of pregnancy complications, prematurity, birth defects, retaining the weight postpartum and having an overweight child. Try to eat twice as healthy when you're pregnant, not twice as much. 3. NOT EXERCISING ENOUGH Only 23 percent of pregnant women get the recommended 30 minutes or more of moderate exercise a day, according to a recent study. Lack of exercise can contribute to excessive weight gain, loss of strength and stamina just when you're going to need them most, and pregnancy complica- tions. If you're not exercising yet, start with leisurely short walks , then gradually increase your speed and walking time. 4. USING HOME CLEANING PRODUCTS Try to avoid using bleach and other strong chemicals or use them only in well-ventilated areas, says Ted Schettler, M.D., science director of the Science and Environmental Health Network and co-author of In Harm's Way: Toxic Threats to Child Development . The same is true for home improvement projects like painting or refinishing. Find nontoxic alternatives whenever possible, and forgo air fresheners, pesticides and lawn chemicals entirely.

DEVELOPING GESTATIONAL DIABETES About 6 to 8 percent of pregnant women develop gestational diabetes , which can raise the risk of serious pregnancy complications, and the numbers are growing. Plus, new research is showing that even expectant moms with borderline gestational diabetes—elevated blood sugar levels that are below the current cutoff point—have an increased risk of complications like preeclampsia, preterm delivery, having a too-large baby and needing a C-section. Exercise regularly, watch your sugar intake and cut back if you've been diagnosed or told your blood sugar is elevated.            Your Account Newsletter Sweepstakes Log in Join now!

It usually happens in the first trimester.  Unfortunately, between 10 and 25 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage.  You may have heard of couples waiting to announce a pregnancy until the risk of having a miscarriage is lower. The further you are into the pregnancy, the less likely you are to miscarry.  Read on for a breakdown of what causes miscarriages. The risk decreases as the pregnancy progresses.  Causes  Dr. Kaylen Silverberg, Texas-based fertility specialist, says miscarriages are very common.  “Women think that when they have one miscarriage, they are doomed to miscarry again,” he says.  But it turns out that your risk isn’t any greater after a miscarriage. Even after two miscarriages, the risk of miscarrying again doesn’t increase.  He says most medical professionals don’t evaluate a woman until she’s had three miscarriages. But there are fertility experts who will do an examination after two.  Here are the five most common miscarriage causes.  Genetics  When the sperm and egg meet, the cells come together. They then begin to divide to start forming the genetic material that makes up a person.  Each of us is supposed to have 46 total chromosomes. That’s 23 from one parent and 23 from the other. If something goes wrong when the cells are dividing, a chromosome may be missing or repeated.  According to Dr. Silverberg, 90 percent of all first trimester miscarriages are because of chromosomal abnormalities.  Infections  Uterus or cervix infections can be dangerous to a developing baby and lead to miscarriage.  Some of these infections include:  chlamydia gonorrhea mycoplasma ureaplasma  Anatomic Problems  This refers to defects of the uterus cavity. If the woman’s uterus didn’t form correctly when she was developing, it may be unable to support a healthy pregnancy.  Clotting Disorders  Clotting disorders are conditions that cause your body to form more blood clots than normal. Examples include lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid syndrome.  In the case of pregnancy, blood clots can form in the placenta. This prevents nutrition and oxygen from getting to the baby-to-be, and prevents waste from being carried away.  Progesterone Deficiency  In luteal phase deficiency or progesterone deficiency, the body isn’t producing enough progesterone. This is the hormone that plays a big part during pregnancy.  Risk Rates  The first trimester of pregnancy is considered weeks 0 to 13. About 80 percent of miscarriages happen in the first trimester.  Weeks 0 to 7  These weeks mark the highest risk. A woman can have a miscarriage in the first week or two without even realizing she’s pregnant. She might think it’s a late period.  Age plays a role in a woman’s risk factor. Here is the miscarriage risk breakdown by age:  Women age 20 to 30: 9 to 17 percent Women age 35 to 39: 20 percent Women age 40 to 44: 40 percent Women age 45 and older: 80 percent  Weeks 7 to 12  Once a pregnancy makes it to 7 weeks with a heartbeat, the risk of having a miscarriage drops to 10 percent.  Weeks 12 to 20  By week 12, the risk may fall to 5 percent. But keep in mind that it doesn’t really go below that because complications can happen during pregnancy.  Signs and Symptoms  The most common signs of a miscarriage are bleeding and cramping that are felt in the abdomen or lower back.  Some women have spotting (light bleeding) during pregnancy. A few drops or light flow of brown or dark red doesn’t necessarily mean trouble. But call the doctor right away if you see bright red blood, particularly in large amounts. Cramping can also happen in normal pregnancies.  Prevention  The majority of miscarriages are the result of genetic abnormalities or other health factors that are beyond our control. For that reason, there isn’t a whole lot you can do for prevention.  The best thing you can do is to keep yourself as healthy as possible before trying to conceive and throughout your pregnancy. Here are some tips to staying healthy during pregnancy:  eat a well-balanced diet exercise regularly avoid alcohol and cigarette smoking avoid caffeine get regular prenatal visits  If you’re worried, you might want to try genetic testing before trying to conceive. Blood is taken from both partners. It’s sent to a laboratory to be evaluated for major genetic disorders.  The Takeaway  It’s important to remember if you have a miscarriage, it’s not your fault. The experience can be physically and emotionally painful. Talk to trusted friends and family, and ask for help when you need it.  Your doctor may be able to recommend a support group or therapist in your area. There are also many online organizations and support groups like March of Dimes that offer a safe place to share your story and grieve with others.

Miscarriage Statistics by Week And What Affects Your Risk of Miscarriage  Getting Pregnant , Pregnancy Facts , Resources Pin 695 Share 159 Tweet 1 Email After 6 months of trying, we finally conceived, only to miscarriage in the fifth week of pregnancy. This was followed by a long and emotionally exhausting period of keeping track of ovulation , timing the lovemaking, BBT charting and hoping. It took another 9 months before we finally conceived again. I know that this is nothing compared to what many other couples go through, but it was still very tough. When I finally got pregnant again, I became very worried that I would have another miscarriage . I don’t know how many hours I spent on the Internet looking for miscarriage statistics by week of pregnancy . When I experienced bleeding in week 8 of my pregnancy , I panicked. I called my midwife (I had my first prenatal visit scheduled a couple of weeks later) and she asked me to come in for an early ultrasound. I did and I got to see what was going to be my daughter some months later. I saw her little heart beating and I saw the little embryo moving around. It was a fantastic feeling. This little peek inside my womb helped me stop worrying somewhat, but I did continue counting the days until week 12 had passed. I also read and learned quite a bit about miscarriage. If you are feeling anxious like I did, I’d like to help you save a few hours. I have gathered and compiled the most recent miscarriage statistics that I’ve been able to find. At the bottom of the page, you’ll find references to research as well, in case you want to dig deeper. If you are very worried about having a miscarriage, or if you already have had one, you can at least take some comfort in that the newest research shows that there is no need to wait 6 months before trying again. You can start trying again almost immediately. You can read about this in this article about getting pregnant after miscarriage . At the bottom of that article, several moms and dads who have been through a miscarriage share their thoughts and feelings about it. Now to the statistics! Miscarriage Risk By Week And What The Figures Tell You The Stats From Week 3 And On Gestational week (completed) All healthy women Healthy women, one live embryo seen on ultrasound % risk of miscarriage % risk of miscarriage 3-4 weeks 22-75% n/a 5-8 weeks 10% n/a 6 weeks n/a 9.4% 7 weeks n/a 4.2% 8 weeks n/a 1.5% 9 weeks n/a 0.5% 10 weeks n/a 0.7% 8-14 weeks 5% n/a 2nd trimester 3% n/a 3rd trimester 1% n/a References: Tong S, Kaur A, Walker SP, Bryant V, Onwude JL, Permezel M. Miscarriage risk for asymptomatic women after a normal first-trimester prenatal visit. Obstet Gynecol. 2008 Mar;111(3):710-4. Wilcox AJ, Weinberg CR, O’Connor JF, et al. Incidence of early loss of pregnancy. N Engl J Med. Jul 28 1988;319(4):189-94. http://pregnancyloss.info/statistics/ The Early High Percentage of Miscarriage and What It Means According to these figures, the risk of miscarriage right after conception is very high, between 22% and 75%. This wide range reflects that different studies have found different rates of miscarriage. It also reflects – and this is important – that the studies claiming up to a 75% risk of miscarriage include failed implantation . That is, your egg might very well have been fertilized, but one reason or the other, it never implanted properly. Views certainly vary if this should even be called a miscarriage. These very early miscarriages are same times referred to as chemical pregnancies , as in producing the pregnancy hormones, but not being viable pregnancies that could ever go full-term. I guess my first pregnancy (and miscarriage) was a textbook example of a chemical pregnancy. Most women probably won’t even know that they were pregnant, but I knew since we actively tried to conceive and I was tracking my basal body temperature very closely. If I were you, I would not fret too much over the terrible statistics for the first few weeks. The data is highly uncertain and if you do miscarriage, chances are you won’t even know that you were (chemically) pregnant and it is likely that the miscarriage was due to chromosomal abnormalities that make your body stop the pregnancy. Miscarraige Statistics After Pregnancy Has Been Confirmed Instead, focus on miscarriage risks after your pregnancy has been confirmed with a test. As you can see, the risk really falls quickly, and especially so if a live embryo has been seen on ultrasound. An embryo that is alive in week 9 is highly likely to become a baby! And even without knowing if the embryo is alive or not, you can rest assured that the likelihood that your baby is healthy and growing is increasing quickly day by day without a bleeding. How the number of miscarriages and age affect miscarriage risk Miscarrariage statistics for recurrent miscarraiges The miscarriage statistics above all refer to a woman’s first miscarriage . How about the next one? And the next? Recurrent miscarriages are defined as having 3 or more consecutive miscarriages. Only around 1% of all couples will have to endure this, while as many as 20-30 % of all women will knowingly experience a miscarriage (or even up to 75%, but without knowing, as seen in the table above.) Out of the 1% of recurring miscarriages, 50% go unexplained. Studies have also shown that the chances of having a successful pregnancy are about the same after the second and third miscarriage, but after that, the chances go down. It is still of course entirely possible, but after three miscarriages, couples are usually offered an examination to try to explain the miscarriages and possibly offer medication or other help. Miscarriage statistics by age Another factor that has been shown to affect the risk of miscarriage is the age of the parents-to-be . The woman’s age is the most obvious here since there will come a time when her eggs simply can’t be fertilized anymore. But the man’s age actually plays a part too. For a woman, the risk of miscarriage increases dramatically after age 37, with the steepest increase occurring after age 40. By age 45, less than 20% of all recognized pregnancies are viable. The graph below is from a U.S. study of pregnancies conceived via IVF. The risk of miscarriage is a bit lower per age group in this study than some other similar studies – probably because the stats are derived from women who successfully manage to become pregnant through IVF. Not all women who undergo IVF have a successful egg retrieval. The embryos that are transferred to the woman’s womb are chosen because they appear to develop normally and hence the risk of miscarriage for these embryos is a bit lower.  References:Slama et al., 2005. Influence of Paternal Age on the Risk of Spontaneous Abortion. American Journal of Epidemiology The man’s age matters too. If the dad-to-be is over 40 years old, the chances of miscarriage raise significantly. Studies indicate some 25-50% increase in the risk of miscarriage as dad is approaching 40 years old. This all seems pretty dark is you are an “older” couple trying to conceive. Older as in approaching 35 years or older. However, it is not all dark. Once a fetal heartbeat has been confirmed, the risk of miscarriage is much more hopeful! Maternal age Miscarriage risk in week 12 35-37 2.8% 37-39 7.5% 40+ 10.8% References: Spontaneous abortion rate and advanced maternal age: consequences for prenatal diagnosis, The Lancet, Volume 336, Issue 8706, 7 July 1990, Pages 27-29  Other Factors that affects Pregnancy Outcome Has this been a lot to digest? I bet! And to make the situation even more complicated, there are of course other factors than luck, age and earlier miscarriages that will affect your pregnancy outcome. Gladly, many of these factors are within your control . Here are some factors that may increase your risk of miscarriage : Smoking Being underweight before pregnancy High alcohol consumption Severe stress (increasing risk with the number of stressful or traumatic events) and changing partner (which can be quite stressful too!) . And controllable factors that reduce your risk of miscarriage : Vitamin supplementation Eating fresh fruits and vegetables daily Trying to arrange your life so you feel well enough to fly or have sex (Yes really!) Conclusion So what is the conclusion of all this? Miscarriages happen whether we worry or not. Most of the time, they don’t. Trying to let go of the worrying will make your life in early pregnancy happier and may even actually reduce the risk of miscarriage a little bit.  (I know, A LOT easier said than done..!) If you are very worried, ask for an early ultrasound scan . If you can hold out until the 8th week of pregnancy, a live embryo and no bleeding mean that the risk of miscarriage is down to 1.5% if you are younger than 35 years! I don’t have a figure to present for those older than 35 years, but a live embryo is likely to cut your risks very sharply too. Remember that by the time you have a positive pregnancy test , the highest risk of miscarriage is already behind you. Isn’t that great to know? Also, unless you are experiencing bleeding, the risk is already down to below 10% at around the seventh week of pregnancy. Don’t smoke, eat healthy foods, and try to focus on the positive aspects of life. I hope you found this information on miscarriage statistics useful.

I've noticed that no matter how many times I look up miscarriages rates, I walk away feeling only slightly better (at best). I'm the kind of person who finds reassurance in statistics, but for some reason, all of the existing posts weren't doing it for me. And then I realized why: articles on miscarriage focus on the chances you're going to miscarry and all the comments share miscarriage stories--they don't focus on how many people DON'T have miscarriages and go on to have happy, healthy babies! I adapted this week-by-week chart and modified it so that it would focus on the positive rather than the negative! Since I found the positive spin benefiting my peace of mind, I thought it might benefit some of you too. By the way, anyone in this January 2016 club already has a better chance of NOT having a miscarriage than having one... The numbers are on your side!

This is my first baby and I'm almost 40, so very, very nervous and half the things I read just make me more nervous. These positive statistics lessen my worry greatly! Again, thank you.

So you have a 97% chance of having no problems this time around! Statistically, you're in even better shape than the chart above.

When pregnancies miscarry it’s almost always because the embryo is defective; not because the mother went clubbing, had sex, didn’t sleep, drank alcohol, went mountaineering, ate a dodgy prawn, or had ambivalent feelings about motherhood. If these things increased the chances of miscarriage, then the world’s population would be much smaller! The fact that babies get born in war zones to women suffering enormous stress and poor nutrition proves that healthy foetuses are pretty resilient and not bothered by bumps, bangs, bad food or mother’s dark state of mind. Miscarriage risk statistics It is more common than many people think, with a large number of women having at least one miscarriage .  Many women miscarry more than once. Considering the frequency of it, about 1 in 36 women will have 2 miscarriages due to nothing more than chance. The chance of it happening decreases as pregnancy progresses. It is thought that as many as half of all pregnancies miscarry before the fertilised egg even implants in the womb. Early after implantation, and before a pregnancy is clinically recognised, around 30% will miscarry. After a pregnancy can be clinically recognised, which is between days 35 – 50, around a quarter of pregnancies will end in miscarriage. However, chance of it happening, decreases dramatically after week 8. Many people wonder if their chances of losing a baby goes up if they’ve already lost a pregnancy. There are many opinions about this, but a Recurrent Miscarriage clinic in London did a study that found miscarriage danger does relate to pregnancy history:  First pregnancy	5%  Last pregnancy terminated 6%  Last pregnancy a live birth 5%  All pregnancies live births 4%  1 previous miscarriage	20%  2 previous miscarriages	28%  3 previous miscarriages	43%  Miscarriage risk factors Aside from nature taking its course and miscarrying a defective foetus, there are other factors that may increase miscarriage danger. Some of these danger factors, such as smoking, can be avoided. Others factors such as diabetes can be controlled and managed to help reduce the danger to pregnancy.  Smoking is believed to increase the chances of not carrying your baby to term by 30 – 50%. So if you’re planning to conceive or are pregnant already, you and your partner now have the perfect incentive to give up the ciggies. Moreover, if you were worried you’d put on weight if you gave up smoking, now it won’t matter so much. Also, as well as reducing your chances of  miscarriage, your lung capacity and efficiency will improve which will become increasingly important as your growing womb pushes up against your lungs.  Coffee is thought to increase the danger of miscarriage if you drink more than four cups a day. Although there isn’t conclusive scientific proof as yet, it would be wise to be on the safe side and switch to herbal teas or hot chocolate.  Age is a factor. Teenagers are more likely to miscarry, as are older women because there’s a greater chance of chromosomal defects.  Some chronic diseases or disorders, including poorly controlled diabetes, certain inherited bloody clotting disorder, certain autoimmune disorders such as Lupus, and certain hormonal disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome can increase the odds of miscarriage. But on a positive note, many of these conditions can be treated or at least managed. For example, if you have a blood-clotting disorder, anticlotting medication may cut your chances of miscarriage by as much as 75%.  Certain infections carry a somewhat higher menace to your baby. They include listeria, mumps, rubella, measles, HIV and gonorrhoea. Your antenatal care should include tests for infections.  If dangerous infections are detected, your doctor or obstetrician will recommend a course of treatment.  Abnormalities of the uterus or cervix increase your danger, including a weak or short cervix.  Some abnormalities are fixable. For example, if a weak cervix has caused a previous miscarriage, a stitch applied at the end of the first trimester in your next pregnancy can stop your cervix from opening early and starting premature labour.  Exposure to toxins might increase your danger, including lead, arsenic, some chemicals, and large doses of radiation or anaesthetic gases  Alcohol consumption is thought by some but not all doctors to increase the chances of miscarriage. Alcohol certainly damages unborn babies so it’s best to give it a miss while you are pregnant and breastfeeding.  Father’s health and age may contribute to miscarriage risk. Father’s age is now believed to be almost as significant as the mother’s, with miscarriage risk increasing with father’s age. Some studies have found that the danger of miscarriage also increases if the father has been exposed to mercury, lead and some industrial chemicals and pesticides.  Hormone imbalance, such as low progesterone during pregnancy can keep the uterus from nourishing the embryo. This can be diagnosed and treated.  Amniocentesis and CSV tests for chromosomal disorders also tend to slightly increase the chances of miscarriage. Amniocentesis carries a 0.5 to 1 percent miscarriage risk within 3 weeks of the test. CVS (chorionic villus sampling) – carries a 1 – 2 per cent risk of causing miscarriage.  Miscarriage risk myths and claims There are lots of myths and bogus claims about miscarriage risk, many of which were used to explain the mysteries of pregnancy before science came up with the truth. From the dark age’s right up to the present day, women have been made to feel guilt, shame and blame for miscarriages. Even though we now know that miscarriage is usually nature stopping the development of a faulty foetus, or due to an often fixable anatomical problem or health condition, women still ask their doctors, “What did I do wrong?” Here are some common myths and claims explained or debunked:  Stress or working too hard. Many women are stressed when they’re pregnant yet go on to have healthy babies. However, recent research suggests stress may be a factor for women who have had multiple miscarriages.  Lifting heavy things such as small children. Pregnant women have always carried an older child on their hip. It’s thought you can safely lift up to 8 or 9 kg without any danger.  And you are likely to automatically drop a heavy item before any harm could occur.  Drinking alcohol. A foetus receives so little of its mother’s blood for the first few weeks of pregnancy that alcohol consumption is not considered a danger in the early stages. Yet women continue to torture themselves over those glasses of wine or tequila shots they enjoyed before they knew they were pregnant. But continuing to drink when you know you’re pregnant is asking for trouble as alcohol can cause Foetal Alcohol Syndrome.  Bad eating habits. Although a shortage of folic acid can cause neural tube defects such as spina bifida, forgetting to take your vitamins or chowing down on a fast food burger won’t generally harm your baby but it will affect you. The baby will take what it needs from your body and you will feel any shortfalls in vitamins and minerals.  Falling over or a blow to the stomach. Baby is cushioned by amniotic fluid so is unlikely to be hurt, especially in the first trimester. However, you should always see a doctor if you are hurt, especially in the second or third trimester as a trauma could cause the placenta to detach and potentially lead to late pregnancy loss. If the blow is domestic abuse, seek immediate help and protection.  Sex does not hurt an unborn baby, although it can be uncomfortable for you in some positions. Don’t be alarmed if there is some blood spotting afterwards. This spotting occurs because the cervix is very soft and its blood vessels are prominent and close to the surface during pregnancy. Unless your doctor advises otherwise (which may be the case if you’ve had recurrent miscarriages or have a condition called placenta previa), there’s no need to move into the spare room.  Exercise. Keeping up your fitness or starting a gentle exercise regimen has big benefits for your health and your baby’s during pregnancy.  It’s thought that as long as you don’t raise your heart rate above 140bpm or overdo intensely physical activities such as martial arts, exercise is not generally a miscarriage risk.  Bad moods or negative feelings about the baby. No matter how dark your thoughts, there’s no way your baby can read them or react to them!  Previous elective abortions. Evidence is mixed on this one. Some studies claim a slight increased risk, while other research identifies no increased chances of miscarriage.  Birth control pills can cause miscarriage.  There is no evidence that taking the pill will cause a miscarriage in an established pregnancy or that taking the pill will increase your future miscarriage risk.  Aspirin increases miscarriage risk. There is some evidence that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can increase the danger but the evidence is mixed. Moreover, low doses of aspirin are sometimes prescribed as part of recurrent miscarriage treatment.  Hot baths or saunas could cause your body temperature to get too high and possibly cause developmental problems but there is no convincing evidence that a long soak in the tub increases the chances of miscarriage. However, some doctors advise pregnant women to steer clear of saunas, just to be on the safe side.
