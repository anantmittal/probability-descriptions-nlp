August is one of those months, making the probability 1/12, or 0.083. If you wanted to be more precise, you would say that there are a different number of days in each month which would mean that you have a slightly greater chance of being born in August than in, say, February. In that case, you would say 365 days in a year, and 31 days in August. Your probability would be 31/365 which is 0.085 (2d.p.). So you can see that although this probability is slightly higher, it doesn't make a whole lot of difference. I hope that helps.

My approach would be as follows:  $$\left( 1- \left(\frac{364}{365} \right)^N \right) \cdot \left(1-\left(\frac{K-1}{K} \right)^N \right)$$  But I'm not really sure that this is the correct answer :)    probability  combinatorics     share | cite | improve this question      edited Jul 4 '12 at 8:23       Alex Becker   47.3k 5 92 154        asked Jul 4 '12 at 8:04       bluehallu   118 8                  How do you take into account leap (bissextile) years ? ‚Äì wap26  Jul 4 '12 at 8:31            I don't, just assume we were all born on a normal year :) ‚Äì bluehallu  Jul 4 '12 at 8:34            Your expression is the probability that someone was born on the same day as you, and that someone (not necessarily the same person) was born in the same hospital as you.

$$\frac{1}{365}\cdot\frac{1}{K}=\frac{1}{365K}.$$
So the probability the person was born on a different day or a different hospital than you is 
$$1-\frac{1}{365K}.$$
The probability that all $N$ were born on a different day or different hospital than you is 
$$\left(1-\frac{1}{365K}\right)^N.$$
So the probability that at least one person "double matches" with you is
$$1-\left(1-\frac{1}{365K}\right)^N.$$  Remark: This is exactly the same reasoning as the pure days problem, except that we now have $365K$ abstract "days."     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jul 4 '12 at 8:49             answered Jul 4 '12 at 8:43       Andr√© Nicolas   442k 35 401 779                  +1 Your answer, as always, is crystal clear. ‚Äì Ravi  Aug 6 '12 at 4:37         1      @FortuonPaendrag: Thank you.

For 3 people, the complementary event includes "all birthdays distinct", "one pair and the rest distinct", "two pairs and the rest distinct", etc. To find the exact value is pretty complicated.  The Poisson approximation is pretty good, though. Imagine checking every triple and calling it a "success" if all three have the same birthdays. The total number of successes is approximately Poisson with mean value ${30 \choose 3}/365^2$. Here $30\choose 3$ is the number of triples, and $1/365^2$ is the chance that any particular triple is a success.
The probability of getting at least one success is obtained from the Poisson distribution:
$$ P(\mbox{ at least one triple birthday with 30 people})\approx 1-\exp(-{30 \choose 3}/365^2)=.0300. $$  You can modify this formula for other values, changing either 30 or 3. For instance, 
$$ P(\mbox{ at least one triple birthday with 100 people})\approx 1-\exp(-{100 \choose 3}/365^2)=.7029,$$
$$ P(\mbox{ at least one double birthday with 25 people })\approx 1-\exp(-{25 \choose 2}/365)=.5604.$$  Poisson approximation is very useful in probability, not only for birthday problems!     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 9 '11 at 1:52      user940              1      " and 1/365^2 is the chance that any particular triple is a success." - Hmm, I don't understand that part.

Multiplying these gives 1/365^2. ‚Äì user940  Mar 9 '11 at 16:25            Ah, that makes sense!

This paper claims that if $W$ is the number of triplets of people having the same birthday, $m$ is the number of days in the year, and $n$ is the number of people, then  $$ P(W \ge 1) = 1 - \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} {m! n! \over i! (n-2i)! (m-n+i)! 2^i m^n} $$  No derivation or source is given; I think the idea is that the term corresponding to $i$ is the probability that there are $i$ birthdays shared by 2 people each and $n-2i$ birthdays with one person each.  In particular, if $m = 365, n = 30$ this formula gives $0.0285$, not far from Byron's approximation.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 9 '11 at 2:06       Michael Lugo   17.1k 3 32 73              2      Here is a good approximation based on two Poissons - one that overcounts and one that undercounts: $$P(W=0)=\frac 1 2\left(\exp\left(-T\right)+\exp\left(-\frac T{1+\frac{3(n-3)}{2m}} \right)\right)$$ where $T=(\frac 1 m)^2\binom n 3$ is expected number of triplets sharing a birthday and the second exponent is expected number of birth-days that are shared by at least $3$ people. The principle of  averaging probabilities of $P(T)$ and $P(T/(1+\alpha))$ can be extended to other events, not just $W=0$. Yields $\approx 0.028537$ in this case. Change $3$ to $M$ for $M-plets$ of birthdays. ‚Äì A.S.  Dec 13 '15 at 16:54         add a comment |             up vote  8  down vote      Since this question has been linked to a question concerning the generalization to the case of $M$ people having the same birthday ( Birthday paradox with M shared birthdays ), I would like to add the general answer. Starting with the expression given by Michael Lugo (a derivation can be found here ), it's rather easy to obtain the general solution. First, the expression can be simplified by using falling factorials:  \begin{equation}
 \displaystyle P(W\ge1) = 1 - \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \frac{(n)_{2i}(m)_{n-i}}{i! 2^i m^n}
\end{equation}  where $(n)_k := n\cdot(n-1)\cdot\ldots\cdot(n-k+1)$. The $i$th term in the sum represents the probability of having $i$ distinct pairs of people.  To generalize this result we note that the number 2 is just the size of a pair and can be replaced by any larger group size. However, we must be careful, since the $2^i$ in the denominator is really $(2!)^i$ (see the derivation for details).  Thus, if we want to know the probability that at least $M$ people from a group of $n$ share a common birthday, we sum over all group sizes smaller than $M$, replacing $2i$ in the numerator by $ki$ (where $k$ is the summation index) and $2^i$ in the denominator by $(k!)^i$:  \begin{equation}
 \displaystyle P(W\ge1) = 1 - \sum_{k=2}^{M-1}\sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor n/k \rfloor} \frac{(n)_{ki}(m)_{n-i}}{i! (k!)^i m^n}
\end{equation}     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:20       Community ‚ô¶   1        answered Dec 10 '13 at 23:00       Trazom   89 1 2              add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      As being pointed out by Micheal Lugo the formulation given by Anirban DasGupta is a exact answer for this problem, however a formal proof is needed. I have found and verified a solution by Doctor Rick from Math Forum, below is the link  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56650.html  His approach is to partition the sample space as following:  1.   none share a birthday
   2.   one pair shares a birthday
   3.   two pairs share different birthdays
   4.   three pairs share different birthdays
   :
 1+N/2. N/2 pairs share different birthdays
 2+N/2. three or more share a birthday  Then he points out a clever way to count for each partition by picking different birthday for each pair of person. I have tried and arrived with the same formulation as Anirban DasGupta's.

Here is a formula that works.  It probably helps to explain Dasgupta's formula from Michael Lugo's answer first.  Say that a map $f : [m]\to [n]$ is $k$-almost injective if $|f^{-1}(j)|\le k$ for all $j\in [n]$.  Counting injective maps is easy, there are  $$
I(1,m,n) := m!\binom{n}{m}
$$  of them.  You just pick the range and then a bijection to it.  This gives right away the standard birthday collision probability for $m$ people and years of length $n$  $$
1 - n^{-m}I(1,m,n)
$$  One gets the generalized birthday probability from $I(k,m,n)$ in the same way, so we can just think about $I(k,m,n)$.  How would we go about counting $2$-injective maps?  The same idea as before works.  This time, we pick $c$ pairs that will have colliding images, injectively map these into $[n]$, then injectively map the rest to a set of size $n-c$.  So we get  $$
I(2,m,n) = \sum_{c=0}^{\lfloor m/2\rfloor}\frac{1}{c!}
         \left(\prod_{j=0}^{c-1}\binom{m - 2j}{2}\right)
         I(1,c,n)I(1,m-2c,n-c)
$$  This is equivalent to Dasgupta's formula, but it is easier to see the induction.  If we want to get $I(k,m,n)$ in general, we have  $$
I(k,m,n) = \sum_{c=0}^{\lfloor m/k\rfloor}\frac{1}{c!}
         \left(\prod_{j=0}^{c-1}\binom{m - kj}{k}\right)
         I(1,c,n)I(k-1,m-kc,n-c)

Supposing I want to solve in a group of 100 people. what is the probability that at least 3 people share a birthday. So I start from very basic - if there are 3 people, the probability of them sharing a birthday is $$\frac{1}{365} *\frac{1}{365}*\frac{1}{365}*(365)=\frac{1}{(365)^2}$$ 1/365 the prob. of 1 person having a birthday on a particular day multiplied by each person's probability multiplied by the total no. of days. Similarly if there are 4 people, the probability of at least 3 of them sharing a birthday would be $\frac{1}{(365)^2}*^4C_3 $. and similarly for x people, $\frac{1}{(365)^2}*^XC_3 $  I am trying to find the fault in this logic.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Apr 8 '16 at 18:39       yavvee   1              1      Welcome to Math.SE!

The chance that three people are born on the same day of the week is indeed $\frac{1}{7^2}$,  but the chance that three out of eight people share a day of week for birth cannot be $\frac{\binom{8}{3}}{7^2}$ because that exceeds $1$. ‚Äì hardmath  Apr 10 '16 at 0:22         add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Let me give you a simple answer first and two deep answers next. Simple answer is, assuming that all months have the same number of days (which is very approximately true), 1/12. If you want a slightly deeper answer, then 31/365 or 31/366 is correct, depending upon whether the year is a normal year or a leap year. The correct answer, which might be argued as "philosophical", is as follows: The Gregorian calender, the current standard calender in most of the world, adds a 29th day to February, 97 years out of 400, a closer approximation than once every four years.  This would be implemented by making a leap year every year divisible by 4 unless that year is divisible by 100.  If it is divisible by 100 it would only be a leap year if that year was also divisible by 400.So, in the last millennium, 1600 and 2000 were leap years, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not.  In this millennium, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600, 2700, 2900 and 3000 will not be leap years, but 2400 and 2800 will be.  The years that are divisible by 100 but not 400 are known as "exceptional common years".  By this rule, the average number of days per year will be 365 + 1/4 - 1/100 + 1/400 = 365.2425.In 400 years, thereforethere are 303 normal years and97 leap yearsTotal number of days in 303 years110,595 days(normal years)Total number of days in 97 years35,502 days(leap years)Total number of days146,097 daysTotal number of August months400(in 400 years)Total number of days in August in12,400400 yearsProbability that a person is 0.084875 or 1 in 11.78202 born in August (=12,400 / 146,097) or 31 in 365.2425 1 / 12 = 0.083333 31 / 365 =0.08493231 / 366 =0.084699 There are assumptions in the above answer as well. These are 1. That all days in a year have the equal probability (which is not strictly true, as records of births will be required for verification) 2. The Gregorian calender has been in effect since 1700s. The probability as above will only work for years after the introduction of Gregorian calender.   3 people  found this useful                       Katyharrison  1 Contribution      Who was born on August ninth 1968?

Eric Bana the actor is born on the 9th August 1968, (starred in The Other Boleyn Girl and currently starring in The Time Travellers Wife). 
Hope this helps               MishTheFish  139 Contributions      What is the probability of being dealt a Blackjack?  When the deck is full, this probability is 4/52 (the probability of getting one of 4 aces) times 16/51 (the probability of getting one of 16 kings, queens, jacks, or tens) times 2 (the number of orders in which you could get these cards: ace first, or ace second). \n. 
\nThis comes out to 32/663, or about 4.83%. \n. 
\nOf course, this probability changes as the game progresses: it decreases when any of the tens, jacks, queens, kings, or aces get discarded, but increases when other cards get discarded. This change is unpredictable, but its expected value is 0; this is a complicated concept to explain, but it means that on average, the probability will go up as much as it goes down.\n. 
\nAlso, the probability is still 32/663 at any point in the game if you have no information whatsoever about what cards came up before: if you forgot every card you saw, or if you just joined the game.

The NFL has a 'rating' system for injured players that specifies their probability of playing in a game:. 
1) Out - the player will not play   2) Doubtful - 75% chance the player will not play   3) Questionable - 50-50 chance the player will play   4) Probable - 75% chance the player WILL play            What is the probability of two healthy people where one is a carrier being parents to a child born with cystic fibrosis?  If only one person is a carrier of cystic fibrosis than there is no chance of having a child with it. Both parents have to be carriers and even then there is only a 25% chance. If only one carries than there is a 50% chance that their children will carry but will not have cystic fibrosis.

Squirrel Man  234,785 Contributions      What is the probability of being killed by a Pop Tart?  Very low, and for a number of reasons.    If a Pop Tart were to be traveling towards your head, the Pop Tart would have to be going at least 173 mph to break your neck, subsequently being killed. Pop Tarts usually do not travel that fast.    A flying Pop Tart that came directly at any other parts would still result in a very unlikely death, since the rib cage holds the most important organs, and is thus very strong (much stronger than the human neck).    To die from choking on a Pop Tart is also extremely unlikely, because 4,600 deaths occur in the United States out of a population of 307 million people. This is only in the United States; the percentage of choking alone is bigger for the entire world. The 4,600 deaths from choking were also mostly younger kids and infants from small parts, and not from food (which makes it very unlikely for the choking culprit to be a Pop Tart).    Thus, the probability of being killed by a Pop Tart is lower than a calculable percentage due to the vast assortment of things that happen in the world. It is  way below  1%.            Probability of being divorced if your parents are divorced?  Well, my parents are divorced and I'm only 15... it was just 2 months ago... I mean yes, im still really pissed, sad, upset and frustrated...but..this kinda thing, actually makes me find the right person...not wait too long for him...(like mid-40's and stuff) but atleast in my 20's... I love my parents...but..ya know, when i heard that, i just had so many more problems in my life i just started to break down and cry. So, based on your beliefs and opinions (in my opinion) i think it pushes you more to find that one right person...               Anand Mehta  278,423 Contributions  mehtamatics = mathematics with a difference      What is The probability of being born on 1st of January?  Births are not distributed randomly across the year: there are seasonal variations as well as differences between days of the week. Where maternity staff like to celebrate New Year's Eve, there may be fewer people on duty on January 1 and so there may well be fewer births. Unfortunately, comprehensive information on such variations is not available.  If you assume that each day of the year is equally likely, the probability is 1/365. Adjusting for leap years changes that to 1/365.25. Further adjusting for Centuries gives 1/365.2425            What celebrities were born on August 5?  Celebrities born on August 5 include: Adam Irigoyen (Shake it Up) - born 1997 Olivia Holt (actress) - born 1997 Patrick Ewing (NBA star) - born 1962 Maureen "Marcia" McCormick (actress,  The Brady Bunch ) - born1956 Erika Slezak (soap actress, famous daughter) - born 1946 Loni Anderson (actress) - born 1945 John Saxon (actor) - born 1935  Historically, it was the birthday of: Joseph Merrick, the  Elephant Man  (1862-1890) John Huston, actor & director (1906-1987) Robert Taylor, actor (1911-1969) Terry Becker, actor  Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1921-2014) Neil Armstrong, first man to walk on the Moon (1930-2012)               Anand Mehta  278,423 Contributions  mehtamatics = mathematics with a difference      What is the probability of being killed by a hurricane?  Very close to 0.  The majority of the world's population does not live in hurricane zones and so for them the probability is 0. For the small part of the world's population who do live in the zone, the mortality rate is low and so the overall probability is extremely low.

The probability of two people's birthday being the same is actually more likely than many would think. The key thing is to note that it doesn't matter what the first person's birthday is. All we need to work out is the probability that the second person has a birthday on any specific day. This probability is 1/365.25  The probability that they were born on June 10th is 1/365.25. The probability that they were born on February 2nd is 1/365.25 and the probability that they were born on the same day as you is 1/365.25               Haider4711  2 Contributions      Which footballer is born on 19 august?

February 29 occurs 97 times in 400 years (not once in 4 years).Therefore, there are 97 favourable events out of 146,097 days whichgives a probability of 0.00066 approx.  However, this assumes that birthdays are randomly spread over thecourse of a year. This is certainly not true, and February is "lowseason" for births so the true probability will be lower.               Answers Publisher  49,340 Contributions      Who was born in August 29 1995?

There is no simple answer to the question because the children's genders are not independent events. They depend on the parents' ages and their genes. Unfortunately there is no readily available research into the genders of seven or more children to establish the experimental probability for such an outcome.    However, if you assume that they are independent events then, given that the probability of a girl is approx 0.48, then the probability of the seventh child being a girl is 0.48.

For a continuous variable it is 0.5 but for a discrete variable the answer depends on the probability of the variable taking the mean value. It is half of the rest of the probability.  If the discrete variable X has mean m and Prob(X = m) is p then Prob(X > m) = (1 - p)/2.           ASK A BRAND    What is the probability of being born in August?

Chart of Americans born over three decades shows greeting card stores are likely to be busiest in July, August and September  By Snejana Farberov    Published: 23:55 EDT, 8 June 2013 |  Updated: 06:23 EDT, 10 June 2013               e-mail           32  View comments     Americans born in the months of September and July share their date of birth with a great number of of their compatriots, but those who were welcomed into the world in January can have their special day all to themselves. According to a heat map created by Matt Stiles, a data journalist with the National Public Radio, September 16 is the single most common birthday for Americans between the ages of 14 and 40. On the other end of the spectrum, the least common date of birth, not surprisingly, is February 29, which comes every four years during a leap year.¬† The second least popular birthday falls on Christmas, December 25, followed by January 1.       Numbers game: According to a heat map created by Matt Stiles, a data journalist with the National Public Radio, September 16 is the single most common birthday for Americans between the ages of 14 and 40   Stiles created his map using data 
drawn from a chart that had been posted on the New York Times site in 
2006, which ranked every day of the year based on how many babies were 
born in the U.S. on that day between 1973 and 1999.  The darker colors on the heat map 
appearing on the site  The Daily Viz indicate the date has a lower-numbered birthday rank and the lighter 
colors a higher-numbered birthday rank.  For example, in the month of June, the
 majority of the days are ranked in the 100th and 200th range, with the 
most common birthday being June 30, ranked 75th on the chart.    RELATED ARTICLES   Previous  1  Next        Forget passwords - you could soon be unlocking your phone by...     Extra special delivery! Woman, 20, gives birth to two sets...       Share this article  Share     The NPR reporter explained that he was
 inspired to create the heat map visualizing the ranking chart after 
someone posted it on his Facebook page in honor of his birthday.  At the time, Stiles and his wife were expecting a baby, whose due date was September 24 ‚Äì the sixth most common date of birth.       Babies delivered on the most common day of the year, September 16, were likely conceived on December 24 - ranked the fourth least common birthday  The map shows that July 4 has a very 
low ranking, suggesting that would-be parents perhaps did not want their
 future child's birthday to clash with Independence Day festivities.  The 13th of every month also suffered from a shortage of birthdays. In this case, superstition may be to blame.  Stiles' design inspired Lane Harrison,
 from the site Codementum.org,  to create an interactive chart featuring 
both the birthday ranks and the estimated conception date ranks.  Harrison's table has revealed that a 
large number of babies born between 1973 and 1999 were conceived in the 
fall and winter, with January and February leading the pack.       What are the odds? In a group of 57 people there is 99 per cent chance that two of them share a birthday   Interesting, babies delivered on the 
most common day of the year, September 16, were likely conceived on 
December 24 - ranked the 363th most common birthday.  Given these numbers, Esther 
Inglis-Arkell, a blogger for the site io9 , calculated that if there are 23 people
 crowded in a room, there is a 50-per cent chance that two of them share
 a birthday.  To bring the probability to 99 per cent, the number of people in said room needs to be increased¬† to 57.

Email  Print   Share   Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Delicious Google+      Follow @TIMEBusiness       There‚Äôs been much research and writing over the years about the positive and negative affects of birth month on various aspects of life, few as well known as Malcolm Gladwell ‚Äòs 2008 bestseller Outliers: The Story of Success . Now comes word that having been born at certain times of the year might help or harm your chances of becoming a boss. (Which means, once again, that it‚Äôs all your parents fault if you fail!) First things first, for those unfamiliar with what is variously called the ‚Äúrelative-age effect,‚Äù ‚Äúbirth-date effect,‚Äù ‚Äúmonth of birth bias‚Äù or ‚Äúseason of birth bias‚Äù: The basic idea is that kids born just before the cutoff date for an academic year or sports age division are at a disadvantage because they can be nearly a full year younger than some of the other children in their group. As a result of being intellectually or physically less mature, the theory goes, such kids are less likely to excel from the outset, which makes it less likely that they‚Äôll get the particular kind of attention and feedback that tends to flow towards high achievers. Similarly, they‚Äôre less likely to be chosen for leadership roles, such as speaking at assemblies or captaining a team.  That brings us to a new study published in the December issue of the journal Economic Letters , co-authored by Qianqian Du of Shanghai Jiao Tang University in China , Huasheng Gao of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore , and Maurice D. Levi from the University of British Columbia‚Äôs Sauder School of Business . Knowing that most academic year cut-off dates fall between September 1 and January 1‚Äîthus making kids born in the summer months most likely to be the youngest in their classes‚Äîthe three researchers theorized that June and July babies would be less likely to grow up to become corporate CEOs, since those roles reflect a long journey of competition and achievement, which should be affected by the relative-age effect if it truly exists. (Outcomes for kids born in August, they speculated, would be affected by the decision of some parents to hold them back, making some the oldest in the next year‚Äôs class.)  To test their theory, the trio collected as much birth-date info as they could for the CEOs of S&P 500 companies between 1992 and 2009, eventually able to identify accurate birth days for 375 such suits. And wouldn‚Äôt you know it, their theory proved to be both true and statistically meaningful: After accounting for trends in U.S. births (more people are born in some months than others) and plain old randomness, the study authors found that the two months produced one quarter to one third fewer CEOs than you‚Äôd expect from a normal distribution of bosses across months. That is, although 8.16% of U.S. births happen in June, only 6.13% of CEOs were born in that month, while a mere 5.87% of CEOs were born in July, despite 8.75% of the U.S. population being born that month. Says Levi: ‚ÄúEarly success is often rewarded with leadership roles and enriched learning opportunities, leading to future advantages that are magnified throughout life.‚Äù  Or, as Gladwell puts it in Outliers ,‚ÄùIf you make a decision about who is good and who is not good at an early age; if you separate the ‚Äòtalented‚Äô from the ‚Äòuntalented‚Äô; and if you provide the ‚Äòtalented‚Äô with a superior experience, then you‚Äôre going to end up giving a huge advantage to that small group of people born closest to the cutoff date.‚Äù  All of which raises the question: If being born in June and July augurs poorly for your chances of landing in the corner office, what birth months are most likely to set you up for life as a big cheese? The answer suggests there‚Äôs something to the idea that the relative-age effect influences the ranks of CEOs. Four of the five months with the highest percentage of CEOs are within three months of at least some possible academic cut-off date from September 1 through December 31‚Äîmeaning children born in those months have a higher probability of being among the oldest in their class. The top 5 CEO-producing months are: March (12.53%), April (10.67%), November (10.67%), January (10.13%), October (9.87%).  Alas, this doesn‚Äôt tell us much about the race for America‚Äôs CEO. Mitt Romney , a March baby, was destined at birth for the corner office, and he fulfilled that destiny several times over. President Obama, born in August, was surely one of the youngest kids in the 1966-67 Noelani Elementary School kindergarten class, but he seems to have gotten the attention and feedback he needed to fulfill his leadership potential.

The speculation is that this is nature‚Äôs way of countering the relatively high mortality rates of males, and creating more of a gender balance in the population. While historically, there have been about 105 boys born for every 100 girls worldwide ‚Äî which creates a ‚Äúsex ratio at birth‚Äù of 1.05 ‚Äî the share of boy babies has increased in recent decades. 2011 data from the World Bank show the global sex ratio at birth is now 1.07, or 107 boys born for every 100 girls.  This increase in the sex ratio is driven largely by births in China, where sex ratios have declined slightly in recent years but remain the highest in the world. The world‚Äôs most populous country has 118 boys for every 100 girls, and accounts for 12% of births worldwide. However, disproportionately large shares of baby boys are found in other countries scattered throughout Asia and the Caucasus, as well. Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, South Korea, and the Solomon Islands round out the list of places with the highest sex ratios. India is tied with Macedonia, Montenegro, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Serbia and Suriname for 7th¬†place, with a ratio of 108 boys born for every 100 girls.  Even while some countries seem to have a disproportionate share of boys, others have particularly high shares of baby girls. While there are still slightly more boys born than girls in these places ‚Äî which are centered in sub-Saharan Africa ‚Äî the sex ratios are nonetheless much lower than average. The six countries with the lowest sex ratios include: Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Togo, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast, and Madagascar.  So what explains these differences in the shares of baby boys and girls?  Perhaps the best-known reason relates to the practice of sex-selective abortion , which has been identified in Asia, and in the Caucasus , as well. The ability to determine fetal sex, along with strong son preferences, accounts in large part for the high shares of boys in many countries in these regions. The desire to limit family size, either due to government regulations as in China, or due to global social and economic changes that have reduced the need for large families, seems to further contribute to sex-selective abortion and a dearth of baby girls.  But this is only one of myriad factors that may be affecting the sex ratio at birth. Some research suggests that the share of newborn boys declines with older parents , and that the high share of girls in Sub-Saharan Africa may be linked to the practice of polygamy (multiple wives). What do these two phenomena have in common? Researchers hypothesize that both situations are associated with less frequent intercourse . (For possible explanations of this association, see this article from the academic journal Human Reproduction .)  On the opposite end of the spectrum, most research shows that the share of baby boys increases during and after wartime . And once again, frequency of intercourse is cited as the likely reason, at least in the case of post-war reunions.  In some cases, though, wartime is associated with a higher share of girl babies. This may relate to the fact that heightened maternal stress , such as would occur during wartime, can lead to an increased likelihood of a miscarriage which is more likely to occur among male fetuses .  Further evidence of this association between maternal stress and the increased share of girl babies emerges from an analysis of births in the vicinity of the Kobe earthquake in Japan, which showed that the share of females born nine months after that event was significantly higher than would have been expected under normal circumstances.

What Are The Odds Of Being Born On A Leap Year? It's About As Rare As You'd Think By Claire Warner Feb 28 2016 As your Facebook feed has no doubt made you aware, Feb. 29 is just around the corner, and there's one thing on everyone's minds: What are the odds of being born on a leap year? Most people find leaplings, as they're called by local-interest pieces and adoring grandmothers, inexplicably fascinating out of a perception that leap year birthdays are incredibly rare. But popular opinion is rarely 100 percent correct (see: every myth about the menstrual cycle ever). Are your chances of being born on a leap year actually that low? For once, the general public has the right idea, because the odds of a leap year birthday are usually estimated to be one in 1,461 . The statistics behind the number are surprisingly simple: Four years is equal to 1,460 days, and the leap year rounds it up to 1,461. Assuming the odds of being born are the same for every day, your chances of being a leapling turn out to be one in 1,461. That being said, it's not that rare; for example, your odds of being struck by lightning during your lifetime are one in 3,000 , and your chances of becoming POTUS are one in 10,000,000. By comparison, being born on a leap year seems like no biggie. However, as the BBC points out, this may oversimplify things; it's well-known that human births vary based on season and location . A 2014 study found that peak birth months occur earlier in the year the further you get from the equator, and the Centers for Disease Control suggest that August is the most popular birth month in America. So in reality, your chances are probably a little less than the statistic cited above, but there's little specific research on the subject. Leap years are used as a way to reconcile the Earth's imperfect orbit with the Gregorian calendar used in most Western countries. Our calendar has 365 days, but the planet actually takes 365.24 days to go around the Sun. The disparity may not seem like much, but the extra time can (and did) build up over the course of centuries unless you account for it. When Julius Caesar came into power, the calendar was something of a mess, as the priesthood hadn't done a great job of keeping up with the convoluted system of the time. Caesar ordered the astronomer Sosigenes to create a new calendar, and he came up with 365-day system that tacked on an extra day every four years. This was later fine-tuned by Pope Gregorious XIII , and voila! You have the Gregorian calendar we still use today. If you were born on a leap year and find yourself so over all the "technically you're still a kid, har har!" jokes, you know who to blame. Thanks, Pope Gregorious XIII.

August is one of those months, making the probability 1/12, or 0.083. If you wanted to be more precise, you would say that there are a different number of days in each month which would mean that you have a slightly greater chance of being born in August than in, say, February. In that case, you would say 365 days in a year, and 31 days in August. Your probability would be 31/365 which is 0.085 (2d.p.). So you can see that although this probability is slightly higher, it doesn't make a whole lot of difference. I hope that helps.

My approach would be as follows:  $$\left( 1- \left(\frac{364}{365} \right)^N \right) \cdot \left(1-\left(\frac{K-1}{K} \right)^N \right)$$  But I'm not really sure that this is the correct answer :)    probability  combinatorics     share | cite | improve this question      edited Jul 4 '12 at 8:23       Alex Becker   47.3k 5 92 154        asked Jul 4 '12 at 8:04       bluehallu   118 8                  How do you take into account leap (bissextile) years ? ‚Äì wap26  Jul 4 '12 at 8:31            I don't, just assume we were all born on a normal year :) ‚Äì bluehallu  Jul 4 '12 at 8:34            Your expression is the probability that someone was born on the same day as you, and that someone (not necessarily the same person) was born in the same hospital as you.

$$\frac{1}{365}\cdot\frac{1}{K}=\frac{1}{365K}.$$
So the probability the person was born on a different day or a different hospital than you is 
$$1-\frac{1}{365K}.$$
The probability that all $N$ were born on a different day or different hospital than you is 
$$\left(1-\frac{1}{365K}\right)^N.$$
So the probability that at least one person "double matches" with you is
$$1-\left(1-\frac{1}{365K}\right)^N.$$  Remark: This is exactly the same reasoning as the pure days problem, except that we now have $365K$ abstract "days."     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jul 4 '12 at 8:49             answered Jul 4 '12 at 8:43       Andr√© Nicolas   442k 35 401 779                  +1 Your answer, as always, is crystal clear. ‚Äì Ravi  Aug 6 '12 at 4:37         1      @FortuonPaendrag: Thank you.

For 3 people, the complementary event includes "all birthdays distinct", "one pair and the rest distinct", "two pairs and the rest distinct", etc. To find the exact value is pretty complicated.  The Poisson approximation is pretty good, though. Imagine checking every triple and calling it a "success" if all three have the same birthdays. The total number of successes is approximately Poisson with mean value ${30 \choose 3}/365^2$. Here $30\choose 3$ is the number of triples, and $1/365^2$ is the chance that any particular triple is a success.
The probability of getting at least one success is obtained from the Poisson distribution:
$$ P(\mbox{ at least one triple birthday with 30 people})\approx 1-\exp(-{30 \choose 3}/365^2)=.0300. $$  You can modify this formula for other values, changing either 30 or 3. For instance, 
$$ P(\mbox{ at least one triple birthday with 100 people})\approx 1-\exp(-{100 \choose 3}/365^2)=.7029,$$
$$ P(\mbox{ at least one double birthday with 25 people })\approx 1-\exp(-{25 \choose 2}/365)=.5604.$$  Poisson approximation is very useful in probability, not only for birthday problems!     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 9 '11 at 1:52      user940              1      " and 1/365^2 is the chance that any particular triple is a success." - Hmm, I don't understand that part.

The chance that the second guy has the same birthday is 1/365, and the chance that the third guy has the same birthday is also 1/365. Multiplying these gives 1/365^2. ‚Äì user940  Mar 9 '11 at 16:25            Ah, that makes sense!

This paper claims that if $W$ is the number of triplets of people having the same birthday, $m$ is the number of days in the year, and $n$ is the number of people, then  $$ P(W \ge 1) = 1 - \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} {m! n! \over i! (n-2i)! (m-n+i)! 2^i m^n} $$  No derivation or source is given; I think the idea is that the term corresponding to $i$ is the probability that there are $i$ birthdays shared by 2 people each and $n-2i$ birthdays with one person each.  In particular, if $m = 365, n = 30$ this formula gives $0.0285$, not far from Byron's approximation.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 9 '11 at 2:06       Michael Lugo   17.1k 3 32 73              2      Here is a good approximation based on two Poissons - one that overcounts and one that undercounts: $$P(W=0)=\frac 1 2\left(\exp\left(-T\right)+\exp\left(-\frac T{1+\frac{3(n-3)}{2m}} \right)\right)$$ where $T=(\frac 1 m)^2\binom n 3$ is expected number of triplets sharing a birthday and the second exponent is expected number of birth-days that are shared by at least $3$ people. The principle of  averaging probabilities of $P(T)$ and $P(T/(1+\alpha))$ can be extended to other events, not just $W=0$. Yields $\approx 0.028537$ in this case. Change $3$ to $M$ for $M-plets$ of birthdays. ‚Äì A.S.  Dec 13 '15 at 16:54         add a comment |             up vote  8  down vote      Since this question has been linked to a question concerning the generalization to the case of $M$ people having the same birthday ( Birthday paradox with M shared birthdays ), I would like to add the general answer. Starting with the expression given by Michael Lugo (a derivation can be found here ), it's rather easy to obtain the general solution. First, the expression can be simplified by using falling factorials:  \begin{equation}
 \displaystyle P(W\ge1) = 1 - \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \frac{(n)_{2i}(m)_{n-i}}{i! 2^i m^n}
\end{equation}  where $(n)_k := n\cdot(n-1)\cdot\ldots\cdot(n-k+1)$. The $i$th term in the sum represents the probability of having $i$ distinct pairs of people.  To generalize this result we note that the number 2 is just the size of a pair and can be replaced by any larger group size. However, we must be careful, since the $2^i$ in the denominator is really $(2!)^i$ (see the derivation for details).  Thus, if we want to know the probability that at least $M$ people from a group of $n$ share a common birthday, we sum over all group sizes smaller than $M$, replacing $2i$ in the numerator by $ki$ (where $k$ is the summation index) and $2^i$ in the denominator by $(k!)^i$:  \begin{equation}
 \displaystyle P(W\ge1) = 1 - \sum_{k=2}^{M-1}\sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor n/k \rfloor} \frac{(n)_{ki}(m)_{n-i}}{i! (k!)^i m^n}
\end{equation}     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:20       Community ‚ô¶   1        answered Dec 10 '13 at 23:00       Trazom   89 1 2              add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      As being pointed out by Micheal Lugo the formulation given by Anirban DasGupta is a exact answer for this problem, however a formal proof is needed. I have found and verified a solution by Doctor Rick from Math Forum, below is the link  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56650.html  His approach is to partition the sample space as following:  1.   none share a birthday
   2.   one pair shares a birthday
   3.   two pairs share different birthdays
   4.   three pairs share different birthdays
   :
 1+N/2. N/2 pairs share different birthdays
 2+N/2. three or more share a birthday  Then he points out a clever way to count for each partition by picking different birthday for each pair of person. I have tried and arrived with the same formulation as Anirban DasGupta's.

Here is a formula that works.  It probably helps to explain Dasgupta's formula from Michael Lugo's answer first.  Say that a map $f : [m]\to [n]$ is $k$-almost injective if $|f^{-1}(j)|\le k$ for all $j\in [n]$.  Counting injective maps is easy, there are  $$
I(1,m,n) := m!\binom{n}{m}
$$  of them.  You just pick the range and then a bijection to it.  This gives right away the standard birthday collision probability for $m$ people and years of length $n$  $$
1 - n^{-m}I(1,m,n)
$$  One gets the generalized birthday probability from $I(k,m,n)$ in the same way, so we can just think about $I(k,m,n)$.  How would we go about counting $2$-injective maps?  The same idea as before works.  This time, we pick $c$ pairs that will have colliding images, injectively map these into $[n]$, then injectively map the rest to a set of size $n-c$.  So we get  $$
I(2,m,n) = \sum_{c=0}^{\lfloor m/2\rfloor}\frac{1}{c!}
         \left(\prod_{j=0}^{c-1}\binom{m - 2j}{2}\right)
         I(1,c,n)I(1,m-2c,n-c)
$$  This is equivalent to Dasgupta's formula, but it is easier to see the induction.  If we want to get $I(k,m,n)$ in general, we have  $$
I(k,m,n) = \sum_{c=0}^{\lfloor m/k\rfloor}\frac{1}{c!}
         \left(\prod_{j=0}^{c-1}\binom{m - kj}{k}\right)
         I(1,c,n)I(k-1,m-kc,n-c)

Supposing I want to solve in a group of 100 people. what is the probability that at least 3 people share a birthday. So I start from very basic - if there are 3 people, the probability of them sharing a birthday is $$\frac{1}{365} *\frac{1}{365}*\frac{1}{365}*(365)=\frac{1}{(365)^2}$$ 1/365 the prob. of 1 person having a birthday on a particular day multiplied by each person's probability multiplied by the total no. of days. Similarly if there are 4 people, the probability of at least 3 of them sharing a birthday would be $\frac{1}{(365)^2}*^4C_3 $. and similarly for x people, $\frac{1}{(365)^2}*^XC_3 $  I am trying to find the fault in this logic.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Apr 8 '16 at 18:39       yavvee   1              1      Welcome to Math.SE!

Note that a probability should always fall between $0$ and $1$, but as $X$ grows, your expression exceeds $1$.  This is easily seen when we consider the days of the week simplification.  The chance that three people are born on the same day of the week is indeed $\frac{1}{7^2}$,  but the chance that three out of eight people share a day of week for birth cannot be $\frac{\binom{8}{3}}{7^2}$ because that exceeds $1$. ‚Äì hardmath  Apr 10 '16 at 0:22         add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Let me give you a simple answer first and two deep answers next. Simple answer is, assuming that all months have the same number of days (which is very approximately true), 1/12. If you want a slightly deeper answer, then 31/365 or 31/366 is correct, depending upon whether the year is a normal year or a leap year. The correct answer, which might be argued as "philosophical", is as follows: The Gregorian calender, the current standard calender in most of the world, adds a 29th day to February, 97 years out of 400, a closer approximation than once every four years.  This would be implemented by making a leap year every year divisible by 4 unless that year is divisible by 100.  If it is divisible by 100 it would only be a leap year if that year was also divisible by 400.So, in the last millennium, 1600 and 2000 were leap years, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not.  In this millennium, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500, 2600, 2700, 2900 and 3000 will not be leap years, but 2400 and 2800 will be.  The years that are divisible by 100 but not 400 are known as "exceptional common years".  By this rule, the average number of days per year will be 365 + 1/4 - 1/100 + 1/400 = 365.2425.In 400 years, thereforethere are 303 normal years and97 leap yearsTotal number of days in 303 years110,595 days(normal years)Total number of days in 97 years35,502 days(leap years)Total number of days146,097 daysTotal number of August months400(in 400 years)Total number of days in August in12,400400 yearsProbability that a person is 0.084875 or 1 in 11.78202 born in August (=12,400 / 146,097) or 31 in 365.2425 1 / 12 = 0.083333 31 / 365 =0.08493231 / 366 =0.084699 There are assumptions in the above answer as well. These are 1. That all days in a year have the equal probability (which is not strictly true, as records of births will be required for verification) 2. The Gregorian calender has been in effect since 1700s. The probability as above will only work for years after the introduction of Gregorian calender.   3 people  found this useful                       Katyharrison  1 Contribution      Who was born on August ninth 1968?

Hope this helps               MishTheFish  139 Contributions      What is the probability of being dealt a Blackjack?  When the deck is full, this probability is 4/52 (the probability of getting one of 4 aces) times 16/51 (the probability of getting one of 16 kings, queens, jacks, or tens) times 2 (the number of orders in which you could get these cards: ace first, or ace second). \n. 
\nThis comes out to 32/663, or about 4.83%. \n. 
\nOf course, this probability changes as the game progresses: it decreases when any of the tens, jacks, queens, kings, or aces get discarded, but increases when other cards get discarded. This change is unpredictable, but its expected value is 0; this is a complicated concept to explain, but it means that on average, the probability will go up as much as it goes down.\n. 
\nAlso, the probability is still 32/663 at any point in the game if you have no information whatsoever about what cards came up before: if you forgot every card you saw, or if you just joined the game.

The NFL has a 'rating' system for injured players that specifies their probability of playing in a game:. 
1) Out - the player will not play   2) Doubtful - 75% chance the player will not play   3) Questionable - 50-50 chance the player will play   4) Probable - 75% chance the player WILL play            What is the probability of two healthy people where one is a carrier being parents to a child born with cystic fibrosis?

Squirrel Man  234,785 Contributions      What is the probability of being killed by a Pop Tart?  Very low, and for a number of reasons.    If a Pop Tart were to be traveling towards your head, the Pop Tart would have to be going at least 173 mph to break your neck, subsequently being killed. Pop Tarts usually do not travel that fast.    A flying Pop Tart that came directly at any other parts would still result in a very unlikely death, since the rib cage holds the most important organs, and is thus very strong (much stronger than the human neck).    To die from choking on a Pop Tart is also extremely unlikely, because 4,600 deaths occur in the United States out of a population of 307 million people. This is only in the United States; the percentage of choking alone is bigger for the entire world. The 4,600 deaths from choking were also mostly younger kids and infants from small parts, and not from food (which makes it very unlikely for the choking culprit to be a Pop Tart).    Thus, the probability of being killed by a Pop Tart is lower than a calculable percentage due to the vast assortment of things that happen in the world. It is  way below  1%.            Probability of being divorced if your parents are divorced?  Well, my parents are divorced and I'm only 15... it was just 2 months ago... I mean yes, im still really pissed, sad, upset and frustrated...but..this kinda thing, actually makes me find the right person...not wait too long for him...(like mid-40's and stuff) but atleast in my 20's... I love my parents...but..ya know, when i heard that, i just had so many more problems in my life i just started to break down and cry. So, based on your beliefs and opinions (in my opinion) i think it pushes you more to find that one right person...               Anand Mehta  278,423 Contributions  mehtamatics = mathematics with a difference      What is The probability of being born on 1st of January?  Births are not distributed randomly across the year: there are seasonal variations as well as differences between days of the week. Where maternity staff like to celebrate New Year's Eve, there may be fewer people on duty on January 1 and so there may well be fewer births. Unfortunately, comprehensive information on such variations is not available.  If you assume that each day of the year is equally likely, the probability is 1/365. Adjusting for leap years changes that to 1/365.25. Further adjusting for Centuries gives 1/365.2425            What celebrities were born on August 5?

Very close to 0.  The majority of the world's population does not live in hurricane zones and so for them the probability is 0. For the small part of the world's population who do live in the zone, the mortality rate is low and so the overall probability is extremely low.

All we need to work out is the probability that the second person has a birthday on any specific day. This probability is 1/365.25  The probability that they were born on June 10th is 1/365.25. The probability that they were born on February 2nd is 1/365.25 and the probability that they were born on the same day as you is 1/365.25               Haider4711  2 Contributions      Which footballer is born on 19 august?

Anand Mehta  278,423 Contributions  mehtamatics = mathematics with a difference      What is the probability of being born on Feb 29?  February 29 occurs 97 times in 400 years (not once in 4 years).Therefore, there are 97 favourable events out of 146,097 days whichgives a probability of 0.00066 approx.  However, this assumes that birthdays are randomly spread over thecourse of a year. This is certainly not true, and February is "lowseason" for births so the true probability will be lower.               Answers Publisher  49,340 Contributions      Who was born in August 29 1995?

There is no simple answer to the question because the children's genders are not independent events. They depend on the parents' ages and their genes. Unfortunately there is no readily available research into the genders of seven or more children to establish the experimental probability for such an outcome.    However, if you assume that they are independent events then, given that the probability of a girl is approx 0.48, then the probability of the seventh child being a girl is 0.48.

However, that assumes that any day of the week is equally likely and that is not the case.

For a continuous variable it is 0.5 but for a discrete variable the answer depends on the probability of the variable taking the mean value. It is half of the rest of the probability.  If the discrete variable X has mean m and Prob(X = m) is p then Prob(X > m) = (1 - p)/2.           ASK A BRAND    What is the probability of being born in August?

Chart of Americans born over three decades shows greeting card stores are likely to be busiest in July, August and September  By Snejana Farberov    Published: 23:55 EDT, 8 June 2013 |  Updated: 06:23 EDT, 10 June 2013               e-mail           32  View comments     Americans born in the months of September and July share their date of birth with a great number of of their compatriots, but those who were welcomed into the world in January can have their special day all to themselves. According to a heat map created by Matt Stiles, a data journalist with the National Public Radio, September 16 is the single most common birthday for Americans between the ages of 14 and 40. On the other end of the spectrum, the least common date of birth, not surprisingly, is February 29, which comes every four years during a leap year.¬† The second least popular birthday falls on Christmas, December 25, followed by January 1.       Numbers game: According to a heat map created by Matt Stiles, a data journalist with the National Public Radio, September 16 is the single most common birthday for Americans between the ages of 14 and 40   Stiles created his map using data 
drawn from a chart that had been posted on the New York Times site in 
2006, which ranked every day of the year based on how many babies were 
born in the U.S. on that day between 1973 and 1999.  The darker colors on the heat map 
appearing on the site  The Daily Viz indicate the date has a lower-numbered birthday rank and the lighter 
colors a higher-numbered birthday rank.  For example, in the month of June, the
 majority of the days are ranked in the 100th and 200th range, with the 
most common birthday being June 30, ranked 75th on the chart.    RELATED ARTICLES   Previous  1  Next        Forget passwords - you could soon be unlocking your phone by...     Extra special delivery! Woman, 20, gives birth to two sets...       Share this article  Share     The NPR reporter explained that he was
 inspired to create the heat map visualizing the ranking chart after 
someone posted it on his Facebook page in honor of his birthday.  At the time, Stiles and his wife were expecting a baby, whose due date was September 24 ‚Äì the sixth most common date of birth.       Babies delivered on the most common day of the year, September 16, were likely conceived on December 24 - ranked the fourth least common birthday  The map shows that July 4 has a very 
low ranking, suggesting that would-be parents perhaps did not want their
 future child's birthday to clash with Independence Day festivities.  The 13th of every month also suffered from a shortage of birthdays. In this case, superstition may be to blame.  Stiles' design inspired Lane Harrison,
 from the site Codementum.org,  to create an interactive chart featuring 
both the birthday ranks and the estimated conception date ranks.  Harrison's table has revealed that a 
large number of babies born between 1973 and 1999 were conceived in the 
fall and winter, with January and February leading the pack.       What are the odds? In a group of 57 people there is 99 per cent chance that two of them share a birthday   Interesting, babies delivered on the 
most common day of the year, September 16, were likely conceived on 
December 24 - ranked the 363th most common birthday.  Given these numbers, Esther 
Inglis-Arkell, a blogger for the site io9 , calculated that if there are 23 people
 crowded in a room, there is a 50-per cent chance that two of them share
 a birthday.  To bring the probability to 99 per cent, the number of people in said room needs to be increased¬† to 57.

Now comes word that having been born at certain times of the year might help or harm your chances of becoming a boss. (Which means, once again, that it‚Äôs all your parents fault if you fail!) First things first, for those unfamiliar with what is variously called the ‚Äúrelative-age effect,‚Äù ‚Äúbirth-date effect,‚Äù ‚Äúmonth of birth bias‚Äù or ‚Äúseason of birth bias‚Äù: The basic idea is that kids born just before the cutoff date for an academic year or sports age division are at a disadvantage because they can be nearly a full year younger than some of the other children in their group. As a result of being intellectually or physically less mature, the theory goes, such kids are less likely to excel from the outset, which makes it less likely that they‚Äôll get the particular kind of attention and feedback that tends to flow towards high achievers. Similarly, they‚Äôre less likely to be chosen for leadership roles, such as speaking at assemblies or captaining a team.  That brings us to a new study published in the December issue of the journal Economic Letters , co-authored by Qianqian Du of Shanghai Jiao Tang University in China , Huasheng Gao of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore , and Maurice D. Levi from the University of British Columbia‚Äôs Sauder School of Business . Knowing that most academic year cut-off dates fall between September 1 and January 1‚Äîthus making kids born in the summer months most likely to be the youngest in their classes‚Äîthe three researchers theorized that June and July babies would be less likely to grow up to become corporate CEOs, since those roles reflect a long journey of competition and achievement, which should be affected by the relative-age effect if it truly exists. (Outcomes for kids born in August, they speculated, would be affected by the decision of some parents to hold them back, making some the oldest in the next year‚Äôs class.)  To test their theory, the trio collected as much birth-date info as they could for the CEOs of S&P 500 companies between 1992 and 2009, eventually able to identify accurate birth days for 375 such suits. And wouldn‚Äôt you know it, their theory proved to be both true and statistically meaningful: After accounting for trends in U.S. births (more people are born in some months than others) and plain old randomness, the study authors found that the two months produced one quarter to one third fewer CEOs than you‚Äôd expect from a normal distribution of bosses across months. That is, although 8.16% of U.S. births happen in June, only 6.13% of CEOs were born in that month, while a mere 5.87% of CEOs were born in July, despite 8.75% of the U.S. population being born that month. Says Levi: ‚ÄúEarly success is often rewarded with leadership roles and enriched learning opportunities, leading to future advantages that are magnified throughout life.‚Äù  Or, as Gladwell puts it in Outliers ,‚ÄùIf you make a decision about who is good and who is not good at an early age; if you separate the ‚Äòtalented‚Äô from the ‚Äòuntalented‚Äô; and if you provide the ‚Äòtalented‚Äô with a superior experience, then you‚Äôre going to end up giving a huge advantage to that small group of people born closest to the cutoff date.‚Äù  All of which raises the question: If being born in June and July augurs poorly for your chances of landing in the corner office, what birth months are most likely to set you up for life as a big cheese? The answer suggests there‚Äôs something to the idea that the relative-age effect influences the ranks of CEOs. Four of the five months with the highest percentage of CEOs are within three months of at least some possible academic cut-off date from September 1 through December 31‚Äîmeaning children born in those months have a higher probability of being among the oldest in their class. The top 5 CEO-producing months are: March (12.53%), April (10.67%), November (10.67%), January (10.13%), October (9.87%).  Alas, this doesn‚Äôt tell us much about the race for America‚Äôs CEO. Mitt Romney , a March baby, was destined at birth for the corner office, and he fulfilled that destiny several times over. President Obama, born in August, was surely one of the youngest kids in the 1966-67 Noelani Elementary School kindergarten class, but he seems to have gotten the attention and feedback he needed to fulfill his leadership potential.

The speculation is that this is nature‚Äôs way of countering the relatively high mortality rates of males, and creating more of a gender balance in the population. While historically, there have been about 105 boys born for every 100 girls worldwide ‚Äî which creates a ‚Äúsex ratio at birth‚Äù of 1.05 ‚Äî the share of boy babies has increased in recent decades. 2011 data from the World Bank show the global sex ratio at birth is now 1.07, or 107 boys born for every 100 girls.  This increase in the sex ratio is driven largely by births in China, where sex ratios have declined slightly in recent years but remain the highest in the world. The world‚Äôs most populous country has 118 boys for every 100 girls, and accounts for 12% of births worldwide. However, disproportionately large shares of baby boys are found in other countries scattered throughout Asia and the Caucasus, as well. Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, South Korea, and the Solomon Islands round out the list of places with the highest sex ratios. India is tied with Macedonia, Montenegro, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Serbia and Suriname for 7th¬†place, with a ratio of 108 boys born for every 100 girls.  Even while some countries seem to have a disproportionate share of boys, others have particularly high shares of baby girls. While there are still slightly more boys born than girls in these places ‚Äî which are centered in sub-Saharan Africa ‚Äî the sex ratios are nonetheless much lower than average. The six countries with the lowest sex ratios include: Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Togo, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast, and Madagascar.  So what explains these differences in the shares of baby boys and girls?  Perhaps the best-known reason relates to the practice of sex-selective abortion , which has been identified in Asia, and in the Caucasus , as well. The ability to determine fetal sex, along with strong son preferences, accounts in large part for the high shares of boys in many countries in these regions. The desire to limit family size, either due to government regulations as in China, or due to global social and economic changes that have reduced the need for large families, seems to further contribute to sex-selective abortion and a dearth of baby girls.  But this is only one of myriad factors that may be affecting the sex ratio at birth. Some research suggests that the share of newborn boys declines with older parents , and that the high share of girls in Sub-Saharan Africa may be linked to the practice of polygamy (multiple wives). What do these two phenomena have in common? Researchers hypothesize that both situations are associated with less frequent intercourse . (For possible explanations of this association, see this article from the academic journal Human Reproduction .)  On the opposite end of the spectrum, most research shows that the share of baby boys increases during and after wartime . And once again, frequency of intercourse is cited as the likely reason, at least in the case of post-war reunions.  In some cases, though, wartime is associated with a higher share of girl babies. This may relate to the fact that heightened maternal stress , such as would occur during wartime, can lead to an increased likelihood of a miscarriage which is more likely to occur among male fetuses .  Further evidence of this association between maternal stress and the increased share of girl babies emerges from an analysis of births in the vicinity of the Kobe earthquake in Japan, which showed that the share of females born nine months after that event was significantly higher than would have been expected under normal circumstances.

What Are The Odds Of Being Born On A Leap Year? It's About As Rare As You'd Think By Claire Warner Feb 28 2016 As your Facebook feed has no doubt made you aware, Feb. 29 is just around the corner, and there's one thing on everyone's minds: What are the odds of being born on a leap year? Most people find leaplings, as they're called by local-interest pieces and adoring grandmothers, inexplicably fascinating out of a perception that leap year birthdays are incredibly rare. But popular opinion is rarely 100 percent correct (see: every myth about the menstrual cycle ever). Are your chances of being born on a leap year actually that low? For once, the general public has the right idea, because the odds of a leap year birthday are usually estimated to be one in 1,461 . The statistics behind the number are surprisingly simple: Four years is equal to 1,460 days, and the leap year rounds it up to 1,461. Assuming the odds of being born are the same for every day, your chances of being a leapling turn out to be one in 1,461. That being said, it's not that rare; for example, your odds of being struck by lightning during your lifetime are one in 3,000 , and your chances of becoming POTUS are one in 10,000,000. By comparison, being born on a leap year seems like no biggie. However, as the BBC points out, this may oversimplify things; it's well-known that human births vary based on season and location . A 2014 study found that peak birth months occur earlier in the year the further you get from the equator, and the Centers for Disease Control suggest that August is the most popular birth month in America. So in reality, your chances are probably a little less than the statistic cited above, but there's little specific research on the subject. Leap years are used as a way to reconcile the Earth's imperfect orbit with the Gregorian calendar used in most Western countries. Our calendar has 365 days, but the planet actually takes 365.24 days to go around the Sun. The disparity may not seem like much, but the extra time can (and did) build up over the course of centuries unless you account for it. When Julius Caesar came into power, the calendar was something of a mess, as the priesthood hadn't done a great job of keeping up with the convoluted system of the time. Caesar ordered the astronomer Sosigenes to create a new calendar, and he came up with 365-day system that tacked on an extra day every four years. This was later fine-tuned by Pope Gregorious XIII , and voila! You have the Gregorian calendar we still use today. If you were born on a leap year and find yourself so over all the "technically you're still a kid, har har!" jokes, you know who to blame. Thanks, Pope Gregorious XIII.
