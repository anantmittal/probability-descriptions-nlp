( self.GlobalOffensive ) submitted 2 years ago by Indrajite Virtus.Pro Fan So it was my birthday last week and i decided to open 150 chroma 2's cases, so I went to contact my friend who sells keys and bought  the keys from him and opened my cases. After 150 openings the best drops I've gotten were 2 mac 10 neon riders, and 10 pinks.
Felt pretty bad afterwards since I got my first knife after 30 cases a couple of months ago, and I'd figure that I'd get at least 1 knife from the 150 cases ;-;
Just wanna know unlucky I am, and prolly gonna spend the next couple of days getting demoted from DMG to silver after the case tilt.

Only do it if you like the gambling aspect of it, chances are you'll never break even. Over a year I've probably opened 500 cases, and the best I've gotten were a few AWP Asiimovs, Hyper Beast ST FT, and a Boreal Forest Gut worth like $50.   permalink embed save give gold [‚Äì] [deleted]  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Iirc like 0.05%  or something.  Cases are a huge waste of money and if you want a skin you should just buy it instead. Unless you're opening like 1000+ cases   permalink embed save [‚Äì] stere  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago *  (0 children) 0,5%.

I started CSGO in OP Vanguard. My 3rd case ever gave me a Field tested Bayonet Blue Steel ~¬£85. I don't know how many cases I opened after that but only ever got one more item worth selling and that was a ST p2000 Fire Elemental.

I have also spent around 800 dollars. All the knives were between 100-400 dollars.

The odds never change while opening cases. So for example if you open 10 cases the chance to get a knife is NOT (0.5*10)% it's 0.5 every time you open the case.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] mikeok1  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 years ago *  (6 children) I don't understand why you think I assume that. It's still 1-(0.995 to the n'th power). Like you're saying: if the odds are 1/200 and you open 200 cases, your chance of getting at least 1 is still only 63.3%   permalink embed save parent give gold [+] kdogrocks2 Office Veteran  comment score below threshold -6 points -5 points -4 points  2 years ago  (5 children) Because that's normally how calculations of this matter work because physical objects are normally represented. However in this case, as the objects are virtual, there is an infinite possible amount of them.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] mikeok1  3 points 4 points 5 points  2 years ago  (1 child) You've completely lost me. Odds are odds. Can't tell if you're trolling.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] Djones0823  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) I don't think they understand percentages within a series.  Have tried to explain it without math.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] EventHorizon67  -2 points -1 points 0 points  2 years ago  (2 children) But if you open 500 cases, it isn't a guaranteed knife. By your calculation, it would be. The other guy is right   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] Djones0823  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (1 child) No.  Compound percentages have nothing to do with things being removed from the pool.  It's a very basic simple derivation of math.  Consider the following.  You have a 10 sided die.  You roll it once.  The chance for a 3 is 10%. You roll it 10 times.  What is the chance of getting at least one roll of 3? Significantly higher than 10%.  It's still 10% for each individual roll but the odds across the series increase.  Imagine you open a million cases.  Is your chance for a knife in a million cases 0.5%? Of course not.  It's much much higher.  How about 100,000? Not as high as a million but still very high.  What about 10,000 now? Still pretty good chance you're going to land that 0.5 chance at least once.  As the length of series increases the percentage chance for any event occurring at least once increases,  as does the odds for everything else too it should be noted. Have tried to explain without math since if you don't know the math it wouldn't make sense.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] EventHorizon67  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) I was agreeing with you lol. I was disagreeing with the guy that thought your chance of a knife from X cases was 0.5%*X which is not true   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] Djones0823  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Compound percentages change.  Whilst the chance of every individual case is the same,  over a series the possibility of that chance increases in proportion to the length of the series.  Example.  You open 1 million cases. The odds of you getting a knife in 1 million cases is very very high.  Nearly 100% in fact.  The larger the series the higher the possibility of any given event to occur.   permalink embed save parent give gold about blog about advertising careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . ¬© 2018 reddit inc.

The exact numbers are not publicly available, so it is hard to say what the exact chance is, but there is a way to get a very clear indication of the what odds you are up against with CSGO case openings.  There are players who have been opening a lot of cases and have uploaded their recordings on YouTube. From observing loads of these videos we can get some good estimations of the chances involved in the case opening system.  I have collected data on a total of 1088 case openings from videos on YouTube: (videos linked further down along with the raw data).       Class    Percentages %        Mil-spec    69, 94485294117647 %      Mil-spec StatTrak    8, 180147058823529 %      Restricted    14, 98161764705882 %      Restricted

  Rare StatTrak    0       Data collection:   The data was collected by inserting a number for each case opened while watching videos.  Below is the entire list and data that I collected for this article.    Numbers are equal to the class of the skin that was in the opened case. In example: 11x2111x311121121311x111411211121  Numbers followed by an "x" means that the skin was a StatTrak skin.

Join them; it only takes a minute:   Sign up    Here's how it works:   Anybody can ask a question  Anybody can answer  The best answers are voted up and rise to the top         What are the chances behind what items you get in chests/boxes in Counter Strike: GO?           up vote  0  down vote  favorite       Obviously people do say it does down to luck and everything but there must be percentages behind what item you get otherwise it will be completely random and valve may end up have people get more knife's than the more common items (which would in that case make knives the more common items).  So does anyone know or have some sort of a clue on the percentages on the rarities of an item?  Also are you more likely to get a rare item at a less peak time or does that not have any effect on what you get? (What I mean by this is say if at 6pm everyone was opening cases are you less likely to get a rare item at this time or does this have no effect on what you get?)  Are items decided on what they are going to be before you open the case? (so say I was about to open a case is the item that is going to come out going to be decided before I open it or chosen through the percentile method once opened?)  My Dream Knife.

The cases don't have pre-existing loot that you unbox.  And no, the time of the unbox does not affect your chances.  The chances have not been officially confirmed by Valve.     share | improve this answer      edited Feb 26 '14 at 16:57             answered Feb 3 '14 at 19:23       Outlier   799 2 7 15              1      that 1% is not true, unless you can provide sources that prove otherwise ‚Äì senpai  Feb 24 '14 at 18:58        add a comment |            Your Answer            draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

( self.GlobalOffensive ) submitted 2 years ago by Indrajite Virtus.Pro Fan So it was my birthday last week and i decided to open 150 chroma 2's cases, so I went to contact my friend who sells keys and bought  the keys from him and opened my cases. After 150 openings the best drops I've gotten were 2 mac 10 neon riders, and 10 pinks.
Felt pretty bad afterwards since I got my first knife after 30 cases a couple of months ago, and I'd figure that I'd get at least 1 knife from the 150 cases ;-;
Just wanna know unlucky I am, and prolly gonna spend the next couple of days getting demoted from DMG to silver after the case tilt.

That spoils the fun of cases. I used to be addicted to gambling and spent that much a month on gambling so i see this is an outlet to keep that under control.  I spend a lot but i've got a lot to spend. If I want a skin I buy it out right like I have 4 of my skins. But with Knives theres nore really one i would want that much to buy outright.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] [deleted]  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) No worries.

Only do it if you like the gambling aspect of it, chances are you'll never break even. Over a year I've probably opened 500 cases, and the best I've gotten were a few AWP Asiimovs, Hyper Beast ST FT, and a Boreal Forest Gut worth like $50.   permalink embed save give gold [‚Äì] [deleted]  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Iirc like 0.05%  or something.  Cases are a huge waste of money and if you want a skin you should just buy it instead. Unless you're opening like 1000+ cases   permalink embed save [‚Äì] stere  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago *  (0 children) 0,5%. So if you have opened 180 cases and got one knife, you can consider yourself somewhat lucky.   permalink embed save give gold [‚Äì] Dissentient  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children)  Just wanna know unlucky I am   You are fairly averagely lucky.   permalink embed save give gold [‚Äì] Haroic  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (4 children) Approx 1/250   permalink embed save give gold [+] masterman467 Guardian  comment score below threshold -6 points -5 points -4 points  2 years ago  (3 children) way lower then that. 1/2000+   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] Haroic  4 points 5 points 6 points  2 years ago  (2 children) How could you even think it's lower than 1/2000... that would mean on average it would cost $5000 to unbox a knife...   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] masterman467 Guardian  -2 points -1 points 0 points  2 years ago  (1 child) yep.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] Haroic  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Before spewing out a random number don't you stop and think, "hey this makes no sense logically"?   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] cheetahkk  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) 1 over 9000   permalink embed save give gold [‚Äì] Joshuazilk  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Honestly it feels almost impossible to get a knife I haven't got one in over 300 cases...   permalink embed save give gold [‚Äì] Oli_  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Dumb luck is just that.  I started CSGO in OP Vanguard. My 3rd case ever gave me a Field tested Bayonet Blue Steel ~¬£85. I don't know how many cases I opened after that but only ever got one more item worth selling and that was a ST p2000 Fire Elemental.  Not long after that I pretty much gave up on opening cases and just bought the skins I wanted. Too much disappointment and UMP-45 | Delusion   permalink embed save give gold [‚Äì] -Howes-  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) It's something like 0.5 or so...

I wasted 20‚Ç¨ into it I think or might be 25 ... and I regret it so hard... only crap in there. I am just betting those 4 cents skins on csgolounge now and I think it is more funny doing it for shits and giggles and occasionally getting a better skin than wasting real money... and well it is also the reason why I got nice equipment.

I have also spent around 800 dollars. All the knives were between 100-400 dollars. Best being a butterfly slaughter mw (when it was 400 dollars I traded it for a more stable 400 dollar skin)   permalink embed save give gold [‚Äì] mikeok1  -1 points 0 points 1 point  2 years ago *  (11 children) If the chance is 0.5% like people are saying, then the chance of getting at least 1 knife in 150 cases is 52.85%.  1-(chance of NOT getting a knife), which is  1-(0.995 150 )=52.85%  Just a word of advice..opening cases should be purely for fun since in the long run you will obviously lose a lot of money.   permalink embed save give gold [‚Äì] cryptwalkerguy  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (1 child) You mean the chance of getting AT LEAST one knife. :p   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] mikeok1  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago *  (0 children) Yes, edited :D   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] kdogrocks2 Office Veteran  -2 points -1 points 0 points  2 years ago  (8 children) No because you're assuming that every time he opens a case it removes something from the pool of available weapons. The odds never change while opening cases. So for example if you open 10 cases the chance to get a knife is NOT (0.5*10)% it's 0.5 every time you open the case.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] mikeok1  2 points 3 points 4 points  2 years ago *  (6 children) I don't understand why you think I assume that. It's still 1-(0.995 to the n'th power). Like you're saying: if the odds are 1/200 and you open 200 cases, your chance of getting at least 1 is still only 63.3%   permalink embed save parent give gold [+] kdogrocks2 Office Veteran  comment score below threshold -6 points -5 points -4 points  2 years ago  (5 children) Because that's normally how calculations of this matter work because physical objects are normally represented. However in this case, as the objects are virtual, there is an infinite possible amount of them.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] mikeok1  3 points 4 points 5 points  2 years ago  (1 child) You've completely lost me. Odds are odds. Can't tell if you're trolling.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] Djones0823  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) I don't think they understand percentages within a series.  Have tried to explain it without math.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] EventHorizon67  -2 points -1 points 0 points  2 years ago  (2 children) But if you open 500 cases, it isn't a guaranteed knife. By your calculation, it would be. The other guy is right   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] Djones0823  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (1 child) No.  Compound percentages have nothing to do with things being removed from the pool.  It's a very basic simple derivation of math.  Consider the following.  You have a 10 sided die.  You roll it once.  The chance for a 3 is 10%. You roll it 10 times.  What is the chance of getting at least one roll of 3? Significantly higher than 10%.  It's still 10% for each individual roll but the odds across the series increase.  Imagine you open a million cases.  Is your chance for a knife in a million cases 0.5%? Of course not.  It's much much higher.  How about 100,000? Not as high as a million but still very high.  What about 10,000 now? Still pretty good chance you're going to land that 0.5 chance at least once.  As the length of series increases the percentage chance for any event occurring at least once increases,  as does the odds for everything else too it should be noted. Have tried to explain without math since if you don't know the math it wouldn't make sense.   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] EventHorizon67  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) I was agreeing with you lol. I was disagreeing with the guy that thought your chance of a knife from X cases was 0.5%*X which is not true   permalink embed save parent give gold [‚Äì] Djones0823  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Compound percentages change.  Whilst the chance of every individual case is the same,  over a series the possibility of that chance increases in proportion to the length of the series.  Example.  You open 1 million cases. The odds of you getting a knife in 1 million cases is very very high.  Nearly 100% in fact.  The larger the series the higher the possibility of any given event to occur.   permalink embed save parent give gold about blog about advertising careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . ¬© 2018 reddit inc.

The exact numbers are not publicly available, so it is hard to say what the exact chance is, but there is a way to get a very clear indication of the what odds you are up against with CSGO case openings.  There are players who have been opening a lot of cases and have uploaded their recordings on YouTube. From observing loads of these videos we can get some good estimations of the chances involved in the case opening system.  I have collected data on a total of 1088 case openings from videos on YouTube: (videos linked further down along with the raw data).

Below is the entire list and data that I collected for this article.    Numbers are equal to the class of the skin that was in the opened case.

Join them; it only takes a minute:   Sign up    Here's how it works:   Anybody can ask a question  Anybody can answer  The best answers are voted up and rise to the top         What are the chances behind what items you get in chests/boxes in Counter Strike: GO?           up vote  0  down vote  favorite       Obviously people do say it does down to luck and everything but there must be percentages behind what item you get otherwise it will be completely random and valve may end up have people get more knife's than the more common items (which would in that case make knives the more common items).  So does anyone know or have some sort of a clue on the percentages on the rarities of an item?  Also are you more likely to get a rare item at a less peak time or does that not have any effect on what you get? (What I mean by this is say if at 6pm everyone was opening cases are you less likely to get a rare item at this time or does this have no effect on what you get?)  Are items decided on what they are going to be before you open the case? (so say I was about to open a case is the item that is going to come out going to be decided before I open it or chosen through the percentile method once opened?)  My Dream Knife.

The cases don't have pre-existing loot that you unbox.  And no, the time of the unbox does not affect your chances.  The chances have not been officially confirmed by Valve.     share | improve this answer      edited Feb 26 '14 at 16:57             answered Feb 3 '14 at 19:23       Outlier   799 2 7 15              1      that 1% is not true, unless you can provide sources that prove otherwise ‚Äì senpai  Feb 24 '14 at 18:58        add a comment |            Your Answer            draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .
