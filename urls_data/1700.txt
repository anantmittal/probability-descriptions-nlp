Hi Bruce One way to approach a probability problem is to make a list or description of all the possible outcomes of the experiment, and then calculate the proportion of these possible outcomes satisfy the condition you are looking for, here that the sum is seven. To make this work you need to find a way to list the possible outcomes so that every item on the list has the same probability of occurring. In the experiment of rolling two dice think of one as red and the other as green and list the possible result of the roll in a table. Here, for example, the (3,5) in third row and fifth column means a 3 was rolled on the red die and a 5 on the green die. As the table shows there are 36 possible outcomes.       1 2  3 4  5 6   1  (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)   2  (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)   3  (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)   4  (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)   5  (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)   6  (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)     For each of the possible outcomes add the numbers on the two dice and count how many times this sum is 7. If you do so you will find that the sum is 7 for 6 of the possible outcomes. Thus the sum is a 7 in 6 of the 36 outcomes and hence the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36 = 1/6.

The sample space has three items, and the event space has two items as there are two possible throws with a 4, Thus the probability is 2/3  (2) We can use conditional probability to confirm:  `P(B|A)=(P(A"and"B))/(P(A)) `  Here we define P(A) as the probability of rolling a sum of 10, and P(B) as the probability that a die shows a 4.  P(A and B) is the probability that the sum is 10 and there is a 4. This is 2/36 as there are 36 possible rolls with (4,6) and (6,4) the only rolls whose sum is 10 with a 4.  P(A) is the probability of rolling a 10. This is 3/36 as there are 36 possible rolls, three of which sum to 10. (4,6),(5,5),(6,4).  Thus the probability of a pair of dice having a 4 if we know the sum is 10 is  `P(B|A)=(2/36)/(3/36)=2/3 `    Further Reading:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability       list Cite  link Link           steveschoen | Certified Educator    A lot of it has to do with what perspective you are looking at.  If you consider the chart on the webpage given, there are 36 combination of rolls you can get from two dice.  When you consider the sum being 10, there are only 3 combinations.  So, the probability of getting a 10 would be 3/36 = 1/12.  But, then, of those 3 combinations, only 2 of them have a 4.  So, then, the probability of getting a sum of 10 with one die being a 4 would be 2/36 = 1/18, when taking into consideration all possible combinations.  But, then, if you consider the perspective of taking into consideration all possible combinations of 10 only, then the probability would be 2/3, 3 total combinations of 10, with 2 of them having a 4.

When two two dice are thrown the sum of the numbers that turn up is 10. This is the case when the following sets of numbers turn up on the dice {(4,6)(5,5),(6,4)}. There are total of three cases in which the sum is 10 and in two of these the number on one of the die is 4. The required probability is therefore 2/3.  If the sum of the numbers that turn up when 2 dice are thrown is 10, there is a probability of 2/3 that the number on one of the dice is 4.      list Cite  link Link              Student Comments      rachellopez | Student    Dice have 6 faces with the numbers 1-6 on them.

A standard deck of cards has 52 cards with 4 aces and 4 queens. The total number of outcomes when two cards are randomly picked is 52*51 = 2652. There are 4 ways in which the first card picked can be an ace. And there are 4 ways in which the second card can be a queen. It is important to notice that the order of picking an ace and a queen is not important here. As a result, we also have to consider the possibility of picking a queen followed by an ace. This gives the total number of ways in which an ace and a queen can be picked as 4*4 + 4*4 = 32. The required probability is 32/2652 = 8/663  When 2 cards are randomly picked from a standard deck of cards the probability of picking a queen and an ace is 8/663 .      list Cite  link Link              Student Comments      rachellopez | Student    1. In order to get a sum of 9 with two dice, you would have to roll the pairs 4 & 5, 5 & 4, 3 & 6, or 6 & 3. Since you have two dice there are 36 different combinations (6 faces*6 faces) you could roll, but only 4 of them would give you a sum of 9. That makes the probability 4/36 or 1/9 .  2. There are 52 cards in a deck. If you draw two at random you'd have 52 to choose from for your first draw and only 51 for your second. That gives you 2,652 combinations of cards total. Out of the 52 cards in the deck, 4 are aces and 4 are queens. This means you can choose an ace and then a queen (4*4) or a queen and then an ace (4*4). You'll have 32 combinations of an ace and a queen total, giving you a probability of 32/2,652 or 8/663 .                         Access hundreds of thousands of answers with a free trial.

9→9, 18→1+8=9, 27→2+7=9, . . ., 99→9+9=18→1+8=9, 108→1+0+8=9,
etc.  Less well known is that the sum of digits of multiples of other numbers have simple
patterns although not so simple as the case of nine.  These are shown below:  Number Repeating Cycle of Sum of Digits of Multiples  2 {2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,9}  3 {3,6,9,3,6,9,3,6,9}  4 {4,8,3,7,2,6,1,5,9}  5 {5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9}  6 {6,3,9,6,3,9,6,3,9}  7 {7,5,3,1,8,6,4,2,9}  8 {8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,9}  9 {9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9}  10 {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}  11 {2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,9}  12 {3,6,9,3,6,9,3,6,9}  13 {4,8,3,7,2,6,1,5,9}   It is asserted that the sum of digits follows a repeating sequence of length 9.  This is
so because for any decimal representation x, the number 10*x (ten times x) will have the same sum of digits.
Multiplication by the base number 10 simply moves the
digits one place to the left and puts a zero in the units place. More generally, DigitSum(10 k *n) = DigitSum(n).   This operation, multiplication by the k-th power of 10, moves the digits k places to the
left and places k zeroes on the right. The sum of digits is the same. Less obviously adding a nine at any place in a decimal representation reduces the digit by one and adds one to the
digit in the next higher place, and thus the sum of the digits is not altered. That is to say, DigitSum(n+9*10 k ) = DigitSum(n).   Going back to the above table, what is immediately suggested by the information presented there is that
the sequence for a multiple digit number m is the sequence for the sum of the digits of m,
the digit sum of m.
For example, the sequence for 12 is the same as the sequence for 1+2=3.  Likewise the
sequence for 13 is the same as the sequence for 1+3=4.  This of course also holds true for
10. The sequences for 3 and 6 are composed of the subsequences {3,6,9} and {6,3,9}, respectively.
Thus the sequences for these digits have three copies of the subsequences of length 3. The
sequence for 9 is nine copies of a subsequence of length 1. Note that {3,6,9}=3*{1,2,3} and  that
{6,3,9}=3*{2,1,3}. It is also worth noting that for all digits except 3, 6 and 9 the length of the sequence is 
nine and that for 3, 6 and 9 the lengths of their sequences, 3 and 1, are factors of 9. The structures of the length 9 sequences are noteworthy. Here is a naive perception of the structure 
of the sequences. For 2 the sequence is the even
digits in ascending order then the odd digits also in ascending order.  For 4 the sequence
is two generally descending sequences interleaved; i.e., 4,3,2,1,9 with 8,7,6,5 interleaved.
For 5 the sequences is also two interleaved sequences but ascending rather than descending; i.e.,
5,6,7,8,9 with 1,2,3,4 interleaved.  For 7 the sequence is a descending sequence of the odd
digits starting with 7 then the even digits in descending order with 9 the odd digit left
out coming last.  For 8 the sequence is a single descending sequence of digits starting
with 8 and finishing with the digit 9 which was left out of the descending sequence.
 Later a more mathematical explanation of the structure of the sequences will be given. The DigitSum Function  Let n be a number and let Dec 10 (n) be the decimal representation of n.
Let DigitSum(z) be the ultimate sum of digits of a decimal representation z; i.e., if the
sum of digits of a decimal representation is greater than nine then the sum of that number's
digits 
is computed until a single digit is ultimately obtained. This function, DigitSum( ), has several interesting properties; i.e.,  DigitSum(x+y) = DigitSum(DigitSum(x) + DigitSum(y)) DigitSum(x−y) = DigitSum(DigitSum(x) − DigitSum(y)) DigitSum(x*y)=DigitSum(DigitSum(x)*y)) DigitSum(x*y)=DigitSum(x*DigitSum(y)) DigitSum(x*y)=DigitSum(DigitSum(x)*DigitSum(y))  See Digit Sums for an analysis and proof of these propositions. The proposition that DigitSum(x*y)=DigitSum(DigitSum(x)*y)) establishes that the sequences for the
multiples of 12 and of 13 are the same as the sequences for 3 (1+2) and 4 (1+3), 
respectively. Decimal Representation of Numbers  In order for the following to make sense one must stop thinking of a number in terms of
its decimal representation and think of a number in terms of an appropriate number of tally
marks so three would be (|||) and eleven (||||||||||||). Consider how one obtains the decimal representation of a number.  To get the last digit one
divides the number by ten and takes the remainder as the last digit.  That last digit is 
subtracted from the number and the result divided by ten.  Then the decimal representation of
that quotient is sought.  The process is repeated and the next the last digit is obtained. An alternate characterization of the process of finding the decimal representation of a number is 
that the k-th power digit for a whole number n is: c k = (trunc[n/10 k ])%10   where trunc[] means the fractional part is thrown away and m%10 means the remainder after
division by 10.  In terms of the terminology from the programming language Pascal the
formula is c k (n) = (n div 10 k ) mod 10   The sum of the digits for a number n is then Sum = Σ k c k (n),   but this is not necessarily the digit sum for the number.  The process has to be repeated
iteratively on the sum of the digits. The Explanation of the Patterns of the Sequences  Consider two digits, a and b.  If their sum is less than ten then DigitSum(a+b) = DigitSum(a)+DigitSum(b) and hence DigitSum(a+b) = DigitSum(DigitSum(a)+DigitSum(b)).   But, if the sum of a and b is ten or more then the decimal representation of their sum is a one in
the ten's place and (a+b−10) in the unit's place.  Thus DigitSum(a+b) = 1 + (a+b−10) = a+b−(10−1) = a+b−9   For digits the DigitSum(a)=a and DigitSum(b)=b so DigitSum(DigitSum(a)+DigitSum(b)) = 1 + (a+b−10).   Therefore for any two digits a and b DigitSum(a+b) = DigitSum(DigitSum(a)+DigitSum(b)).   This applies as well to the digits in the k-th place.  Thus the general proposition for
any two decimal representations of numbers, x and y DigitSum(a+b) = DigitSum(DigitSum(a)+DigitSum(b)).   For differences, if a and b are digits and a>b then DigitSum(a−b) = DigitSum(DigitSum(a)−DigitSum(b)).   On the other hand if a<b then (a−b)=−(b−a) and,
since DigitSum(−c) = DigitSum(c), it also holds that DigitSum(a−b) = DigitSum(DigitSum(a)−DigitSum(b)).   Again this extends to the digits in any place in a decimal representation of a number. For any decimal numbers x and y then DigitSum(x±y) = DigitSum(DigitSum(x)±DigitSum(y)).   Since multiplication is simply repeated addition it also follows that DigitSum(x*y) = DigitSum(DigitSum(x)*y) DigitSum(x*y) = DigitSum(x*DigitSum(y)) and finally DigitSum(x*y) = DigitSum(DigitSum(x)*DigitSum(y)).   It was previously noted that for any two digits whose sum is greater than ten, DigitSum(a+b) = 1 + (a+b−10) = a+b−(10−1) = a+b−9   In general then for any decimal representation x DigitSum(x) = Sumofdigits(x) − m*9 where m is such that DigitSum(x) is reduced to a single digit.   Another way of expressing this is that the DigitSum for a number n is simply the 
remainder after division by 9; i.e., DigitSum(n)=(n%9).  DigitSum arithmetic is simply
arithmetic modulo 9. For comparison the multiplication table for modulo 9 arithmetic is:  Multiplication Table for Modulo 9 Arithmetic  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 < 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  0 2 4 6 8 1 3 5 7  0 3 6 0 3 6 0 3 6  0 4 8 3 7 2 6 1 5  0 5 1 6 2 7 3 8 4  0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3  0 7 5 3 1 2 6 4 2  0 8 7 6 5 4 3 2  1   If the 0's were replaced by 9's and the table rearranged so the first column becomes the last column and the first row
becomes the last row the result would be 
identical to the table for the sequences of digit sums.

From this it follows from the proposition that 
DigitSum(x−y)=DigitSum(x)−DigitSum(y) that DigitSum((10−1)*n) = 0 and thus DigitSum(9*n) = 0 but in modulo 9 arithmetic 0 is the same as 9, so DigitSum(9*n) = 9   The way to understand the sequence for 8 is that when 8 is added to any digit except 0 or 1
in any place the digit is reduced by 2 and one added to the digit of the next place.  This
results in a net decrease in the sum of digits of one. Thus when 8 is added to 8 the digit
becomes 6, a reduction of 2, and 1 is added to the next higher digit, a net decrease in the
sum of the digits of 1.  Thus added 8 to 8 results in a sum of digits of 7.  Adding 8 to 7
results in a sum of digits of 6, and so on down to adding 8 to 1 which gives 9.  Even this 
fits into the rule in the sense that if 1 were reduce by 1 the result would be 0 which is 
equivalent to 9 modulo 9.  Likewise adding 7 to a digit reduces it by 3 and adds 1 to the
digit in the next place, a net reduction in the sum of digits of 2.  Thus when 7 is added to 7
the sum of digits is reduced to 5. When 7 is added to 5 the sum of digits is reduced to 3.
When 7 is added to 3 the sum of digits is reduced to 1.  If 7 is added to 1 the result is 8,
but that 8 could be consider as a reduction of 1 by 2 modulo 9.  The addition of 7 to 8 results
in a sum of digits of 6 and so on down to a sum of digits of 2.  The addition of 7 to 2
results in a sum of digits of 9, but that 9 can be considered 0 modulo 9 and thus it is 
a reduction of 2. Generalization to Other Number Bases  There is nothing special about 9; it is simply the number base ten less one.  The digitsum sequences for multiples in the
hexadecimal (base 16) number system is:  Number Repeating Cycle of Sum of Digits of Multiples  2 {2,4,6,8,a,c,e,1,3,5,7,9,b,d,f}  3 {3,6,9,c,f,3,6,9,c,f,3,6,9,c,f}  4 {4,8,c,1,5,9,d,2,6,a,e,3,7,b,f}  5 {5,a,f,5,a,f,5,a,f,5,a,f,5,a,f}  6 {6,c,3,9,f,6,c,3,9,f,6,c,3,9,f}  7 {7,e,6,d,5,c,4,b,3,a,2,9,1,8,f}  8 {8,1,9,2,a,3,b,4,c,5,d,6,e,7,f}  9 {9,3,c,6,f,9,3,c,6,f,9,3,c,6,f}  a {a,5,f,a,5,f,a,5,f,a,5,f,a,5,f}  b {b,7,3,e,a,6,2,d,9,5,1,c,8,4,f}  c {c,9,6,3,f,c,9,6,3,f,c,9,6,3,f}  d {d,b,9,7,5,3,1,e,c,a,8,6,4,2,f}  e {e,d,c,b,a,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,f}  f {f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f}   In general, for numbers of base b the digit sums are equivalent to arithmetic 
modulo (b−1).  
The sequences which contain subsequences are the multiples of the factors of (b−1)
other than unity.
In the case of b=ten these factors are 3 and 9. Therefore there  are subsequences for
 {3,6,9}. The lengths of the subsequences are (b−1) divided by the factors; i.e.,
in the case of b=ten 3 and 1. For b=sixteen the factors are three, five
and fifteen and so subsequences occur for {3,6,9,c,f,5,a} and the lengths of the
subsequences are 3, 5 and 1.

If holding two dice in your hands, you'll probably figure this out on your own. Lets make sense of things, and why the dice do what they do.   Dice Roll Odds Understanding dice rolling probability isn't much different than a coin flip probability. A coin has two sides. If you flip a coin,probability dictates that either heads or tails have a 50% chance of coming up. If you choose heads before the flipping of a coin, then there's 1 way of 2 that would happen. It can be written as 1/2, 1 out of 2, or 50% (1 divided by 2).   Dice rolling probability is similar to a coins probability, only with more choices Looking at a die (only one from a pair of dice), you'll see 6 sides. The pips (the little white dots) are 1,2,3,4,5,6.   Take a trip back to high school and revisit fractions An apple pie (my favorite) is cut into 6 slices, and one of these slices contains a $100 bill (eww) - what would your chances be of grabbing that $100 bill? Saying it out loud gives you the answer: One slice out of the 6 slices has the $100. Therefore, that's your odds of grabbing it - 1 out of 6, 1/6, or ~16.67% (1 divided by 6) chance.  That's exactly the probability of one side of a die coming up when you roll it. The probability of at least one of the die coming up a 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 is exactly 1 out of 6.   Probability of rolling two dice Craps actually has two dice, and not anymore complicated than the pie example. There are 6 sides on each die.  There are two of them. Twist and turn each of the dice and you get 36 different variations.    Ever wanted to know the probability of rolling doubles with two dice? A hardway,2 or 12 has exactly a dice rolling probability of 1 out of 36 possibilities. Let's look at this chart, and see how it works. I know it's everywhere, but you can't fight science...    Dice Rolling Probability Chart:    # on Dice Ttl Combinations Combinations/Permutations    2 1 1-1    3 2 1-2    2-1    4 3 1-3    2-2    3-1    5 4 1-4    2-3    3-2    4-1    6 5 1-5    2-4    3-3    4-2    5-1    7 6 1-6    2-5    3-4    4-3    5-2    6-1    8 5 2-6    3-5    4-4    5-3    6-2    9 4 3-6    4-5    5-4    6-3    10 3 4-6    5-5    6-4    11 2 5-6    6-5    12 1 6-6    36 Total Combinations     7 has the most possibilities of coming up. The dice rolling probability can never change in a random roll.  It's the rules of probability . The chances of rolling dice are confined to the above chart. This is the reason 7 rolls more often then any number when you roll two dice randomly. When playing Monopoly, you'll have approximately a 66.7% chance of moving 5-9 spaces (hopefully not into another players' Boardwalk). Why? Because adding up the ways 5,6,7,8, and 9 can roll you get 24 different ways. Since there's only 36 results the dice can roll - you're left with 24 out of 36 ways 5-9 come up. That's 24 divided by 36, equaling .666666... Multiply by 100, and you have ~66.7%. So if exaclty two squares away is the "Go To Jail" square, you don't have to worry much on landing there. But there's always a chance of course (a 1 out of 36, or ~2.78% chance to be precise).  Since the 7 comes up more often than the rest, the casinos capitalize on this. The more random the dice are, the more this is true.     An easy way to remember each numbers' combination Looking at the chart, you see that there are pairs that have the same combinations: 2&12, 3&11, 4&10, 5&9,6&8. Just memorize this, because I'm going to show you a cool trick.  By subtracting 1 from any number from 2 to 7, you get the total combinations: Therefore the dice rolling probability of rolling a 6 with two dice is 5 out of 36 (Or 13.89%).  Knowing the pairs I just mentioned, helps you figure out any dice rolling probability. Viola!   When playing craps, you should keep these combinations in mind For example, most people play the 6 & 8 at the same time. The 6 has 5 different ways of coming up on the dice, and so does the 8 - totalling 10 different permutations. That's 10 out of 36 ways.  Translation - ~27.8% chance of hitting the 6 or 8; and a ~16.7% chance of losing. (dice rolling probability=6/36 ways the 7 can come out).  Others place bets on the "inside" - 5,6,8,9. Using what you know so far, try and figure the chance of winning one of those bets on the next roll. Did you get it? It's 50% because 5&9 have 4 ways each 6&8 has 5, giving you 18 (4+5+5+4) out of 36 ways the dice can come up.  I'm not saying whether these are good bets or bad ones, I'm just getting into the math right now. For some betting strategies, check out How to Win At Craps on this website.

Hi Bruce One way to approach a probability problem is to make a list or description of all the possible outcomes of the experiment, and then calculate the proportion of these possible outcomes satisfy the condition you are looking for, here that the sum is seven. To make this work you need to find a way to list the possible outcomes so that every item on the list has the same probability of occurring. In the experiment of rolling two dice think of one as red and the other as green and list the possible result of the roll in a table. Here, for example, the (3,5) in third row and fifth column means a 3 was rolled on the red die and a 5 on the green die. As the table shows there are 36 possible outcomes.       1 2  3 4  5 6   1  (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)   2  (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)   3  (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)   4  (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)   5  (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)   6  (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)     For each of the possible outcomes add the numbers on the two dice and count how many times this sum is 7. If you do so you will find that the sum is 7 for 6 of the possible outcomes. Thus the sum is a 7 in 6 of the 36 outcomes and hence the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36 = 1/6.

You have just double-counted something. You should get $15/36$. – Lord Soth  Aug 5 '13 at 19:26            @Squirtle is it 15/36 or 16/36? – MethodManX  Aug 5 '13 at 19:27            No! You absolutely need to count $2+5$ AND $5+2$, because the die act independently of each other.... its not like if one possibility exists the other doesn't.  Its like say, because I can first roll two then five, then it is never the case that if I roll five that I may roll two. – Squirtle  Aug 5 '13 at 19:31            @LordSoth Yes I double counted 2+5 thanks – MethodManX  Aug 5 '13 at 19:33        add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  4  down vote  accepted      You double counted some possibilities (the two events are not mutually exclusive!). By taking the union of the sets of desirable outcomes, we obtain:
$$ \left\{\begin{align*}
&(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,5),(6,5),\\
&(5,1),(5,2),(5,3),(5,4),~~~~~~~~~~~(5,6),\\
&(1,6),(6,1),(3,4),(4,3)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\end{align*}\right\}$$
so the probability is:
$$
\dfrac{15}{36}=\dfrac{5}{12}

If you want to use some symbolic machinery, let $A$ be the event "sum of $7$" and let $B$ be the event "at least one $5$."  We want $\Pr(A\cup B)$. By a perhaps familiar formula, we have
$$\Pr(A\cup B)=\Pr(A)+\Pr(B)-\Pr(A\cap B).$$  You know how to compute $\Pr(A)$ and $\Pr(B)$. The event $A\cap B$ happens if we get $(2,5)$ or $(5,2)$, so has probability $\frac{2}{36}$.  An alternate version uses the following counting formula:
$$|A\cup B|=|A|+|B|-|A\cap B|.$$
Here by $|C|$ we mean the number of elements in the set $C$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 5 '13 at 19:44       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Find probability sum of 5 appears before sum of 7.  2 approaches:   $$P(\text{sum of 5 appears before sum of 7})$$   $$= P(\text{roll 1 is 5})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 2 is 5, roll 1 is not 7})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 3 is 5, roll 1,2 are not 7})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 4 is 5, roll 1,2,3 are not 7})$$  $$+ \ldots$$   $$P(\text{sum of 5 appears before sum of 7})$$   $$= P(\text{roll 1 is 5})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 2 is 5, roll 1 is not 7}, \ \color{red}{\text{roll 1 is not 5}})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 3 is 5, roll 1,2 are not 7}, \ \color{red}{\text{roll 1,2 are not 5}})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 4 is 5, roll 1,2,3 are not 7}, \ \color{red}{\text{roll 1,2,3 are not 5}})$$  $$+ \ldots$$  Which if any is right?   Mathematically:  Let $n = 1,2,...$  Let $A_n$ be probability that sum of 5 appears on roll $n$  Let $B_n$ be probability that sum of 7 appears on roll $n$  Let $B_0^C = \Omega$  Observe that $A_n$ and $B_n$ are disjoint. Hence $A_n \subseteq B_n^C$  Approach 1 gives:  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n} B_m^C)$$  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{\color{red}{n-1}} B_m^C)$$  $$ = \frac{4}{36} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (\frac{30}{36})^{n-1}$$  Approach 2 gives:  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n} B_m^C \color{red}{\cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n-1} A_m^C})$$  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{\color{red}{n-1}} B_m^C \color{red}{\cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n-1} A_m^C})$$  $$ = \frac{4}{36} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (\frac{30}{36})^{n-1} \color{red}{(\frac{32}{36})^{n-1}}$$   What is the weakest independence assumption we need to make?  For approach 1 it seems that we need to assume independence of  $$A_n, B_1, B_2, ..., B_{n-1}$$.  For approach 2 it seems that we need to assume independence of  $$A_1, A_2, ..., A_n, B_1, B_2, ..., B_{n-1}$$.

Probability corresponding with sum $5$ is $\frac{4}{36}$ and probability
corresponding with sum $7$ is $\frac{6}{36}$.  Neglecting the other outcomes we find a probability $\frac{4}{10}$
for sum $5$ and $\frac{6}{10}$
for sum $7$.  If on base of these probabilities a choice is made then the probability that sum $5$ is chosen (i.e. comes before sum $7$) is: $$\frac25$$   edit :  Your first approach is wrong and your second is correct (but tedious). See the answer of Micapps.  Let $E_{k}$ denotes the event that at the $k$-roll for the first
time a sum of $5$ or $7$ appears.  Then more formally we have: $$P\left(\text{sum }5\text{ appears first}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P\left(\text{sum }5\text{ appears first}\mid E_{k}\right)P\left(E_{k}\right)=$$$$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P\left(\text{sum }5\text{ appears at roll }k\mid E_{k}\right)P\left(E_{k}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{2}{5}P\left(E_{k}\right)=\frac{2}{5}$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 16 '16 at 10:09             answered Jun 16 '16 at 9:29       drhab   78.7k 5 37 108                  Wait what about the mathematical formulation and the weakest independence assumption? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:45        1      What exactly do you mean by that? – drhab  Jun 16 '16 at 9:46            drhab, is my mathematical representation of my second approach correct?

Now, the probability of a sum of $5$ is $\color\red{1/9}$, and the probability of a sum of $7$ is $\color\green{1/6}$.  Therefore:   The probability that a sum of $5$ appears before a sum of $7$ is $\frac{\color\red{1/9}}{\color\red{1/9}+\color\green{1/6}}=\frac25$  The probability that a sum of $7$ appears before a sum of $5$ is $\frac{\color\green{1/6}}{\color\red{1/9}+\color\green{1/6}}=\frac35$      share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 16 '16 at 9:57             answered Jun 16 '16 at 9:54       barak manos   37.2k 7 40 92                  World = omega (The whole sample space) ? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:57        1      @BCLC: I guess you could call it that way (it's probability even a more "mathematical" way of saying it)...

What is the probability that a sum of $7$ appears before a sum of $8$? Can you help me with that – behold  May 4 '17 at 2:26        add a comment |             up vote  4  down vote      In your first approach the events are not disjoint: For example the event where the first two rolls are $5$ is contained in both of the first two events.  In the second approach the events are disjoint and their union is the event that $5$ appeared before $7$, so this is the way to go.  Indidentally, if we can assume the throws are all independent, a neat trick in solving this sort of problem is as follows: Let $p$ be the probability that $5$ appears before $7$. By the law of complete probability we have:  $p = \Pr[5\text{ appears on first roll}] + \Pr[\text{first roll is not }5\text{ or }7]\cdot\Pr[5\text{ appears before }7\ |\text{ first roll is not }5\text{ or }7]$  Now, because of the self-similar nature of the problem we get:  $\Pr[5\text{ appears before }7\ |\text{ first roll is not }5\text{ or }7]=p$  Plugging numbers in the first equation we get:  $$p=\frac{4}{36}+\frac{26}{36}p\implies\frac{5}{18}p=\frac{1}{9}\implies p=\frac{2}{5}$$   Regarding "mathematical formulation" of the second approach: The way you've presented the problem by defining the events $A_n,B_n$ is correct as far as I can tell, in the sense that it encodes the intuition given at the start of the question.  Regarding independence: In order to move from the probability of an intersection of events to the product of their probabilities in general you need independence. You may be able to get away with something "weaker" (which you would have to specify), but I have no clue what the "weakest" assumption would be.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 16 '16 at 9:55             answered Jun 16 '16 at 9:29       Micapps   794 2 6                  Wait what about the mathematical formulation and the weakest independence assumption? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:45            The approach above (as well as your approach #2, from where you plug in the numbers) use the independence of the distinct dice rolls. Without this assumption the answer would (in general) change, and would probably be much more difficult to compute directly (although everything that doesn't involve actual numbers would still be correct). – Micapps  Jun 16 '16 at 9:50        1      Mathematical formulation: Not sure what you mean by this. – Micapps  Jun 16 '16 at 9:51            Micapps, about mathematical formulation: is my mathematical representation of my second approach correct? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:51         2      The only thing that matters is that the chances on sum $5$ or sum $7$ are constant. For that you do not need independency. If e.g. you would work under the condition that every roll will have the same outcome (heavily dependent) as the first roll then still the answer is $\frac25$. Independence is not essential here. See my answer for a proof that also works under dependency. – drhab  Jun 16 '16 at 10:31         |  show 4 more comments           Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

My sample space would be $S = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}^2$ and $P(s) = \frac{1}{36}$ for all $s \in S$.  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I am trying to solve this problem using the formula $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$, but I can't get the answer to make sense. I want to solve it using this formula.  Let A be the event that neither die shows a 2. So $A = \{1,3,4,5,6\}^2$ and $|A| = 25$. $P(A) = \frac{25}{36}$.  Let $B$ be the event that the two dice sum up to $7$. So $B = \{(1,6), (6,1), (4,3), (3,4), (2,5), (5,2)\}$ $|B| = 6$ and $P(B) = \frac{1}{6}$.  Then $A \cap B = \{(1,6), (6,1), (4,3), (3,4)\}$, $|A \cap B| = 4$, and $P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{9}$.  Using the above formula, you get that $P(A|B) = \frac{3}{2}$, which is obviously not correct.  I am having a lot of trouble solving anything with this formula, so I'd appreciate an explanation using only that formula if possible - I know there are other ways of thinking about the problem from the other post.  I then need to do the reverse of the statement, "What is the probability the dice sum to 7, given that neither die shows a 2?" which will be difficult when I'm not understanding the first example.    probability  discrete-mathematics     share | cite | improve this question      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:21       Community ♦   1        asked Apr 26 '16 at 3:44       Dewick47   417 3 11              3      You got the probabilities right, but at the end you are doing the fraction arithmetic wrong.

\begin{align*}
P(A) & = \frac{25}{36}\\
P(B) & = \frac{1}{6}\\
P(A \cap B) & = \frac{1}{9}
\end{align*}
Hence, 
$$P(A \mid B) = \frac{\frac{1}{9}}{\frac{1}{6}} = \frac{1}{9} \cdot \frac{6}{1} = \frac{2}{3}$$
rather than $3/2$ as you initially calculated.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Apr 26 '16 at 9:42              community wiki    N. F.

I know that to find conditional probability that you utilize:  $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$  I also know that there is a $6/36$ chance to roll a sum of 7, and that if you roll a sum of 7 that there is a $4/6$ chance to get a sum without using the number 2. I do not know what else is necessary however in order to finish this problem and to find $P(A|B)$.    probability  dice     share | cite | improve this question     asked May 3 '15 at 22:22       Ampage Green   394 1 4 10              1      Why does it have to be conditional?  $7=6+1=1+6=3+4=4+3$  How many are there? – Eleven-Eleven  May 3 '15 at 22:26             What do think A and B should be - what events? – ip6  May 3 '15 at 22:27            Wouldn't it just be $1/9$?  I'm reading it as you can roll a seven using two fair die including 2's, you just are not looking for specifically 5+2 or 2+5 as part of your event. – Eleven-Eleven  May 3 '15 at 22:32            @ampage, can you be a little more specific as to what you are looking for? – Eleven-Eleven  May 3 '15 at 22:48            @Eleven-Eleven The question asks "A pair of dice are rolled. What is the probability that neither die shows a 2 given that they sum to 7? What is the probability that they sum to 7 given that neither die shows a 2?" It seems to me that the answer would be the same, however, I'm not sure why it would be asked inversely if that were the case. – Ampage Green  May 3 '15 at 23:46        |  show 1 more comment          3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  1  down vote  accepted      $B= \{1,3,4,5,6\}^2$.  $A= \{ (i,j) | i+j = 7, i, j \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} \}$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 3 '15 at 22:29       copper.hat   118k 5 54 143              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      The Event $E$of rolling two dice that sum to seven not including a sum with summand 2 would be 
$$\{(1,6),(3,4),(4,3),(6,1)\}$$  Thus $|E|=4$.
Since the sample space has cardinality $36$, $P(E)=4/36=1/9$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 3 '15 at 22:35       Eleven-Eleven   8,814 5 22 52              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote       I also know that there is a 6/36 chance to roll a sum of 7, and that if you 
  roll 
  a sum of 7 that there is a 4/6 chance to get a sum without using the number 2.   So, putting these statements into probability notation, you have,
$$
\begin{split}
P(x_1 + x_2 = 7) &= \frac{6}{36}\\
P(x_1\ne 2 \cap x_2 \ne 2 | x_1 + x_2 = 7) &= \:\frac{4}{6}
\end{split}
$$
So, what you want is $P(x_1 \ne 2 \cap x_2\ne 2  \cap x_1 + x_2 = 7)$ ( i.e. the joint probability), so using the conditional probability definition:
$$
P(x_1\ne 2 \cap x_2 \ne 2 | x_1 + x_2 = 7) 
= \frac{P(x_1 \ne 2 \cap x_2\ne 2 \cap x_1 + x_2 = 7)}{P(x_1 + x_2 = 7)} 
\qquad
$$
and thus, 
$$
P(x_1 \ne 2 \cap x_2\ne 2 \cap x_1 + x_2 = 7) = P(x_1\ne 2 \cap x_2 \ne 2 | x_1 + x_2 = 7){P(x_1 + x_2 = 7)}.

Die 1 : 1,2,3,4,5,6 and Die 2: 1,2,3,4,5,6 So there are three ways we can get 7 and they are : 1+6, 2+5,3+4. The order does not matter as we are concerned about the sum i.e. 7. So 3/36 = 1/12.

There are six possible ways to be 7 i.e. (1+6), (2+5), (3+4), (4+3), (5+2), (6+1) So, total probability is 6/36 or 1/6. Answer is B.

Total number of out comes = 6C1*6C1= 36 We can get a sum of 7 with following sets of number (1,6)(6,1)(2,5)(5,2)(3,4)(4,3) There are 6 such sets So, probability will be 6/36 = 1/6 Answer:-B                           amansiwach79      Intern           Joined: 06 May 2015   Posts: 4                       Re: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     23 Sep 2015, 07:32      Answer is B. If we considered the probability of the first dice as 1 since any no would have a corresponding no from the other dice to add up to 7. And the second dice P=1/6 hence the probability = 1x1/6=1/6 Would this be a correct approach?

See: how-many-positive-integers-less-than-10-000-are-there-in-85291.html#p639156 The question asks for a sum of 7 between two dice.  Since each die has to have a minimum of 1, there will be 5 stars and 1 bar. ***|** can be arranged in \(\frac{6!}{5!}\)= 6  ways. There is a total of \(6^2\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{6}{6^2}\) = answer choice B If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 8 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side.  Since each die has to have a minimum of 2, there will be 4 stars and 1 bar. **|** can be arranged in \(\frac{5!}{4!}\)= 5  ways. There is a total of \(6^2\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{5}{6^2}\) If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 15 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side, by symmetry it is equivalent to the probability of rolling a total of 6 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice. Since each die has to have a minimum of 1, there will be 3 stars and 2 bars. *|**| can be arranged in \(\frac{5!}{2!3!}\)= 10  ways. There is a total of \(6^3\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{10}{6^3}\) If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 10 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side, you have to be a little careful. First arrange 7 stars and 2 bars, which can be arranged in \(9C2\) = 36 ways. But these 36 ways are including (1,1,8), which can be arranged in 3 ways and (1,2,7), which can be arranged in 6 ways.  After subtracting 9 from 36, the answer to this question becomes \(\frac{27}{6^3}\)                                GMATPrepNow      SVP        P     Joined: 12 Sep 2015   Posts: 2203   Location: Canada                      Re: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     23 Sep 2015, 13:26        1  This post received KUDOS       Expert's post      Bunuel wrote: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side? (A)     1/12 (B)     1/6 (C)     2/7 (D)     1/3 (E)     1/2 Another approach: Name the dice "die1" and "die2" Now recognize that the value appearing on die1 is somewhat inconsequential , since the value of die2 will determine whether or not the sum is 7. To clarify, for ANY value of die1, there is a unique value that die2 can have that will create a sum of 7. For example, if die1 = 2, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 5 If die1 = 6, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 1 If die1 = 1, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 6 And so on. Notice that for any given value of die1, there is ONE value of die2 that will create a sum of 7. In other words, of the 6 possible values of die2, only 1 will create a sum of 7 So, P(sum is 7) = P(die1 has ANY value AND die2 creates a sum of 7 with die1) = P(die1 has ANY value) X P(die2 creates a sum of 7 with die1) = 1 X  1/6 = 1/6 = B Cheers, Brent _________________   Brent Hanneson – Founder of gmatprepnow.com                             Bunuel      Math Expert     V     Joined: 02 Sep 2009   Posts: 44512                            Re: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     27 Sep 2015, 11:54       Expert's post      Bunuel wrote: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side?

First, probability is just desired outcomes divided by possible outcomes, so you will need to find this ratio. Second, if more than one event occurs, "and" means multiply and "or" means add. In this problem, we want to roll a combined 7. We can accomplish this in a number of ways. We can roll a 1 with our first die and a 6 with our second, a 2 first and a 5 second, a 3 first and a 4 second, a 4 first and a 3 second, a 5 first and a 2 second, or a 6 first and a 1 second. This gives us a total of 6 desired outcomes. Next, we will need to find our possible outcomes. Since we have 6 possible outcomes for the first die and 6 possible outcomes for the second die we should multiply 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. Also note, that this is an "and" situation - we roll the first AND second die - so we want to multiply rather than add. Finally, we put desired outcomes over possible outcomes, to get 6/36 as the probability of rolling a combined 7. 6/36 simplifies to 1/6, which is answer (B) . _________________   New to the Math Forum?

A. 1/144 B. 1/36 C. 1/12 D. 1/6 E. 1/3 IMO B is the correct answer Probability to get sum as 7=(6/36)=1/6 Now we can these two incidents as two independent events so again probability of getting sum as 7=(6/36)=1/6 So total Prob =1/6 * 1/6= 1/36                           Taurus      Intern           Joined: 02 Jul 2014   Posts: 6                      Re: What is the probability that the sum of two dice will yield a 7, and [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     02 Jul 2015, 03:07        2  This post received KUDOS      In order to get the sum of the two dices to be 7, there are six combinations that satisfy this requirement. 1+6=7 2+5=7 3+4=7 4+3=7 5+2=7 6+1=7 Each combination has 1/36 of probability of occurrence, or in total 6/36 for the six combinations, which is 1/6. In order to get the probability of this occurring twice in a row we multiply 1/6 *1/6 and we get 1/36. The answer is B.                          balamoon      Manager           Joined: 26 Dec 2011   Posts: 118   Schools:  HBS '18 , IIMA                       Re: What is the probability that the sum of two dice will yield a 7, and [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     02 Jul 2015, 03:23      What is the probability that the sum of two dice will yield a 7, and then when both are thrown again, their sum will again yield a 7? assume that each die has 6 sides with faces numbered 1 to 6. A. 1/144 B. 1/36 C. 1/12 D. 1/6 E. 1/3 Solution - Rolling dices is an independent event. The combinations to get 7 are (1,6), (6,1), (2,5), (5,2), (3,4), (4,3) and total combinations of both dices is 36. The probability of getting 7 in first attempt is 6/36=1/6. Probability of getting 7 again in second attempt = (1/6)*(1/6) = 1/36.

A. 1/144 B. 1/36 C. 1/12 D. 1/6 E. 1/3 Kudos for a correct solution . The pairs of values that will provide us a total 7 are: 1,6 2,5 3,4 4,3 5,2 6,1 There are 6*6 = 36 pairs possible on a throw of 2 dice. Thus probability of getting a 7 first time = 6/36 = 1/6 And, probability of getting a 7 second time = 1/6*1/6 = 1/36, B is thus the answer.                        adityadon      Manager           Joined: 18 Mar 2014   Posts: 234   Location: India   Concentration: Operations, Strategy   Schools:  INSEAD Jan '17 , NUS '17 (D) , Broad '17 (M) , NTU '17 , Rutgers '18 , SMU '16 (A) , Weatherhead '18 (S) , UConn    GMAT 1 : 670 Q48 V35     GPA: 3.19   WE: Information Technology (Computer Software)                       Re: What is the probability that the sum of two dice will yield a 7, and [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     03 Jul 2015, 11:08      i understand that on first attempt probablity is 1/6 . but for second atttempt why are we mulitplying it and why not adding it.. ?

And means multiplication and OR means addition - Is it a thumb rule ?? Yes, 'AND' in probability means that the outcome has to satisfy both conditions at the same time. Multiplying both the probabilities denotes 'and'. 'Or' means that the outcome has to satisfy one condition, or the other condition. Addition of the probabilities denotes 'or'.

A. 1/144 B. 1/36 C. 1/12 D. 1/6 E. 1/3 Kudos for a correct solution . MANHATTAN GMAT OFFICIAL SOLUTION: There are 36 ways in which 2 dice can be thrown (6x6 = 36). The combinations that yield a sum of 7 are 1 + 6, 2 + 5, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, 5 + 2, and 6 + 1: 6 different combinations. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36, or 1/6. To find the probability that this will happen twice in a row, multiply 1/6 by 1/6 to get 1/36. Answer: B. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

Because of the total of 36 possible combinations, 6 pairings yield 7; 6/36 = 1/6 For this probability to occur again, just multiple the original probability by itself. 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36 B                    gmatclubot          Re: What is the probability that the sum of two dice will yield a 7, and [ #permalink ]     06 Mar 2018, 23:34                         Print view    First unread post            Display posts from previous: All posts 1 day 7 days 2 weeks 1 month 3 months 6 months 1 year   Sort by Author Post time Subject    Ascending Descending                What is the probability that the sum of two dice will yield a 7, and          new topic       post reply       Question banks     Downloads     My Bookmarks     Reviews     Important topics        Moderators:  chetan2u , Bunuel , niks18 , mikemcgarry , VeritasPrepKarishma , generis                 Search for:           10 Latest Posts     Calling all NUS Singapore MBA Applicants: (2018 Intake) Class of 2020     13 mins     s1d1       Solution A is 40% chlorine by volume, and Solution B is 60% chlorine     20 mins     gracie       Divided into four sections, one for each strategy     20 mins     pawanpoolla       In a class of 78 students 41 are taking French, 22 are taking German.     25 mins     JeffTargetTestPrep       By what percent was the price of a certain television set discounted     26 mins     JeffTargetTestPrep       Classroom courses recommendations     26 mins     EMPOWERgmatRichC       A circular jogging track forms the edge of a circular lake that has a     26 mins     JeffTargetTestPrep       Cape Cod Cookies makes cookies of identical size from batches of cooki     27 mins     JeffTargetTestPrep       If a and b are both prime integers, which of the following could not     28 mins     JeffTargetTestPrep       2ab5 is a four-digit number divisible by 25.

The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 OR probability:  If Events A and B are independent, the probability that Event A OR Event B occurs is equal to the probability that Event A occurs plus the probability that Event B occurs minus the probability that both Events A and B occur: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \ and \ B)\). This is basically the same as 2 overlapping sets formula: {total # of items in groups A or B} = {# of items in group A} + {# of items  in group B} - {# of items in A and B} . Note that if event are mutually exclusive then \(P(A \ and \ B)=0\) and the formula simplifies to: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B)\). Also note that when we say "A or B occurs" we include three possibilities: A occurs and B does not occur; B occurs and A does not occur; Both A and B occur. AND probability: When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events: \(P(A \ and \ B) = P(A)*P(B)\). This is basically the same as Principle of Multiplication : if one event can occur in \(m\) ways and a second can occur independently of the first in \(n\) ways, then the two events can occur in \(mn\) ways. BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION: Two dice are tossed once. The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 1. The probability of getting an even number at the first die is 1/2 (as the probability of even = the probability of odd = 1/2); 2. The probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/6^2, as there are 5 different favorable scenarios: (2,6), (6,2), (3,5), (5,3) and (4,4); 3. The probability of getting an even number at the first die AND a total of 8 is 3/6^2 (from above case); Hence, The probability of getting an even number at the first die OR a total of 8 is 1/2+5/36-3/36=20/36.

Remember that the "OR formula" is: P(A) OR P(B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) In this case, A and B can take place together, so the value of P(A and B) is greater than 0. _________________   "Life’s battle doesn’t always go to stronger or faster men; but sooner or later the man who wins is the one who thinks he can."

Why don't we make a difference between 4 on dice 1 and four on dice ? I mean why the combination 4'4'' is the same as 4''4' (apostrophe symbolizes the dice: ' = dice number one, '' = dice number two). I have encountered many probability problems, where events that are identical are differentiated. For example: Quote: A 5 meter long wire is cut into two pieces. The longer piece is then used to form a perimeter of a square. What is the probability that the area of the square will be more than 1 if the original wire is cut at an arbitrary point? 1/6 1/5 3/10 1/3 2/5 OA: [Reveal] Spoiler: (E) In the example above the probability is 2/5. Could you please explain the difference?

We can get combination of (2, 6) in two ways: 2 on die A and 6 on die B  OR  2 on die B and 6 on die A ; Whereas (4, 4) has only one combination: 4 on on die A and 4 on die B , it has no second combination, since 4 on die B and 4 on die A is exact same combination. nonameee wrote: I have encountered many probability problems, where events that are identical are differentiated.

Could you please explain the difference? This is completely different problem. In order the area of a square to be more than 1 the side of it must be more than 1, or the perimeter more than 4. So the longer piece must be more than 4. Look at the diagram. - --- - If the wire will be cut anywhere at the red region then the rest of the wire (longer piece) will be more than 4 meter long. The probability of that is 2/5 (2 red pieces out of 5). Answer: E.

Quote: why the probability of getting 'four' on both dices is 1/36 and not 1/18? Why don't we make a difference between 4 on die1 and four on die? This is because we fix dices one and two. Quote: A 5 meter long wire is cut into two pieces. The longer piece is then used to form a perimeter of a square. What is the probability that the area of the square will be more than 1 if the original wire is cut at an arbitrary point? This is because we can cut the wire from both ends. When we fix the ends, we can cut 1 m from the left, or we can cut 1 m from the right end. Both options are different since we have fixed the ends. Quote: When calculating probability, how should we know when to count the same instances and when not? We don't count twice the same instances of the fixed "property" (don't know how to call that). But if two fixed properties (e.g., two dices: die_1 = property_one, die_2 = property_two) yield the same result by taking various values, we need to count those options (as in the above example with dices producing the sum of 8). Bunuel, does the above make sense?                           Bunuel      Math Expert     V     Joined: 02 Sep 2009   Posts: 44512                            Re: Two dice are tossed once.

The probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/6^2, as there are 5 different favorable scenarios: (2,6), (6,2), (3,5), (5,3) and (4,4); Dear Bunuel, my question pertains to the quoted text. My reasoning to get sum 8 is: Select any 5 numbers from first dice ie. probability: 5/6 To make the sum 8, only a unique number is to be chosen from 2nd dice. Hence the probability of selecting 1 number in second dice is : 1/6 Probability for sum 8 is 5/6^2. However I multiplied this number by 2 since you can perform the same task by selecting the second dice first and choosing a corresponding unique value in 1st dice. Net probability is 5*2/6^2, but i believe this is wrong. Please let me know under what situations do we employ my understanding. Sorry if it is a silly question.

The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 When we roll two dice, there are 6 x 6 = 36 equally likely outcomes. From these 36 outcomes, we can get a total of 8 in the following ways: 6,2 2,6 4,4 5,3 3,5 The probability of each of these outcomes is 1/36, so the probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/36. The probability of getting an even number on the first die is 1/2. Recall that the probability of A or B is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Let’s concentrate on P(A and B), which includes outcomes that have an even first roll AND a total of 8. The probability that the first die is even and the total of the two dice is 8 is 3/36 since (6,2), (2,6), and (4,4) are 3 of the 36 outcomes in which the first die is even and the total is 8. Thus, the total probability of getting an even number on the first die OR a total of 8 is: 5/36 + 1/2 - 3/36 = 5/36 + 18/36 - 3/36 = 20/36 Answer: D _________________     Scott Woodbury-Stewart  Founder and CEO            GMAT Quant Self-Study Course  500+ lessons 3000+ practice problems 800+ HD solutions    TRY FOR $1                                  mtk10      Manager        B     Joined: 02 Jan 2017   Posts: 81   Location: Pakistan   Concentration: Finance, Technology   GMAT 1 : 650 Q47 V34     GPA: 3.41   WE: Business Development (Accounting)                       Re: Two dice are tossed once.

The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 OR probability:  If Events A and B are independent, the probability that Event A OR Event B occurs is equal to the probability that Event A occurs plus the probability that Event B occurs minus the probability that both Events A and B occur: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \ and \ B)\). This is basically the same as 2 overlapping sets formula: {total # of items in groups A or B} = {# of items in group A} + {# of items  in group B} - {# of items in A and B} . Note that if event are mutually exclusive then \(P(A \ and \ B)=0\) and the formula simplifies to: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B)\). Also note that when we say "A or B occurs" we include three possibilities: A occurs and B does not occur; B occurs and A does not occur; Both A and B occur. AND probability: When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events: \(P(A \ and \ B) = P(A)*P(B)\). This is basically the same as Principle of Multiplication : if one event can occur in \(m\) ways and a second can occur independently of the first in \(n\) ways, then the two events can occur in \(mn\) ways. BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION: Two dice are tossed once. The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 1. The probability of getting an even number at the first die is 1/2 (as the probability of even = the probability of odd = 1/2); 2. The probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/6^2, as there are 5 different favorable scenarios: (2,6), (6,2), (3,5), (5,3) and (4,4); 3. The probability of getting an even number at the first die AND a total of 8 is 3/6^2 (from above case); Hence, The probability of getting an even number at the first die OR a total of 8 is 1/2+5/36-3/36=20/36. Answer: D. As you have mentioned above When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events: \(P(A \ and \ B) = P(A)*P(B)\). Could you explain why can we not get probability of ( even number & total of 8)= by multiplying the two probabilities  ? Like this = 1/2 * 5/36? Or am i missing something quite simple here ( I feel like i am)                        Eulerelements      Intern        B     Joined: 08 Dec 2017   Posts: 17                      Re: Two dice are tossed once.

You start rolling the dice, and the sum of two dice is 3, but the third dice adds up to a 7 ?

You have two dice, what is the probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7? Thanks.. First of all please note that this question is far beyond the GMAT scope. \(P(sum=3)=\frac{2}{36}=\frac{1}{18}\): either (1,2) or (2,1) out of total of 36 different combinations of two dice; \(P(sum=7)=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}\): (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), or (6,1); \(P(other \ sum)=1-(\frac{1}{18}+\frac{1}{6})=\frac{7}{9}\), probability of sums: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12; Winning scenarios: {sum=3} - we have sum of 3 on the first roll of two dice - \(P_1=\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; sum=3} - on the first roll we have other sum and sum of 3 on the second roll - \(P_2=\frac{7}{9}*\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; other sum; sum=3} - \(P_3=(\frac{7}{9})^2*\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; other sum; other sum; sum=3} - \(P_4=(\frac{7}{9})^3*\frac{1}{18}\); ... So probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7 would be the sum of the above infinite series: \(P=\frac{1}{18}+\frac{7}{9}*\frac{1}{18}+(\frac{7}{9})^2*\frac{1}{18}+(\frac{7}{9})^3*\frac{1}{18}+...=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{7}{9}+(\frac{7}{9})^2+(\frac{7}{9})^3+...)=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{\frac{7}{9}}{1-\frac{7}{9}})=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{7}{2})=\frac{1}{4}\) (for geometric progression with common ratio \(|q|<1\), the sum of the progression: \(b_1, b_2, ...\) is \(Sum=\frac{b_1}{1-q}\).). OR: As \(P(sum=3)=\frac{2}{36}\) and \(P(sum=7)=\frac{6}{36}\) then getting the sum of 7 is 3 times more likely than getting the sum of 3, so the sum of 3 has 1 chance out of 4 to get first out of any number of tries, so \(P=\frac{1}{4}\) or \(P=\frac{\frac{2}{36}}{\frac{2}{36}+\frac{6}{36}}=\frac{1}{4}\). Hope it's clear. _________________   New to the Math Forum? Please read this: Ultimate GMAT Quantitative Megathread | All You Need for Quant | PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW:  12 Rules for Posting!!!

However I have a few questions: I understand up to P(other sum). How can you conclude the winning scenario is other sum then sum 3? I know it's a possible case, but why is it (other sum, sum 3) will lead to a (other sum, sum 3, then sum 7). It could be (other sum, sum 3, sum 8) - after 3 rollings, while what we expect is sum 7. Therefore the (other sum, other sum,..., sum 3) could be a wrong case. On the other hand, if we can conclude other sum, other sum,..., sum 3 is a winning scenario, have we assume the probability of sum 7 and other sum but not 7 are the same, while there are different? I don't understand this sentence too "So probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7 would be the sum of the above infinite series" - how can you conclude it's the sum that series, how about if we have an AFTER word? What is the difference between BEFORE and AFTER? Edit: I like your second approach, by comparing the fraction of the probability of 2 events we can say P = 1/4, but I still don't understand the word BEFORE.. What if they ask for AFTER? Will we still compare the 2 probabilities?

Will we still compare the 2 probabilities? When we roll 2 dice the sum can be 3, 7, or some other number (not 3 and not 7). The questions asks for the cases when we get the sum of 3 BEFORE the sum of 7. For example why the cases I wrote are the winning scenarios: {sum=3} - means that right on the first throw we have sum of 3, so we have 3 before 7 (as no 7 at all); {other sum; sum=3} - first roll not 7 and not 3, so we can continue. On the second throw we have sum of 3, so again 3 before 7 - OK; {other sum; other sum; sum=3} - sum of 3 on the third roll; {other sum; other sum; other sum; sum=3} - sum of 3 on the fourth roll; .... {other sum; other sum; other sum; ..., other sum on the nth roll; sum of 3 on the (n+1)th roll} - out of n+1 rolls we have other sum for the rolls from 1 to n and sum of 3 on the (n+1)th roll, still 3 before 7 - OK; ... The above can be continued infinitely, and all above case represent the scenario when we have the sum of 3 BEFORE we have the sum of 7 (which will eventually occur on some roll afterwards). So the probability of getting 3 before 7 would be the sum of the probabilities of the above events. Hope it's clear. Anyway: you won't need this for GMAT, so don't worry too much. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

However I think you miss the scenario where sum=7 occurs before sum=3. For example, 1st time sum=7, 2nd time sum=3, so the probability must be 6/36 * 2/36. You assumed that sum 7 never happens before sum 3 so you take the probability of other sum (7/9) to calculate. Am I wrong?

I'm not assuming that 7 doesn't occur before 3 rather than I'm only interested to count the probability of the cases when 3 occur before 7 as this is what the question is asking, that's why I'm not considering the cases when 7 occur before 3. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

Answer is E > 25/100  Basically, if the numbers on two of the dice are decided, then there is only one value of the third die that is possible. So you have to find only those combinations of two dice that yield a sum of 6 or above. e.g. If the value on the 1st die is 1, then you have two possible outcomes - 5 or 6 on the 2nd die. Similarly, for a value of 2 on the first die, you have 3 possible outcomes (4, 5, 6) and so on... However, if you get a value of 6 on the first die, then you can have only 5 possible outcomes.  The total number of outcomes comes out to be (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 5) = 25.  Probability is 25/216! _________________  Uh uh. I know what you're thinking. "Is the answer A, B, C, D or E?"

Start checking from the smaller or bigger numbers on the dice. We will check from bigger numbers working downwards: start with 6, it has the following options: (6,5,1), (6,4,2), (6,3,3). Now pass on to 5: (5,5,2), (5,4,3). Now 4: (4,4,4). And that’s it, these are all number combinations that are possible, if you go on to 3, you will notice that you need to use 4, 5 or 6, that you have already considered (the same goes for 2 and 1). Now analyze every option: 6,5,1 has 6 options (6,5,1), (6,1,5), (5,1,6), (5,6,1), (1,6,5), (1,5,6). So do (6,4,2) and (5,4,3). Options (6,3,3) and (5,5,2) have 3 options each: (5,5,2), (5,2,5) and (2,5,5). The same goes for (6,3,3). The last option (4,4,4) has only one option. The total is 3*6+2*3+1=18+6+1 = 25 out of 216 (6x6x6) options. 5,5,2= (552),(255),(525) Like= 336                          Glengubbay1      Intern           Joined: 06 Oct 2014   Posts: 12   Concentration: Finance   Schools:  HBS '19 , Wharton '19 , CBS '19    GMAT 1 : 700 Q45 V41     GPA: 3.8                      What is the probability of getting a sum of 12 when rolling [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     25 Aug 2015, 13:56      An easy way to visualise it is by drawing a Binomial tree, we've all done those in school and if each branch has a 1/2 probability, you'll find that there's only 3 ways to get there.

Similarly, how will you adjust for the sum of 10? There will be cases where the split is like this: (7, 0, 0) or (6, 1, 0). These do not work since the maximum a die can show is 6. So you need to remove 9 cases (3 arrangements of 7, 0, 0 and 6 arrangements of 6, 1, 0)                          ShashankDave      Senior Manager        G     Joined: 03 Apr 2013   Posts: 291   Location: India   Concentration: Marketing, Finance   Schools:  Simon '20    GMAT 1 : 740 Q50 V41     GPA: 3                       Re: What is the probability of getting a sum of 12 when rolling [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     09 Jul 2017, 02:53       thefibonacci wrote: anhlukas wrote: What is the probability of getting a sum of 12 when rolling 3 dice simultaneously?

dice theory --- for teachers    Single dice  Sum of two dice  Other conditions with two dice   Either dice is a particular number  Neither dice is a particular number  Both dice are the same particular number  At least one dice isn't a particular number  The highest dice is a particular number  The lowest dice is a particular number  The dice have two particular numbers  The dice are not either particular number  The dice are two particular numbers    More than two dice  Die or dice?     Single dice  Click here for how to write a probability.  Throwing dice is more complicated than tossing coins , as there are more than 2 values. If you throw a single dice, then it can fall six ways, each of which is equally likely if the dice is true. So the probability of getting one particular value is 1/6 . If you want either of two values it is 2/6 or 1/3 , and so on.    Sum of two dice  It gets more interesting when you have two dice. One thing that you can do is work out what the total of the dice is. The dice experiment allows you to simulate throwing pairs of dice and see what the result is. This is a good introduction to probability, since you can see which combinations are more likely. But the real world, or even a simulated real world, never matches completely with calculated probability. So how do we calculate it? The first thing is to work out what the range is. You can't have a total less than 2 (both dice being 1) and you can't have a total more than 12 (both dice being 6). The easiest way to see what the probabilities is to write out the possible totals. There are 36 of them in all (6 x 6).   Total on dice Pairs of dice Probability  2 1 + 1 1/36 = 3%  3 1 + 2 , 2 + 1 2/36 = 6%  4 1 + 3 , 2 + 2 , 3 + 1 3/36 = 8%  5 1 + 4 , 2 + 3 , 3 + 2 , 4 + 1 4/36 = 11%  6 1 + 5 , 2 + 4 , 3 + 3 , 4 + 2 , 5 + 1 5/36 = 14%  7 1 + 6 , 2 + 5 , 3 + 4 , 4 + 3 , 5 + 2 , 6 + 1 6/36 = 17%  8 2 + 6 , 3 + 5 , 4 + 4 , 5 + 3 , 6 + 2 5/36 = 14%  9 3 + 6 , 4 + 5 , 5 + 4 , 6 + 3 4/36 = 11%  10 4 + 6 , 5 + 5 , 6 + 4 3/36 = 8%  11 5 + 6 , 6 + 5 2/36 = 6%  12 6 + 6 1/36 = 3%   The percentages above are rounded. Compare these with the dice experiment . It won't match exactly, although the more throws you do, the closer it will get.    Other conditions with two dice  There are plenty of other conditions that you can have with two dice. Often, the easiest way to get the probability of a condition is to list all possible throws, and count the ones that fit the condition. The best way to make sure you have remembered all throws is to list them in a 6 x 6 table, like below.  Imagine two dice, red and green. This table shows all possible throws of these dice, with red numbers for the red dice, and green for the green dice. The background is black if the condition is satisfied. You can change the numbers and the condition to see what happens. You find the probability of this condition by counting the black squares, and dividing by 36 (all possible throws).    First number:  1  2  3  4  5  6   Either dice is  Neither dice is  Both dice are  At least one dice isn't  The highest dice is  The lowest dice is  Second number:  1  2  3  4  5  6   Dice are or  Dice are not and not  Dice are and      Probability of this condition =  See below for an explanation     Either dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice being a particular number is 1/6 . You would assume that it would be twice as likely that either of two dice being a particular number, or 1/3 , but this would be wrong. If you select the first condition above, you will see why. While there are six conditions where one dice is a number, and six conditions where the other dice is that number, there is one condition in both. So the probability is (12-1)/36 or 11/36 .  There is a better way to calculate this. If you click on the second condition, then back on the first, you will find that they are opposites of each other. That means that their probabilities add up to one. The second condition is easier to calculate directly (see below), as 25/36 . So this probability is (36-25)/36 = 11/36 .   Neither dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice not being a particular number is 5/6 . The probability of two dice not being a that number is 5/6 x 5/6 = 25/36 . You can do this as they don't overlap as all (the correct term is that they are independent events).   Both dice are the same particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice being a particular number is 1/6 . The probability of two dice being the same particular number is 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 . This is not the same as saying that both dice are the same number. There are six different possible numbers, so that would be 6/36 or 1/6 .   At least one dice isn't a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  This is the opposite of both dice being the same particular number, so the probabilities will add up to one. So the probability of at least one dice isn't a particular number = 1 - (1/36) = 35/36 .   The highest dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  This is a fun conditions, but a little strange to work out! Try experimenting with different numbers, and you will get different collections of throws fitting the conditions, and so different probabilities. To take an example, considering one dice, if the particular number is 5 then there are 5 throws which fit the condition. There are another 5 for the other dice, and there is one overlap, so the result is (5 + 5 - 1)/36 = 9/36 or 1/4 . But this varies for other numbers.   The lowest dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probabilities vary considering what the number is. But the probability of the lowest dice being a particular number is the same as the probability of the highest dice being six minus that particular number.   The dice have two particular numbers  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  Like the first condition, there are two ways to work this out. The first is doing it directly. Each dice has 6 throws for each number, but there are four overlaps. So the probability is (4 x 6 - 4)/36 = 20/36 .  An easier way is to realise that this condition is the opposite of the next one, dice are not either number. That probability is 16/36 so this one is 1 - 16/36 = 20/36 or 5/9 .   The dice are not either particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice not being either of two numbers is 4/6 , so the probability of both dice fitting this condition is 4/6 x 4/6 = 16/36 . We can do this as the conditions don't overlap, so they are independent events.   The dice are two particular numbers  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  There are only two ways that two dice can have two values (try the exercise above to see why), so the probability is 2/36 or 1/18 .   More than two dice  As the number of dice increase, then the different conditions can become more complicated. You can work out some simply.  The easiest is the probability of a number of dice being a particular number. For n dice, this is 1/(6 n ) . For example, the probability for throwing 5 dice and getting them all sixes is 1/(6 5 ) = 1/(6x6x6x6x6) = 1/7776 = 0.000128 or 7775 to 1 .  You can work out what is the chance of getting various numbers when throwing several dice (or one dice several times), but you do it in a back-to-front way, as above . For example, if you throw three dice, what is the chance of one of the dice getting less than five? This means that one of the dice (at least) will be a one, two, three or four. Now this is quite hard to work out directly. What we can do is work out the opposite. The chance of one dice not getting less than five means the chance of it getting a five or six, and this is 2/6 , or 1/3 . But we need all dice to get this. This is 1/3 x 1/3 x 1/3 or 1/27 . This was the opposite of what we want, so we must take it away from one. 1 - 1/27 or 26/27 which is about 96% .   Die or dice  People occasionally point out to me that the singular of 'dice' is 'die'. Yes, I know that. However, a lot of people don't, and I prefer to use 'dice' since then my meaning is clear. It stops them wondering why I'm talking about dying! However, if you think that I should be accurate rather than comprehensible, I'm afraid that the authorities are not on your side. The Oxford English Dictionary says "The form dice (used as pl. and sing.) is of much more frequent occurrence in gaming and related senses than the singular die." I think that probability is related to gaming! It gives a quote: 1474 CAXTON Chesse 132 "He caste thre dyse and on eche dyse was a sise."

There are 6 ways to get a 7 and a total of 36 ways for 2 dice, so P(7) = 6/36 = 1/6 -- There are 2 ways to get a sum of 11. So, P(7 OR 11) = 6/36 + 2/36 = 8/36 = 2/9. -- OR means add (+) AND means multiply (*)                            Date: Tue, 09 Jun 1998 19:16:35 -0600 From: Bruce Subject: math question what is the probablity of rolling two dice and it coming out as seven? a) 1/6 b) 1/36 please give me the correct awnser and explain please. Hi Bruce One way to approach a probability problem is to make a list or description of all the possible outcomes of the experiment, and then calculate the proportion of these possible outcomes satisfy the condition you are looking for, here that the sum is seven. To make this work you need to find a way to list the possible outcomes so that every item on the list has the same probability of occurring. In the experiment of rolling two dice think of one as red and the other as green and list the possible result of the roll in a table. Here, for example, the (3,5) in third row and fifth column means a 3 was rolled on the red die and a 5 on the green die. As the table shows there are 36 possible outcomes.       1 2  3 4  5 6   1  (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)   2  (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)   3  (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)   4  (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)   5  (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)   6  (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)     For each of the possible outcomes add the numbers on the two dice and count how many times this sum is 7. If you do so you will find that the sum is 7 for 6 of the possible outcomes. Thus the sum is a 7 in 6 of the 36 outcomes and hence the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36 = 1/6.

The sample space has three items, and the event space has two items as there are two possible throws with a 4, Thus the probability is 2/3  (2) We can use conditional probability to confirm:  `P(B|A)=(P(A"and"B))/(P(A)) `  Here we define P(A) as the probability of rolling a sum of 10, and P(B) as the probability that a die shows a 4.  P(A and B) is the probability that the sum is 10 and there is a 4. This is 2/36 as there are 36 possible rolls with (4,6) and (6,4) the only rolls whose sum is 10 with a 4.  P(A) is the probability of rolling a 10. This is 3/36 as there are 36 possible rolls, three of which sum to 10. (4,6),(5,5),(6,4).  Thus the probability of a pair of dice having a 4 if we know the sum is 10 is  `P(B|A)=(2/36)/(3/36)=2/3 `    Further Reading:   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability       list Cite  link Link           steveschoen | Certified Educator    A lot of it has to do with what perspective you are looking at.  If you consider the chart on the webpage given, there are 36 combination of rolls you can get from two dice.  When you consider the sum being 10, there are only 3 combinations.  So, the probability of getting a 10 would be 3/36 = 1/12.  But, then, of those 3 combinations, only 2 of them have a 4.  So, then, the probability of getting a sum of 10 with one die being a 4 would be 2/36 = 1/18, when taking into consideration all possible combinations.  But, then, if you consider the perspective of taking into consideration all possible combinations of 10 only, then the probability would be 2/3, 3 total combinations of 10, with 2 of them having a 4.

A standard deck of cards has 52 cards with 4 aces and 4 queens. The total number of outcomes when two cards are randomly picked is 52*51 = 2652. There are 4 ways in which the first card picked can be an ace. And there are 4 ways in which the second card can be a queen. It is important to notice that the order of picking an ace and a queen is not important here. As a result, we also have to consider the possibility of picking a queen followed by an ace. This gives the total number of ways in which an ace and a queen can be picked as 4*4 + 4*4 = 32. The required probability is 32/2652 = 8/663  When 2 cards are randomly picked from a standard deck of cards the probability of picking a queen and an ace is 8/663 .      list Cite  link Link              Student Comments      rachellopez | Student    1. In order to get a sum of 9 with two dice, you would have to roll the pairs 4 & 5, 5 & 4, 3 & 6, or 6 & 3. Since you have two dice there are 36 different combinations (6 faces*6 faces) you could roll, but only 4 of them would give you a sum of 9. That makes the probability 4/36 or 1/9 .  2. There are 52 cards in a deck. If you draw two at random you'd have 52 to choose from for your first draw and only 51 for your second. That gives you 2,652 combinations of cards total. Out of the 52 cards in the deck, 4 are aces and 4 are queens. This means you can choose an ace and then a queen (4*4) or a queen and then an ace (4*4). You'll have 32 combinations of an ace and a queen total, giving you a probability of 32/2,652 or 8/663 .                         Access hundreds of thousands of answers with a free trial.

9→9, 18→1+8=9, 27→2+7=9, . . ., 99→9+9=18→1+8=9, 108→1+0+8=9,
etc.  Less well known is that the sum of digits of multiples of other numbers have simple
patterns although not so simple as the case of nine.  These are shown below:  Number Repeating Cycle of Sum of Digits of Multiples  2 {2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,9}  3 {3,6,9,3,6,9,3,6,9}  4 {4,8,3,7,2,6,1,5,9}  5 {5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4,9}  6 {6,3,9,6,3,9,6,3,9}  7 {7,5,3,1,8,6,4,2,9}  8 {8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,9}  9 {9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9}  10 {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}  11 {2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,9}  12 {3,6,9,3,6,9,3,6,9}  13 {4,8,3,7,2,6,1,5,9}   It is asserted that the sum of digits follows a repeating sequence of length 9.  This is
so because for any decimal representation x, the number 10*x (ten times x) will have the same sum of digits.
Multiplication by the base number 10 simply moves the
digits one place to the left and puts a zero in the units place. More generally, DigitSum(10 k *n) = DigitSum(n).   This operation, multiplication by the k-th power of 10, moves the digits k places to the
left and places k zeroes on the right. The sum of digits is the same. Less obviously adding a nine at any place in a decimal representation reduces the digit by one and adds one to the
digit in the next higher place, and thus the sum of the digits is not altered. That is to say, DigitSum(n+9*10 k ) = DigitSum(n).   Going back to the above table, what is immediately suggested by the information presented there is that
the sequence for a multiple digit number m is the sequence for the sum of the digits of m,
the digit sum of m.
For example, the sequence for 12 is the same as the sequence for 1+2=3.  Likewise the
sequence for 13 is the same as the sequence for 1+3=4.  This of course also holds true for
10. The sequences for 3 and 6 are composed of the subsequences {3,6,9} and {6,3,9}, respectively.
Thus the sequences for these digits have three copies of the subsequences of length 3. The
sequence for 9 is nine copies of a subsequence of length 1. Note that {3,6,9}=3*{1,2,3} and  that
{6,3,9}=3*{2,1,3}. It is also worth noting that for all digits except 3, 6 and 9 the length of the sequence is 
nine and that for 3, 6 and 9 the lengths of their sequences, 3 and 1, are factors of 9. The structures of the length 9 sequences are noteworthy. Here is a naive perception of the structure 
of the sequences. For 2 the sequence is the even
digits in ascending order then the odd digits also in ascending order.  For 4 the sequence
is two generally descending sequences interleaved; i.e., 4,3,2,1,9 with 8,7,6,5 interleaved.
For 5 the sequences is also two interleaved sequences but ascending rather than descending; i.e.,
5,6,7,8,9 with 1,2,3,4 interleaved.  For 7 the sequence is a descending sequence of the odd
digits starting with 7 then the even digits in descending order with 9 the odd digit left
out coming last.  For 8 the sequence is a single descending sequence of digits starting
with 8 and finishing with the digit 9 which was left out of the descending sequence.
 Later a more mathematical explanation of the structure of the sequences will be given. The DigitSum Function  Let n be a number and let Dec 10 (n) be the decimal representation of n.
Let DigitSum(z) be the ultimate sum of digits of a decimal representation z; i.e., if the
sum of digits of a decimal representation is greater than nine then the sum of that number's
digits 
is computed until a single digit is ultimately obtained. This function, DigitSum( ), has several interesting properties; i.e.,  DigitSum(x+y) = DigitSum(DigitSum(x) + DigitSum(y)) DigitSum(x−y) = DigitSum(DigitSum(x) − DigitSum(y)) DigitSum(x*y)=DigitSum(DigitSum(x)*y)) DigitSum(x*y)=DigitSum(x*DigitSum(y)) DigitSum(x*y)=DigitSum(DigitSum(x)*DigitSum(y))  See Digit Sums for an analysis and proof of these propositions. The proposition that DigitSum(x*y)=DigitSum(DigitSum(x)*y)) establishes that the sequences for the
multiples of 12 and of 13 are the same as the sequences for 3 (1+2) and 4 (1+3), 
respectively. Decimal Representation of Numbers  In order for the following to make sense one must stop thinking of a number in terms of
its decimal representation and think of a number in terms of an appropriate number of tally
marks so three would be (|||) and eleven (||||||||||||). Consider how one obtains the decimal representation of a number.  To get the last digit one
divides the number by ten and takes the remainder as the last digit.  That last digit is 
subtracted from the number and the result divided by ten.  Then the decimal representation of
that quotient is sought.  The process is repeated and the next the last digit is obtained. An alternate characterization of the process of finding the decimal representation of a number is 
that the k-th power digit for a whole number n is: c k = (trunc[n/10 k ])%10   where trunc[] means the fractional part is thrown away and m%10 means the remainder after
division by 10.  In terms of the terminology from the programming language Pascal the
formula is c k (n) = (n div 10 k ) mod 10   The sum of the digits for a number n is then Sum = Σ k c k (n),   but this is not necessarily the digit sum for the number.  The process has to be repeated
iteratively on the sum of the digits. The Explanation of the Patterns of the Sequences  Consider two digits, a and b.  If their sum is less than ten then DigitSum(a+b) = DigitSum(a)+DigitSum(b) and hence DigitSum(a+b) = DigitSum(DigitSum(a)+DigitSum(b)).   But, if the sum of a and b is ten or more then the decimal representation of their sum is a one in
the ten's place and (a+b−10) in the unit's place.  Thus DigitSum(a+b) = 1 + (a+b−10) = a+b−(10−1) = a+b−9   For digits the DigitSum(a)=a and DigitSum(b)=b so DigitSum(DigitSum(a)+DigitSum(b)) = 1 + (a+b−10).   Therefore for any two digits a and b DigitSum(a+b) = DigitSum(DigitSum(a)+DigitSum(b)).   This applies as well to the digits in the k-th place.  Thus the general proposition for
any two decimal representations of numbers, x and y DigitSum(a+b) = DigitSum(DigitSum(a)+DigitSum(b)).   For differences, if a and b are digits and a>b then DigitSum(a−b) = DigitSum(DigitSum(a)−DigitSum(b)).   On the other hand if a<b then (a−b)=−(b−a) and,
since DigitSum(−c) = DigitSum(c), it also holds that DigitSum(a−b) = DigitSum(DigitSum(a)−DigitSum(b)).   Again this extends to the digits in any place in a decimal representation of a number. For any decimal numbers x and y then DigitSum(x±y) = DigitSum(DigitSum(x)±DigitSum(y)).   Since multiplication is simply repeated addition it also follows that DigitSum(x*y) = DigitSum(DigitSum(x)*y) DigitSum(x*y) = DigitSum(x*DigitSum(y)) and finally DigitSum(x*y) = DigitSum(DigitSum(x)*DigitSum(y)).   It was previously noted that for any two digits whose sum is greater than ten, DigitSum(a+b) = 1 + (a+b−10) = a+b−(10−1) = a+b−9   In general then for any decimal representation x DigitSum(x) = Sumofdigits(x) − m*9 where m is such that DigitSum(x) is reduced to a single digit.   Another way of expressing this is that the DigitSum for a number n is simply the 
remainder after division by 9; i.e., DigitSum(n)=(n%9).  DigitSum arithmetic is simply
arithmetic modulo 9. For comparison the multiplication table for modulo 9 arithmetic is:  Multiplication Table for Modulo 9 Arithmetic  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 < 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  0 2 4 6 8 1 3 5 7  0 3 6 0 3 6 0 3 6  0 4 8 3 7 2 6 1 5  0 5 1 6 2 7 3 8 4  0 6 3 0 6 3 0 6 3  0 7 5 3 1 2 6 4 2  0 8 7 6 5 4 3 2  1   If the 0's were replaced by 9's and the table rearranged so the first column becomes the last column and the first row
becomes the last row the result would be 
identical to the table for the sequences of digit sums.

From this it follows from the proposition that 
DigitSum(x−y)=DigitSum(x)−DigitSum(y) that DigitSum((10−1)*n) = 0 and thus DigitSum(9*n) = 0 but in modulo 9 arithmetic 0 is the same as 9, so DigitSum(9*n) = 9   The way to understand the sequence for 8 is that when 8 is added to any digit except 0 or 1
in any place the digit is reduced by 2 and one added to the digit of the next place.  This
results in a net decrease in the sum of digits of one. Thus when 8 is added to 8 the digit
becomes 6, a reduction of 2, and 1 is added to the next higher digit, a net decrease in the
sum of the digits of 1.  Thus added 8 to 8 results in a sum of digits of 7.  Adding 8 to 7
results in a sum of digits of 6, and so on down to adding 8 to 1 which gives 9.  Even this 
fits into the rule in the sense that if 1 were reduce by 1 the result would be 0 which is 
equivalent to 9 modulo 9.  Likewise adding 7 to a digit reduces it by 3 and adds 1 to the
digit in the next place, a net reduction in the sum of digits of 2.  Thus when 7 is added to 7
the sum of digits is reduced to 5. When 7 is added to 5 the sum of digits is reduced to 3.
When 7 is added to 3 the sum of digits is reduced to 1.  If 7 is added to 1 the result is 8,
but that 8 could be consider as a reduction of 1 by 2 modulo 9.  The addition of 7 to 8 results
in a sum of digits of 6 and so on down to a sum of digits of 2.  The addition of 7 to 2
results in a sum of digits of 9, but that 9 can be considered 0 modulo 9 and thus it is 
a reduction of 2. Generalization to Other Number Bases  There is nothing special about 9; it is simply the number base ten less one.  The digitsum sequences for multiples in the
hexadecimal (base 16) number system is:  Number Repeating Cycle of Sum of Digits of Multiples  2 {2,4,6,8,a,c,e,1,3,5,7,9,b,d,f}  3 {3,6,9,c,f,3,6,9,c,f,3,6,9,c,f}  4 {4,8,c,1,5,9,d,2,6,a,e,3,7,b,f}  5 {5,a,f,5,a,f,5,a,f,5,a,f,5,a,f}  6 {6,c,3,9,f,6,c,3,9,f,6,c,3,9,f}  7 {7,e,6,d,5,c,4,b,3,a,2,9,1,8,f}  8 {8,1,9,2,a,3,b,4,c,5,d,6,e,7,f}  9 {9,3,c,6,f,9,3,c,6,f,9,3,c,6,f}  a {a,5,f,a,5,f,a,5,f,a,5,f,a,5,f}  b {b,7,3,e,a,6,2,d,9,5,1,c,8,4,f}  c {c,9,6,3,f,c,9,6,3,f,c,9,6,3,f}  d {d,b,9,7,5,3,1,e,c,a,8,6,4,2,f}  e {e,d,c,b,a,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,f}  f {f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f,f}   In general, for numbers of base b the digit sums are equivalent to arithmetic 
modulo (b−1).  
The sequences which contain subsequences are the multiples of the factors of (b−1)
other than unity.
In the case of b=ten these factors are 3 and 9. Therefore there  are subsequences for
 {3,6,9}. The lengths of the subsequences are (b−1) divided by the factors; i.e.,
in the case of b=ten 3 and 1. For b=sixteen the factors are three, five
and fifteen and so subsequences occur for {3,6,9,c,f,5,a} and the lengths of the
subsequences are 3, 5 and 1.

If holding two dice in your hands, you'll probably figure this out on your own. Lets make sense of things, and why the dice do what they do.   Dice Roll Odds Understanding dice rolling probability isn't much different than a coin flip probability. A coin has two sides. If you flip a coin,probability dictates that either heads or tails have a 50% chance of coming up. If you choose heads before the flipping of a coin, then there's 1 way of 2 that would happen. It can be written as 1/2, 1 out of 2, or 50% (1 divided by 2).   Dice rolling probability is similar to a coins probability, only with more choices Looking at a die (only one from a pair of dice), you'll see 6 sides. The pips (the little white dots) are 1,2,3,4,5,6.   Take a trip back to high school and revisit fractions An apple pie (my favorite) is cut into 6 slices, and one of these slices contains a $100 bill (eww) - what would your chances be of grabbing that $100 bill? Saying it out loud gives you the answer: One slice out of the 6 slices has the $100. Therefore, that's your odds of grabbing it - 1 out of 6, 1/6, or ~16.67% (1 divided by 6) chance.  That's exactly the probability of one side of a die coming up when you roll it. The probability of at least one of the die coming up a 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 is exactly 1 out of 6.   Probability of rolling two dice Craps actually has two dice, and not anymore complicated than the pie example. There are 6 sides on each die.  There are two of them. Twist and turn each of the dice and you get 36 different variations.    Ever wanted to know the probability of rolling doubles with two dice? A hardway,2 or 12 has exactly a dice rolling probability of 1 out of 36 possibilities. Let's look at this chart, and see how it works. I know it's everywhere, but you can't fight science...    Dice Rolling Probability Chart:    # on Dice Ttl Combinations Combinations/Permutations    2 1 1-1    3 2 1-2    2-1    4 3 1-3    2-2    3-1    5 4 1-4    2-3    3-2    4-1    6 5 1-5    2-4    3-3    4-2    5-1    7 6 1-6    2-5    3-4    4-3    5-2    6-1    8 5 2-6    3-5    4-4    5-3    6-2    9 4 3-6    4-5    5-4    6-3    10 3 4-6    5-5    6-4    11 2 5-6    6-5    12 1 6-6    36 Total Combinations     7 has the most possibilities of coming up. The dice rolling probability can never change in a random roll.  It's the rules of probability . The chances of rolling dice are confined to the above chart. This is the reason 7 rolls more often then any number when you roll two dice randomly. When playing Monopoly, you'll have approximately a 66.7% chance of moving 5-9 spaces (hopefully not into another players' Boardwalk). Why? Because adding up the ways 5,6,7,8, and 9 can roll you get 24 different ways. Since there's only 36 results the dice can roll - you're left with 24 out of 36 ways 5-9 come up. That's 24 divided by 36, equaling .666666... Multiply by 100, and you have ~66.7%. So if exaclty two squares away is the "Go To Jail" square, you don't have to worry much on landing there. But there's always a chance of course (a 1 out of 36, or ~2.78% chance to be precise).  Since the 7 comes up more often than the rest, the casinos capitalize on this. The more random the dice are, the more this is true.     An easy way to remember each numbers' combination Looking at the chart, you see that there are pairs that have the same combinations: 2&12, 3&11, 4&10, 5&9,6&8. Just memorize this, because I'm going to show you a cool trick.  By subtracting 1 from any number from 2 to 7, you get the total combinations: Therefore the dice rolling probability of rolling a 6 with two dice is 5 out of 36 (Or 13.89%).  Knowing the pairs I just mentioned, helps you figure out any dice rolling probability. Viola!   When playing craps, you should keep these combinations in mind For example, most people play the 6 & 8 at the same time. The 6 has 5 different ways of coming up on the dice, and so does the 8 - totalling 10 different permutations. That's 10 out of 36 ways.  Translation - ~27.8% chance of hitting the 6 or 8; and a ~16.7% chance of losing. (dice rolling probability=6/36 ways the 7 can come out).  Others place bets on the "inside" - 5,6,8,9. Using what you know so far, try and figure the chance of winning one of those bets on the next roll. Did you get it? It's 50% because 5&9 have 4 ways each 6&8 has 5, giving you 18 (4+5+5+4) out of 36 ways the dice can come up.  I'm not saying whether these are good bets or bad ones, I'm just getting into the math right now. For some betting strategies, check out How to Win At Craps on this website.

Hi Bruce One way to approach a probability problem is to make a list or description of all the possible outcomes of the experiment, and then calculate the proportion of these possible outcomes satisfy the condition you are looking for, here that the sum is seven. To make this work you need to find a way to list the possible outcomes so that every item on the list has the same probability of occurring. In the experiment of rolling two dice think of one as red and the other as green and list the possible result of the roll in a table. Here, for example, the (3,5) in third row and fifth column means a 3 was rolled on the red die and a 5 on the green die. As the table shows there are 36 possible outcomes.       1 2  3 4  5 6   1  (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6)   2  (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6)   3  (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6)   4  (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)   5  (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)   6  (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)     For each of the possible outcomes add the numbers on the two dice and count how many times this sum is 7. If you do so you will find that the sum is 7 for 6 of the possible outcomes. Thus the sum is a 7 in 6 of the 36 outcomes and hence the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36 = 1/6.

You have just double-counted something. You should get $15/36$. – Lord Soth  Aug 5 '13 at 19:26            @Squirtle is it 15/36 or 16/36? – MethodManX  Aug 5 '13 at 19:27            No! You absolutely need to count $2+5$ AND $5+2$, because the die act independently of each other.... its not like if one possibility exists the other doesn't.  Its like say, because I can first roll two then five, then it is never the case that if I roll five that I may roll two. – Squirtle  Aug 5 '13 at 19:31            @LordSoth Yes I double counted 2+5 thanks – MethodManX  Aug 5 '13 at 19:33        add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  4  down vote  accepted      You double counted some possibilities (the two events are not mutually exclusive!). By taking the union of the sets of desirable outcomes, we obtain:
$$ \left\{\begin{align*}
&(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,5),(6,5),\\
&(5,1),(5,2),(5,3),(5,4),~~~~~~~~~~~(5,6),\\

so the probability is:
$$

If you want to use some symbolic machinery, let $A$ be the event "sum of $7$" and let $B$ be the event "at least one $5$."  We want $\Pr(A\cup B)$. By a perhaps familiar formula, we have
$$\Pr(A\cup B)=\Pr(A)+\Pr(B)-\Pr(A\cap B).$$  You know how to compute $\Pr(A)$ and $\Pr(B)$. The event $A\cap B$ happens if we get $(2,5)$ or $(5,2)$, so has probability $\frac{2}{36}$.  An alternate version uses the following counting formula:
$$|A\cup B|=|A|+|B|-|A\cap B|.$$
Here by $|C|$ we mean the number of elements in the set $C$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 5 '13 at 19:44       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Find probability sum of 5 appears before sum of 7.  2 approaches:   $$P(\text{sum of 5 appears before sum of 7})$$   $$= P(\text{roll 1 is 5})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 2 is 5, roll 1 is not 7})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 3 is 5, roll 1,2 are not 7})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 4 is 5, roll 1,2,3 are not 7})$$  $$+ \ldots$$   $$P(\text{sum of 5 appears before sum of 7})$$   $$= P(\text{roll 1 is 5})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 2 is 5, roll 1 is not 7}, \ \color{red}{\text{roll 1 is not 5}})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 3 is 5, roll 1,2 are not 7}, \ \color{red}{\text{roll 1,2 are not 5}})$$  $$+ P(\text{roll 4 is 5, roll 1,2,3 are not 7}, \ \color{red}{\text{roll 1,2,3 are not 5}})$$  $$+ \ldots$$  Which if any is right?   Mathematically:  Let $n = 1,2,...$  Let $A_n$ be probability that sum of 5 appears on roll $n$  Let $B_n$ be probability that sum of 7 appears on roll $n$  Let $B_0^C = \Omega$  Observe that $A_n$ and $B_n$ are disjoint. Hence $A_n \subseteq B_n^C$  Approach 1 gives:  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n} B_m^C)$$  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{\color{red}{n-1}} B_m^C)$$  $$ = \frac{4}{36} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (\frac{30}{36})^{n-1}$$  Approach 2 gives:  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n} B_m^C \color{red}{\cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n-1} A_m^C})$$  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} P(A_n \cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{\color{red}{n-1}} B_m^C \color{red}{\cap \bigcap_{m=0}^{n-1} A_m^C})$$  $$ = \frac{4}{36} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (\frac{30}{36})^{n-1} \color{red}{(\frac{32}{36})^{n-1}}$$   What is the weakest independence assumption we need to make?  For approach 1 it seems that we need to assume independence of  $$A_n, B_1, B_2, ..., B_{n-1}$$.  For approach 2 it seems that we need to assume independence of  $$A_1, A_2, ..., A_n, B_1, B_2, ..., B_{n-1}$$.

Probability corresponding with sum $5$ is $\frac{4}{36}$ and probability
corresponding with sum $7$ is $\frac{6}{36}$.  Neglecting the other outcomes we find a probability $\frac{4}{10}$
for sum $5$ and $\frac{6}{10}$
for sum $7$.  If on base of these probabilities a choice is made then the probability that sum $5$ is chosen (i.e. comes before sum $7$) is: $$\frac25$$   edit :  Your first approach is wrong and your second is correct (but tedious). See the answer of Micapps.  Let $E_{k}$ denotes the event that at the $k$-roll for the first
time a sum of $5$ or $7$ appears.  Then more formally we have: $$P\left(\text{sum }5\text{ appears first}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P\left(\text{sum }5\text{ appears first}\mid E_{k}\right)P\left(E_{k}\right)=$$$$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P\left(\text{sum }5\text{ appears at roll }k\mid E_{k}\right)P\left(E_{k}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{2}{5}P\left(E_{k}\right)=\frac{2}{5}$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 16 '16 at 10:09             answered Jun 16 '16 at 9:29       drhab   78.7k 5 37 108                  Wait what about the mathematical formulation and the weakest independence assumption? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:45        1      What exactly do you mean by that? – drhab  Jun 16 '16 at 9:46            drhab, is my mathematical representation of my second approach correct?

Now, the probability of a sum of $5$ is $\color\red{1/9}$, and the probability of a sum of $7$ is $\color\green{1/6}$.  Therefore:   The probability that a sum of $5$ appears before a sum of $7$ is $\frac{\color\red{1/9}}{\color\red{1/9}+\color\green{1/6}}=\frac25$  The probability that a sum of $7$ appears before a sum of $5$ is $\frac{\color\green{1/6}}{\color\red{1/9}+\color\green{1/6}}=\frac35$      share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 16 '16 at 9:57             answered Jun 16 '16 at 9:54       barak manos   37.2k 7 40 92                  World = omega (The whole sample space) ? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:57        1      @BCLC: I guess you could call it that way (it's probability even a more "mathematical" way of saying it)...

What is the probability that a sum of $7$ appears before a sum of $8$? Can you help me with that – behold  May 4 '17 at 2:26        add a comment |             up vote  4  down vote      In your first approach the events are not disjoint: For example the event where the first two rolls are $5$ is contained in both of the first two events.  In the second approach the events are disjoint and their union is the event that $5$ appeared before $7$, so this is the way to go.  Indidentally, if we can assume the throws are all independent, a neat trick in solving this sort of problem is as follows: Let $p$ be the probability that $5$ appears before $7$. By the law of complete probability we have:  $p = \Pr[5\text{ appears on first roll}] + \Pr[\text{first roll is not }5\text{ or }7]\cdot\Pr[5\text{ appears before }7\ |\text{ first roll is not }5\text{ or }7]$  Now, because of the self-similar nature of the problem we get:  $\Pr[5\text{ appears before }7\ |\text{ first roll is not }5\text{ or }7]=p$  Plugging numbers in the first equation we get:  $$p=\frac{4}{36}+\frac{26}{36}p\implies\frac{5}{18}p=\frac{1}{9}\implies p=\frac{2}{5}$$   Regarding "mathematical formulation" of the second approach: The way you've presented the problem by defining the events $A_n,B_n$ is correct as far as I can tell, in the sense that it encodes the intuition given at the start of the question.  Regarding independence: In order to move from the probability of an intersection of events to the product of their probabilities in general you need independence. You may be able to get away with something "weaker" (which you would have to specify), but I have no clue what the "weakest" assumption would be.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 16 '16 at 9:55             answered Jun 16 '16 at 9:29       Micapps   794 2 6                  Wait what about the mathematical formulation and the weakest independence assumption? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:45            The approach above (as well as your approach #2, from where you plug in the numbers) use the independence of the distinct dice rolls. Without this assumption the answer would (in general) change, and would probably be much more difficult to compute directly (although everything that doesn't involve actual numbers would still be correct). – Micapps  Jun 16 '16 at 9:50        1      Mathematical formulation: Not sure what you mean by this. – Micapps  Jun 16 '16 at 9:51            Micapps, about mathematical formulation: is my mathematical representation of my second approach correct? – BCLC  Jun 16 '16 at 9:51         2      The only thing that matters is that the chances on sum $5$ or sum $7$ are constant. For that you do not need independency. If e.g. you would work under the condition that every roll will have the same outcome (heavily dependent) as the first roll then still the answer is $\frac25$. Independence is not essential here. See my answer for a proof that also works under dependency. – drhab  Jun 16 '16 at 10:31         |  show 4 more comments           Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

My sample space would be $S = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}^2$ and $P(s) = \frac{1}{36}$ for all $s \in S$.  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I am trying to solve this problem using the formula $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$, but I can't get the answer to make sense. I want to solve it using this formula.  Let A be the event that neither die shows a 2. So $A = \{1,3,4,5,6\}^2$ and $|A| = 25$. $P(A) = \frac{25}{36}$.  Let $B$ be the event that the two dice sum up to $7$. So $B = \{(1,6), (6,1), (4,3), (3,4), (2,5), (5,2)\}$ $|B| = 6$ and $P(B) = \frac{1}{6}$.  Then $A \cap B = \{(1,6), (6,1), (4,3), (3,4)\}$, $|A \cap B| = 4$, and $P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{9}$.  Using the above formula, you get that $P(A|B) = \frac{3}{2}$, which is obviously not correct.  I am having a lot of trouble solving anything with this formula, so I'd appreciate an explanation using only that formula if possible - I know there are other ways of thinking about the problem from the other post.  I then need to do the reverse of the statement, "What is the probability the dice sum to 7, given that neither die shows a 2?" which will be difficult when I'm not understanding the first example.    probability  discrete-mathematics     share | cite | improve this question      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:21       Community ♦   1        asked Apr 26 '16 at 3:44       Dewick47   417 3 11              3      You got the probabilities right, but at the end you are doing the fraction arithmetic wrong.

If that's correct, I am feeling more comfortable and understand the difference here. – Dewick47  Apr 26 '16 at 4:03        add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  0  down vote      community wiki answer so that the question can be closed  You correctly found that
\begin{align*}
P(A) & = \frac{25}{36}\\
P(B) & = \frac{1}{6}\\
P(A \cap B) & = \frac{1}{9}
\end{align*}
Hence, 
$$P(A \mid B) = \frac{\frac{1}{9}}{\frac{1}{6}} = \frac{1}{9} \cdot \frac{6}{1} = \frac{2}{3}$$
rather than $3/2$ as you initially calculated.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Apr 26 '16 at 9:42              community wiki    N. F.

I know that to find conditional probability that you utilize:  $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$  I also know that there is a $6/36$ chance to roll a sum of 7, and that if you roll a sum of 7 that there is a $4/6$ chance to get a sum without using the number 2. I do not know what else is necessary however in order to finish this problem and to find $P(A|B)$.    probability  dice     share | cite | improve this question     asked May 3 '15 at 22:22       Ampage Green   394 1 4 10              1      Why does it have to be conditional?  $7=6+1=1+6=3+4=4+3$  How many are there? – Eleven-Eleven  May 3 '15 at 22:26             What do think A and B should be - what events? – ip6  May 3 '15 at 22:27            Wouldn't it just be $1/9$?  I'm reading it as you can roll a seven using two fair die including 2's, you just are not looking for specifically 5+2 or 2+5 as part of your event. – Eleven-Eleven  May 3 '15 at 22:32            @ampage, can you be a little more specific as to what you are looking for? – Eleven-Eleven  May 3 '15 at 22:48            @Eleven-Eleven The question asks "A pair of dice are rolled. What is the probability that neither die shows a 2 given that they sum to 7? What is the probability that they sum to 7 given that neither die shows a 2?" It seems to me that the answer would be the same, however, I'm not sure why it would be asked inversely if that were the case. – Ampage Green  May 3 '15 at 23:46        |  show 1 more comment          3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  1  down vote  accepted      $B= \{1,3,4,5,6\}^2$.  $A= \{ (i,j) | i+j = 7, i, j \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} \}$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 3 '15 at 22:29       copper.hat   118k 5 54 143              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      The Event $E$of rolling two dice that sum to seven not including a sum with summand 2 would be 
$$\{(1,6),(3,4),(4,3),(6,1)\}$$  Thus $|E|=4$.
Since the sample space has cardinality $36$, $P(E)=4/36=1/9$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 3 '15 at 22:35       Eleven-Eleven   8,814 5 22 52              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote       I also know that there is a 6/36 chance to roll a sum of 7, and that if you 
  roll 
  a sum of 7 that there is a 4/6 chance to get a sum without using the number 2.   So, putting these statements into probability notation, you have,
$$
\begin{split}
P(x_1 + x_2 = 7) &= \frac{6}{36}\\
P(x_1\ne 2 \cap x_2 \ne 2 | x_1 + x_2 = 7) &= \:\frac{4}{6}
\end{split}
$$
So, what you want is $P(x_1 \ne 2 \cap x_2\ne 2  \cap x_1 + x_2 = 7)$ ( i.e. the joint probability), so using the conditional probability definition:
$$
P(x_1\ne 2 \cap x_2 \ne 2 | x_1 + x_2 = 7) 
= \frac{P(x_1 \ne 2 \cap x_2\ne 2 \cap x_1 + x_2 = 7)}{P(x_1 + x_2 = 7)} 
\qquad
$$
and thus, 
$$
P(x_1 \ne 2 \cap x_2\ne 2 \cap x_1 + x_2 = 7) = P(x_1\ne 2 \cap x_2 \ne 2 | x_1 + x_2 = 7){P(x_1 + x_2 = 7)}.

Die 1 : 1,2,3,4,5,6 and Die 2: 1,2,3,4,5,6 So there are three ways we can get 7 and they are : 1+6, 2+5,3+4. The order does not matter as we are concerned about the sum i.e. 7. So 3/36 = 1/12.

There are six possible ways to be 7 i.e. (1+6), (2+5), (3+4), (4+3), (5+2), (6+1) So, total probability is 6/36 or 1/6. Answer is B.

If we considered the probability of the first dice as 1 since any no would have a corresponding no from the other dice to add up to 7. And the second dice P=1/6 hence the probability = 1x1/6=1/6 Would this be a correct approach?

See: how-many-positive-integers-less-than-10-000-are-there-in-85291.html#p639156 The question asks for a sum of 7 between two dice.  Since each die has to have a minimum of 1, there will be 5 stars and 1 bar. ***|** can be arranged in \(\frac{6!}{5!}\)= 6  ways. There is a total of \(6^2\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{6}{6^2}\) = answer choice B If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 8 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side.  Since each die has to have a minimum of 2, there will be 4 stars and 1 bar. **|** can be arranged in \(\frac{5!}{4!}\)= 5  ways. There is a total of \(6^2\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{5}{6^2}\) If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 15 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side, by symmetry it is equivalent to the probability of rolling a total of 6 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice. Since each die has to have a minimum of 1, there will be 3 stars and 2 bars. *|**| can be arranged in \(\frac{5!}{2!3!}\)= 10  ways. There is a total of \(6^3\) outcomes, so  the answer to this question is \(\frac{10}{6^3}\) If the question asked to find the probability of rolling a total of 10 with a single roll of three fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side, you have to be a little careful. First arrange 7 stars and 2 bars, which can be arranged in \(9C2\) = 36 ways. But these 36 ways are including (1,1,8), which can be arranged in 3 ways and (1,2,7), which can be arranged in 6 ways.  After subtracting 9 from 36, the answer to this question becomes \(\frac{27}{6^3}\)                                GMATPrepNow      SVP        P     Joined: 12 Sep 2015   Posts: 2203   Location: Canada                      Re: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     23 Sep 2015, 13:26        1  This post received KUDOS       Expert's post      Bunuel wrote: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side? (A)     1/12 (B)     1/6 (C)     2/7 (D)     1/3 (E)     1/2 Another approach: Name the dice "die1" and "die2" Now recognize that the value appearing on die1 is somewhat inconsequential , since the value of die2 will determine whether or not the sum is 7. To clarify, for ANY value of die1, there is a unique value that die2 can have that will create a sum of 7. For example, if die1 = 2, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 5 If die1 = 6, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 1 If die1 = 1, then the sum will equal 7 if die2 = 6 And so on. Notice that for any given value of die1, there is ONE value of die2 that will create a sum of 7. In other words, of the 6 possible values of die2, only 1 will create a sum of 7 So, P(sum is 7) = P(die1 has ANY value AND die2 creates a sum of 7 with die1) = P(die1 has ANY value) X P(die2 creates a sum of 7 with die1) = 1 X  1/6 = 1/6 = B Cheers, Brent _________________   Brent Hanneson – Founder of gmatprepnow.com                             Bunuel      Math Expert     V     Joined: 02 Sep 2009   Posts: 44512                            Re: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     27 Sep 2015, 11:54       Expert's post      Bunuel wrote: What is the probability of rolling a total of 7 with a single roll of two fair six-sided dice, each with the distinct numbers 1 through 6 on each side?

First, probability is just desired outcomes divided by possible outcomes, so you will need to find this ratio. Second, if more than one event occurs, "and" means multiply and "or" means add. In this problem, we want to roll a combined 7. We can accomplish this in a number of ways. We can roll a 1 with our first die and a 6 with our second, a 2 first and a 5 second, a 3 first and a 4 second, a 4 first and a 3 second, a 5 first and a 2 second, or a 6 first and a 1 second. This gives us a total of 6 desired outcomes. Next, we will need to find our possible outcomes. Since we have 6 possible outcomes for the first die and 6 possible outcomes for the second die we should multiply 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. Also note, that this is an "and" situation - we roll the first AND second die - so we want to multiply rather than add. Finally, we put desired outcomes over possible outcomes, to get 6/36 as the probability of rolling a combined 7. 6/36 simplifies to 1/6, which is answer (B) . _________________   New to the Math Forum?

A. 1/144 B. 1/36 C. 1/12 D. 1/6 E. 1/3 IMO B is the correct answer Probability to get sum as 7=(6/36)=1/6 Now we can these two incidents as two independent events so again probability of getting sum as 7=(6/36)=1/6 So total Prob =1/6 * 1/6= 1/36                           Taurus      Intern           Joined: 02 Jul 2014   Posts: 6                      Re: What is the probability that the sum of two dice will yield a 7, and [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     02 Jul 2015, 03:07        2  This post received KUDOS      In order to get the sum of the two dices to be 7, there are six combinations that satisfy this requirement. 1+6=7 2+5=7 3+4=7 4+3=7 5+2=7 6+1=7 Each combination has 1/36 of probability of occurrence, or in total 6/36 for the six combinations, which is 1/6. In order to get the probability of this occurring twice in a row we multiply 1/6 *1/6 and we get 1/36.

A. 1/144 B. 1/36 C. 1/12 D. 1/6 E. 1/3 Solution - Rolling dices is an independent event. The combinations to get 7 are (1,6), (6,1), (2,5), (5,2), (3,4), (4,3) and total combinations of both dices is 36. The probability of getting 7 in first attempt is 6/36=1/6. Probability of getting 7 again in second attempt = (1/6)*(1/6) = 1/36.

A. 1/144 B. 1/36 C. 1/12 D. 1/6 E. 1/3 Kudos for a correct solution . The pairs of values that will provide us a total 7 are: 1,6 2,5 3,4 4,3 5,2 6,1 There are 6*6 = 36 pairs possible on a throw of 2 dice. Thus probability of getting a 7 first time = 6/36 = 1/6 And, probability of getting a 7 second time = 1/6*1/6 = 1/36, B is thus the answer.                        adityadon      Manager           Joined: 18 Mar 2014   Posts: 234   Location: India   Concentration: Operations, Strategy   Schools:  INSEAD Jan '17 , NUS '17 (D) , Broad '17 (M) , NTU '17 , Rutgers '18 , SMU '16 (A) , Weatherhead '18 (S) , UConn    GMAT 1 : 670 Q48 V35     GPA: 3.19   WE: Information Technology (Computer Software)                       Re: What is the probability that the sum of two dice will yield a 7, and [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     03 Jul 2015, 11:08      i understand that on first attempt probablity is 1/6 . but for second atttempt why are we mulitplying it and why not adding it.. ?

And means multiplication and OR means addition - Is it a thumb rule ?? Yes, 'AND' in probability means that the outcome has to satisfy both conditions at the same time. Multiplying both the probabilities denotes 'and'. 'Or' means that the outcome has to satisfy one condition, or the other condition. Addition of the probabilities denotes 'or'.

A. 1/144 B. 1/36 C. 1/12 D. 1/6 E. 1/3 Kudos for a correct solution . MANHATTAN GMAT OFFICIAL SOLUTION: There are 36 ways in which 2 dice can be thrown (6x6 = 36). The combinations that yield a sum of 7 are 1 + 6, 2 + 5, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, 5 + 2, and 6 + 1: 6 different combinations. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 7 is 6/36, or 1/6. To find the probability that this will happen twice in a row, multiply 1/6 by 1/6 to get 1/36. Answer: B. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 OR probability:  If Events A and B are independent, the probability that Event A OR Event B occurs is equal to the probability that Event A occurs plus the probability that Event B occurs minus the probability that both Events A and B occur: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \ and \ B)\). This is basically the same as 2 overlapping sets formula: {total # of items in groups A or B} = {# of items in group A} + {# of items  in group B} - {# of items in A and B} . Note that if event are mutually exclusive then \(P(A \ and \ B)=0\) and the formula simplifies to: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B)\). Also note that when we say "A or B occurs" we include three possibilities: A occurs and B does not occur; B occurs and A does not occur; Both A and B occur. AND probability: When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events: \(P(A \ and \ B) = P(A)*P(B)\). This is basically the same as Principle of Multiplication : if one event can occur in \(m\) ways and a second can occur independently of the first in \(n\) ways, then the two events can occur in \(mn\) ways. BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION: Two dice are tossed once. The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 1. The probability of getting an even number at the first die is 1/2 (as the probability of even = the probability of odd = 1/2); 2. The probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/6^2, as there are 5 different favorable scenarios: (2,6), (6,2), (3,5), (5,3) and (4,4); 3. The probability of getting an even number at the first die AND a total of 8 is 3/6^2 (from above case); Hence, The probability of getting an even number at the first die OR a total of 8 is 1/2+5/36-3/36=20/36.

Remember that the "OR formula" is: P(A) OR P(B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) In this case, A and B can take place together, so the value of P(A and B) is greater than 0. _________________   "Life’s battle doesn’t always go to stronger or faster men; but sooner or later the man who wins is the one who thinks he can."

Why don't we make a difference between 4 on dice 1 and four on dice ? I mean why the combination 4'4'' is the same as 4''4' (apostrophe symbolizes the dice: ' = dice number one, '' = dice number two). I have encountered many probability problems, where events that are identical are differentiated. For example: Quote: A 5 meter long wire is cut into two pieces. The longer piece is then used to form a perimeter of a square. What is the probability that the area of the square will be more than 1 if the original wire is cut at an arbitrary point? 1/6 1/5 3/10 1/3 2/5 OA: [Reveal] Spoiler: (E) In the example above the probability is 2/5.

We can get combination of (2, 6) in two ways: 2 on die A and 6 on die B  OR  2 on die B and 6 on die A ; Whereas (4, 4) has only one combination: 4 on on die A and 4 on die B , it has no second combination, since 4 on die B and 4 on die A is exact same combination. nonameee wrote: I have encountered many probability problems, where events that are identical are differentiated.

Could you please explain the difference? This is completely different problem. In order the area of a square to be more than 1 the side of it must be more than 1, or the perimeter more than 4. So the longer piece must be more than 4. Look at the diagram. - --- - If the wire will be cut anywhere at the red region then the rest of the wire (longer piece) will be more than 4 meter long. The probability of that is 2/5 (2 red pieces out of 5). Answer: E.

The probability of getting an even [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     21 Feb 2012, 02:46      I have re-read my posts and I think it's clear now. Quote: why the probability of getting 'four' on both dices is 1/36 and not 1/18? Why don't we make a difference between 4 on die1 and four on die? This is because we fix dices one and two. Quote: A 5 meter long wire is cut into two pieces. The longer piece is then used to form a perimeter of a square. What is the probability that the area of the square will be more than 1 if the original wire is cut at an arbitrary point? This is because we can cut the wire from both ends. When we fix the ends, we can cut 1 m from the left, or we can cut 1 m from the right end. Both options are different since we have fixed the ends. Quote: When calculating probability, how should we know when to count the same instances and when not? We don't count twice the same instances of the fixed "property" (don't know how to call that). But if two fixed properties (e.g., two dices: die_1 = property_one, die_2 = property_two) yield the same result by taking various values, we need to count those options (as in the above example with dices producing the sum of 8). Bunuel, does the above make sense?                           Bunuel      Math Expert     V     Joined: 02 Sep 2009   Posts: 44512                            Re: Two dice are tossed once.

The probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/6^2, as there are 5 different favorable scenarios: (2,6), (6,2), (3,5), (5,3) and (4,4); Dear Bunuel, my question pertains to the quoted text. My reasoning to get sum 8 is: Select any 5 numbers from first dice ie. probability: 5/6 To make the sum 8, only a unique number is to be chosen from 2nd dice. Hence the probability of selecting 1 number in second dice is : 1/6 Probability for sum 8 is 5/6^2. However I multiplied this number by 2 since you can perform the same task by selecting the second dice first and choosing a corresponding unique value in 1st dice. Net probability is 5*2/6^2, but i believe this is wrong. Please let me know under what situations do we employ my understanding. Sorry if it is a silly question.

The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 When we roll two dice, there are 6 x 6 = 36 equally likely outcomes. From these 36 outcomes, we can get a total of 8 in the following ways: 6,2 2,6 4,4 5,3 3,5 The probability of each of these outcomes is 1/36, so the probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/36. The probability of getting an even number on the first die is 1/2. Recall that the probability of A or B is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Let’s concentrate on P(A and B), which includes outcomes that have an even first roll AND a total of 8. The probability that the first die is even and the total of the two dice is 8 is 3/36 since (6,2), (2,6), and (4,4) are 3 of the 36 outcomes in which the first die is even and the total is 8. Thus, the total probability of getting an even number on the first die OR a total of 8 is: 5/36 + 1/2 - 3/36 = 5/36 + 18/36 - 3/36 = 20/36 Answer: D _________________     Scott Woodbury-Stewart  Founder and CEO            GMAT Quant Self-Study Course  500+ lessons 3000+ practice problems 800+ HD solutions    TRY FOR $1                                  mtk10      Manager        B     Joined: 02 Jan 2017   Posts: 81   Location: Pakistan   Concentration: Finance, Technology   GMAT 1 : 650 Q47 V34     GPA: 3.41   WE: Business Development (Accounting)                       Re: Two dice are tossed once.

The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 OR probability:  If Events A and B are independent, the probability that Event A OR Event B occurs is equal to the probability that Event A occurs plus the probability that Event B occurs minus the probability that both Events A and B occur: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \ and \ B)\). This is basically the same as 2 overlapping sets formula: {total # of items in groups A or B} = {# of items in group A} + {# of items  in group B} - {# of items in A and B} . Note that if event are mutually exclusive then \(P(A \ and \ B)=0\) and the formula simplifies to: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B)\). Also note that when we say "A or B occurs" we include three possibilities: A occurs and B does not occur; B occurs and A does not occur; Both A and B occur. AND probability: When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events: \(P(A \ and \ B) = P(A)*P(B)\). This is basically the same as Principle of Multiplication : if one event can occur in \(m\) ways and a second can occur independently of the first in \(n\) ways, then the two events can occur in \(mn\) ways. BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION: Two dice are tossed once. The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 1. The probability of getting an even number at the first die is 1/2 (as the probability of even = the probability of odd = 1/2); 2. The probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/6^2, as there are 5 different favorable scenarios: (2,6), (6,2), (3,5), (5,3) and (4,4); 3. The probability of getting an even number at the first die AND a total of 8 is 3/6^2 (from above case); Hence, The probability of getting an even number at the first die OR a total of 8 is 1/2+5/36-3/36=20/36. Answer: D. As you have mentioned above When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events: \(P(A \ and \ B) = P(A)*P(B)\). Could you explain why can we not get probability of ( even number & total of 8)= by multiplying the two probabilities  ? Like this = 1/2 * 5/36? Or am i missing something quite simple here ( I feel like i am)                        Eulerelements      Intern        B     Joined: 08 Dec 2017   Posts: 17                      Re: Two dice are tossed once.

You have two dice, what is the probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7? Thanks.. First of all please note that this question is far beyond the GMAT scope. \(P(sum=3)=\frac{2}{36}=\frac{1}{18}\): either (1,2) or (2,1) out of total of 36 different combinations of two dice; \(P(sum=7)=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}\): (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), or (6,1); \(P(other \ sum)=1-(\frac{1}{18}+\frac{1}{6})=\frac{7}{9}\), probability of sums: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12; Winning scenarios: {sum=3} - we have sum of 3 on the first roll of two dice - \(P_1=\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; sum=3} - on the first roll we have other sum and sum of 3 on the second roll - \(P_2=\frac{7}{9}*\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; other sum; sum=3} - \(P_3=(\frac{7}{9})^2*\frac{1}{18}\); {other sum; other sum; other sum; sum=3} - \(P_4=(\frac{7}{9})^3*\frac{1}{18}\); ... So probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7 would be the sum of the above infinite series: \(P=\frac{1}{18}+\frac{7}{9}*\frac{1}{18}+(\frac{7}{9})^2*\frac{1}{18}+(\frac{7}{9})^3*\frac{1}{18}+...=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{7}{9}+(\frac{7}{9})^2+(\frac{7}{9})^3+...)=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{\frac{7}{9}}{1-\frac{7}{9}})=\frac{1}{18}(1+\frac{7}{2})=\frac{1}{4}\) (for geometric progression with common ratio \(|q|<1\), the sum of the progression: \(b_1, b_2, ...\) is \(Sum=\frac{b_1}{1-q}\).). OR: As \(P(sum=3)=\frac{2}{36}\) and \(P(sum=7)=\frac{6}{36}\) then getting the sum of 7 is 3 times more likely than getting the sum of 3, so the sum of 3 has 1 chance out of 4 to get first out of any number of tries, so \(P=\frac{1}{4}\) or \(P=\frac{\frac{2}{36}}{\frac{2}{36}+\frac{6}{36}}=\frac{1}{4}\). Hope it's clear. _________________   New to the Math Forum? Please read this: Ultimate GMAT Quantitative Megathread | All You Need for Quant | PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW:  12 Rules for Posting!!!

However I have a few questions: I understand up to P(other sum). How can you conclude the winning scenario is other sum then sum 3? I know it's a possible case, but why is it (other sum, sum 3) will lead to a (other sum, sum 3, then sum 7). It could be (other sum, sum 3, sum 8) - after 3 rollings, while what we expect is sum 7. Therefore the (other sum, other sum,..., sum 3) could be a wrong case. On the other hand, if we can conclude other sum, other sum,..., sum 3 is a winning scenario, have we assume the probability of sum 7 and other sum but not 7 are the same, while there are different? I don't understand this sentence too "So probability of rolling a sum of 3 BEFORE rolling a sum of 7 would be the sum of the above infinite series" - how can you conclude it's the sum that series, how about if we have an AFTER word? What is the difference between BEFORE and AFTER? Edit: I like your second approach, by comparing the fraction of the probability of 2 events we can say P = 1/4, but I still don't understand the word BEFORE.. What if they ask for AFTER? Will we still compare the 2 probabilities?

Will we still compare the 2 probabilities? When we roll 2 dice the sum can be 3, 7, or some other number (not 3 and not 7). The questions asks for the cases when we get the sum of 3 BEFORE the sum of 7. For example why the cases I wrote are the winning scenarios: {sum=3} - means that right on the first throw we have sum of 3, so we have 3 before 7 (as no 7 at all); {other sum; sum=3} - first roll not 7 and not 3, so we can continue. On the second throw we have sum of 3, so again 3 before 7 - OK; {other sum; other sum; sum=3} - sum of 3 on the third roll; {other sum; other sum; other sum; sum=3} - sum of 3 on the fourth roll; .... {other sum; other sum; other sum; ..., other sum on the nth roll; sum of 3 on the (n+1)th roll} - out of n+1 rolls we have other sum for the rolls from 1 to n and sum of 3 on the (n+1)th roll, still 3 before 7 - OK; ... The above can be continued infinitely, and all above case represent the scenario when we have the sum of 3 BEFORE we have the sum of 7 (which will eventually occur on some roll afterwards). So the probability of getting 3 before 7 would be the sum of the probabilities of the above events. Hope it's clear. Anyway: you won't need this for GMAT, so don't worry too much. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

However I think you miss the scenario where sum=7 occurs before sum=3. For example, 1st time sum=7, 2nd time sum=3, so the probability must be 6/36 * 2/36. You assumed that sum 7 never happens before sum 3 so you take the probability of other sum (7/9) to calculate. Am I wrong?

I'm not assuming that 7 doesn't occur before 3 rather than I'm only interested to count the probability of the cases when 3 occur before 7 as this is what the question is asking, that's why I'm not considering the cases when 7 occur before 3. _________________   New to the Math Forum?

Answer is E > 25/100  Basically, if the numbers on two of the dice are decided, then there is only one value of the third die that is possible. So you have to find only those combinations of two dice that yield a sum of 6 or above. e.g. If the value on the 1st die is 1, then you have two possible outcomes - 5 or 6 on the 2nd die. Similarly, for a value of 2 on the first die, you have 3 possible outcomes (4, 5, 6) and so on... However, if you get a value of 6 on the first die, then you can have only 5 possible outcomes.  The total number of outcomes comes out to be (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 5) = 25.  Probability is 25/216! _________________  Uh uh. I know what you're thinking. "Is the answer A, B, C, D or E?" Well to tell you the truth in all this excitement I kinda lost track myself. But you've gotta ask yourself one question: "Do I feel lucky?"

Start checking from the smaller or bigger numbers on the dice. We will check from bigger numbers working downwards: start with 6, it has the following options: (6,5,1), (6,4,2), (6,3,3). Now pass on to 5: (5,5,2), (5,4,3). Now 4: (4,4,4). And that’s it, these are all number combinations that are possible, if you go on to 3, you will notice that you need to use 4, 5 or 6, that you have already considered (the same goes for 2 and 1). Now analyze every option: 6,5,1 has 6 options (6,5,1), (6,1,5), (5,1,6), (5,6,1), (1,6,5), (1,5,6). So do (6,4,2) and (5,4,3). Options (6,3,3) and (5,5,2) have 3 options each: (5,5,2), (5,2,5) and (2,5,5). The same goes for (6,3,3). The last option (4,4,4) has only one option. The total is 3*6+2*3+1=18+6+1 = 25 out of 216 (6x6x6) options. 5,5,2= (552),(255),(525) Like= 336                          Glengubbay1      Intern           Joined: 06 Oct 2014   Posts: 12   Concentration: Finance   Schools:  HBS '19 , Wharton '19 , CBS '19    GMAT 1 : 700 Q45 V41     GPA: 3.8                      What is the probability of getting a sum of 12 when rolling [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     25 Aug 2015, 13:56      An easy way to visualise it is by drawing a Binomial tree, we've all done those in school and if each branch has a 1/2 probability, you'll find that there's only 3 ways to get there. (1/2)^3 x 3 = 3/8 Hope it helps!

Similarly, how will you adjust for the sum of 10? There will be cases where the split is like this: (7, 0, 0) or (6, 1, 0). These do not work since the maximum a die can show is 6. So you need to remove 9 cases (3 arrangements of 7, 0, 0 and 6 arrangements of 6, 1, 0)                          ShashankDave      Senior Manager        G     Joined: 03 Apr 2013   Posts: 291   Location: India   Concentration: Marketing, Finance   Schools:  Simon '20    GMAT 1 : 740 Q50 V41     GPA: 3                       Re: What is the probability of getting a sum of 12 when rolling [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     09 Jul 2017, 02:53       thefibonacci wrote: anhlukas wrote: What is the probability of getting a sum of 12 when rolling 3 dice simultaneously?

dice theory --- for teachers    Single dice  Sum of two dice  Other conditions with two dice   Either dice is a particular number  Neither dice is a particular number  Both dice are the same particular number  At least one dice isn't a particular number  The highest dice is a particular number  The lowest dice is a particular number  The dice have two particular numbers  The dice are not either particular number  The dice are two particular numbers    More than two dice  Die or dice?     Single dice  Click here for how to write a probability.  Throwing dice is more complicated than tossing coins , as there are more than 2 values. If you throw a single dice, then it can fall six ways, each of which is equally likely if the dice is true. So the probability of getting one particular value is 1/6 . If you want either of two values it is 2/6 or 1/3 , and so on.    Sum of two dice  It gets more interesting when you have two dice. One thing that you can do is work out what the total of the dice is. The dice experiment allows you to simulate throwing pairs of dice and see what the result is. This is a good introduction to probability, since you can see which combinations are more likely. But the real world, or even a simulated real world, never matches completely with calculated probability. So how do we calculate it? The first thing is to work out what the range is. You can't have a total less than 2 (both dice being 1) and you can't have a total more than 12 (both dice being 6). The easiest way to see what the probabilities is to write out the possible totals. There are 36 of them in all (6 x 6).   Total on dice Pairs of dice Probability  2 1 + 1 1/36 = 3%  3 1 + 2 , 2 + 1 2/36 = 6%  4 1 + 3 , 2 + 2 , 3 + 1 3/36 = 8%  5 1 + 4 , 2 + 3 , 3 + 2 , 4 + 1 4/36 = 11%  6 1 + 5 , 2 + 4 , 3 + 3 , 4 + 2 , 5 + 1 5/36 = 14%  7 1 + 6 , 2 + 5 , 3 + 4 , 4 + 3 , 5 + 2 , 6 + 1 6/36 = 17%  8 2 + 6 , 3 + 5 , 4 + 4 , 5 + 3 , 6 + 2 5/36 = 14%  9 3 + 6 , 4 + 5 , 5 + 4 , 6 + 3 4/36 = 11%  10 4 + 6 , 5 + 5 , 6 + 4 3/36 = 8%  11 5 + 6 , 6 + 5 2/36 = 6%  12 6 + 6 1/36 = 3%   The percentages above are rounded. Compare these with the dice experiment . It won't match exactly, although the more throws you do, the closer it will get.    Other conditions with two dice  There are plenty of other conditions that you can have with two dice. Often, the easiest way to get the probability of a condition is to list all possible throws, and count the ones that fit the condition. The best way to make sure you have remembered all throws is to list them in a 6 x 6 table, like below.  Imagine two dice, red and green. This table shows all possible throws of these dice, with red numbers for the red dice, and green for the green dice. The background is black if the condition is satisfied. You can change the numbers and the condition to see what happens. You find the probability of this condition by counting the black squares, and dividing by 36 (all possible throws).    First number:  1  2  3  4  5  6   Either dice is  Neither dice is  Both dice are  At least one dice isn't  The highest dice is  The lowest dice is  Second number:  1  2  3  4  5  6   Dice are or  Dice are not and not  Dice are and      Probability of this condition =  See below for an explanation     Either dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice being a particular number is 1/6 . You would assume that it would be twice as likely that either of two dice being a particular number, or 1/3 , but this would be wrong. If you select the first condition above, you will see why. While there are six conditions where one dice is a number, and six conditions where the other dice is that number, there is one condition in both. So the probability is (12-1)/36 or 11/36 .  There is a better way to calculate this. If you click on the second condition, then back on the first, you will find that they are opposites of each other. That means that their probabilities add up to one. The second condition is easier to calculate directly (see below), as 25/36 . So this probability is (36-25)/36 = 11/36 .   Neither dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice not being a particular number is 5/6 . The probability of two dice not being a that number is 5/6 x 5/6 = 25/36 . You can do this as they don't overlap as all (the correct term is that they are independent events).   Both dice are the same particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice being a particular number is 1/6 . The probability of two dice being the same particular number is 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 . This is not the same as saying that both dice are the same number. There are six different possible numbers, so that would be 6/36 or 1/6 .   At least one dice isn't a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  This is the opposite of both dice being the same particular number, so the probabilities will add up to one. So the probability of at least one dice isn't a particular number = 1 - (1/36) = 35/36 .   The highest dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  This is a fun conditions, but a little strange to work out! Try experimenting with different numbers, and you will get different collections of throws fitting the conditions, and so different probabilities. To take an example, considering one dice, if the particular number is 5 then there are 5 throws which fit the condition. There are another 5 for the other dice, and there is one overlap, so the result is (5 + 5 - 1)/36 = 9/36 or 1/4 . But this varies for other numbers.   The lowest dice is a particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probabilities vary considering what the number is. But the probability of the lowest dice being a particular number is the same as the probability of the highest dice being six minus that particular number.   The dice have two particular numbers  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  Like the first condition, there are two ways to work this out. The first is doing it directly. Each dice has 6 throws for each number, but there are four overlaps. So the probability is (4 x 6 - 4)/36 = 20/36 .  An easier way is to realise that this condition is the opposite of the next one, dice are not either number. That probability is 16/36 so this one is 1 - 16/36 = 20/36 or 5/9 .   The dice are not either particular number  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  The probability of one dice not being either of two numbers is 4/6 , so the probability of both dice fitting this condition is 4/6 x 4/6 = 16/36 . We can do this as the conditions don't overlap, so they are independent events.   The dice are two particular numbers  Return to interactive exercise for conditions  There are only two ways that two dice can have two values (try the exercise above to see why), so the probability is 2/36 or 1/18 .   More than two dice  As the number of dice increase, then the different conditions can become more complicated. You can work out some simply.  The easiest is the probability of a number of dice being a particular number. For n dice, this is 1/(6 n ) . For example, the probability for throwing 5 dice and getting them all sixes is 1/(6 5 ) = 1/(6x6x6x6x6) = 1/7776 = 0.000128 or 7775 to 1 .  You can work out what is the chance of getting various numbers when throwing several dice (or one dice several times), but you do it in a back-to-front way, as above . For example, if you throw three dice, what is the chance of one of the dice getting less than five? This means that one of the dice (at least) will be a one, two, three or four. Now this is quite hard to work out directly. What we can do is work out the opposite. The chance of one dice not getting less than five means the chance of it getting a five or six, and this is 2/6 , or 1/3 . But we need all dice to get this. This is 1/3 x 1/3 x 1/3 or 1/27 . This was the opposite of what we want, so we must take it away from one. 1 - 1/27 or 26/27 which is about 96% .   Die or dice  People occasionally point out to me that the singular of 'dice' is 'die'. Yes, I know that. However, a lot of people don't, and I prefer to use 'dice' since then my meaning is clear. It stops them wondering why I'm talking about dying! However, if you think that I should be accurate rather than comprehensible, I'm afraid that the authorities are not on your side. The Oxford English Dictionary says "The form dice (used as pl. and sing.) is of much more frequent occurrence in gaming and related senses than the singular die." I think that probability is related to gaming! It gives a quote: 1474 CAXTON Chesse 132 "He caste thre dyse and on eche dyse was a sise."

What is the probability of rolling the sum of 7? What about 7 OR 11?  Found 2 solutions by Greenfinch, drk : Answer by Greenfinch(383)   ( Show Source ): You can put this solution on YOUR website! To do this use a Sample Space diagram. With it the problem is ridiculously simple, without it it is not at all easy. Number is the addition of the values Value of first die across top, value of second die down the side 1   2   3   4   5   6 ----------------------- 1 | 2   3   4   5   6   7 2 | 3   4   5   6   7   8 3 | 4   5   6   7   8   9 4 | 5   6   7   8   9  10 5 | 6   7   8   9  10  11 6 | 7   8   9  10  11  12 There are 6 x 6 or 36 options, all are equally likely, 7 occurs 6 times, so the chances are 6/36 or 1/6. 11 occurs 2 times so chances are 2/36 or 1/18. 7 or 11 are 8 of the 36 options so 8/36 or 2/9. You can even find out chance of a prime number. the 2,3,5,7,11 options add up to 15, so 15/36 or 5/12 is the chance of that.  Answer by drk(1908)   ( Show Source ): You can put this solution on YOUR website! There are 6 ways to get a 7 and a total of 36 ways for 2 dice, so P(7) = 6/36 = 1/6 -- There are 2 ways to get a sum of 11. So, P(7 OR 11) = 6/36 + 2/36 = 8/36 = 2/9. -- OR means add (+) AND means multiply (*)
