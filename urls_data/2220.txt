   Probability  The probability of an event is a number describing the chance that the event will happen. An event
that is certain to happen has a probability of 1. An event that cannot possibly happen has
a probability of zero. If there is a chance that an event will happen, then
its probability is between zero and 1.    Examples of Events:   tossing a coin and it landing on heads  tossing a coin and it landing on tails  rolling a '3' on a die rolling a number > 4 on a die it rains two days in a row drawing a card from the suit of clubs guessing a certain number between 000 and 999 (lottery)    Events that are certain:     If it is Thursday, the probability that tomorrow is Friday is certain,
    therefore the probability is 1. If you are sixteen, the probability of you turning seventeen on your
    next birthday is 1. This is a certain event.      Events that are uncertain:     The probability that tomorrow is Friday if today is Monday is 0. The probability that you will be seventeen on your next birthday, if
    you were just born is 0.      Let's take a closer look at tossing the coin. When you
toss a coin, there are two possible outcomes , "heads" or "tails."    Examples of outcomes:   When rolling a die for a board game, the outcomes possible are 1,2,3,4,5,
  and 6. The outcomes when choosing the days of a week are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. When selecting a door to be chosen behind on the game show "Let's
  Make a Deal," the outcome of the choices is door 1, door 2, and door
  3.    The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment
is the sample space for the experiment.   A die is rolled and the number on the top face is recorded. All the
  integers from 1 to 6 are possible. So S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. A pair of dice are rolled and the sum of the numbers on the top faces
  is recorded. The smallest sum is 1 + 1 = 2; the largest is 6 + 6 = 12;
  and all the integers in-between are possible. So S = {2, 3, 4, ...,
  11, 12}.  The two outcomes of tossing a coin are equally likely , which means that each has
the same chance of happening. When all outcomes of an event are equally
likely, the probability that the event will happen is given by the ration
below.   When looking at the probability of the event that the coin
lands on tail we get the following:          These events are equally likely to happen:   When there is a 50% chance of rain, that means that there
  a chance that it might rain, but that there is also a chance that it might
  not rain. These chances are the same so the event is equally likely to
  happen.  When one rolls a game die, he/she has exactly the same
  chance of landing on any of the six sides. Therefore the probability of
  landing on any one specific side would be 1/6. This is also true for any
  spinner. Say a spinner is divided into 10 sections. Then there is an equally
  likely chance that the spinner can land on any of the sections. Thus the
  probability for the spinner to land in any designated section is 1/10.  The probability of selecting one of the three doors on
  the game show is also equally likely. There is no bias over the contestants
  decision so each door has a probability of 1/3 being chosen. This is true
  if there are no arrows pointing towards one of the doors.    When the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome
of a second event, the events are independent . When the outcome of one event does affect the outcome of the
second event, the events are dependent . Let's look at the following five examples. Decide which pair
of events are dependent or independent.  1. Toss a coin. Then roll a number cube (die).  2. Choose a bracelet and put it on. Choose another bracelet.  3. Select a card. Do not replace it. Then select another
card.  4. Select a card. Replace it. Select another card.  5. Pick one flower from a garden, then pick another.          The events above that are independent are numbers 1 and
4.  Probability of Two Independent
Events   Given a coin and a die, what is the probability
of tossing a head and rolling a 5?       The events above that are dependent events are numbers
2, 3, and 5.  Probability of Two Dependent
Events   Given a deck of cards, what is the probability
that the second card drawn will be from the same suit if the first card
drawn is the Queen of Hearts?     The
Counting Principle  The number of outcomes of an event is the
product of the number of outcomes for each stage of the event.    Let's suppose that we want to find out how many different
license plates are possible, when the license plate is composed of three
digits then three letters. To do this you can use the counting principle .
The product below gives the number of different plates possible.    We can use this same principle even if there are stipulations
on the problem. For example say that a number or letter can only be used
once.   What if we wanted to know which plate system provided more
possible outcomes, one with five letters or one with seven digits?    Five letters:  Seven digits:    So we see by using the counting principle that there are
more possibilities if we use five letters instead of seven digits.     Statistics

A die has 6 sides, 1 side contain the number 6 that give us 1 wanted outcome in 6 possible outcomes.   Independent events: Two events are independent when the outcome of the first event does not influence the outcome of the second event.  When we determine the probability of two independent events we multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event.  $$P(X \, and \, Y)=P(X)\cdot P(Y)$$  To find the probability of an independent event we are using this rule:   Example  If one has three dice what is the probability of getting three 4s?  The probability of getting a 4 on one die is 1/6  The probability of getting 3 4s is:  $$P\left ( 4\, and\, 4\, and\, 4 \right )=\frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{216}$$  When the outcome affects the second outcome, which is what we called dependent events.  Dependent events: Two events are dependent when the outcome of the first event influences the outcome of the second event. The probability of two dependent events is the product of the probability of X and the probability of Y AFTER X occurs.  $$P(X \, and \, Y)=P(X)\cdot P(Y\: after\: x)$$   Example  What is the probability for you to choose two red cards in a deck of cards?  A deck of cards has 26 black and 26 red cards. The probability of choosing a red card randomly is:  $$P\left ( red \right )=\frac{26}{52}=\frac{1}{2}$$  The probability of choosing a second red card from the deck is now:  $$P\left ( red \right )=\frac{25}{51}$$  The probability:  $$P\left ( 2\,red \right )=\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{25}{51}=\frac{25}{102}$$  Two events are mutually exclusive when two events cannot happen at the same time. The probability that one of the mutually exclusive events occur is the sum of their individual probabilities.  $$P(X \, or \, Y)=P(X)+ P(Y)$$  An example of two mutually exclusive events is a wheel of fortune. Let's say you win a bar of chocolate if you end up in a red or a pink field.   What is the probability that the wheel stops at red or pink?  P(red or pink)=P(red)+P(pink)  $$P\left (red \right )=\frac{2}{8}=\frac{1}{4}$$  $$P\left (pink \right )=\frac{1}{8}$$  $$P\left ( red\, or\, pink \right )=\frac{1}{8}+\frac{2}{8}=\frac{3}{8}$$  Inclusive events are events that can happen at the same time. To find the probability of an inclusive event we first add the probabilities of the individual events and then subtract the probability of the two events happening at the same time.  $$P\left (X \, or \, Y \right )=P\left (X \right )+ P\left (Y \right )-P\left (X \, and \, Y \right )$$   Example  What is the probability of drawing a black card or a ten in a deck of cards?  There are 4 tens in a deck of cards P(10) = 4/52  There are 26 black cards P(black) = 26/52  There are 2 black tens P(black and 10) = 2/52  $$P\left ( black\, or\, ten \right )=\frac{4}{52}+\frac{26}{52}-\frac{2}{52}=\frac{30}{52}-\frac{2}{52}=\frac{28}{52}=\frac{7}{13}$$   Video lesson  At Ann's 7-years olds party all 20 invited guests are going to get some candy from the fish pond. In 12 of the bags there is an extra chocolate bar. Tina and James are first and second out, what is the probability that they both get a bag with an extra chocolate bar?

[1] A single outcome may be an element of many different events, [2] and different events in an experiment are usually not equally likely, since they may include very different groups of outcomes. [3] An event defines a complementary event , namely the complementary set (the event not occurring), and together these define a Bernoulli trial : did the event occur or not?  Typically, when the sample space is finite, any subset of the sample space is an event ( i . e . all elements of the power set of the sample space are defined as events). However, this approach does not work well in cases where the sample space is uncountably infinite . So, when defining a probability space it is possible, and often necessary, to exclude certain subsets of the sample space from being events (see Events in probabiliity spaces , below).     Contents    1  A simple example  2  Events in probability spaces  3  A note on notation  4  See also  5  Notes  6  External links     A simple example [ edit ]  If we assemble a deck of 52 playing cards with no jokers, and draw a single card from the deck, then the sample space is a 52-element set, as each card is a possible outcome. An event, however, is any subset of the sample space, including any singleton set (an elementary event ), the empty set (an impossible event, with probability zero) and the sample space itself (a certain event, with probability one). Other events are proper subsets of the sample space that contain multiple elements. So, for example, potential events include:     A Euler diagram of an event. B is the sample space and A is an event. By the ratio of their areas, the probability of A is approximately 0.4.     "Red and black at the same time without being a joker" (0 elements),  "The 5 of Hearts" (1 element),  "A King" (4 elements),  "A Face card" (12 elements),  "A Spade" (13 elements),  "A Face card or a red suit" (32 elements),  "A card" (52 elements).   Since all events are sets, they are usually written as sets (e.g. {1, 2, 3}), and represented graphically using Venn diagrams . In the situation where each outcome in the sample space Ω is equally likely, the probability     P    {\displaystyle P}   of an event A is the following formula :        P   (  A  )  =      |   A   |      |   Ω   |          (    alternatively:     Pr  (  A  )  =      |   A   |      |   Ω   |       )     {\displaystyle \mathrm {P} (A)={\frac {|A|}{|\Omega |}}\,\ \left({\text{alternatively:}}\ \Pr(A)={\frac {|A|}{|\Omega |}}\right)}     This rule can readily be applied to each of the example events above.  Events in probability spaces [ edit ]  Defining all subsets of the sample space as events works well when there are only finitely many outcomes, but gives rise to problems when the sample space is infinite. For many standard probability distributions , such as the normal distribution , the sample space is the set of real numbers or some subset of the real numbers . Attempts to define probabilities for all subsets of the real numbers run into difficulties when one considers 'badly behaved' sets, such as those that are nonmeasurable . Hence, it is necessary to restrict attention to a more limited family of subsets. For the standard tools of probability theory, such as joint and conditional probabilities , to work, it is necessary to use a σ-algebra , that is, a family closed under complementation and countable unions of its members. The most natural choice is the Borel measurable set derived from unions and intersections of intervals. However, the larger class of Lebesgue measurable sets proves more useful in practice.  In the general measure-theoretic description of probability spaces , an event may be defined as an element of a selected σ-algebra of subsets of the sample space. Under this definition, any subset of the sample space that is not an element of the σ-algebra is not an event, and does not have a probability. With a reasonable specification of the probability space, however, all events of interest are elements of the σ-algebra.  A note on notation [ edit ]  Even though events are subsets of some sample space Ω, they are often written as propositional formulas involving random variables . For example, if X is a real-valued random variable defined on the sample space Ω, the event       {  ω  ∈  Ω  ∣  u  <  X  (  ω  )  ≤  v  }     {\displaystyle \{\omega \in \Omega \mid u<X(\omega )\leq v\}\,}     can be written more conveniently as, simply,       u  <  X  ≤  v   .    {\displaystyle u<X\leq v\,.}     This is especially common in formulas for a probability , such as       Pr  (  u  <  X  ≤  v  )  =  F  (  v  )  −  F  (  u  )   .    {\displaystyle \Pr(u<X\leq v)=F(v)-F(u)\,.}     The set  u < X ≤ v is an example of an inverse image under the mapping  X because     ω  ∈   X   −  1    (  (  u  ,  v  ]  )    {\displaystyle \omega \in X^{-1}((u,v])}   if and only if     u  <  X  (  ω  )  ≤  v    {\displaystyle u<X(\omega )\leq v}   .

            events alongside each other. How these different events relate to each other determines
            the methods and rules to follow when we're studying their probabilities.  Events can be pided into two major categories dependent or Independent events.  Independent Events  When two events are said to be independent of each other, what this means is that
            the probability that one event occurs in no way affects the probability of the other
            event occurring. An example of two independent events is as follows; say you rolled
            a die and flipped a coin. The probability of getting any number face on the die
            in no way influences the probability of getting a head or a tail on the coin.  Dependent Events  When two events are said to be dependent, the probability of one event occurring
            influences the likelihood of the other event.  For example, if you were to draw a two cards from a deck of 52 cards. If on your
            first draw you had an ace and you put that aside, the probability of drawing an
            ace on the second draw is greatly changed because you drew an ace the first time.
            Let's calculate these different probabilities to see what's going on.  There are 4 Aces in a deck of 52 cards    On your first draw, the probability of getting an ace is given by:    If we don't return this card into the deck, the probability of drawing an ace on
            the second pick is given by        As you can clearly see, the above two probabilities are different, so we say that
            the two events are dependent. The likelihood of the second event depends on what
            happens in the first event.  Conditional Probability  We have already defined dependent and independent events and seen how probability
            of one event relates to the probability of the other event.  Having those concepts in mind, we can now look at conditional probability.  Conditional probability deals with further defining dependence of events by looking
            at probability of an event given that some other event first occurs.  Conditional probability is denoted by the following:    The above is read as the probability that B occurs given that A has already occurred .  The above is mathematically defined as:    Set Theory in Probability  A sample space is defined as a universal set of all possible outcomes from a given
            experiment.  Given two events A and B and given that these events are part of a
            sample space S . This sample space is represented as a set as in the diagram
            below.    The entire sample space of S is given by:    Remember the following from set theory:      The different regions of the set S can be explained as using the rules of
            probability.  Rules of Probability  When dealing with more than one event, there are certain rules that we must follow
            when studying probability of these events. These rules depend greatly on whether
            the events we are looking at are Independent or dependent on each other.  First acknowledge that    Multiplication Rule (A∩B)  This region is referred to as 'A intersection B' and in probability; this region
            refers to the event that both A and B happen. When we use the word and we are referring to multiplication, thus A and B can be thought
            of as AxB or (using dot notation which is more popular in probability) A • B  If A and B are dependent events, the probability of this event happening
            can be calculated as shown below:    If A and B are independent events, the probability of this event happening
            can be calculated as shown below:    Conditional probability for two independent events can be redefined using the relationship
            above to become:        The above is consistent with the definition of independent events, the occurrence
            of event A in no way influences the occurrence of event B , and so
            the probability that event B occurs given that event A has occurred
            is the same as the probability of event B .  Additive Rule (A∪B)  In probability we refer to the addition operator ( + ) as or . Thus when
            we want to we want to define some event such that the event can be A or B, to find
            the probability of that event:      Thus it follows that:    But remember from set theory that and from the way we defined our sample space above:    and that:   So we can now redefine out event as     The above is sometimes referred to as the subtraction rule.  Mutual Exclusivity  Certain special pairs of events have a unique relationship referred to as mutual
            exclusivity.  Two events are said to be mutually exclusive if they can't occur at the same time.
            For a given sample space, its either one or the other but not both. As a consequence,
            mutually exclusive events have their probability defined as follows:    An example of mutually exclusive events are the outcomes of a fair coin flip. When
            you flip a fair coin, you either get a head or a tail but not both, we can prove
            that these events are mutually exclusive by adding their probabilities:    For any given pair of events, if the sum of their probabilities is equal to one,
            then those two events are mutually exclusive.  Rules of Probability for Mutually Exclusive Events    Multiplication Rule  From the definition of mutually exclusive events, we should quickly conclude the
                    following:      Addition Rule  As we defined above, the addition rule applies to mutually exclusive events as follows:      Subtraction Rule  From the addition rule above, we can conclude that the subtraction rule for mutually
                    exclusive events takes the form;      Conditional Probability for Mutually Exclusive Events  We have defined conditional probability with the following equation:    We can redefine the above using the multiplication rule    hence    Below is a venn diagram of a set containing two mutually exclusive events A and B .

An event
that is certain to happen has a probability of 1. An event that cannot possibly happen has
a probability of zero. If there is a chance that an event will happen, then
its probability is between zero and 1.    Examples of Events:   tossing a coin and it landing on heads  tossing a coin and it landing on tails  rolling a '3' on a die rolling a number > 4 on a die it rains two days in a row drawing a card from the suit of clubs guessing a certain number between 000 and 999 (lottery)    Events that are certain:     If it is Thursday, the probability that tomorrow is Friday is certain,
    therefore the probability is 1. If you are sixteen, the probability of you turning seventeen on your
    next birthday is 1. This is a certain event.      Events that are uncertain:     The probability that tomorrow is Friday if today is Monday is 0. The probability that you will be seventeen on your next birthday, if
    you were just born is 0.      Let's take a closer look at tossing the coin. When you
toss a coin, there are two possible outcomes , "heads" or "tails."    Examples of outcomes:   When rolling a die for a board game, the outcomes possible are 1,2,3,4,5,
  and 6. The outcomes when choosing the days of a week are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. When selecting a door to be chosen behind on the game show "Let's
  Make a Deal," the outcome of the choices is door 1, door 2, and door
  3.    The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment
is the sample space for the experiment.   A die is rolled and the number on the top face is recorded. All the
  integers from 1 to 6 are possible. So S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. A pair of dice are rolled and the sum of the numbers on the top faces
  is recorded. The smallest sum is 1 + 1 = 2; the largest is 6 + 6 = 12;
  and all the integers in-between are possible. So S = {2, 3, 4, ...,
  11, 12}.  The two outcomes of tossing a coin are equally likely , which means that each has
the same chance of happening. When all outcomes of an event are equally
likely, the probability that the event will happen is given by the ration
below.   When looking at the probability of the event that the coin
lands on tail we get the following:          These events are equally likely to happen:   When there is a 50% chance of rain, that means that there
  a chance that it might rain, but that there is also a chance that it might
  not rain. These chances are the same so the event is equally likely to
  happen.  When one rolls a game die, he/she has exactly the same
  chance of landing on any of the six sides. Therefore the probability of
  landing on any one specific side would be 1/6. This is also true for any
  spinner. Say a spinner is divided into 10 sections. Then there is an equally
  likely chance that the spinner can land on any of the sections. Thus the
  probability for the spinner to land in any designated section is 1/10.  The probability of selecting one of the three doors on
  the game show is also equally likely. There is no bias over the contestants
  decision so each door has a probability of 1/3 being chosen. This is true
  if there are no arrows pointing towards one of the doors.    When the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome
of a second event, the events are independent . When the outcome of one event does affect the outcome of the
second event, the events are dependent . Let's look at the following five examples. Decide which pair
of events are dependent or independent.  1. Toss a coin. Then roll a number cube (die).  2. Choose a bracelet and put it on. Choose another bracelet.  3. Select a card. Do not replace it. Then select another
card.  4. Select a card. Replace it. Select another card.  5. Pick one flower from a garden, then pick another.          The events above that are independent are numbers 1 and
4.  Probability of Two Independent
Events   Given a coin and a die, what is the probability
of tossing a head and rolling a 5?       The events above that are dependent events are numbers
2, 3, and 5.  Probability of Two Dependent
Events   Given a deck of cards, what is the probability
that the second card drawn will be from the same suit if the first card
drawn is the Queen of Hearts?     The
Counting Principle  The number of outcomes of an event is the
product of the number of outcomes for each stage of the event.    Let's suppose that we want to find out how many different
license plates are possible, when the license plate is composed of three
digits then three letters. To do this you can use the counting principle .
The product below gives the number of different plates possible.    We can use this same principle even if there are stipulations
on the problem. For example say that a number or letter can only be used
once.   What if we wanted to know which plate system provided more
possible outcomes, one with five letters or one with seven digits?    Five letters:  Seven digits:    So we see by using the counting principle that there are
more possibilities if we use five letters instead of seven digits.     Statistics

Advanced          Show Ads  Hide Ads  About Ads                   Probability: Independent Events   Life is full of random events!  You need to get a "feel" for them to be a smart and successful person.  The toss of a coin, throwing  dice and  lottery draws are all examples of  random events.  Sometimes an event can affect the next event.   Example: taking colored marbles from a bag: as you take each marble there are less marbles left in the bag, so the probabilities change.   We call those Dependent Events , because what happens depends on what happened before (learn more about this at Conditional probability ).  But otherwise they are Independent Events ...  Independent Events   Independent Events are not affected by previous events.  This is an important idea!  A coin does not "know"  it came up heads before.  And each toss of a coin is a perfect isolated thing.   Example: You toss a coin and it comes up "Heads" three times ... what is the chance that the next toss will also be a "Head"?  The chance is simply ½ (or 0.5) just like ANY toss of the coin.  What it did in the past will not affect the current toss!   Some people think "it is overdue for a Tail", but really truly the next toss of the coin is totally independent of any previous tosses.  Saying "a Tail is due", or "just one more go, my luck is due"			is called The Gambler's Fallacy   Of course your luck may change, because each toss of the coin has an equal chance.  Probability of Independent Events  "Probability" (or  "Chance") is how likely something is to happen.  So how do we calculate probability?   Probability of an event happening =  Number of ways it can happen  Total number of outcomes         Example: what is the probability of getting a "Head" when tossing a coin?  Number of ways it can happen: 1 (Head)  Total number of outcomes: 2 (Head and Tail)  So the probability =  1  2  = 0.5     Example: what is the probability of getting a "4" or "6" when rolling a die?  Number of ways it can happen: 2 ("4" and  "6")  Total number of outcomes: 6 ("1",  "2", "3",  "4", "5" and  "6")  So the probability =  2  6  =  1  3  = 0.333...   Ways of Showing Probability  Probability goes from 0 (imposssible) to 1 (certain):   It is often shown as a decimal or fraction .   Example: the probability of getting a "Head" when tossing a coin:   As a decimal: 0.5  As a fraction: 1/2  As a percentage: 50%  Or sometimes like this: 1-in-2    Two or More Events  We can calculate the chances of two or more independent events by multiplying the chances.   Example: Probability of 3 Heads in a Row  For each toss of a coin a "Head" has a probability of 0.5:   And so the chance of getting 3 Heads in a row is 0.125   So each toss of a coin  has a ½ chance of being Heads, but lots of Heads in a row is unlikely.   Example: Why is it  unlikely to get, say, 7 heads in a row, when each toss of a coin  has a ½ chance of being Heads?  Because we are asking two different questions:  Question 1:  What is the probability of 7 heads in a row?  Answer: ½×½×½×½×½×½×½ = 0.0078125 (less than 1%).  Question 2:  Given that we have just got 6 heads in a row, what is the probability   that the next toss is also a head?  Answer: ½ , as the previous tosses don't affect the next toss.   You can have a play with the Quincunx to see how lots of independent effects can still have a pattern.  Notation  We use "P" to mean "Probability Of",  So, for Independent Events:  P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)  Probability of A and B equals the probability of A times the probability of B   Example: your boss (to be fair) randomly assigns everyone an extra 2 hours work on  weekend evenings between 4 and midnight.  What are the chances you get  Saturday between 6 and 8?   Day: there are two days on the weekend, so P(Saturday) = 0.5  Time: you want the 2 hours of 6-to-8, out of the 8 hours of 4-to-midnight):  P(Your Time) = 2/8 = 0.25  And:    P(Saturday and Your Time)  = P(Saturday) × P(Your Time)      = 0.5 × 0.25      = 0.125    Or a 12.5% Chance  (Note: we could ALSO have worked out that you wanted 2 hours out of a total possible  16 hours, which is 2/16 = 0.125. Both methods work here.)   Another Example  Imagine there are two groups:   A member of each group gets randomly chosen for the winners circle,  then one of those gets randomly chosen to get the big money prize:    What is your chance of winnning the big prize?   there is a 1/5 chance of going to the winners circle  and a 1/2 chance of winning the big prize   So you have a 1/5 chance followed by a 1/2 chance ... which makes a 1/10 chance overall:  1 5 × 1 2 = 1 5 × 2 = 1 10  Or we can  calculate using decimals (1/5 is 0.2, and 1/2 is 0.5):  0.2 x 0.5 = 0.1  So your chance of winning the big money is 0.1 (which is the same as 1/10).  Coincidence!  Many "Coincidences" are, in fact,  likely.   Example:  you are in a room with 30 people, and find that Zach and Anna  celebrate their birthday on the same day.  Do you say:   "Wow, how strange !", or  "That seems reasonable, with so many people here"   In fact there is a 70% chance that would happen ... so it is likely .   Why is the chance so high?  Because you are comparing everyone to everyone else (not just one to many).  And with 30 people that is 435 comparisons    (Read Shared Birthdays to find out more.)     Example:  Snap!  Did you ever say something at exactly the same time as someone else ?  Wow, how amazing!  But you were probably sharing an experience (movie, journey, whatever) and so your thoughts were similar.  And there are only so many ways of saying something ...  ... so it is like the card game "Snap!" (also called Slaps or Slapjack) ...  ... if you speak enough words together, they will eventually match up.  So, maybe not so amazing, just simple chance at work.   Can you think of other cases where a "coincidence" was simply a likely thing?  Conclusion    Probability is: (Number of ways it can happen) / (Total number of outcomes)  Dependent Events (such as removing marbles from a bag) are affected by previous events  Independent events (such as a coin toss) are not affected by previous events  We can calculate the probability of 2 or more Independent events by multiplying  Not all coincidences are really unlikely (when you think about them).

        a birthday  Describe the gambler's fallacy     Probability of a Single Event  If you roll a six-sided die, there are six possible 
                outcomes, and each of these outcomes is equally likely. A six 
                is as likely to come up as a three, and likewise for the other 
                four sides of the die. What, then, is the probability that a one 
                will come up? Since there are six possible outcomes, the probability 
                is 1/6. What is the probability that either a one or a six will 
                come up? The two outcomes about which we are concerned (a one 
                or a six coming up) are called favorable 
                outcomes . Given that all outcomes are equally likely, we can 
                compute the probability of a one or a six using the formula:     In this case there are two favorable outcomes and six possible 
                outcomes. So the probability of throwing either a one or six is 
                1/3. Don't be misled by our use of the term "favorable," 
                by the way. You should understand it in the sense of "favorable 
                to the event in question happening." That event might not 
                be favorable to your well-being. You might be betting on a three, 
                for example.  The above formula applies to many games of chance. 
                For example, what is the probability that a card drawn at random 
                from a deck of playing cards will be an ace? Since the deck has 
                four aces, there are four favorable outcomes; since the deck has 
                52 cards, there are 52 possible outcomes. The probability is therefore 
                4/52 = 1/13. What about the probability that the card will be 
                a club? Since there are 13 clubs, the probability is 13/52 = 1/4.  Let's say you have a bag with 20 cherries: 14 sweet 
                and 6 sour. If you pick a cherry at random, what is the probability 
                that it will be sweet? There are 20 possible cherries that could 
                be picked, so the number of possible outcomes is 20. Of these 
                20 possible outcomes, 14 are favorable (sweet), so the probability 
                that the cherry will be sweet is 14/20 = 7/10. There is one potential 
                complication to this example, however. It must be assumed that 
                the probability of picking any of the cherries is the same as 
                the probability of picking any other. This wouldn't be true if 
                (let us imagine) the sweet cherries are smaller than the sour 
                ones. (The sour cherries would come to hand more readily when 
                you sampled from the bag.) Let us keep in mind, therefore, that 
                when we assess probabilities in terms of the ratio of favorable 
                to all potential cases, we rely heavily on the assumption of equal 
                probability for all outcomes.  Here is a more complex example. You throw 2 dice. 
                What is the probability that the sum of the two dice will be 6? 
                To solve this problem, list all the possible outcomes. There are 
                36 of them since each die can come up one of six ways. The 36 
                possibilities are shown below.       Die 1  Die 2  Total    Die 1  Die 2  Total    Die 1  Die 2  Total    1  1  2    3  1  4    5  1  6    1  2  3    3  2  5    5  2  7    1  3  4    3  3  6    5  3  8    1  4  5    3  4  7    5  4  9    1  5  6    3  5  8    5  5  10    1  6  7    3  6  9    5  6  11    2  1  3    4  1  5    6  1  7    2  2  4    4  2  6    6  2  8    2  3  5    4  3  7    6  3  9    2  4  6    4  4  8    6  4  10    2  5  7    4  5  9    6  5  11    2  6  8    4  6  10    6  6  12     You can see that 5 of the 36 possibilities total 6. Therefore, 
                the probability is 5/36.  If you know the probability of an event occurring, 
                it is easy to compute the probability that the event does not 
                occur. If P(A) is the probability of Event A, then 1 - P(A) is 
                the probability that the event does not occur. For the last example, 
                the probability that the total is 6 is 5/36. Therefore, the probability 
                that the total is not 6 is 1 - 5/36 = 31/36.  Probability of Two (or more) Independent Events  Events A and B are independent
                   events if the probability of Event B occurring is the
                   same  whether or not Event A occurs. Let's take a simple example.
                   A  fair coin is tossed two times. The probability that a head
                   comes  up on the second toss is 1/2 regardless of whether
                   or not a head  came up on the first toss. The two events are
                   (1) first toss is  a head and (2) second toss is a head. So
                   these events are independent.  Consider the two events (1) "It
                   will rain tomorrow in Houston" 
                and (2) "It will rain tomorrow in Galveston" (a city near
                 Houston). These events are not independent because it is more
                 likely that it will rain in Galveston on days it rains in Houston
                 than on days it does not.  Probability of A and B  When two events are independent, the probability
                 of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the
                individual  events. More formally, if events A and B are independent,
                then  the probability of both A and B occurring is:  P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)  where P(A and B) is the probability of events
                 A and B both occurring, P(A) is the probability of event A occurring,
                 and P(B) is the probability of event B occurring.  If you flip a coin twice, what is the probability 
                that it will come up heads both times? Event A is that the coin 
                comes up heads on the first flip and Event B is that the coin 
                comes up heads on the second flip. Since both P(A) and P(B) equal 
                1/2, the probability that both events occur is  1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4.  Let's take another example. If you flip a coin
                 and roll a six-sided die, what is the probability that the coin
                 comes up heads and the die comes up 1? Since the two events
                are  independent, the probability is simply the probability of
                a head  (which is 1/2) times the probability of the die coming
                up 1 (which  is 1/6). Therefore, the probability of both events
                occurring is  1/2 x 1/6 = 1/12.  One final example: You draw a card from a deck of 
                cards, put it back, and then draw another card. What is the probability 
                that the first card is a heart and the second card is black? Since 
                there are 52 cards in a deck and 13 of them are hearts, the probability 
                that the first card is a heart is 13/52 = 1/4. Since there are 
                26 black cards in the deck, the probability that the second card 
                is black is 26/52 = 1/2. The probability of both events occurring 
                is therefore 1/4 x 1/2 = 1/8.  See the section on conditional probabilities on
                this page to see how to compute P(A and
                B) when A and B are not independent.  Probability of A or B  If Events A and B are independent, the probability 
                that either Event A or Event B occurs is:  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)  In this discussion, when we say "A or B occurs" 
                we include three possibilities:   A occurs and B does not occur  B occurs and A does not occur  Both A and B occur   This use of the word "or" is technically 
                called inclusive or because it includes 
                the case in which both A and B occur. If we included only the 
                first two cases, then we would be using an exclusive 
                or .   (Optional) We can derive the law for P(A-or-B) 
                  from our law about P(A-and-B). The event "A-or-B" 
                  can happen in any of the following ways:   A-and-B happens  A-and-not-B happens  not-A-and-B happens.   The simple event A can happen if either A-and-B 
                  happens or A-and-not-B happens. Similarly, the simple event 
                  B happens if either A-and-B happens or not-A-and-B happens. 
                  P(A) + P(B) is therefore P(A-and-B) + P(A-and-not-B) + P(A-and-B) 
                  + P(not-A-and-B), whereas P(A-or-B) is P(A-and-B) + P(A-and-not-B) 
                  + P(not-A-and-B). We can make these two sums equal by subtracting 
                  one occurrence of P(A-and-B) from the first. Hence, P(A-or-B) 
                  = P(A) + P(B) - P(A-and-B).     Now for some examples. If you flip a coin two times, 
                what is the probability that you will get a head on the first 
                flip or a head on the second flip (or both)? Letting Event A be 
                a head on the first flip and Event B be a head on the second flip, 
                then P(A) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/2, and P(A and B) = 1/4. Therefore,  P(A or B) = 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/4 = 3/4.  If you throw a six-sided die and then flip a coin, 
                what is the probability that you will get either a 6 on the die 
                or a head on the coin flip (or both)? Using the formula,  P(6 or head) = P(6) + P(head) - P(6 and head) = 
                (1/6) + (1/2) - (1/6)(1/2) = 
                7/12  An alternate approach to computing this value 
                is to start by computing the probability of not getting either 
                a 6 or a head. Then subtract this value from 1 to compute the 
                probability of getting a 6 or a head. Although this is a complicated 
                method, it has the advantage of being applicable to problems with 
                more than two events. Here is the calculation in the present case. 
                The probability of not getting either a 6 or a head can be recast 
                as the probability of  (not getting a 6) AND (not getting a head).  This follows because if you did not get a 6 and 
                you did not get a head, then you did not get a 6 or a head. The 
                probability of not getting a six is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The probability 
                of not getting a head is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The probability of not 
                getting a six and not getting a head is 5/6 x 1/2 = 5/12. This 
                is therefore the probability of not getting a 6 or a head. The 
                probability of getting a six or a head is therefore (once again) 
                1 - 5/12 = 7/12.  If you throw a die three times, what is the probability 
                that one or more of your throws will come up with a 1? That is, 
                what is the probability of getting a 1 on the first throw OR a 
                1 on the second throw OR a 1 on the third throw? The easiest way 
                to approach this problem is to compute the probability of  NOT getting a 1 on the first throw AND not getting a 1 on the second throw AND not getting a 1 on the third throw.  The answer will be 1 minus this probability. The 
                probability of not getting a 1 on any of the three throws is 5/6 
                x 5/6 x 5/6 = 125/216. Therefore, the probability of getting a 
                1 on at least one of the throws is 1 - 125/216 = 91/216.  Conditional Probabilities  Often it is required to compute the probability
                 of an event given that another event has occurred. For example,
                 what is the probability that two cards drawn at random from
                a  deck of playing cards will both be aces? It might seem that
                you  could use the formula for the probability of two independent
                events  and simply multiply 4/52 x 4/52 = 1/169. This would be incorrect ,
                 however, because the two events are not independent. If the
                first  card drawn is an ace, then the probability that the second
                card  is also an ace would be lower because there would only
                be three  aces left in the deck.  Once the first card chosen is an ace, the probability 
                that the second card chosen is also an ace is called the conditional 
                probability of drawing an ace. In this case, the "condition" 
                is that the first card is an ace. Symbolically, we write this 
                as:  P(ace on second draw | an ace on the first draw)  The vertical bar "|" is read as "given," 
                so the above expression is short for: "The probability that
                 an ace is drawn on the second draw given that an ace was drawn
                 on the first draw." What is this probability? Since after
                  an ace is drawn on the first draw, there are 3 aces out of
                 51  total cards left. This means that the probability that one
                 of these  aces will be drawn is 3/51 = 1/17.  If Events A and B are not independent, then 
                P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B|A).  Applying this to the problem of two aces, the 
                probability of drawing two aces from a deck is 4/52 x 3/51 = 1/221.  One more example: If you draw two cards from a deck, 
                what is the probability that you will get the Ace of Diamonds 
                and a black card? There are two ways you can satisfy this condition: 
                (a) You can get the Ace of Diamonds first and then a black card 
                or (b) you can get a black card first and then the Ace of Diamonds. 
                Let's calculate Case A. The probability that the first card is 
                the Ace of Diamonds is 1/52. The probability that the second card 
                is black given that the first card is the Ace of Diamonds is 26/51 
                because 26 of the remaining 51 cards are black. The probability 
                is therefore 1/52 x 26/51 = 1/102. Now for Case B: the probability 
                that the first card is black is 26/52 = 1/2. The probability that 
                the second card is the Ace of Diamonds given that the first card 
                is black is 1/51. The probability of Case B is therefore 1/2 x 
                1/51 = 1/102, the same as the probability of Case A. Recall that 
                the probability of A or B is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). In this 
                problem, P(A and B) = 0 since a card cannot be the Ace of Diamonds 
                and be a black card. Therefore, the probability of Case A or Case 
                B is 1/102 + 1/102 = 2/102 = 1/51. So, 1/51 is the probability that 
                you will get the Ace of Diamonds and a black card when drawing 
                two cards from a deck.  Birthday Problem  If there are 25 people in a room, what is the 
                probability that at least two of them share the same birthday. 
                If your first thought is that it is 25/365 = 0.068, you will be 
                surprised to learn it is much higher than that. This problem requires 
                the application of the sections on P(A and B) and conditional 
                probability.  This problem is best approached by asking what is 
                the probability that no two people have the same birthday. Once 
                we know this probability, we can simply subtract it from 1 to 
                find the probability that two people share a birthday.  If we choose two people at random, what is the
                probability  that they do not share a birthday? Of the 365 days
                on which the  second person could have a birthday, 364 of them
                are different  from the first person's birthday. Therefore the
                probability is  364/365. Let's define P2 as the probability that
                the second person  drawn does not share a birthday with the person
                drawn previously.  P2 is therefore 364/365. Now define P3 as
                the probability that  the third person drawn does not share a
                birthday with anyone drawn  previously given that
                there are  no previous birthday matches. P3 is therefore a conditional
                probability.  If there are no previous birthday matches, then
                two of the 365  days have been "used up," leaving 363
                non-matching days.  Therefore P3 = 363/365. In like manner, P4
                = 362/365, P5 = 361/365,  and so on up to P25 = 341/365.  In order for there to be no matches, the second 
                person must not match any previous person and the third person must not match any previous person, and the fourth person must not match any previous person, etc. Since 
                P(A and B) = P(A)P(B), all we have to do is multiply P2, P3, P4 
                ...P25 together. The result is 0.431. Therefore the probability 
                of at least one match is 0.569.  Gambler's Fallacy  A fair coin is flipped five times and comes up
                 heads each time. What is the probability that it will come up
                 heads on the sixth flip? The correct answer is, of course, 1/2.
                 But many people believe that a tail is more likely to occur
                after  throwing five heads. Their faulty
                reasoning may go something like this: "In the long run, the number
                of  heads and tails will be the same, so the tails have some
                catching  up to do." The flaws in this logic are exposed
                in the simulation in this chapter.         Please answer the questions:    feedback                  Conditional Probability The conditional probability B A P(B|A) probability of B given A A B independent A B B A B P(B)  If events A and B are not independent, then the probability
of the intersection of A and B (the probability that both events
occur) is defined by P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A). From this definition, the conditional probability P(B|A) is easily
obtained by dividing by P(A) :  Note: This expression is only valid when P(A) is greater than 0.   Examples In a card game, suppose a player needs to draw two cards of the same suit in order 
to win.  Of the 52 cards, there are 13 cards in each suit.  Suppose first the player 
draws a heart.  Now the player wishes to draw a second heart.  Since one
heart has already been chosen, there are now 12 hearts remaining in a deck of 51 cards.
So the conditional probability P(Draw second heart|First card a heart) = 12/51. Suppose an individual applying to a college determines that he has an 80% chance of
being accepted, and he knows that dormitory housing will only be provided for 60% of 
all of the accepted students.  The chance of the student being accepted and receiving dormitory housing is defined by  P(Accepted and Dormitory Housing) = P(Dormitory Housing|Accepted)P(Accepted) = 
(0.60)*(0.80) = 0.48.  To calculate the probability of the intersection of more than two events, the conditional
probabilities of all of the preceding events must be considered.  In the case of
three events, A , B , and C , the probability of the intersection P(A and B and C) = P(A)P(B|A)P(C|A and B) .  Consider the college applicant who has determined that he has 0.80 probability of 
acceptance and that only 60% of the accepted students will receive dormitory housing.  
Of the accepted students who receive dormitory housing, 80% will have at least one roommate.
The probability of being accepted and receiving dormitory housing and having
no roommates is calculated by:  P(Accepted and Dormitory Housing and No Roommates) = 
P(Accepted)P(Dormitory Housing|Accepted)P(No Roomates|Dormitory Housing and Accepted) = (0.80)*(0.60)*(0.20) = 0.096.  The student has about a 10% chance of receiving
a single room at the college. Another important method for calculating conditional probabilities is given by Bayes's formula P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A c )P(A c ) B B A A B P(B)P(A) + P(B)P(A c ) = P(B)(P(A) + 
P(A c )) = P(B)(1) = P(B), Example By Bayes's formula, P(Voter lives in state B|Voter supports liberal candidate) =
P(Voter supports liberal candidate|Voter lives in state B)P(Voter lives in state B)/
	(P(Voter supports lib. cand.|Voter lives in state A)P(Voter lives in state A) + 
	 P(Voter supports lib. cand.|Voter lives in state B)P(Voter lives in state B) +
	 P(Voter supports lib. cand.|Voter lives in state C)P(Voter lives in state C)) = (0.60)*(0.25)/((0.50)*(0.40) + (0.60)*(0.25) + (0.35)*(0.35)) 
= (0.15)/(0.20 + 0.15 + 0.1225) = 0.15/0.4725 = 0.3175.  The probability that the voter lives in state B is approximately 0.32. For some more definitions and examples, see the probability index in Valerie J. Easton and John H. McColl's Statistics Glossary v1.1 .    PROBABILITIES OF "OR" AND "NOT" EVENTS     Sometimes we are interested in computing probabilities of
more complicated events. Here we introduce two basic probability rules. The
first rule is useful for finding the probability of one event or another
event. The second rule tells us how to compute the probability that an event does
not occur.  The addition rule (for computing probabilities of "or" events)  We will illustrate this rule with an example. Suppose Ohio has a two-digit lottery game and the winning number will be chosen at random
from all possible two-digit numbers  {00, 01, 02, 03, ...,
97, 98, 99}.  There are 100 possible winning numbers and since each has the same chance of
being chosen, we assign a probability of 1/100 = .01 to each number.  Suppose we want to find the probability that the winning number has the same
two digits or the winning number is between 89 and 96 inclusive. If
these two events ("same two digits" and "between 89 and 96")
are nonoverlapping, then we can find the probability of "same two digits"
or "between 89 and 96" by adding:  Prob("same two
digits" or "between 89 and 96") = Prob("same two
digits")+Prob("between 89 and 96")  Are these two events nonoverlapping? Nonoverlapping means that it is
impossible for the two events to occur at the same time. Here "same two
digits" means the winning number is from the set {00, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55,
66, 77, 88, 99}. "Between 89 and 96" means that the number is in the
set {89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96}. Note that these two sets have nothing in
common; in other words, it is impossible for the winning number to have the
same two digits and be between 89 and 96. So we can add the probabilities to
find the probability of the "or" event. The probability of "same
two digits" is 10/100 and the probability of "between 89 and 96"
is 8/100. Therefore the probability of interest is  Prob("same two
digits" or "between 89 and 96") = 10/100 + 8/100 = 18/100 = .18  What if we wanted to find the probability of "same two digits" or
"an even second digit"? Here we can't use this addition rule, since
these two events are overlapping. It is possible for the winning to have the
same two digits and have an even second digit -- the number 44 (and other
numbers) is in both events. So this rule cannot be used in this case.  This rule is also applicable in the case where you want to find the
probability of a collection of different outcomes. Suppose you toss a coin five
times and you wish to find the probability that the number of heads is 2 or
fewer. You can think of the event "2 or fewer heads" as an
"or" event:  {2 or fewer heads} =
{0 heads} or {1 head} or {2 heads}  By definition, the three outcomes {0 heads}, {1 heads} and {2 heads}, since
you can only observe at most one of these outcomes when you toss the coin three
times. So the addition rule can be used and  Prob(2 or fewer
heads) = Prob(0 heads) + Prob(1 head) + Prob(2 heads)  The complement rule (for computing probabilities of "not" events)  Let's return to our lottery example. What if you're
interested in the probability that the winning number does not have
the same two digits. The rule for "not" events is called the complement rule:  Probability("not"
an event) = 1 - Probability(event)  In this case, we can write  Probability(not same
digits) = 1 - Probability(same digits)  We have already found the probability that the winning number has the same
two digits, so the probability of interest is  Probability(not same
digits) = 1 - 10/100 = 90/100  The complement rule is especially useful in the case where it hard to
compute the probability of an event, but it is relatively easy to compute the
probability of "not" the event. For example, suppose we wish to
compute the probability of tossing at least one head in 10 tosses of a coin. In
this case, it would make sense to first perform the easier computation, the
probability of "not at least one head" or "no heads". Then
we apply the complement rule to find the probability of the event of interest.  Probability(at least
one head) = 1 - Probability(no heads)  Return to AN INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY     Page Author: Jim Albert (© 2005) albert@bayes.bgsu.edu Document: http://www-math.bgsu.edu/~albert/m115/probability/add_probs.html Last Modified: February 18, 2005         Probability  The probability of an event is a number describing the chance that the event will happen. An event
that is certain to happen has a probability of 1. An event that cannot possibly happen has
a probability of zero. If there is a chance that an event will happen, then
its probability is between zero and 1.    Examples of Events:   tossing a coin and it landing on heads  tossing a coin and it landing on tails  rolling a '3' on a die rolling a number > 4 on a die it rains two days in a row drawing a card from the suit of clubs guessing a certain number between 000 and 999 (lottery)    Events that are certain:     If it is Thursday, the probability that tomorrow is Friday is certain,
    therefore the probability is 1. If you are sixteen, the probability of you turning seventeen on your
    next birthday is 1. This is a certain event.      Events that are uncertain:     The probability that tomorrow is Friday if today is Monday is 0. The probability that you will be seventeen on your next birthday, if
    you were just born is 0.      Let's take a closer look at tossing the coin. When you
toss a coin, there are two possible outcomes , "heads" or "tails."    Examples of outcomes:   When rolling a die for a board game, the outcomes possible are 1,2,3,4,5,
  and 6. The outcomes when choosing the days of a week are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. When selecting a door to be chosen behind on the game show "Let's
  Make a Deal," the outcome of the choices is door 1, door 2, and door
  3.    The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment
is the sample space for the experiment.   A die is rolled and the number on the top face is recorded. All the
  integers from 1 to 6 are possible. So S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. A pair of dice are rolled and the sum of the numbers on the top faces
  is recorded. The smallest sum is 1 + 1 = 2; the largest is 6 + 6 = 12;
  and all the integers in-between are possible. So S = {2, 3, 4, ...,
  11, 12}.  The two outcomes of tossing a coin are equally likely , which means that each has
the same chance of happening. When all outcomes of an event are equally
likely, the probability that the event will happen is given by the ration
below.   When looking at the probability of the event that the coin
lands on tail we get the following:          These events are equally likely to happen:   When there is a 50% chance of rain, that means that there
  a chance that it might rain, but that there is also a chance that it might
  not rain. These chances are the same so the event is equally likely to
  happen.  When one rolls a game die, he/she has exactly the same
  chance of landing on any of the six sides. Therefore the probability of
  landing on any one specific side would be 1/6. This is also true for any
  spinner. Say a spinner is divided into 10 sections. Then there is an equally
  likely chance that the spinner can land on any of the sections. Thus the
  probability for the spinner to land in any designated section is 1/10.  The probability of selecting one of the three doors on
  the game show is also equally likely. There is no bias over the contestants
  decision so each door has a probability of 1/3 being chosen. This is true
  if there are no arrows pointing towards one of the doors.    When the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome
of a second event, the events are independent . When the outcome of one event does affect the outcome of the
second event, the events are dependent . Let's look at the following five examples. Decide which pair
of events are dependent or independent.  1. Toss a coin. Then roll a number cube (die).  2. Choose a bracelet and put it on. Choose another bracelet.  3. Select a card. Do not replace it. Then select another
card.  4. Select a card. Replace it. Select another card.  5. Pick one flower from a garden, then pick another.          The events above that are independent are numbers 1 and
4.  Probability of Two Independent
Events   Given a coin and a die, what is the probability
of tossing a head and rolling a 5?       The events above that are dependent events are numbers
2, 3, and 5.  Probability of Two Dependent
Events   Given a deck of cards, what is the probability
that the second card drawn will be from the same suit if the first card
drawn is the Queen of Hearts?     The
Counting Principle  The number of outcomes of an event is the
product of the number of outcomes for each stage of the event.    Let's suppose that we want to find out how many different
license plates are possible, when the license plate is composed of three
digits then three letters. To do this you can use the counting principle .
The product below gives the number of different plates possible.    We can use this same principle even if there are stipulations
on the problem. For example say that a number or letter can only be used
once.   What if we wanted to know which plate system provided more
possible outcomes, one with five letters or one with seven digits?    Five letters:  Seven digits:    So we see by using the counting principle that there are
more possibilities if we use five letters instead of seven digits.     Statistics

A die has 6 sides, 1 side contain the number 6 that give us 1 wanted outcome in 6 possible outcomes.   Independent events: Two events are independent when the outcome of the first event does not influence the outcome of the second event.  When we determine the probability of two independent events we multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of the second event.  $$P(X \, and \, Y)=P(X)\cdot P(Y)$$  To find the probability of an independent event we are using this rule:   Example  If one has three dice what is the probability of getting three 4s?  The probability of getting a 4 on one die is 1/6  The probability of getting 3 4s is:  $$P\left ( 4\, and\, 4\, and\, 4 \right )=\frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{216}$$  When the outcome affects the second outcome, which is what we called dependent events.  Dependent events: Two events are dependent when the outcome of the first event influences the outcome of the second event. The probability of two dependent events is the product of the probability of X and the probability of Y AFTER X occurs.  $$P(X \, and \, Y)=P(X)\cdot P(Y\: after\: x)$$   Example  What is the probability for you to choose two red cards in a deck of cards?  A deck of cards has 26 black and 26 red cards. The probability of choosing a red card randomly is:  $$P\left ( red \right )=\frac{26}{52}=\frac{1}{2}$$  The probability of choosing a second red card from the deck is now:  $$P\left ( red \right )=\frac{25}{51}$$  The probability:  $$P\left ( 2\,red \right )=\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{25}{51}=\frac{25}{102}$$  Two events are mutually exclusive when two events cannot happen at the same time. The probability that one of the mutually exclusive events occur is the sum of their individual probabilities.  $$P(X \, or \, Y)=P(X)+ P(Y)$$  An example of two mutually exclusive events is a wheel of fortune. Let's say you win a bar of chocolate if you end up in a red or a pink field.   What is the probability that the wheel stops at red or pink?  P(red or pink)=P(red)+P(pink)  $$P\left (red \right )=\frac{2}{8}=\frac{1}{4}$$  $$P\left (pink \right )=\frac{1}{8}$$  $$P\left ( red\, or\, pink \right )=\frac{1}{8}+\frac{2}{8}=\frac{3}{8}$$  Inclusive events are events that can happen at the same time. To find the probability of an inclusive event we first add the probabilities of the individual events and then subtract the probability of the two events happening at the same time.  $$P\left (X \, or \, Y \right )=P\left (X \right )+ P\left (Y \right )-P\left (X \, and \, Y \right )$$   Example  What is the probability of drawing a black card or a ten in a deck of cards?  There are 4 tens in a deck of cards P(10) = 4/52  There are 26 black cards P(black) = 26/52  There are 2 black tens P(black and 10) = 2/52  $$P\left ( black\, or\, ten \right )=\frac{4}{52}+\frac{26}{52}-\frac{2}{52}=\frac{30}{52}-\frac{2}{52}=\frac{28}{52}=\frac{7}{13}$$   Video lesson  At Ann's 7-years olds party all 20 invited guests are going to get some candy from the fish pond. In 12 of the bags there is an extra chocolate bar. Tina and James are first and second out, what is the probability that they both get a bag with an extra chocolate bar?

[1] A single outcome may be an element of many different events, [2] and different events in an experiment are usually not equally likely, since they may include very different groups of outcomes. [3] An event defines a complementary event , namely the complementary set (the event not occurring), and together these define a Bernoulli trial : did the event occur or not?  Typically, when the sample space is finite, any subset of the sample space is an event ( i . e . all elements of the power set of the sample space are defined as events). However, this approach does not work well in cases where the sample space is uncountably infinite . So, when defining a probability space it is possible, and often necessary, to exclude certain subsets of the sample space from being events (see Events in probabiliity spaces , below).     Contents    1  A simple example  2  Events in probability spaces  3  A note on notation  4  See also  5  Notes  6  External links     A simple example [ edit ]  If we assemble a deck of 52 playing cards with no jokers, and draw a single card from the deck, then the sample space is a 52-element set, as each card is a possible outcome. An event, however, is any subset of the sample space, including any singleton set (an elementary event ), the empty set (an impossible event, with probability zero) and the sample space itself (a certain event, with probability one). Other events are proper subsets of the sample space that contain multiple elements. So, for example, potential events include:     A Euler diagram of an event. B is the sample space and A is an event. By the ratio of their areas, the probability of A is approximately 0.4.     "Red and black at the same time without being a joker" (0 elements),  "The 5 of Hearts" (1 element),  "A King" (4 elements),  "A Face card" (12 elements),  "A Spade" (13 elements),  "A Face card or a red suit" (32 elements),  "A card" (52 elements).   Since all events are sets, they are usually written as sets (e.g. {1, 2, 3}), and represented graphically using Venn diagrams . In the situation where each outcome in the sample space Ω is equally likely, the probability     P    {\displaystyle P}   of an event A is the following formula :        P   (  A  )  =      |   A   |      |   Ω   |          (    alternatively:     Pr  (  A  )  =      |   A   |      |   Ω   |       )     {\displaystyle \mathrm {P} (A)={\frac {|A|}{|\Omega |}}\,\ \left({\text{alternatively:}}\ \Pr(A)={\frac {|A|}{|\Omega |}}\right)}     This rule can readily be applied to each of the example events above.  Events in probability spaces [ edit ]  Defining all subsets of the sample space as events works well when there are only finitely many outcomes, but gives rise to problems when the sample space is infinite. For many standard probability distributions , such as the normal distribution , the sample space is the set of real numbers or some subset of the real numbers . Attempts to define probabilities for all subsets of the real numbers run into difficulties when one considers 'badly behaved' sets, such as those that are nonmeasurable . Hence, it is necessary to restrict attention to a more limited family of subsets. For the standard tools of probability theory, such as joint and conditional probabilities , to work, it is necessary to use a σ-algebra , that is, a family closed under complementation and countable unions of its members. The most natural choice is the Borel measurable set derived from unions and intersections of intervals. However, the larger class of Lebesgue measurable sets proves more useful in practice.  In the general measure-theoretic description of probability spaces , an event may be defined as an element of a selected σ-algebra of subsets of the sample space. Under this definition, any subset of the sample space that is not an element of the σ-algebra is not an event, and does not have a probability. With a reasonable specification of the probability space, however, all events of interest are elements of the σ-algebra.  A note on notation [ edit ]  Even though events are subsets of some sample space Ω, they are often written as propositional formulas involving random variables . For example, if X is a real-valued random variable defined on the sample space Ω, the event       {  ω  ∈  Ω  ∣  u  <  X  (  ω  )  ≤  v  }     {\displaystyle \{\omega \in \Omega \mid u<X(\omega )\leq v\}\,}     can be written more conveniently as, simply,       u  <  X  ≤  v   .    {\displaystyle u<X\leq v\,.}     This is especially common in formulas for a probability , such as       Pr  (  u  <  X  ≤  v  )  =  F  (  v  )  −  F  (  u  )   .    {\displaystyle \Pr(u<X\leq v)=F(v)-F(u)\,.}     The set  u < X ≤ v is an example of an inverse image under the mapping  X because     ω  ∈   X   −  1    (  (  u  ,  v  ]  )    {\displaystyle \omega \in X^{-1}((u,v])}   if and only if     u  <  X  (  ω  )  ≤  v    {\displaystyle u<X(\omega )\leq v}   .

            events alongside each other. How these different events relate to each other determines
            the methods and rules to follow when we're studying their probabilities.  Events can be pided into two major categories dependent or Independent events.  Independent Events  When two events are said to be independent of each other, what this means is that
            the probability that one event occurs in no way affects the probability of the other
            event occurring. An example of two independent events is as follows; say you rolled
            a die and flipped a coin. The probability of getting any number face on the die
            in no way influences the probability of getting a head or a tail on the coin.  Dependent Events  When two events are said to be dependent, the probability of one event occurring
            influences the likelihood of the other event.  For example, if you were to draw a two cards from a deck of 52 cards. If on your
            first draw you had an ace and you put that aside, the probability of drawing an
            ace on the second draw is greatly changed because you drew an ace the first time.
            Let's calculate these different probabilities to see what's going on.  There are 4 Aces in a deck of 52 cards    On your first draw, the probability of getting an ace is given by:    If we don't return this card into the deck, the probability of drawing an ace on
            the second pick is given by        As you can clearly see, the above two probabilities are different, so we say that
            the two events are dependent. The likelihood of the second event depends on what
            happens in the first event.  Conditional Probability  We have already defined dependent and independent events and seen how probability
            of one event relates to the probability of the other event.  Having those concepts in mind, we can now look at conditional probability.  Conditional probability deals with further defining dependence of events by looking
            at probability of an event given that some other event first occurs.  Conditional probability is denoted by the following:    The above is read as the probability that B occurs given that A has already occurred .  The above is mathematically defined as:    Set Theory in Probability  A sample space is defined as a universal set of all possible outcomes from a given
            experiment.  Given two events A and B and given that these events are part of a
            sample space S . This sample space is represented as a set as in the diagram
            below.    The entire sample space of S is given by:    Remember the following from set theory:      The different regions of the set S can be explained as using the rules of
            probability.  Rules of Probability  When dealing with more than one event, there are certain rules that we must follow
            when studying probability of these events. These rules depend greatly on whether
            the events we are looking at are Independent or dependent on each other.  First acknowledge that    Multiplication Rule (A∩B)  This region is referred to as 'A intersection B' and in probability; this region
            refers to the event that both A and B happen. When we use the word and we are referring to multiplication, thus A and B can be thought
            of as AxB or (using dot notation which is more popular in probability) A • B  If A and B are dependent events, the probability of this event happening
            can be calculated as shown below:    If A and B are independent events, the probability of this event happening
            can be calculated as shown below:    Conditional probability for two independent events can be redefined using the relationship
            above to become:        The above is consistent with the definition of independent events, the occurrence
            of event A in no way influences the occurrence of event B , and so
            the probability that event B occurs given that event A has occurred
            is the same as the probability of event B .  Additive Rule (A∪B)  In probability we refer to the addition operator ( + ) as or . Thus when
            we want to we want to define some event such that the event can be A or B, to find
            the probability of that event:      Thus it follows that:    But remember from set theory that and from the way we defined our sample space above:    and that:   So we can now redefine out event as     The above is sometimes referred to as the subtraction rule.  Mutual Exclusivity  Certain special pairs of events have a unique relationship referred to as mutual
            exclusivity.  Two events are said to be mutually exclusive if they can't occur at the same time.
            For a given sample space, its either one or the other but not both. As a consequence,
            mutually exclusive events have their probability defined as follows:    An example of mutually exclusive events are the outcomes of a fair coin flip. When
            you flip a fair coin, you either get a head or a tail but not both, we can prove
            that these events are mutually exclusive by adding their probabilities:    For any given pair of events, if the sum of their probabilities is equal to one,
            then those two events are mutually exclusive.  Rules of Probability for Mutually Exclusive Events    Multiplication Rule  From the definition of mutually exclusive events, we should quickly conclude the
                    following:      Addition Rule  As we defined above, the addition rule applies to mutually exclusive events as follows:      Subtraction Rule  From the addition rule above, we can conclude that the subtraction rule for mutually
                    exclusive events takes the form;      Conditional Probability for Mutually Exclusive Events  We have defined conditional probability with the following equation:    We can redefine the above using the multiplication rule    hence    Below is a venn diagram of a set containing two mutually exclusive events A and B .

An event
that is certain to happen has a probability of 1. An event that cannot possibly happen has
a probability of zero. If there is a chance that an event will happen, then
its probability is between zero and 1.    Examples of Events:   tossing a coin and it landing on heads  tossing a coin and it landing on tails  rolling a '3' on a die rolling a number > 4 on a die it rains two days in a row drawing a card from the suit of clubs guessing a certain number between 000 and 999 (lottery)    Events that are certain:     If it is Thursday, the probability that tomorrow is Friday is certain,
    therefore the probability is 1. If you are sixteen, the probability of you turning seventeen on your
    next birthday is 1. This is a certain event.      Events that are uncertain:     The probability that tomorrow is Friday if today is Monday is 0. The probability that you will be seventeen on your next birthday, if
    you were just born is 0.      Let's take a closer look at tossing the coin. When you
toss a coin, there are two possible outcomes , "heads" or "tails."    Examples of outcomes:   When rolling a die for a board game, the outcomes possible are 1,2,3,4,5,
  and 6. The outcomes when choosing the days of a week are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. When selecting a door to be chosen behind on the game show "Let's
  Make a Deal," the outcome of the choices is door 1, door 2, and door
  3.    The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment
is the sample space for the experiment.   A die is rolled and the number on the top face is recorded. All the
  integers from 1 to 6 are possible. So S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. A pair of dice are rolled and the sum of the numbers on the top faces
  is recorded. The smallest sum is 1 + 1 = 2; the largest is 6 + 6 = 12;
  and all the integers in-between are possible. So S = {2, 3, 4, ...,
  11, 12}.  The two outcomes of tossing a coin are equally likely , which means that each has
the same chance of happening. When all outcomes of an event are equally
likely, the probability that the event will happen is given by the ration
below.   When looking at the probability of the event that the coin
lands on tail we get the following:          These events are equally likely to happen:   When there is a 50% chance of rain, that means that there
  a chance that it might rain, but that there is also a chance that it might
  not rain. These chances are the same so the event is equally likely to
  happen.  When one rolls a game die, he/she has exactly the same
  chance of landing on any of the six sides. Therefore the probability of
  landing on any one specific side would be 1/6. This is also true for any
  spinner. Say a spinner is divided into 10 sections. Then there is an equally
  likely chance that the spinner can land on any of the sections. Thus the
  probability for the spinner to land in any designated section is 1/10.  The probability of selecting one of the three doors on
  the game show is also equally likely. There is no bias over the contestants
  decision so each door has a probability of 1/3 being chosen. This is true
  if there are no arrows pointing towards one of the doors.    When the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome
of a second event, the events are independent . When the outcome of one event does affect the outcome of the
second event, the events are dependent . Let's look at the following five examples. Decide which pair
of events are dependent or independent.  1. Toss a coin. Then roll a number cube (die).  2. Choose a bracelet and put it on. Choose another bracelet.  3. Select a card. Do not replace it. Then select another
card.  4. Select a card. Replace it. Select another card.  5. Pick one flower from a garden, then pick another.          The events above that are independent are numbers 1 and
4.  Probability of Two Independent
Events   Given a coin and a die, what is the probability
of tossing a head and rolling a 5?       The events above that are dependent events are numbers
2, 3, and 5.  Probability of Two Dependent
Events   Given a deck of cards, what is the probability
that the second card drawn will be from the same suit if the first card
drawn is the Queen of Hearts?     The
Counting Principle  The number of outcomes of an event is the
product of the number of outcomes for each stage of the event.    Let's suppose that we want to find out how many different
license plates are possible, when the license plate is composed of three
digits then three letters. To do this you can use the counting principle .
The product below gives the number of different plates possible.    We can use this same principle even if there are stipulations
on the problem. For example say that a number or letter can only be used
once.   What if we wanted to know which plate system provided more
possible outcomes, one with five letters or one with seven digits?    Five letters:  Seven digits:    So we see by using the counting principle that there are
more possibilities if we use five letters instead of seven digits.     Statistics

Advanced          Show Ads  Hide Ads  About Ads                   Probability: Independent Events   Life is full of random events!  You need to get a "feel" for them to be a smart and successful person.  The toss of a coin, throwing  dice and  lottery draws are all examples of  random events.  Sometimes an event can affect the next event.   Example: taking colored marbles from a bag: as you take each marble there are less marbles left in the bag, so the probabilities change.   We call those Dependent Events , because what happens depends on what happened before (learn more about this at Conditional probability ).  But otherwise they are Independent Events ...  Independent Events   Independent Events are not affected by previous events.  This is an important idea!  A coin does not "know"  it came up heads before.  And each toss of a coin is a perfect isolated thing.   Example: You toss a coin and it comes up "Heads" three times ... what is the chance that the next toss will also be a "Head"?  The chance is simply ½ (or 0.5) just like ANY toss of the coin.  What it did in the past will not affect the current toss!   Some people think "it is overdue for a Tail", but really truly the next toss of the coin is totally independent of any previous tosses.  Saying "a Tail is due", or "just one more go, my luck is due"			is called The Gambler's Fallacy   Of course your luck may change, because each toss of the coin has an equal chance.  Probability of Independent Events  "Probability" (or  "Chance") is how likely something is to happen.  So how do we calculate probability?   Probability of an event happening =  Number of ways it can happen  Total number of outcomes         Example: what is the probability of getting a "Head" when tossing a coin?  Number of ways it can happen: 1 (Head)  Total number of outcomes: 2 (Head and Tail)  So the probability =  1  2  = 0.5     Example: what is the probability of getting a "4" or "6" when rolling a die?  Number of ways it can happen: 2 ("4" and  "6")  Total number of outcomes: 6 ("1",  "2", "3",  "4", "5" and  "6")  So the probability =  2  6  =  1  3  = 0.333...   Ways of Showing Probability  Probability goes from 0 (imposssible) to 1 (certain):   It is often shown as a decimal or fraction .   Example: the probability of getting a "Head" when tossing a coin:   As a decimal: 0.5  As a fraction: 1/2  As a percentage: 50%  Or sometimes like this: 1-in-2    Two or More Events  We can calculate the chances of two or more independent events by multiplying the chances.   Example: Probability of 3 Heads in a Row  For each toss of a coin a "Head" has a probability of 0.5:   And so the chance of getting 3 Heads in a row is 0.125   So each toss of a coin  has a ½ chance of being Heads, but lots of Heads in a row is unlikely.   Example: Why is it  unlikely to get, say, 7 heads in a row, when each toss of a coin  has a ½ chance of being Heads?  Because we are asking two different questions:  Question 1:  What is the probability of 7 heads in a row?  Answer: ½×½×½×½×½×½×½ = 0.0078125 (less than 1%).  Question 2:  Given that we have just got 6 heads in a row, what is the probability   that the next toss is also a head?  Answer: ½ , as the previous tosses don't affect the next toss.   You can have a play with the Quincunx to see how lots of independent effects can still have a pattern.  Notation  We use "P" to mean "Probability Of",  So, for Independent Events:  P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)  Probability of A and B equals the probability of A times the probability of B   Example: your boss (to be fair) randomly assigns everyone an extra 2 hours work on  weekend evenings between 4 and midnight.  What are the chances you get  Saturday between 6 and 8?   Day: there are two days on the weekend, so P(Saturday) = 0.5  Time: you want the 2 hours of 6-to-8, out of the 8 hours of 4-to-midnight):  P(Your Time) = 2/8 = 0.25  And:    P(Saturday and Your Time)  = P(Saturday) × P(Your Time)      = 0.5 × 0.25      = 0.125    Or a 12.5% Chance  (Note: we could ALSO have worked out that you wanted 2 hours out of a total possible  16 hours, which is 2/16 = 0.125. Both methods work here.)   Another Example  Imagine there are two groups:   A member of each group gets randomly chosen for the winners circle,  then one of those gets randomly chosen to get the big money prize:    What is your chance of winnning the big prize?   there is a 1/5 chance of going to the winners circle  and a 1/2 chance of winning the big prize   So you have a 1/5 chance followed by a 1/2 chance ... which makes a 1/10 chance overall:  1 5 × 1 2 = 1 5 × 2 = 1 10  Or we can  calculate using decimals (1/5 is 0.2, and 1/2 is 0.5):  0.2 x 0.5 = 0.1  So your chance of winning the big money is 0.1 (which is the same as 1/10).  Coincidence!  Many "Coincidences" are, in fact,  likely.   Example:  you are in a room with 30 people, and find that Zach and Anna  celebrate their birthday on the same day.  Do you say:   "Wow, how strange !", or  "That seems reasonable, with so many people here"   In fact there is a 70% chance that would happen ... so it is likely .   Why is the chance so high?  Because you are comparing everyone to everyone else (not just one to many).  And with 30 people that is 435 comparisons    (Read Shared Birthdays to find out more.)     Example:  Snap!  Did you ever say something at exactly the same time as someone else ?  Wow, how amazing!  But you were probably sharing an experience (movie, journey, whatever) and so your thoughts were similar.  And there are only so many ways of saying something ...  ... so it is like the card game "Snap!" (also called Slaps or Slapjack) ...  ... if you speak enough words together, they will eventually match up.  So, maybe not so amazing, just simple chance at work.   Can you think of other cases where a "coincidence" was simply a likely thing?  Conclusion    Probability is: (Number of ways it can happen) / (Total number of outcomes)  Dependent Events (such as removing marbles from a bag) are affected by previous events  Independent events (such as a coin toss) are not affected by previous events  We can calculate the probability of 2 or more Independent events by multiplying  Not all coincidences are really unlikely (when you think about them).

        a birthday  Describe the gambler's fallacy     Probability of a Single Event  If you roll a six-sided die, there are six possible 
                outcomes, and each of these outcomes is equally likely. A six 
                is as likely to come up as a three, and likewise for the other 
                four sides of the die. What, then, is the probability that a one 
                will come up? Since there are six possible outcomes, the probability 
                is 1/6. What is the probability that either a one or a six will 
                come up? The two outcomes about which we are concerned (a one 
                or a six coming up) are called favorable 
                outcomes . Given that all outcomes are equally likely, we can 
                compute the probability of a one or a six using the formula:     In this case there are two favorable outcomes and six possible 
                outcomes. So the probability of throwing either a one or six is 
                1/3. Don't be misled by our use of the term "favorable," 
                by the way. You should understand it in the sense of "favorable 
                to the event in question happening." That event might not 
                be favorable to your well-being. You might be betting on a three, 
                for example.  The above formula applies to many games of chance. 
                For example, what is the probability that a card drawn at random 
                from a deck of playing cards will be an ace? Since the deck has 
                four aces, there are four favorable outcomes; since the deck has 
                52 cards, there are 52 possible outcomes. The probability is therefore 
                4/52 = 1/13. What about the probability that the card will be 
                a club? Since there are 13 clubs, the probability is 13/52 = 1/4.  Let's say you have a bag with 20 cherries: 14 sweet 
                and 6 sour. If you pick a cherry at random, what is the probability 
                that it will be sweet? There are 20 possible cherries that could 
                be picked, so the number of possible outcomes is 20. Of these 
                20 possible outcomes, 14 are favorable (sweet), so the probability 
                that the cherry will be sweet is 14/20 = 7/10. There is one potential 
                complication to this example, however. It must be assumed that 
                the probability of picking any of the cherries is the same as 
                the probability of picking any other. This wouldn't be true if 
                (let us imagine) the sweet cherries are smaller than the sour 
                ones. (The sour cherries would come to hand more readily when 
                you sampled from the bag.) Let us keep in mind, therefore, that 
                when we assess probabilities in terms of the ratio of favorable 
                to all potential cases, we rely heavily on the assumption of equal 
                probability for all outcomes.  Here is a more complex example. You throw 2 dice. 
                What is the probability that the sum of the two dice will be 6? 
                To solve this problem, list all the possible outcomes. There are 
                36 of them since each die can come up one of six ways. The 36 
                possibilities are shown below.       Die 1  Die 2  Total    Die 1  Die 2  Total    Die 1  Die 2  Total    1  1  2    3  1  4    5  1  6    1  2  3    3  2  5    5  2  7    1  3  4    3  3  6    5  3  8    1  4  5    3  4  7    5  4  9    1  5  6    3  5  8    5  5  10    1  6  7    3  6  9    5  6  11    2  1  3    4  1  5    6  1  7    2  2  4    4  2  6    6  2  8    2  3  5    4  3  7    6  3  9    2  4  6    4  4  8    6  4  10    2  5  7    4  5  9    6  5  11    2  6  8    4  6  10    6  6  12     You can see that 5 of the 36 possibilities total 6. Therefore, 
                the probability is 5/36.  If you know the probability of an event occurring, 
                it is easy to compute the probability that the event does not 
                occur. If P(A) is the probability of Event A, then 1 - P(A) is 
                the probability that the event does not occur. For the last example, 
                the probability that the total is 6 is 5/36. Therefore, the probability 
                that the total is not 6 is 1 - 5/36 = 31/36.  Probability of Two (or more) Independent Events  Events A and B are independent
                   events if the probability of Event B occurring is the
                   same  whether or not Event A occurs. Let's take a simple example.
                   A  fair coin is tossed two times. The probability that a head
                   comes  up on the second toss is 1/2 regardless of whether
                   or not a head  came up on the first toss. The two events are
                   (1) first toss is  a head and (2) second toss is a head. So
                   these events are independent.  Consider the two events (1) "It
                   will rain tomorrow in Houston" 
                and (2) "It will rain tomorrow in Galveston" (a city near
                 Houston). These events are not independent because it is more
                 likely that it will rain in Galveston on days it rains in Houston
                 than on days it does not.  Probability of A and B  When two events are independent, the probability
                 of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the
                individual  events. More formally, if events A and B are independent,
                then  the probability of both A and B occurring is:  P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)  where P(A and B) is the probability of events
                 A and B both occurring, P(A) is the probability of event A occurring,
                 and P(B) is the probability of event B occurring.  If you flip a coin twice, what is the probability 
                that it will come up heads both times? Event A is that the coin 
                comes up heads on the first flip and Event B is that the coin 
                comes up heads on the second flip. Since both P(A) and P(B) equal 
                1/2, the probability that both events occur is  1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4.  Let's take another example. If you flip a coin
                 and roll a six-sided die, what is the probability that the coin
                 comes up heads and the die comes up 1? Since the two events
                are  independent, the probability is simply the probability of
                a head  (which is 1/2) times the probability of the die coming
                up 1 (which  is 1/6). Therefore, the probability of both events
                occurring is  1/2 x 1/6 = 1/12.  One final example: You draw a card from a deck of 
                cards, put it back, and then draw another card. What is the probability 
                that the first card is a heart and the second card is black? Since 
                there are 52 cards in a deck and 13 of them are hearts, the probability 
                that the first card is a heart is 13/52 = 1/4. Since there are 
                26 black cards in the deck, the probability that the second card 
                is black is 26/52 = 1/2. The probability of both events occurring 
                is therefore 1/4 x 1/2 = 1/8.  See the section on conditional probabilities on
                this page to see how to compute P(A and
                B) when A and B are not independent.  Probability of A or B  If Events A and B are independent, the probability 
                that either Event A or Event B occurs is:  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)  In this discussion, when we say "A or B occurs" 
                we include three possibilities:   A occurs and B does not occur  B occurs and A does not occur  Both A and B occur   This use of the word "or" is technically 
                called inclusive or because it includes 
                the case in which both A and B occur. If we included only the 
                first two cases, then we would be using an exclusive 
                or .   (Optional) We can derive the law for P(A-or-B) 
                  from our law about P(A-and-B). The event "A-or-B" 
                  can happen in any of the following ways:   A-and-B happens  A-and-not-B happens  not-A-and-B happens.   The simple event A can happen if either A-and-B 
                  happens or A-and-not-B happens. Similarly, the simple event 
                  B happens if either A-and-B happens or not-A-and-B happens. 
                  P(A) + P(B) is therefore P(A-and-B) + P(A-and-not-B) + P(A-and-B) 
                  + P(not-A-and-B), whereas P(A-or-B) is P(A-and-B) + P(A-and-not-B) 
                  + P(not-A-and-B). We can make these two sums equal by subtracting 
                  one occurrence of P(A-and-B) from the first. Hence, P(A-or-B) 
                  = P(A) + P(B) - P(A-and-B).     Now for some examples. If you flip a coin two times, 
                what is the probability that you will get a head on the first 
                flip or a head on the second flip (or both)? Letting Event A be 
                a head on the first flip and Event B be a head on the second flip, 
                then P(A) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/2, and P(A and B) = 1/4. Therefore,  P(A or B) = 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/4 = 3/4.  If you throw a six-sided die and then flip a coin, 
                what is the probability that you will get either a 6 on the die 
                or a head on the coin flip (or both)? Using the formula,  P(6 or head) = P(6) + P(head) - P(6 and head) = 
                (1/6) + (1/2) - (1/6)(1/2) = 
                7/12  An alternate approach to computing this value 
                is to start by computing the probability of not getting either 
                a 6 or a head. Then subtract this value from 1 to compute the 
                probability of getting a 6 or a head. Although this is a complicated 
                method, it has the advantage of being applicable to problems with 
                more than two events. Here is the calculation in the present case. 
                The probability of not getting either a 6 or a head can be recast 
                as the probability of  (not getting a 6) AND (not getting a head).  This follows because if you did not get a 6 and 
                you did not get a head, then you did not get a 6 or a head. The 
                probability of not getting a six is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6. The probability 
                of not getting a head is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The probability of not 
                getting a six and not getting a head is 5/6 x 1/2 = 5/12. This 
                is therefore the probability of not getting a 6 or a head. The 
                probability of getting a six or a head is therefore (once again) 
                1 - 5/12 = 7/12.  If you throw a die three times, what is the probability 
                that one or more of your throws will come up with a 1? That is, 
                what is the probability of getting a 1 on the first throw OR a 
                1 on the second throw OR a 1 on the third throw? The easiest way 
                to approach this problem is to compute the probability of  NOT getting a 1 on the first throw AND not getting a 1 on the second throw AND not getting a 1 on the third throw.  The answer will be 1 minus this probability. The 
                probability of not getting a 1 on any of the three throws is 5/6 
                x 5/6 x 5/6 = 125/216. Therefore, the probability of getting a 
                1 on at least one of the throws is 1 - 125/216 = 91/216.  Conditional Probabilities  Often it is required to compute the probability
                 of an event given that another event has occurred. For example,
                 what is the probability that two cards drawn at random from
                a  deck of playing cards will both be aces? It might seem that
                you  could use the formula for the probability of two independent
                events  and simply multiply 4/52 x 4/52 = 1/169. This would be incorrect ,
                 however, because the two events are not independent. If the
                first  card drawn is an ace, then the probability that the second
                card  is also an ace would be lower because there would only
                be three  aces left in the deck.  Once the first card chosen is an ace, the probability 
                that the second card chosen is also an ace is called the conditional 
                probability of drawing an ace. In this case, the "condition" 
                is that the first card is an ace. Symbolically, we write this 
                as:  P(ace on second draw | an ace on the first draw)  The vertical bar "|" is read as "given," 
                so the above expression is short for: "The probability that
                 an ace is drawn on the second draw given that an ace was drawn
                 on the first draw." What is this probability? Since after
                  an ace is drawn on the first draw, there are 3 aces out of
                 51  total cards left. This means that the probability that one
                 of these  aces will be drawn is 3/51 = 1/17.  If Events A and B are not independent, then 
                P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B|A).  Applying this to the problem of two aces, the 
                probability of drawing two aces from a deck is 4/52 x 3/51 = 1/221.  One more example: If you draw two cards from a deck, 
                what is the probability that you will get the Ace of Diamonds 
                and a black card? There are two ways you can satisfy this condition: 
                (a) You can get the Ace of Diamonds first and then a black card 
                or (b) you can get a black card first and then the Ace of Diamonds. 
                Let's calculate Case A. The probability that the first card is 
                the Ace of Diamonds is 1/52. The probability that the second card 
                is black given that the first card is the Ace of Diamonds is 26/51 
                because 26 of the remaining 51 cards are black. The probability 
                is therefore 1/52 x 26/51 = 1/102. Now for Case B: the probability 
                that the first card is black is 26/52 = 1/2. The probability that 
                the second card is the Ace of Diamonds given that the first card 
                is black is 1/51. The probability of Case B is therefore 1/2 x 
                1/51 = 1/102, the same as the probability of Case A. Recall that 
                the probability of A or B is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). In this 
                problem, P(A and B) = 0 since a card cannot be the Ace of Diamonds 
                and be a black card. Therefore, the probability of Case A or Case 
                B is 1/102 + 1/102 = 2/102 = 1/51. So, 1/51 is the probability that 
                you will get the Ace of Diamonds and a black card when drawing 
                two cards from a deck.  Birthday Problem  If there are 25 people in a room, what is the 
                probability that at least two of them share the same birthday. 
                If your first thought is that it is 25/365 = 0.068, you will be 
                surprised to learn it is much higher than that. This problem requires 
                the application of the sections on P(A and B) and conditional 
                probability.  This problem is best approached by asking what is 
                the probability that no two people have the same birthday. Once 
                we know this probability, we can simply subtract it from 1 to 
                find the probability that two people share a birthday.  If we choose two people at random, what is the
                probability  that they do not share a birthday? Of the 365 days
                on which the  second person could have a birthday, 364 of them
                are different  from the first person's birthday. Therefore the
                probability is  364/365. Let's define P2 as the probability that
                the second person  drawn does not share a birthday with the person
                drawn previously.  P2 is therefore 364/365. Now define P3 as
                the probability that  the third person drawn does not share a
                birthday with anyone drawn  previously given that
                there are  no previous birthday matches. P3 is therefore a conditional
                probability.  If there are no previous birthday matches, then
                two of the 365  days have been "used up," leaving 363
                non-matching days.  Therefore P3 = 363/365. In like manner, P4
                = 362/365, P5 = 361/365,  and so on up to P25 = 341/365.  In order for there to be no matches, the second 
                person must not match any previous person and the third person must not match any previous person, and the fourth person must not match any previous person, etc. Since 
                P(A and B) = P(A)P(B), all we have to do is multiply P2, P3, P4 
                ...P25 together. The result is 0.431. Therefore the probability 
                of at least one match is 0.569.  Gambler's Fallacy  A fair coin is flipped five times and comes up
                 heads each time. What is the probability that it will come up
                 heads on the sixth flip? The correct answer is, of course, 1/2.
                 But many people believe that a tail is more likely to occur
                after  throwing five heads. Their faulty
                reasoning may go something like this: "In the long run, the number
                of  heads and tails will be the same, so the tails have some
                catching  up to do." The flaws in this logic are exposed
                in the simulation in this chapter.         Please answer the questions:    feedback                  Conditional Probability The conditional probability B A P(B|A) probability of B given A A B independent A B B A B P(B)  If events A and B are not independent, then the probability
of the intersection of A and B (the probability that both events
occur) is defined by P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A). From this definition, the conditional probability P(B|A) is easily
obtained by dividing by P(A) :  Note: This expression is only valid when P(A) is greater than 0.   Examples In a card game, suppose a player needs to draw two cards of the same suit in order 
to win.  Of the 52 cards, there are 13 cards in each suit.  Suppose first the player 
draws a heart.  Now the player wishes to draw a second heart.  Since one
heart has already been chosen, there are now 12 hearts remaining in a deck of 51 cards.
So the conditional probability P(Draw second heart|First card a heart) = 12/51. Suppose an individual applying to a college determines that he has an 80% chance of
being accepted, and he knows that dormitory housing will only be provided for 60% of 
all of the accepted students.  The chance of the student being accepted and receiving dormitory housing is defined by  P(Accepted and Dormitory Housing) = P(Dormitory Housing|Accepted)P(Accepted) = 
(0.60)*(0.80) = 0.48.  To calculate the probability of the intersection of more than two events, the conditional
probabilities of all of the preceding events must be considered.  In the case of
three events, A , B , and C , the probability of the intersection P(A and B and C) = P(A)P(B|A)P(C|A and B) .  Consider the college applicant who has determined that he has 0.80 probability of 
acceptance and that only 60% of the accepted students will receive dormitory housing.  
Of the accepted students who receive dormitory housing, 80% will have at least one roommate.
The probability of being accepted and receiving dormitory housing and having
no roommates is calculated by:  P(Accepted and Dormitory Housing and No Roommates) = 
P(Accepted)P(Dormitory Housing|Accepted)P(No Roomates|Dormitory Housing and Accepted) = (0.80)*(0.60)*(0.20) = 0.096.  The student has about a 10% chance of receiving
a single room at the college. Another important method for calculating conditional probabilities is given by Bayes's formula P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A c )P(A c ) B B A A B P(B)P(A) + P(B)P(A c ) = P(B)(P(A) + 
P(A c )) = P(B)(1) = P(B), Example By Bayes's formula, P(Voter lives in state B|Voter supports liberal candidate) =
P(Voter supports liberal candidate|Voter lives in state B)P(Voter lives in state B)/
	(P(Voter supports lib. cand.|Voter lives in state A)P(Voter lives in state A) + 
	 P(Voter supports lib. cand.|Voter lives in state B)P(Voter lives in state B) +
	 P(Voter supports lib. cand.|Voter lives in state C)P(Voter lives in state C)) = (0.60)*(0.25)/((0.50)*(0.40) + (0.60)*(0.25) + (0.35)*(0.35)) 
= (0.15)/(0.20 + 0.15 + 0.1225) = 0.15/0.4725 = 0.3175.  The probability that the voter lives in state B is approximately 0.32. For some more definitions and examples, see the probability index in Valerie J. Easton and John H. McColl's Statistics Glossary v1.1 .    PROBABILITIES OF "OR" AND "NOT" EVENTS     Sometimes we are interested in computing probabilities of
more complicated events. Here we introduce two basic probability rules. The
first rule is useful for finding the probability of one event or another
event. The second rule tells us how to compute the probability that an event does
not occur.  The addition rule (for computing probabilities of "or" events)  We will illustrate this rule with an example. Suppose Ohio has a two-digit lottery game and the winning number will be chosen at random
from all possible two-digit numbers  {00, 01, 02, 03, ...,
97, 98, 99}.  There are 100 possible winning numbers and since each has the same chance of
being chosen, we assign a probability of 1/100 = .01 to each number.  Suppose we want to find the probability that the winning number has the same
two digits or the winning number is between 89 and 96 inclusive. If
these two events ("same two digits" and "between 89 and 96")
are nonoverlapping, then we can find the probability of "same two digits"
or "between 89 and 96" by adding:  Prob("same two
digits" or "between 89 and 96") = Prob("same two
digits")+Prob("between 89 and 96")  Are these two events nonoverlapping? Nonoverlapping means that it is
impossible for the two events to occur at the same time. Here "same two
digits" means the winning number is from the set {00, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55,
66, 77, 88, 99}. "Between 89 and 96" means that the number is in the
set {89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96}. Note that these two sets have nothing in
common; in other words, it is impossible for the winning number to have the
same two digits and be between 89 and 96. So we can add the probabilities to
find the probability of the "or" event. The probability of "same
two digits" is 10/100 and the probability of "between 89 and 96"
is 8/100. Therefore the probability of interest is  Prob("same two
digits" or "between 89 and 96") = 10/100 + 8/100 = 18/100 = .18  What if we wanted to find the probability of "same two digits" or
"an even second digit"? Here we can't use this addition rule, since
these two events are overlapping. It is possible for the winning to have the
same two digits and have an even second digit -- the number 44 (and other
numbers) is in both events. So this rule cannot be used in this case.  This rule is also applicable in the case where you want to find the
probability of a collection of different outcomes. Suppose you toss a coin five
times and you wish to find the probability that the number of heads is 2 or
fewer. You can think of the event "2 or fewer heads" as an
"or" event:  {2 or fewer heads} =
{0 heads} or {1 head} or {2 heads}  By definition, the three outcomes {0 heads}, {1 heads} and {2 heads}, since
you can only observe at most one of these outcomes when you toss the coin three
times. So the addition rule can be used and  Prob(2 or fewer
heads) = Prob(0 heads) + Prob(1 head) + Prob(2 heads)  The complement rule (for computing probabilities of "not" events)  Let's return to our lottery example. What if you're
interested in the probability that the winning number does not have
the same two digits. The rule for "not" events is called the complement rule:  Probability("not"
an event) = 1 - Probability(event)  In this case, we can write  Probability(not same
digits) = 1 - Probability(same digits)  We have already found the probability that the winning number has the same
two digits, so the probability of interest is  Probability(not same
digits) = 1 - 10/100 = 90/100  The complement rule is especially useful in the case where it hard to
compute the probability of an event, but it is relatively easy to compute the
probability of "not" the event. For example, suppose we wish to
compute the probability of tossing at least one head in 10 tosses of a coin. In
this case, it would make sense to first perform the easier computation, the
probability of "not at least one head" or "no heads". Then
we apply the complement rule to find the probability of the event of interest.  Probability(at least
one head) = 1 - Probability(no heads)  Return to AN INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY     Page Author: Jim Albert (© 2005) albert@bayes.bgsu.edu Document: http://www-math.bgsu.edu/~albert/m115/probability/add_probs.html Last Modified: February 18, 2005
