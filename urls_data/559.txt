About  · FAQ · Law · Library · Bibliographies · Books · History · Videos · People       Home  How common is intersex?      To answer this question in an uncontroversial way, you’d have to first get everyone to agree on what counts as intersex —and also to agree on what should count as strictly male or strictly female. That’s hard to do. How small does a penis have to be before it counts as intersex? Do you count “sex chromosome” anomalies as intersex if there’s no apparent external sexual ambiguity? 1 (Alice Dreger explores this question in greater depth in her book Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex .)  Here’s what we do know: If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won’t show up until later in life.  Below we provide a summary of statistics drawn from an article by Brown University researcher Anne Fausto-Sterling. 2 The basis for that article was an extensive review of the medical literature from 1955 to 1998 aimed at producing numeric estimates for the frequency of sex variations. Note that the frequency of some of these conditions, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, differs for different populations. These statistics are approximations.  Not XX and not XY one in 1,666 births Klinefelter (XXY) one in 1,000 births Androgen insensitivity syndrome one in 13,000 births Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome one in 130,000 births Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia one in 13,000 births Late onset adrenal hyperplasia one in 66 individuals Vaginal agenesis one in 6,000 births Ovotestes one in 83,000 births Idiopathic (no discernable medical cause) one in 110,000 births Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment, for instance progestin administered to pregnant mother) no estimate 5 alpha reductase deficiency no estimate Mixed gonadal dysgenesis no estimate Complete gonadal dysgenesis one in 150,000 births Hypospadias (urethral opening in perineum or along penile shaft) one in 2,000 births Hypospadias (urethral opening between corona and tip of glans penis) one in 770 births Total number of people whose bodies differ from standard male or female one in 100 births Total number of people receiving surgery to “normalize” genital appearance one or two in 1,000 births  1 Dreger, Alice Domurat. 1998.

More commonly one or both gonads is an ovotestis containing both types of tissue.  Although similar in some ways to mixed gonadal dysgenesis , the conditions can be distinguished histologically. [2]     Contents    1  Presentation  2  Causes   2.1  Karyotypes    3  Human prevalence  4  Etymology  5  Society and culture   5.1  M.C. v. Aaronson    6  References  7  External links     Presentation [ edit ]  External genitalia are often ambiguous, the degree depending mainly on the amount of testosterone produced by the testicular tissue between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation .  Causes [ edit ]  There are several ways in which this may occur.   It can be caused by the division of one ovum, followed by fertilization of each haploid ovum and fusion of the two zygotes early in development.  Alternately, an ovum can be fertilized by two sperm followed by trisomic rescue in one or more daughter cells.  Two ova fertilized by two sperm cells will occasionally fuse to form a tetragametic chimera . If one male zygote and one female zygote fuse, a hermaphroditic individual may result.  It can be associated with mutation in the SRY gene. [3]   Karyotypes [ edit ]  Encountered karyotypes include 47XXY , 46XX/46XY, or 46XX/47XXY or XX & XY with SRY Mutations, Mixed Chromosomal abnormalities or hormone deficiency/excess disorders, and various degrees of mosaicism of these and a variety of others. The 3 Primary Karyotypes for True Hermaphroditism are XX with genetic defects (55-70% of cases), XX/XY (20-30% of cases) & XY (5-15% of cases) with the remainder being a variety of other Chromosomal abnormalities and Mosaicisms.  Human prevalence [ edit ]  There are no documented cases in which both types of gonadal tissue function. [4]  Although fertility is possible in true hermaphrodites, there has yet to be a documented case where both gonadal tissues function, contrary to the misconception that hermaphrodites can impregnate themselves. As of 2010, there have been at least 11 reported cases of fertility in true hermaphrodite humans in the scientific literature, [2] with one case of a person with XY-predominant (96%) mosaic giving birth. [4]  Etymology [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex in history  The term derives from the Latin : hermaphroditus , from Ancient Greek : ἑρμαφρόδιτος , translit.  hermaphroditos , [5] which derives from Hermaphroditos ( Ἑρμαϕρόδιτος), the son of Hermes and Aphrodite in Greek mythology . According to Ovid , he fused with the nymph  Salmacis resulting in one individual possessing physical traits of both sexes; [6] according to the earlier Diodorus Siculus , he was born with a physical body combining both sexes. [7] The word hermaphrodite entered the English lexicon in the late fourteenth century. [8]  Society and culture [ edit ]  M.C. v. Aaronson [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex rights in the United States  The U.S. legal case of M.C. v. Aaronson , advanced by intersex civil society organization  interACT with the Southern Poverty Law Center was brought before the courts in 2013. [9] [10] [11] [12] The child in the case was born in December 2004 with ovotestes, initially determined as male, but subsequently assigned female and placed in the care of South Carolina Department of Social Services in February 2005. [13] Physicians responsible for M.C. initially concluded that surgery was not urgent or necessary and M.C. had potential to identify as male or female, but, in April 2006, M.C. was subjected to feminizing medical interventions. [13] He was adopted in December 2006. Aged 8 at the time the case was taken, he now identifies as male. The Southern Poverty Law Center state: "In M.C.’s condition, there is no way to tell whether the child will ultimately identify as a boy or a girl. Instead, the doctors decided to assign M.C. female and change his body to fit their stereotype of how a girl should look." [10] [14] The defendant in the case, Dr Ian Aaronson, had written in 2001 that "feminizing genitoplasty on an infant who might eventually identify herself as a boy would be catastrophic". [15] [13]  The defendants sought to dismiss the case and seek a defense of qualified immunity, but these were denied by the District Court for the District of South Carolina. In January 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed this decision and dismissed the complaint, stating that, "it did not “mean to diminish the severe harm that M.C. claims to have suffered” but that a reasonable official in 2006 did not have fair warning from then-existing precedent that performing sex assignment surgery on sixteen-month-old M.C. violated a clearly established constitutional right." [16] The Court did not rule on whether or not the surgery violated M.C.'s constitutional rights. [17]  State suits were subsequently filed. [16] In July 2017, it was reported that the case had been settled out of court by the Medical University of South Carolina for $440,000. The University denied negligence, but agreed to a "compromise" settlement to avoid "costs of litigation." [18]  References [ edit ]     ^  Lee P. A., Houk C. P., Ahmed S. F., Hughes I.

MOST POPULAR   5 May 2011      Share      Tweet      Share      Email   Question I am a 30-year-old woman. Since I was a child I have had a very large clitoris, which has always protruded significantly. I am worried that I may be a hermaphrodite. I now have normal regular periods and no other signs of masculinity (excessive body hair etc.) Why could this be and will it affect my future fertility? I would like to have children. Answer I am sorry to hear of your concerns about your body. ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW As you are no doubt aware, hermaphrodites (people with both female and male internal reproductive organs, ie testicles and ovaries) do exist but the condition is very rare, only about four hundred sufferers being known of today. Most hermaphrodites do not have complete female or male genitalia or complete internal organs. In about one quarter of female hermaphrodites, there is a menstrual cycle with periods and the development of breasts (gynaecomastia). MOST POPULAR I would think that it is much more likely that your clitoris is within the normal size range for a woman. Everybody is different when it comes to the genital area and like men with different sized penises – women have different sized clitorises. I suspect that your doctor has not commented when you have attended for smears that there is any particular abnormality in that area. As you are considering having children in the future, I would advise you to have a chat with your doctor about your worries. A physical examination, combined with an internal examination of the vagina (bi-manual examination) will confirm that you have ovaries and a womb (uterus). Blood tests (to check hormone levels) and an ultrasound scan of your pelvis (to look for any internal tissues that could indicate hermaphroditism) should be enough to allay your fears. If there are any areas of doubt remaining, I am sure that your GP would be happy to refer you on to a specialist gynaecologist or endocrinologist for further investigations. Thank you for raising this question on such a sensitive subject.

In Summary  Is it true that hermaphrodites ‘do sex on themselves’? There is a rumour in school that one of us does so.   Advertisement             Dear doctor, Is it true that hermaphrodites ‘do sex on themselves’? There is a rumour in school that one of us does so. Student Dear student, A hermaphrodite is defined as any organism that has both male and female reproductive organs and this in human beings, is very rare indeed. What is found in humans is vague reproductive parts that make it difficult for those humans to be properly placed as either male or female. That hermaphrodites can have sex by themselves and even reproduce is not possible because either or both of their sex organs are non-functional. Naturally, sex is achieved with an erection that takes the manhood away from the body and therefore cannot be bent towards one’s own body for self-sex. Dear doctor, I take Indocid to relieve my menstrual pains every month. I combine it with my asthma medicine. Is this too strong? What could be the danger of doing this? Shakira Dear Shakira, Indocid is one of the so-called Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) which work by interfering with production of the substances ( prostaglandins), that are mainly responsible for period pains. Prostaglandins cause period pain the same way they cause labour pains by contracting the uterus. However, the likes of Indocid by this action can also lead to wounds in the alimentary canal called peptic ulcers. Also, they lead to accumulation of other substances that can easily lead to an asthma attack. So since you are asthmatic, apart from other undesirable effects from the drug, you are likely to worsen your asthma and therefore need to consult your doctor about use of other painkiller drugs that won’t worsen the asthma. Too many tablets can increase the pill burden, with risk of not taking all the given treatment and in the long run, the ailment not being cured. Dear doctor, I had a C-section after the doctor declared my situation an emergency because the baby stopped moving in the womb. Personally, I knew I had lost my baby on seeing the doctor’s reaction. Though I was very positive about giving birth normally, I was advised not to push because my cervix was not opening. But I’m now pregnant again. Is it possible for me to give birth normally or I should arrange with my doctor for another c-section since I do not want to take chances and end up losing my baby? And what causes the cervix not to open even after the waters have broken? Please advise. Fiona Dear Fiona, A caesarean operation whereby a baby is delivered through a cut on the abdomen is normally done if the baby or the mother’s health is in danger.  Some of the problems that put their health in danger may be present during one pregnancy and not the next and therefore do not necessitate the repeat of the operation during other pregnancies. If the baby got tired and yet the cervix was not open, this necessitated an operation but the same problem may or may not happen during your current pregnancy. That said, you need to religiously attend antenatal clinics for proper care, monitoring and advice. Meanwhile, avoid use of herbs like mumbwa during labour because some contain alcohol which makes the baby tired while others cause the uterus to contract too strongly and may cause the scar to give way, with more dangerous consequences. To answer your second question, cervical dystocia is where the cervix fails to dilate during labour. This can result from scars due to previous injuries or operations to the cervix. This then may call for delivering by caesarean operation whenever a woman has to deliver. Sometimes, failure of cervical dilation may be due to uncoordinated uterine contractions but this may respond to drugs and a caesarean may be done if the baby is tired. Dear doctor, I pass hot wind and even when I’ am seated, I feel it burning my behind. I get embarrassed and look around to see whether people near me smell it. What can I do to solve this problem? Agripina      Dear Agripina, you need not get embarrassed because wind is a normal byproduct of food digestion passed by all humans except those with some sort of obstruction to the intestines. Those who do not pass gas are the ones who need treatment. A feeling that gas is burning might indicate that the anal area is irritated or inflamed, requiring a medic to check it out. The irritation could be due to soap used for washing the anus or other applications and semen if you are a homosexual. That you fear that the gas smells is normal and everyone who passes gas has the same fears. The smell of gas depends on the diet and intestinal bacteria and it is normal for gas to smell. That you are getting jittery over normal events that are performed by everyone  may be an indication that you may have other fears or worries that need to be addressed in their own right. Homosexuality creates guilt feelings in a society that abhors it like in this country. The feelings can lead to being too sensitive, hence the fear about smell and feeling that the gas is hot. Dear doctor, I’m an epileptic who passes wind, stool and foam from my mouth. What worries me is the stool. Is there a way to stop this? Remmy Dear Remmy, epilepsy results from the generation of electrical signals inside the brain, causing one to have fits now and then. The type of fits one gets vary from person to person but usually, the same person may get the same type of fits. Some people with epilepsy simply stare blankly for a few seconds during a fit, but what is locally called epilepsy in Uganda is the worse type where one (1) Loses control and falls to the ground (2) Loses consciousness (3) Gets stiff and starts jerking without control. (4) Stops breathing for some seconds (5) Bites the tongue (6) Loses control of the bladder or rectum and foams at the mouth. (7) Gets confused on waking up. Therefore, uncontrollable passage of stool is one of the few symptoms of epilepsy. Epilepsy in Uganda carries a lot of stigma and people are oblivious of its complications including sudden death. This therefore calls for proper investigation and treatment of epilepsy as a whole instead of seeking to eliminate only one of the embarrassing symptoms. Epilepsy can be properly managed, for one to live a normal life without fear of the embarrassing symptoms like loss of bladder and bowel control. So please see a doctor nearest to you.

Intersex is a group of conditions where there is a discrepancy between the external genitals and the internal genitals (the testes and ovaries). The older term for this condition is hermaphroditism. Although the older terms are still included in this article for reference, they have been replaced by most experts, patients and families. Increasingly, this group of conditions is being called disorders of sex development (DSDs). Causes   Intersex can be divided into 4 categories: 46, XX intersex 46, XY intersex True gonadal intersex Complex or undetermined intersex Each one is discussed in more detail below. Note: In many children, the cause of intersex may remain undetermined, even with modern diagnostic techniques. 46, XX INTERSEX The person has the chromosomes of a woman, the ovaries of a woman, but external (outside) genitals that appear male. This most often is the result of a female fetus having been exposed to excess male hormones before birth. The labia ("lips" or folds of skin of the external female genitals) fuse, and the clitoris enlarges to appear like a penis. In most cases, this person has a normal uterus and fallopian tubes. This condition is also called 46, XX with virilization . It used to be called female pseudohermaphroditism. There are several possible causes: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (the most common cause). Male hormones (such as testosterone ) taken or encountered by the mother during pregnancy. Male hormone-producing tumors in the mother: These are most often ovarian tumors . Mothers who have children with 46, XX intersex should be checked unless there is another clear cause. Aromatase deficiency: This one may not be noticeable until puberty. Aromatase is an enzyme that normally converts male hormones to female hormones. Too much aromatase activity can lead to excess estrogen (female hormone); too little to 46, XX intersex. At puberty, these XX children, who had been raised as girls, may begin to take on male characteristics. 46, XY INTERSEX The person has the chromosomes of a man, but the external genitals are incompletely formed, ambiguous, or clearly female. Internally, testes may be normal, malformed, or absent. This condition is also called 46, XY with undervirilization. It used to be called male pseudohermaphroditism. Formation of normal male external genitals depends on the appropriate balance between male and female hormones. Therefore, it requires the adequate production and function of male hormones. 46, XY intersex has many possible causes: Problems with the testes: The testes normally produce male hormones. If the testes do not form properly, it will lead to undervirilization. There are a number of possible causes for this, including XY pure gonadal dysgenesis . Problems with testosterone formation: Testosterone is formed through a series of steps. Each of these steps requires a different enzyme. Deficiencies in any of these enzymes can result in inadequate testosterone and produce a different syndrome of 46, XY intersex. Different types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia can fall in this category. Problems with using testosterone: Some people have normal testes and make adequate amounts of testosterone, but still have 46, XY intersex due to conditions such as 5-alpha-reductase deficiency or androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). People with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency lack the enzyme needed to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). There are at least 5 different types of 5-alpha-reductase deficiency. Some of the babies have normal male genitalia, some have normal female genitalia, and many have something in between. Most change to external male genitalia around the time of puberty. AIS is the most common cause of 46, XY intersex. It has also been called testicular feminization. Here, the hormones are all normal, but the receptors to male hormones don't function properly. There are over 150 different defects that have been identified so far, and each causes a different type of AIS. TRUE GONADAL INTERSEX The person must have both ovarian and testicular tissue. This may be in the same gonad (an ovotestis), or the person might have 1 ovary and 1 testis. The person may have XX chromosomes, XY chromosomes, or both. The external genitals may be ambiguous or may appear to be female or male. This condition used to be called true hermaphroditism. In most people with true gonadal intersex, the underlying cause is unknown, although in some animal studies it has been linked to exposure to common agricultural pesticides. COMPLEX OR UNDETERMINED INTERSEX DISORDERS OF SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT Many chromosome configurations other than simple 46, XX or 46, XY can result in disorders of sex development. These include 45, XO (only one X chromosome), and 47, XXY, 47, XXX - both cases have an extra sex chromosome, either an X or a Y. These disorders do not result in a condition where there is discrepancy between internal and external genitalia. However, there may be problems with sex hormone levels, overall sexual development, and altered numbers of sex chromosomes. Symptoms   The symptoms associated with intersex will depend on the underlying cause. They may include: Ambiguous genitalia at birth Micropenis Clitoromegaly (an enlarged clitoris) Partial labial fusion Apparently undescended testes (which may turn out to be ovaries) in boys Labial or inguinal (groin) masses (which may turn out to be testes) in girls Hypospadias (the opening of the penis is somewhere other than at the tip; in females, the urethra [urine canal] opens into the vagina) Otherwise unusual-appearing genitalia at birth Electrolyte abnormalities Delayed or absent puberty Unexpected changes at puberty Exams and Tests   The following tests and exams may be done: Chromosome analysis Hormone levels (for example, testosterone level) Hormone stimulation tests Electrolyte tests Specific molecular testing Endoscopic exam (to verify the absence or presence of a vagina or cervix ) Ultrasound or MRI to evaluate whether internal sex organs are present (for example, a uterus) Treatment   Ideally, a team of health care professionals with expertise in intersex should work together to understand and treat the child with intersex and support the family. Parents should understand controversies and changes in treating intersex in recent years. In the past, the prevailing opinion was that it was generally best to assign a gender as quickly as possible. This was often based on the external genitals rather than the chromosomal gender. Parents were told to have no ambiguity in their minds as to the gender of the child. Prompt surgery was often recommended. Ovarian or testicular tissue from the other gender would be removed. In general, it was considered easier to reconstruct female genitalia than functioning male genitalia, so if the "correct" choice was not clear, the child was often assigned to be a girl. More recently, the opinion of many experts has shifted. Greater respect for the complexities of female sexual functioning has led them to conclude that suboptimal female genitalia may not be inherently better than suboptimal male genitalia, even if the reconstruction is "easier." In addition, other factors may be more important in gender satisfaction than functioning external genitals. Chromosomal, neural, hormonal, psychological, and behavioral factors can all influence gender identity. Many experts now urge delaying definitive surgery for as long as is healthy, and ideally involving the child in the gender decision. Clearly, intersex is a complex issue, and its treatment has short- and long-term consequences. The best answer will depend on many factors, including the specific cause of the intersex. It is best to take the time to understand the issues before rushing into a decision. An intersex support group may help acquaint families with the latest research, and may provide a community of other families, children, and adult individuals who have faced the same issues. Support Groups   Support groups are very important for families dealing with intersex. Different support groups may differ in their thoughts regarding this very sensitive topic. Look for one that supports your thoughts and feelings on the topic.

The prognosis depends on the specific cause of intersex. With understanding, support, and appropriate treatment, overall outlook is excellent.

I saw this program on the Discovery Channel about kids who were born with both male and female genitalia and for the rest of my pregnancy I was like 'I'm definitely going to have a hermaphrodite baby.'" â€“ Heather Armstrong of Dooce  Reality check: Luckily, the odds are on your side on this one. Hermaphrodites (or intersex babies, as theyâ€™re now called) make up a measly one percent of all live births. As for the chance that baby will be born with other physical deformities, recent stats say only three percent of all babies born in the U.S. wind up with significant physical birth defects each year (though this number reflects a very wide range of defects, big and small). While the rates are pretty slim, it's definitely still possible. But until you know for sure, try to curb some of your anxiety.

I'd be so torn. If the baby was born a true intersection baby, wouldn't you then get the option to choose the sex? Even if the reproductive organs weren't working (which I think would be the case in a true intersex baby, because otherwise it'd more or less be just a genital deformation requiring corrective surgery, right?), you'd at least get to choose the "cosmetic" procedure to give your child a vagina or penis. But what if they hit puberty and don't identify with the sex you chose? I'd feel so guilty, knowing the confusion and pain transsexuals have had to deal with. I think if that happened, I know I'd support my child's decision if they wanted to change their sex, but I think I'd be so mad at myself (because I know myself and can be extremely hard and critical of myself at times) because I'd feel that I should have instinctively known or something. Wow. I've never thought of the possibility of having an "it" before. I should stop talking now. Haha Sorry. I tend to analyze and think deeply about everything. :-p  P.S. If any of you have been in this situation or ever find yourself in this situation, my post in no way reflects my opinion of transsexuals or their parents. I'm very open minded about that.

We were having a conversation on the phone last night about the sex of our babies. She mentioned to me that her friend thought she was having a boy throughout her whole pregnancy and delivered a girl then somewhere in the conversation she brought up hermaphrodites!! She asked me ''what are the chances that we might deliver an intersex baby?'' What would you do? I have actually never thought about that and it kind of freaked me out a bit. I immediately starting googling the chances, found this website that said 1 in 20,0000. I also googled ''Would you be able to tell in an ultrasound if the baby has both male and female parts (hermaphrodite) couldn't find an answer. I know that this is very rare but I don't know why still kinda freaking me out lol I guess because the subject never crossed my mind and now it just won't leave my brain lol. What do you know about the subject? Do you know anyone that had an intersex baby? Do you know if you can tell on an ultrasound? What would you do? Has this subject cross your mind?  I really want to read any of your thoughts on this or anything you might now on the subject.

Once the baby identified with a certain gender they could decided later on to have a surgery to fit that identification. It happens, whether a baby is born intersex or with a certain defined sex. It doesn't mean it automatically is that gender. Wouldn't be any different for me I guess.    --  Proud & Happy Single Mom DS- 9/2004 DD-10/2014             Reply            Report this comment        5                     MercyAnew    Posted 07/19/2014      It's crossed my mind a lot. I have a hermaphrodite cousin and a transgender friend. I wouldn't choose and I would protect their gender identity until they were older, 18 (not six) and felt they could choose for themselves. I think having genetic tests and ultrasounds of internal organs would be helpful information for them in deciding so i would be a medical advocate for my child to provide that information and opportunities for him/her.

I'm not sure I'd do any surgeries early on. Just not worth it, IMO.

It's so rare you probably don't need to be worrying about it. BUT if it were me ... I would do tons of research, because I want to do the right thing but also because  I like to research. :) If I HAD to choose, I'd probably discuss with the doctor which hormones are most likely to take over at puberty and go with that. But I wouldn't force any gender identity. I'd buy the most neutural toys/clothes possible and come up with a more androgynous nickname until the child was old enough to tell me what clothes and toys they want. I have lots of LGBT friends and most knew pretty early in life how they identified, so I figure the kid would tell me when he or she got old enough. (Editing to clarify that I would not have the child have surgery. If that was necessary later in life after puberty, we'd do it then). Honestly, regardless of what gender my baby is (we're going to be surprised, so I have no idea), I will try not to force gender expectations. Sure, I'll dress a girl in cute frilly clothes as long as I can get away with it, but if she wants to play sports and get muddy with the boys, that's fine. If I have a boy who wants me to paint his room pink and play with barbies, that's awesome too. If my child turns out to be transgender, I'll look for a doctor and cousnelor that can best help him or her work through things and when the kid is old enough, if he or she wants to transition, I'll be supportive and say, "What pronouns and name would you like me to use?" If I have a gay kid, I'll become president of the local PFLAG chapter.

I read that based on that it is how the parents decide the sex.... But I guess that could always change :( I mean it does in people that were born with just one sex organ as well so its hit or miss.

The odds that a pregnancy will result in the birth of a Hermaphrodite are approximately 1 in 250,000 (0.0004%) Now, I'm not gonna go out on a limb and say that Lady Gaga is a Hermaphrodite, thats for you, and bookies, and her traumatized boyfriend to discuss. Not that I'm above that or anything, I just prefer dealing with facts and quantifiable data...With that said, Lady Gaga is mentally retarded. And the creative director for The Muppets dresses her.

About  · FAQ · Law · Library · Bibliographies · Books · History · Videos · People       Home  How common is intersex?      To answer this question in an uncontroversial way, you’d have to first get everyone to agree on what counts as intersex —and also to agree on what should count as strictly male or strictly female. That’s hard to do. How small does a penis have to be before it counts as intersex? Do you count “sex chromosome” anomalies as intersex if there’s no apparent external sexual ambiguity? 1 (Alice Dreger explores this question in greater depth in her book Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex .)  Here’s what we do know: If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won’t show up until later in life.  Below we provide a summary of statistics drawn from an article by Brown University researcher Anne Fausto-Sterling. 2 The basis for that article was an extensive review of the medical literature from 1955 to 1998 aimed at producing numeric estimates for the frequency of sex variations. Note that the frequency of some of these conditions, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, differs for different populations. These statistics are approximations.  Not XX and not XY one in 1,666 births Klinefelter (XXY) one in 1,000 births Androgen insensitivity syndrome one in 13,000 births Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome one in 130,000 births Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia one in 13,000 births Late onset adrenal hyperplasia one in 66 individuals Vaginal agenesis one in 6,000 births Ovotestes one in 83,000 births Idiopathic (no discernable medical cause) one in 110,000 births Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment, for instance progestin administered to pregnant mother) no estimate 5 alpha reductase deficiency no estimate Mixed gonadal dysgenesis no estimate Complete gonadal dysgenesis one in 150,000 births Hypospadias (urethral opening in perineum or along penile shaft) one in 2,000 births Hypospadias (urethral opening between corona and tip of glans penis) one in 770 births Total number of people whose bodies differ from standard male or female one in 100 births Total number of people receiving surgery to “normalize” genital appearance one or two in 1,000 births  1 Dreger, Alice Domurat. 1998.

More commonly one or both gonads is an ovotestis containing both types of tissue.  Although similar in some ways to mixed gonadal dysgenesis , the conditions can be distinguished histologically. [2]     Contents    1  Presentation  2  Causes   2.1  Karyotypes    3  Human prevalence  4  Etymology  5  Society and culture   5.1  M.C. v. Aaronson    6  References  7  External links     Presentation [ edit ]  External genitalia are often ambiguous, the degree depending mainly on the amount of testosterone produced by the testicular tissue between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation .  Causes [ edit ]  There are several ways in which this may occur.   It can be caused by the division of one ovum, followed by fertilization of each haploid ovum and fusion of the two zygotes early in development.  Alternately, an ovum can be fertilized by two sperm followed by trisomic rescue in one or more daughter cells.  Two ova fertilized by two sperm cells will occasionally fuse to form a tetragametic chimera . If one male zygote and one female zygote fuse, a hermaphroditic individual may result.  It can be associated with mutation in the SRY gene. [3]   Karyotypes [ edit ]  Encountered karyotypes include 47XXY , 46XX/46XY, or 46XX/47XXY or XX & XY with SRY Mutations, Mixed Chromosomal abnormalities or hormone deficiency/excess disorders, and various degrees of mosaicism of these and a variety of others. The 3 Primary Karyotypes for True Hermaphroditism are XX with genetic defects (55-70% of cases), XX/XY (20-30% of cases) & XY (5-15% of cases) with the remainder being a variety of other Chromosomal abnormalities and Mosaicisms.  Human prevalence [ edit ]  There are no documented cases in which both types of gonadal tissue function. [4]  Although fertility is possible in true hermaphrodites, there has yet to be a documented case where both gonadal tissues function, contrary to the misconception that hermaphrodites can impregnate themselves. As of 2010, there have been at least 11 reported cases of fertility in true hermaphrodite humans in the scientific literature, [2] with one case of a person with XY-predominant (96%) mosaic giving birth. [4]  Etymology [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex in history  The term derives from the Latin : hermaphroditus , from Ancient Greek : ἑρμαφρόδιτος , translit.  hermaphroditos , [5] which derives from Hermaphroditos ( Ἑρμαϕρόδιτος), the son of Hermes and Aphrodite in Greek mythology . According to Ovid , he fused with the nymph  Salmacis resulting in one individual possessing physical traits of both sexes; [6] according to the earlier Diodorus Siculus , he was born with a physical body combining both sexes. [7] The word hermaphrodite entered the English lexicon in the late fourteenth century. [8]  Society and culture [ edit ]  M.C. v. Aaronson [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex rights in the United States  The U.S. legal case of M.C. v. Aaronson , advanced by intersex civil society organization  interACT with the Southern Poverty Law Center was brought before the courts in 2013. [9] [10] [11] [12] The child in the case was born in December 2004 with ovotestes, initially determined as male, but subsequently assigned female and placed in the care of South Carolina Department of Social Services in February 2005. [13] Physicians responsible for M.C. initially concluded that surgery was not urgent or necessary and M.C. had potential to identify as male or female, but, in April 2006, M.C. was subjected to feminizing medical interventions. [13] He was adopted in December 2006. Aged 8 at the time the case was taken, he now identifies as male. The Southern Poverty Law Center state: "In M.C.’s condition, there is no way to tell whether the child will ultimately identify as a boy or a girl. Instead, the doctors decided to assign M.C. female and change his body to fit their stereotype of how a girl should look." [10] [14] The defendant in the case, Dr Ian Aaronson, had written in 2001 that "feminizing genitoplasty on an infant who might eventually identify herself as a boy would be catastrophic". [15] [13]  The defendants sought to dismiss the case and seek a defense of qualified immunity, but these were denied by the District Court for the District of South Carolina. In January 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed this decision and dismissed the complaint, stating that, "it did not “mean to diminish the severe harm that M.C. claims to have suffered” but that a reasonable official in 2006 did not have fair warning from then-existing precedent that performing sex assignment surgery on sixteen-month-old M.C. violated a clearly established constitutional right." [16] The Court did not rule on whether or not the surgery violated M.C.'s constitutional rights. [17]  State suits were subsequently filed. [16] In July 2017, it was reported that the case had been settled out of court by the Medical University of South Carolina for $440,000. The University denied negligence, but agreed to a "compromise" settlement to avoid "costs of litigation." [18]  References [ edit ]     ^  Lee P. A., Houk C. P., Ahmed S. F., Hughes I.

[1] [2] Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female . [3] [4]  Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites , "congenital eunuchs", [5] [6] or congenitally "frigid". [7] Such terms have fallen out of favor; in particular, the term "hermaphrodite" is considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious. [8] Medical description of intersex traits as disorders of sex development has been controversial [9] [10] [11] since the label was introduced in 2006. [12]  Intersex people may face stigmatization and discrimination from birth or discovery of an intersex trait. This may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. [13] [14] [15] Globally, some intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, are surgically or hormonally altered to create more socially acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of good outcomes. [16] Such treatments may involve sterilization . Adults, including elite female athletes, have also been subjects of such treatment. [17] [18] Increasingly these issues are considered human rights abuses, with statements from international [19] [20] and national human rights and ethics institutions. [21] [22] Intersex organizations have also issued statements about human rights violations, including the Malta declaration of the third International Intersex Forum . [23]  In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] [26]  Some intersex persons may be assigned and raised as a girl or boy but then identify with another gender later in life, while most continue to identify with their assigned sex.

Odiele disclosed that she has the intersex trait androgen insensitivity syndrome in 2017    According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights :   Intersex people are born with sex characteristics (including genitals, gonads and chromosome patterns) that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies.  Intersex is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of natural bodily variations. In some cases, intersex traits are visible at birth while in others, they are not apparent until puberty. Some chromosomal intersex variations may not be physically apparent at all. [2]   In biological terms, sex may be determined by a number of factors present at birth, including: [30]   the number and type of sex chromosomes ;  the type of gonads —ovaries or testicles;  the sex hormones ;  the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the uterus in females); and  the external genitalia.   People whose characteristics are not either all typically male or all typically female at birth are intersex. [31]  Some intersex traits are not always visible at birth; some babies may be born with ambiguous genitals, while others may have ambiguous internal organs (testes and ovaries). Others will not become aware that they are intersex unless they receive genetic testing, because it does not manifest in their phenotype.  History [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex in history , Timeline of intersex history , and History of intersex surgery      Hermaphroditus in a wall painting from Herculaneum (first half of the 1st century AD)    Whether or not they were socially tolerated or accepted by any particular culture, the existence of intersex people was known to many ancient and pre-modern cultures. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote of "hermaphroditus" in the first century BCE that Hermaphroditus "is born with a physical body which is a combination of that of a man and that of a woman", and with supernatural properties. [32]      Edward Coke , The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England (1st ed, 1628, title page)    In European societies, Roman law , post-classical canon law , and later common law , referred to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. [33] The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani states that "Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails". [34] [35] [36] The foundation of common law, the 17th Century Institutes of the Lawes of England described how a hermaphrodite could inherit "either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile." [37] [38] Legal cases have been described in canon law and elsewhere over the centuries.  In some non-European societies, sex or gender systems with more than two categories may have allowed for other forms of inclusion of both intersex and transgender people. Such societies have been characterized as "primitive", while Morgan Holmes states that subsequent analysis has been simplistic or romanticized, failing to take account of the ways that subjects of all categories are treated. [39]  During the Victorian era , medical authors introduced the terms " true hermaphrodite " for an individual who has both ovarian and testicular tissue, "male pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with testicular tissue, but either female or ambiguous sexual anatomy, and "female pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with ovarian tissue, but either male or ambiguous sexual anatomy. Some later shifts in terminology have reflected advances in genetics, while other shifts are suggested to be due to pejorative associations. [40]  The term intersexuality was coined by Richard Goldschmidt in 1917. [41] The first suggestion to replace the term 'hermaphrodite' with 'intersex' was made by Cawadias in the 1940s. [42]  Since the rise of modern medical science, some intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals. Surgeons pinpointed intersex babies as a "social emergency" when born. [43] An 'optimal gender policy', initially developed by John Money , stated that early intervention helped avoid gender identity confusion, but this lacks evidence, [44] and early interventions have adverse consequences for psychological and physical health. [22] Since advances in surgery have made it possible for intersex conditions to be concealed, many people are not aware of how frequently intersex conditions arise in human beings or that they occur at all. [45]  Dialog between what were once antagonistic groups of activists and clinicians has led to only slight changes in medical policies and how intersex patients and their families are treated in some locations. [46] In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] Many civil society organizations and human rights institutions now call for an end to unnecessary "normalizing" interventions, including in the Malta declaration . [47] [1]  Human rights and legal issues [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex rights by country  Human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on harmful practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions including, in 2015, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the World Health Organization . These developments have been accompanied by International Intersex Forums and increased cooperation amongst civil society organizations. However, the implementation, codification and enforcement of intersex human rights in national legal systems remains slow.  Areas of concern include: non-consensual medical interventions; stigma, discrimination and equal treatment; access to reparations and justice; access to information and support, and legal recognition.  Physical integrity and bodily autonomy [ edit ]       Legal prohibition of non-consensual medical interventions   Regulatory suspension of non-consensual medical interventions     Main articles: Intersex human rights and Intersex medical interventions  Stigmatization and discrimination from birth may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in east Africa may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a curse. [13] [14] Abandonments and infanticides have been reported in Uganda , [13]  Kenya , [48]  south Asia , [49] and China . [15]  Infants, children and adolescents also experience "normalising" interventions on intersex persons that are medically unnecessary and the unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics. Medical interventions to modify the sex characteristics of intersex people, without the consent of the intersex person have taken place in all countries where the human rights of intersex people have been studied. [50] These interventions have frequently been performed with the consent of the intersex person's parents, when the person is legally too young to consent. Such interventions have been criticized by the World Health Organization, other UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and an increasing number of regional and national institutions due to their adverse consequences, including trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw surgical intervention without consent. [25] [26] In the same year, the Council of Europe became the first institution to state that intersex people have the right not to undergo sex affirmation interventions. [25] [26] [51] [52] [53]  Anti-discrimination and equal treatment [ edit ]       Explicit protection on grounds of sex characteristics   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex status   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex within attribute of sex     Main article: Discrimination against intersex people  Inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law . Because people born with intersex bodies are seen as different, intersex infants, children, adolescents and adults "are often stigmatized and subjected to multiple human rights violations", including discrimination in education, healthcare, employment, sport, and public services. [2] [1] [54] Several countries have so far explicitly protected intersex people from discrimination, with landmarks including South Africa , [26] [55]  Australia , [56] [57] and, most comprehensively, Malta. [58] [59] [60] [61] [62]  Reparations and justice [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Facilitating access to justice and reparations . Access to reparation appears limited, with a scarcity of legal cases, such as the 2011 case of Christiane Völling in Germany . [24] [63] A second case was adjudicated in Chile in 2012, involving a child and his parents. [64] [65] A further successful case in Germany, taken by Michaela Raab, was reported in 2015. [66] In the United States , the "M.C." legal case, advanced by Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth with the Southern Poverty Law Centre is still before the courts. [67] [68]  Information and support [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Access to information , medical records, peer and other counselling and support. With the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, a secrecy-based model was also adopted, in the belief that this was necessary to ensure "normal" physical and psychosocial development. [21] [22] [69] [70] [71] [72]  Legal recognition [ edit ]  Main article: Legal recognition of intersex people  The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions states that legal recognition is firstly "about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women." [23] In some regions, obtaining any form of birth certification may be an issue. A Kenyan court case in 2014 established the right of an intersex boy, "Baby A", to a birth certificate. [73]  Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a certain sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not. [3] [4] [28] [29] Recognition of third sex or gender classifications occurs in several countries, [74] [75] [76] [77] however, it is controversial when it becomes assumed or coercive, as is the case with some German infants . [78] [79] [80] Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third 'X' sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an "X" or "other" option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure. [27] [81]  Language [ edit ]     U.S. intersex activist Pidgeon Pagonis    Research in the late 20th century led to a growing medical consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal, but relatively rare, forms of human biology. [4] [82] [83] [84] Clinician and researcher Milton Diamond stresses the importance of care in the selection of language related to intersex people:   Foremost, we advocate use of the terms "typical", "usual", or "most frequent" where it is more common to use the term "normal." When possible avoid expressions like maldeveloped or undeveloped, errors of development, defective genitals, abnormal, or mistakes of nature. Emphasize that all of these conditions are biologically understandable while they are statistically uncommon. [85]   The term 'intersex' [ edit ]  Some people with intersex traits self-identify as intersex, and some do not. [86] [87] Australian sociological research published in 2016, found that 60% of respondents used the term "intersex" to self-describe their sex characteristics, including people identifying themselves as intersex, describing themselves as having an intersex variation or, in smaller numbers, having an intersex condition. A majority of 75% of survey respondents also self-described as male or female. [27] Respondents also commonly used diagnostic labels and referred to their sex chromosomes, with word choices depending on audience. [27] [81] Research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that 80% of affected Support Group respondents "strongly liked, liked or felt neutral about intersex" as a term, while caregivers were less supportive. [88] The hospital reported that "disorders of sex development" may negatively affect care. [89]  Some intersex organizations reference "intersex people" and "intersex variations or traits" [90] while others use more medicalized language such as "people with intersex conditions", [91] or people "with intersex conditions or DSDs (differences of sex development)" and "children born with variations of sex anatomy". [92] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth published a statement recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  Hermaphrodite [ edit ]  Main article: Hermaphrodite  A hermaphrodite is an organism that has both male and female reproductive organs. Until the mid-20th century, "hermaphrodite" was used synonymously with "intersex". [42] The distinctions "male pseudohermaphrodite", "female pseudohermaphrodite" and especially " true hermaphrodite " [94] are vestiges of outdated 19th-century thinking, reflecting histology (microscopic appearance) of the gonads . [95] [96] [97] Medical terminology has shifted not only due to concerns about language, but also a shift to understandings based on genetics .  Currently, hermaphroditism is not to be confused with intersex, as the former refers only to a specific phenotypical presentation of sex organs and the latter to more complex combination of phenotypical and genotypical presentation. Using "hermaphrodite" to refer to intersex individuals is considered to be stigmatizing and misleading. [98]  Hermaphrodite is used for animal and vegetal species in which the possession of both ovaries and testes is either serial or concurrent, and for living organisms without such gonads but present binary form of reproduction, which is part of the typical life history of those species; intersex has come to be used when this is not the case.  Disorders of sex development [ edit ]  Main article: Disorders of sex development  " Disorders of sex development " (DSD) is a contested term, [9] [10] defined to include congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. Members of the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric  Endocrine Society and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology adopted this term in their "Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders". [12] [44] While it adopted the term, to open "many more doors", the now defunct Intersex Society of North America itself remarked that intersex is not a disorder. [99] Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested the adoption of the terminology and its implied status as a "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who do not feel that there is something wrong with them, regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy. [100]  Sociological research in Australia, published in 2016, found that 3% of respondents used the term "disorders of sex development" or "DSD" to define their sex characteristics, while 21% use the term when accessing medical services. In contrast, 60% used the term "intersex" in some form to self-describe their sex characteristics. [81] U.S. research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that "disorders of sex development" terminology may negatively affect care, give offence, and result in lower attendance at medical clinics. [89] [88]  Alternatives to categorizing intersex conditions as "disorders" have been suggested, including "variations of sex development". [11]  Organisation Intersex International (OII) questions a disease/disability approach, argues for deferral of intervention unless medically necessary, when fully informed consent of the individual involved is possible, and self-determination of sex/gender orientation and identity. [101] The UK Intersex Association is also highly critical of the label 'disorders' and points to the fact that there was minimal involvement of intersex representatives in the debate which led to the change in terminology. [102] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth also published a statement opposing pathologizing language to describe people born with intersex traits, recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  LGBT and LGBTI [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex and LGBT  Intersex can be contrasted with homosexuality or same-sex attraction . Numerous studies have shown higher rates of same sex attraction in intersex people, [103] [104] with a recent Australian study of people born with atypical sex characteristics finding that 52% of respondents were non-heterosexual, [27] [81] thus research on intersex subjects has been used to explore means of preventing homosexuality. [103] [104] However, current studies do not support a statistical correlation between genetic intersex traits and transsexual persons. [105] [106]  Intersex can therefore be contrasted with transgender , [107] which describes the condition in which one's gender identity does not match one's assigned sex. [107] [108] [109] Some people are both intersex and transgender. [110] A 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced gender dysphoria . [28] In an analysis of the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to eliminate intersex traits, Behrmann and Ravitsky state: "Parental choice against intersex may ... conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  The relationship of intersex to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans, and queer communities is complex, [112] but intersex people are often added to LGBT to create an LGBTI community. Emi Koyama describes how inclusion of intersex in LGBTI can fail to address intersex-specific human rights issues, including creating false impressions "that intersex people's rights are protected" by laws protecting LGBT people, and failing to acknowledge that many intersex people are not LGBT. [113]  Organisation Intersex International Australia states that some intersex individuals are same sex attracted, and some are heterosexual, but "LGBTI activism has fought for the rights of people who fall outside of expected binary sex and gender norms." [114] [115]  Julius Kaggwa of SIPD Uganda has written that, while the gay community "offers us a place of relative safety, it is also oblivious to our specific needs". [116]  Mauro Cabral has written that transgender people and organizations "need to stop approaching intersex issues as if they were trans issues" including use of intersex as a means of explaining being transgender; "we can collaborate a lot with the intersex movement by making it clear how wrong that approach is". [117]  Intersex in society [ edit ]     Kristi Bruce after shooting the documentary XXXY , 2000    Fiction and media [ edit ]  Main articles: Literature about intersex and Intersex characters in fiction  An intersex character is the narrator in Jeffrey Eugenides ' Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Middlesex .  Television works about intersex and films about intersex are scarce. The Spanish-language film XXY won the Critics' Week grand prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and the ACID/CCAS Support Award. [118]  Faking It is notable for providing the first intersex main character in a television show, [119] and television's first intersex character played by an intersex actor. [120]  Civil society institutions [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex civil society organizations  Intersex peer support and advocacy organizations have existed since at least 1985, with the establishment of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia in 1985. [121] The Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (UK) established in 1988. [122] The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) may have been one of the first intersex civil society organizations to have been open to people regardless of diagnosis; it was active from 1993 to 2008. [123]  Events [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex Awareness Day and Intersex Day of Remembrance  Intersex Awareness Day is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight the challenges faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 26 October. It marks the first public demonstration by intersex people, which took place in Boston on October 26, 1996, outside a venue where the American Academy of Pediatrics was holding its annual conference. [124]  Intersex Day of Remembrance , also known as Intersex Solidarity Day, is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight issues faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 8 November. It marks the birthday of Herculine Barbin , a French intersex person whose memoirs were later published by Michel Foucault in Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite .  Flag [ edit ]     Intersex Pride flag    Main article: Intersex flag  The intersex flag was created by Organisation Intersex International Australia in July 2013 to create a flag "that is not derivative, but is yet firmly grounded in meaning". The organization aimed to create a symbol without gendered pink and blue colors. It describes yellow and purple as " hermaphrodite " colors. The organization describes it as freely available "for use by any intersex person or organization who wishes to use it, in a human rights affirming community context". [125]  Religion [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex people and religion  In Hinduism , Sangam literature uses the word pedi to refer to people born with an intersex condition; it also refers to antharlinga hijras and various other hijras . [126] Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded but provokes parental fear. [49]  In Islam , scholars of Islamic jurisprudence have detailed discussions on the status and rights of intersex based on what mainly exhibits in their external sexual organs. Yet, modern Islamic jurisprudence scholars turn to medical screening to determine the dominance of their sex. The intersex rights includes rights of inheritance, rights to marriage, rights to live like any other male or female. The rights are generally based on whether they are true hermaphrodites, or pseudo hermaphrodite. Scholars of Islamic jurisprudence generally consider their rights based on the majority of what appears from their external sexual organs. [ citation needed ]  In Judaism , the Talmud contains extensive discussion concerning the status of two intersex types in Jewish law; namely the androginus , which exhibits both male and female external sexual organs, and the tumtum which exhibits neither. In the 1970s and 1980s, the treatment of intersex babies started to be discussed in Orthodox Jewish medical halacha by prominent rabbinic leaders, for example Eliezer Waldenberg and Moshe Feinstein . [127]  Sport [ edit ]      Stanisława Walasiewicz (Stella Walsh) in 1933    Main article: Sex verification in sports  Multiple athletes have been humiliated, excluded from competition or been forced to return medals following discovery of an intersex trait. Examples include Erik Schinegger , Foekje Dillema , Maria José Martínez-Patiño and Santhi Soundarajan . In contrast, Stanisława Walasiewicz (also known as Stella Walsh) was the subject of posthumous controversy. [128]  The South African middle-distance runner Caster Semenya won gold at the World Championships in the women's 800 meter and won silver in the 2012 Summer Olympics. When Semenya won gold in the World Championships, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) requested sex verification tests. The results were not released, but Semenya was cleared to race with other women. [129]  Katrina Karkazis , Rebecca Jordan-Young , Georgiann Davis and Silvia Camporesi argued that new IAAF policies on "hyperandrogenism" in female athletes (applied for example to the case of Dutee Chand ), established in response to the Semenya case, are "significantly flawed", arguing that the policy will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify "gender policing". They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender. [130]  In April 2014, the BMJ reported that four elite women athletes with 5-ARD were subjected to sterilization and "partial clitoridectomies" in order to compete in sport. The authors noted that "partial clitoridectomy" was "not medically indicated, does not relate to real or perceived athletic "advantage". [17] Intersex advocates regard this intervention as "a clearly coercive process". [131] In 2016, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on health, Dainius Pūras, criticized "current and historic" sex verification policies, describing how "a number of athletes have undergone gonadectomy (removal of reproductive organs) and partial clitoridectomy (a form of female genital mutilation ) in the absence of symptoms or health issues warranting those procedures." [132]  Population figures [ edit ]  There are few firm estimates of the number of intersex people. While human rights institutions have called for the demedicalisation of intersex traits, as far as possible, [21] [51] [133] [134] medical definitions are often still used. The now-defunct Intersex Society of North America stated that:   If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won't show up until later in life. [135]   According to Blackless, Fausto-Sterling et al., 1.7 percent of human births are intersex, including variations that may not become apparent until, for example, puberty, or until attempting to conceive. [136] [137] Some clinicians do not favor such definitions. According to Leonard Sax, intersex should be "restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female", around 0.018%. This definition excludes Klinefelter syndrome and many other variations. [138] He in turn criticizes Fausto-Sterling for counting Late-Onset Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia for 88% of her figure. His rebuttal concludes,   "The most original feature of Fausto-Sterling's book is her reluctance to classify true intersex conditions as pathological (Fausto-Sterling, 2000, p. 113) ... She often uses the word natural synonymously with normal. However, natural and normal are not synonyms. A cow may give birth to a two-headed or Siamese calf by natural processes, natural being understood as per Fausto-Sterling's definition as "produced by nature." Nevertheless, that two-headed calf unarguably manifests an abnormal condition. Fausto-Sterling's insistence that all combinations of sexual anatomy be regarded as normal... follows that classifications of normal and abnormal sexual anatomy are mere social conventions, prejudices which can and should be set aside by an enlightened intelligentsia. This type of extreme social constructionism is confusing and is not helpful to clinicians, to their patients, or to their patients' families. Diluting the term intersex to include "any deviation from the Platonic ideal of sexual dimorphism" (Blackless et al., 2000, p. 152), as Fausto-Sterling suggests, deprives the term of any clinically useful meaning." [139]   However, many conditions excluded from Sax's analysis are currently regarded as disorders of sex development . Individuals with those diagnoses may experience stigma and discrimination due to their sex characteristics, including sex "normalizing" interventions, and so those diagnoses and life experiences meet definitions of intersex in use by UN and other bodies. As a result, the statistical analyses by Blackless and Fausto-Sterling, despite her outdated and perceived offensive use of the term hermaphrodite, [140] have become widely quoted, [51] [141] including by other clinicians. [142] The following summarizes those frequency statistics:    Sex Variation  Frequency    Not XX, XY, Klinefelter, or Turner  one in 1,666 births    Klinefelter syndrome (XXY)  one in 1,000 births    Turner syndrome (45,X)  one in 2,710 births [143]    Androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 13,000 births    Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 130,000 births    Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia  one in 13,000 births    Late onset adrenal hyperplasia  one in 10,000 births. [144]    Vaginal agenesis  one in 6,000 births    Ovotestes  one in 83,000 births    Idiopathic (no discernable medical cause)  one in 110,000 births    Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment, e.g. progestin administered to pregnant mother)  No estimate    5-alpha-reductase deficiency  No estimate    Mixed gonadal dysgenesis  No estimate    MRKH Syndrome  1 in 4,500-5,000 births    Complete gonadal dysgenesis  one in 150,000 births    Hypospadias (urethral opening in perineum or along penile shaft)  one in 250 births [145]    Epispadias (urethral opening between corona and tip of glans penis)  one in 117,000 births [146]    Population figures can vary due to genetic causes. In the Dominican Republic , 5-alpha-reductase deficiency is not uncommon in the town of Las Salinas resulting in social acceptance of the intersex trait. [147] Men with the trait are called "guevedoces" (Spanish for "eggs at twelve"). 12 out of 13 families had one or more male family members that carried the gene. The overall incidence for the town was 1 in every 90 males were carriers, with other males either non-carriers or non-affected carriers. [148]  Medical classifications [ edit ]  Signs [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia may appear as a large clitoris or as a small penis.     The Quigley scale is a method for describing genital development in AIS.    Because there is variation in all of the processes of the development of the sex organs , a child can be born with a sexual anatomy that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average clitoris ( clitoral hypertrophy ) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average penis that is open along the underside. The appearance may be quite ambiguous, describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia, or as male genitals with a very small penis, completely open along the midline (" hypospadic "), and empty scrotum. Fertility is variable.  Measurement systems [ edit ]  The Orchidometer is a medical instrument to measure the volume of the testicles. It was developed by Swiss pediatric endocrinologist Andrea Prader . The Prader scale [149] and Quigley scale are visual rating systems that measure genital appearance.  Other signs [ edit ]  In order to help in classification, methods other than a genitalia inspection can be performed. For instance, a karyotype display of a tissue sample may determine which of the causes of intersex is prevalent in the case.  Causes [ edit ]  Main article: Sexual differentiation  The common pathway of sexual differentiation , where a productive human female has an XX chromosome pair, and a productive male has an XY pair, is relevant to the development of intersex conditions.  During fertilization, the sperm adds either an X (female) or a Y (male) chromosome to the X in the ovum. This determines the genetic sex of the embryo. [150] During the first weeks of development, genetic male and female fetuses are "anatomically indistinguishable", with primitive gonads beginning to develop during approximately the sixth week of gestation. The gonads, in a "bipotential state", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events. [150] Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.  At around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In normal female differentiation, the Müllerian duct system develops into the uterus , Fallopian tubes , and inner third of the vagina. In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone MIH causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the Wolffian duct system , which develops into the vas deferens , seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts. [150] By birth, the typical fetus has been completely "sexed" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.  Conditions [ edit ]  Further information: disorders of sex development  There are a variety of opinions on what conditions or traits are and are not intersex, dependent on the definition of intersex that is used. Current human rights based definitions stress a broad diversity of sex characteristics that differ from expectations for male or female bodies. [2] During 2015, the Council of Europe , [51] the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights [133] and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights [134] have called for a review of medical classifications on the basis that they presently impede enjoyment of the right to health ; the Council of Europe expressed concern that "the gap between the expectations of human rights organisations of intersex people and the development of medical classifications has possibly widened over the past decade". [51] [133] [134]    List of conditions    Sex chromosomes  Name  Description    XX  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  The most common cause of sexual ambiguity is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands produce abnormally high levels of virilizing hormones in utero. The genes that cause CAH can now be detected in the developing embryo. As Fausto-Sterling mentioned in chapter 3 of Sexing the Body , "a woman who suspects she may be pregnant with a CAH baby (if she or someone in her family carries CAH) can undergo treatment and then get tested." To prevent an XX-CAH child's genitalia from becoming masculinized, a treatment, which includes the use of the steroid dexamethasone, must begin as early as four weeks after formation. Many do not favor this process because "the safety of this experimental therapy has not been established in rigorously controlled trials", it does allow physicians to detect abnormalities, therefore starting treatment right after birth. Starting treatment as soon as an XX-CAH baby is born not only minimizes, but also may even eliminate the chances of genital surgery from being performed. [137] However, the necessity of such surgery itself is disputed. Meta-analysis of the studies supporting the use of dexamethasone on CAH at-risk fetuses found "less than one half of one percent of published 'studies' of this intervention were regarded as being of high enough quality to provide meaningful data for a meta-analysis. Even these four studies were of low quality" ... "in ways so slipshod as to breach professional standards of medical ethics" [151] and "there were no data on long-term follow-up of physical and metabolic outcomes in children exposed to dexamethasone". [152]  In XX-females, this can range from partial masculinization that produces a large clitoris, to virilization and male appearance. The latter applies in particular to congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency , which is the most common form of CAH.  Individuals born with XX chromosomes affected by 17α-hydroxylase deficiency are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.  See below for XY CAH 17α-hydroxylase deficiency.     XX  Progestin-induced virilisation  In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by the use of progestin , a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals normally have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males. [153]    XX  Freemartinism  This condition occurs commonly in all species of cattle and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the placentae of fraternal twins usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a freemartin is very like a normal female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a castrated male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs – in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop normally as in other mammals.    XY  Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)  People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees. Cases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a vagina and no uterus , cervix , or ovaries , and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.  In mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as clitoromegaly , or a small penis, which is called micropenis or microphallus; hypospadias and cryptorchidism may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.     XY  5-alpha-reductase deficiency (5-ARD)  The condition affects individuals with a Y chromosome , making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS. [154] Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth. Such individuals are usually raised as girls. The lack of DHT also limits the development of facial hair.    XY  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  In individuals with a Y chromosome (typically XY) who have Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency , CAH inhibits virilization, unlike cases without a Y chromosome.    XY  Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS)  The child has XY chromosomes typical of a male. The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce Müllerian inhibiting factor during fetal development.    XY  Anorchia  Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce gametes necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to gender dysphoria , as anorchic individuals are typically assigned male at birth .    XY  Gonadal dysgenesis  It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whose gonads don't develop properly. Clinical features are heterogeneous. [137]    XY  Hypospadias  It is caused by various causes, including alterations in testosterone metabolism. The urethra does not run to the tip of the penis. In mild forms, the opening is just shy of the tip; in moderate forms, it is along the shaft; and in severe forms, it may open at the base of the penis. [155]    Other  Unusual chromosomal sex  In addition to the most common XX and XY chromosomal sexes, there are several other possible combinations, for example Turner syndrome ( XO ), Triple X syndrome (XXX), Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) and variants ( XXYY , XXXY , XXXXY ), XYY syndrome , de la Chapelle syndrome ( XX male ), Swyer syndrome (XY female).    Other  Mosaicism and chimerism  A mix can occur, where some of the cells of the body have the common XX or XY, while some have one of the less usual chromosomal contents above. Such a mixture is caused by either mosaicism or chimerism . In mosaicism, the mixture is caused by a mutation in one of the cells of the embryo after fertilization, whereas chimerism is a fusion of two embryos. In alternative fashion, it is simply a mixture between XX and XY, and does not have to involve any less-common genotypes in individual cells. This, too, can occur both as chimerism and as a result of one sex chromosome having mutated into the other. [156]  Mosaicism and chimerism may involve chromosomes other than the sex chromosomes, and not result in intersex traits.     Other  True hermaphroditism and ovotestis  A " true hermaphrodite " is defined as someone with both testicular and ovarian tissue. Though naturally occurring true hermaphroditism in humans is unknown, there is, on the other hand, a spectrum of forms of ovotestes . The varieties include having two ovotestes or one ovary and one ovotestis, often in the form of streak gonads . Phenotype is not determinable from the ovotestes; in some cases, the appearance is "fairly typically female"; in others, it is "fairly typically male", and it may also be "fairly in-between in terms of genital development." [157] Intersex activist Cheryl Chase is an example of someone with ovotestes. [158]    Medical interventions [ edit ]     Hong Kong intersex activist Small Luk    Main article: Intersex medical interventions  Further information: History of intersex surgery  Rationales [ edit ]  Medical interventions take place to address physical health concerns, and psychosocial risks. Both types of rationale are the subject of debate, particularly as the consequences of surgical (and many hormonal) interventions are lifelong and irreversible. Questions regarding physical health include accurately assessing risk levels, necessity and timing. Psychosocial rationales are particularly susceptible to questions of necessity as they reflect social and cultural concerns.  There remains no clinical consensus about an evidence base, surgical timing, necessity, type of surgical intervention, and degree of difference warranting intervention. [159] [160] [161] Such surgeries are the subject of significant contention due to consequences that include trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] This includes community activism, [40] and multiple reports by international human rights [19] [51] [23] [162] and health [72] institutions and national ethics bodies. [22] [163]  In the cases where gonads may pose a cancer risk, as in some cases of androgen insensitivity syndrome , [164] concern has been expressed that treatment rationales and decision-making regarding cancer risk may encapsulate decisions around a desire for surgical normalization. [21]  Types [ edit ]   Feminizing and masculinizing surgeries : Surgical procedures depend on diagnosis, and there is often concern as to whether surgery should be performed at all. Typically, surgery is performed shortly after birth. Defenders of the practice argue that it is necessary for individuals to be clearly identified as male or female in order for them to function socially and develop normally. Psychosocial reasons are often stated. [12] This is criticised by many human rights institutions, and authors. Unlike other aesthetic surgical procedures performed on infants, such as corrective surgery for a cleft lip , genital surgery may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life, or feelings of freakishness and unacceptability. [165]  Hormone treatment : There is widespread evidence of prenatal testing and hormone treatment to prevent or eliminate intersex traits, [166] [167] associated also with the problematization of sexual orientation and gender non-conformity. [166] [168]  Psychosocial support : All stakeholders support psychosocial support. A joint international statement by participants at the Third International Intersex Forum in 2013 sought, amongst other demands: "Recognition that medicalization and stigmatisation of intersex people result in significant trauma and mental health concerns. In view of ensuring the bodily integrity and well-being of intersex people, autonomous non-pathologising psycho-social and peer support be available to intersex people throughout their life (as self-required), as well as to parents and/or care providers."  Genetic selection and terminations : The ethics of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to select against intersex traits was the subject of 11 papers in the October 2013 issue of the American Journal of Bioethics . [169] There is widespread evidence of pregnancy terminations arising from prenatal testing, as well as prenatal hormone treatment to prevent intersex traits. Behrmann and Ravitsky find social concepts of sex, gender and sexual orientation to be "intertwined on many levels. Parental choice against intersex may thus conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  Gender dysphoria : The DSM-5 included a change from using gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria. This revised code now specifically includes intersex people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth and experience clinically significant distress or impairment, using the language of disorders of sex development . [170] This move was criticised by intersex advocacy groups in Australia and New Zealand . [171]  Medical photography and display : Photographs of intersex children's genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes. Problems associated with medical photography of intersex children have been discussed due to experiences of humiliation and powerlessness by child subjects, [172] along with their ethics, control and usage.

[1] [2] Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female . [3] [4]  Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites , "congenital eunuchs", [5] [6] or congenitally "frigid". [7] Such terms have fallen out of favor; in particular, the term "hermaphrodite" is considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious. [8] Medical description of intersex traits as disorders of sex development has been controversial [9] [10] [11] since the label was introduced in 2006. [12]  Intersex people may face stigmatization and discrimination from birth or discovery of an intersex trait. This may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. [13] [14] [15] Globally, some intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, are surgically or hormonally altered to create more socially acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of good outcomes. [16] Such treatments may involve sterilization . Adults, including elite female athletes, have also been subjects of such treatment. [17] [18] Increasingly these issues are considered human rights abuses, with statements from international [19] [20] and national human rights and ethics institutions. [21] [22] Intersex organizations have also issued statements about human rights violations, including the Malta declaration of the third International Intersex Forum . [23]  In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] [26]  Some intersex persons may be assigned and raised as a girl or boy but then identify with another gender later in life, while most continue to identify with their assigned sex.

Odiele disclosed that she has the intersex trait androgen insensitivity syndrome in 2017    According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights :   Intersex people are born with sex characteristics (including genitals, gonads and chromosome patterns) that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies.  Intersex is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of natural bodily variations. In some cases, intersex traits are visible at birth while in others, they are not apparent until puberty. Some chromosomal intersex variations may not be physically apparent at all. [2]   In biological terms, sex may be determined by a number of factors present at birth, including: [30]   the number and type of sex chromosomes ;  the type of gonads —ovaries or testicles;  the sex hormones ;  the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the uterus in females); and  the external genitalia.   People whose characteristics are not either all typically male or all typically female at birth are intersex. [31]  Some intersex traits are not always visible at birth; some babies may be born with ambiguous genitals, while others may have ambiguous internal organs (testes and ovaries). Others will not become aware that they are intersex unless they receive genetic testing, because it does not manifest in their phenotype.  History [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex in history , Timeline of intersex history , and History of intersex surgery      Hermaphroditus in a wall painting from Herculaneum (first half of the 1st century AD)    Whether or not they were socially tolerated or accepted by any particular culture, the existence of intersex people was known to many ancient and pre-modern cultures. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote of "hermaphroditus" in the first century BCE that Hermaphroditus "is born with a physical body which is a combination of that of a man and that of a woman", and with supernatural properties. [32]      Edward Coke , The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England (1st ed, 1628, title page)    In European societies, Roman law , post-classical canon law , and later common law , referred to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. [33] The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani states that "Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails". [34] [35] [36] The foundation of common law, the 17th Century Institutes of the Lawes of England described how a hermaphrodite could inherit "either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile." [37] [38] Legal cases have been described in canon law and elsewhere over the centuries.  In some non-European societies, sex or gender systems with more than two categories may have allowed for other forms of inclusion of both intersex and transgender people. Such societies have been characterized as "primitive", while Morgan Holmes states that subsequent analysis has been simplistic or romanticized, failing to take account of the ways that subjects of all categories are treated. [39]  During the Victorian era , medical authors introduced the terms " true hermaphrodite " for an individual who has both ovarian and testicular tissue, "male pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with testicular tissue, but either female or ambiguous sexual anatomy, and "female pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with ovarian tissue, but either male or ambiguous sexual anatomy. Some later shifts in terminology have reflected advances in genetics, while other shifts are suggested to be due to pejorative associations. [40]  The term intersexuality was coined by Richard Goldschmidt in 1917. [41] The first suggestion to replace the term 'hermaphrodite' with 'intersex' was made by Cawadias in the 1940s. [42]  Since the rise of modern medical science, some intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals. Surgeons pinpointed intersex babies as a "social emergency" when born. [43] An 'optimal gender policy', initially developed by John Money , stated that early intervention helped avoid gender identity confusion, but this lacks evidence, [44] and early interventions have adverse consequences for psychological and physical health. [22] Since advances in surgery have made it possible for intersex conditions to be concealed, many people are not aware of how frequently intersex conditions arise in human beings or that they occur at all. [45]  Dialog between what were once antagonistic groups of activists and clinicians has led to only slight changes in medical policies and how intersex patients and their families are treated in some locations. [46] In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] Many civil society organizations and human rights institutions now call for an end to unnecessary "normalizing" interventions, including in the Malta declaration . [47] [1]  Human rights and legal issues [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex rights by country  Human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on harmful practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions including, in 2015, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the World Health Organization . These developments have been accompanied by International Intersex Forums and increased cooperation amongst civil society organizations. However, the implementation, codification and enforcement of intersex human rights in national legal systems remains slow.  Areas of concern include: non-consensual medical interventions; stigma, discrimination and equal treatment; access to reparations and justice; access to information and support, and legal recognition.  Physical integrity and bodily autonomy [ edit ]       Legal prohibition of non-consensual medical interventions   Regulatory suspension of non-consensual medical interventions     Main articles: Intersex human rights and Intersex medical interventions  Stigmatization and discrimination from birth may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in east Africa may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a curse. [13] [14] Abandonments and infanticides have been reported in Uganda , [13]  Kenya , [48]  south Asia , [49] and China . [15]  Infants, children and adolescents also experience "normalising" interventions on intersex persons that are medically unnecessary and the unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics. Medical interventions to modify the sex characteristics of intersex people, without the consent of the intersex person have taken place in all countries where the human rights of intersex people have been studied. [50] These interventions have frequently been performed with the consent of the intersex person's parents, when the person is legally too young to consent. Such interventions have been criticized by the World Health Organization, other UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and an increasing number of regional and national institutions due to their adverse consequences, including trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw surgical intervention without consent. [25] [26] In the same year, the Council of Europe became the first institution to state that intersex people have the right not to undergo sex affirmation interventions. [25] [26] [51] [52] [53]  Anti-discrimination and equal treatment [ edit ]       Explicit protection on grounds of sex characteristics   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex status   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex within attribute of sex     Main article: Discrimination against intersex people  Inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law . Because people born with intersex bodies are seen as different, intersex infants, children, adolescents and adults "are often stigmatized and subjected to multiple human rights violations", including discrimination in education, healthcare, employment, sport, and public services. [2] [1] [54] Several countries have so far explicitly protected intersex people from discrimination, with landmarks including South Africa , [26] [55]  Australia , [56] [57] and, most comprehensively, Malta. [58] [59] [60] [61] [62]  Reparations and justice [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Facilitating access to justice and reparations . Access to reparation appears limited, with a scarcity of legal cases, such as the 2011 case of Christiane Völling in Germany . [24] [63] A second case was adjudicated in Chile in 2012, involving a child and his parents. [64] [65] A further successful case in Germany, taken by Michaela Raab, was reported in 2015. [66] In the United States , the "M.C." legal case, advanced by Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth with the Southern Poverty Law Centre is still before the courts. [67] [68]  Information and support [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Access to information , medical records, peer and other counselling and support. With the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, a secrecy-based model was also adopted, in the belief that this was necessary to ensure "normal" physical and psychosocial development. [21] [22] [69] [70] [71] [72]  Legal recognition [ edit ]  Main article: Legal recognition of intersex people  The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions states that legal recognition is firstly "about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women." [23] In some regions, obtaining any form of birth certification may be an issue. A Kenyan court case in 2014 established the right of an intersex boy, "Baby A", to a birth certificate. [73]  Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a certain sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not. [3] [4] [28] [29] Recognition of third sex or gender classifications occurs in several countries, [74] [75] [76] [77] however, it is controversial when it becomes assumed or coercive, as is the case with some German infants . [78] [79] [80] Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third 'X' sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an "X" or "other" option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure. [27] [81]  Language [ edit ]     U.S. intersex activist Pidgeon Pagonis    Research in the late 20th century led to a growing medical consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal, but relatively rare, forms of human biology. [4] [82] [83] [84] Clinician and researcher Milton Diamond stresses the importance of care in the selection of language related to intersex people:   Foremost, we advocate use of the terms "typical", "usual", or "most frequent" where it is more common to use the term "normal." When possible avoid expressions like maldeveloped or undeveloped, errors of development, defective genitals, abnormal, or mistakes of nature. Emphasize that all of these conditions are biologically understandable while they are statistically uncommon. [85]   The term 'intersex' [ edit ]  Some people with intersex traits self-identify as intersex, and some do not. [86] [87] Australian sociological research published in 2016, found that 60% of respondents used the term "intersex" to self-describe their sex characteristics, including people identifying themselves as intersex, describing themselves as having an intersex variation or, in smaller numbers, having an intersex condition. A majority of 75% of survey respondents also self-described as male or female. [27] Respondents also commonly used diagnostic labels and referred to their sex chromosomes, with word choices depending on audience. [27] [81] Research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that 80% of affected Support Group respondents "strongly liked, liked or felt neutral about intersex" as a term, while caregivers were less supportive. [88] The hospital reported that "disorders of sex development" may negatively affect care. [89]  Some intersex organizations reference "intersex people" and "intersex variations or traits" [90] while others use more medicalized language such as "people with intersex conditions", [91] or people "with intersex conditions or DSDs (differences of sex development)" and "children born with variations of sex anatomy". [92] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth published a statement recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  Hermaphrodite [ edit ]  Main article: Hermaphrodite  A hermaphrodite is an organism that has both male and female reproductive organs. Until the mid-20th century, "hermaphrodite" was used synonymously with "intersex". [42] The distinctions "male pseudohermaphrodite", "female pseudohermaphrodite" and especially " true hermaphrodite " [94] are vestiges of outdated 19th-century thinking, reflecting histology (microscopic appearance) of the gonads . [95] [96] [97] Medical terminology has shifted not only due to concerns about language, but also a shift to understandings based on genetics .  Currently, hermaphroditism is not to be confused with intersex, as the former refers only to a specific phenotypical presentation of sex organs and the latter to more complex combination of phenotypical and genotypical presentation. Using "hermaphrodite" to refer to intersex individuals is considered to be stigmatizing and misleading. [98]  Hermaphrodite is used for animal and vegetal species in which the possession of both ovaries and testes is either serial or concurrent, and for living organisms without such gonads but present binary form of reproduction, which is part of the typical life history of those species; intersex has come to be used when this is not the case.  Disorders of sex development [ edit ]  Main article: Disorders of sex development  " Disorders of sex development " (DSD) is a contested term, [9] [10] defined to include congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. Members of the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric  Endocrine Society and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology adopted this term in their "Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders". [12] [44] While it adopted the term, to open "many more doors", the now defunct Intersex Society of North America itself remarked that intersex is not a disorder. [99] Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested the adoption of the terminology and its implied status as a "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who do not feel that there is something wrong with them, regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy. [100]  Sociological research in Australia, published in 2016, found that 3% of respondents used the term "disorders of sex development" or "DSD" to define their sex characteristics, while 21% use the term when accessing medical services. In contrast, 60% used the term "intersex" in some form to self-describe their sex characteristics. [81] U.S. research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that "disorders of sex development" terminology may negatively affect care, give offence, and result in lower attendance at medical clinics. [89] [88]  Alternatives to categorizing intersex conditions as "disorders" have been suggested, including "variations of sex development". [11]  Organisation Intersex International (OII) questions a disease/disability approach, argues for deferral of intervention unless medically necessary, when fully informed consent of the individual involved is possible, and self-determination of sex/gender orientation and identity. [101] The UK Intersex Association is also highly critical of the label 'disorders' and points to the fact that there was minimal involvement of intersex representatives in the debate which led to the change in terminology. [102] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth also published a statement opposing pathologizing language to describe people born with intersex traits, recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  LGBT and LGBTI [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex and LGBT  Intersex can be contrasted with homosexuality or same-sex attraction . Numerous studies have shown higher rates of same sex attraction in intersex people, [103] [104] with a recent Australian study of people born with atypical sex characteristics finding that 52% of respondents were non-heterosexual, [27] [81] thus research on intersex subjects has been used to explore means of preventing homosexuality. [103] [104] However, current studies do not support a statistical correlation between genetic intersex traits and transsexual persons. [105] [106]  Intersex can therefore be contrasted with transgender , [107] which describes the condition in which one's gender identity does not match one's assigned sex. [107] [108] [109] Some people are both intersex and transgender. [110] A 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced gender dysphoria . [28] In an analysis of the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to eliminate intersex traits, Behrmann and Ravitsky state: "Parental choice against intersex may ... conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  The relationship of intersex to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans, and queer communities is complex, [112] but intersex people are often added to LGBT to create an LGBTI community. Emi Koyama describes how inclusion of intersex in LGBTI can fail to address intersex-specific human rights issues, including creating false impressions "that intersex people's rights are protected" by laws protecting LGBT people, and failing to acknowledge that many intersex people are not LGBT. [113]  Organisation Intersex International Australia states that some intersex individuals are same sex attracted, and some are heterosexual, but "LGBTI activism has fought for the rights of people who fall outside of expected binary sex and gender norms." [114] [115]  Julius Kaggwa of SIPD Uganda has written that, while the gay community "offers us a place of relative safety, it is also oblivious to our specific needs". [116]  Mauro Cabral has written that transgender people and organizations "need to stop approaching intersex issues as if they were trans issues" including use of intersex as a means of explaining being transgender; "we can collaborate a lot with the intersex movement by making it clear how wrong that approach is". [117]  Intersex in society [ edit ]     Kristi Bruce after shooting the documentary XXXY , 2000    Fiction and media [ edit ]  Main articles: Literature about intersex and Intersex characters in fiction  An intersex character is the narrator in Jeffrey Eugenides ' Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Middlesex .  Television works about intersex and films about intersex are scarce. The Spanish-language film XXY won the Critics' Week grand prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and the ACID/CCAS Support Award. [118]  Faking It is notable for providing the first intersex main character in a television show, [119] and television's first intersex character played by an intersex actor. [120]  Civil society institutions [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex civil society organizations  Intersex peer support and advocacy organizations have existed since at least 1985, with the establishment of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia in 1985. [121] The Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (UK) established in 1988. [122] The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) may have been one of the first intersex civil society organizations to have been open to people regardless of diagnosis; it was active from 1993 to 2008. [123]  Events [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex Awareness Day and Intersex Day of Remembrance  Intersex Awareness Day is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight the challenges faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 26 October. It marks the first public demonstration by intersex people, which took place in Boston on October 26, 1996, outside a venue where the American Academy of Pediatrics was holding its annual conference. [124]  Intersex Day of Remembrance , also known as Intersex Solidarity Day, is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight issues faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 8 November. It marks the birthday of Herculine Barbin , a French intersex person whose memoirs were later published by Michel Foucault in Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite .  Flag [ edit ]     Intersex Pride flag    Main article: Intersex flag  The intersex flag was created by Organisation Intersex International Australia in July 2013 to create a flag "that is not derivative, but is yet firmly grounded in meaning". The organization aimed to create a symbol without gendered pink and blue colors. It describes yellow and purple as " hermaphrodite " colors. The organization describes it as freely available "for use by any intersex person or organization who wishes to use it, in a human rights affirming community context". [125]  Religion [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex people and religion  In Hinduism , Sangam literature uses the word pedi to refer to people born with an intersex condition; it also refers to antharlinga hijras and various other hijras . [126] Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded but provokes parental fear. [49]  In Islam , scholars of Islamic jurisprudence have detailed discussions on the status and rights of intersex based on what mainly exhibits in their external sexual organs. Yet, modern Islamic jurisprudence scholars turn to medical screening to determine the dominance of their sex. The intersex rights includes rights of inheritance, rights to marriage, rights to live like any other male or female. The rights are generally based on whether they are true hermaphrodites, or pseudo hermaphrodite. Scholars of Islamic jurisprudence generally consider their rights based on the majority of what appears from their external sexual organs. [ citation needed ]  In Judaism , the Talmud contains extensive discussion concerning the status of two intersex types in Jewish law; namely the androginus , which exhibits both male and female external sexual organs, and the tumtum which exhibits neither. In the 1970s and 1980s, the treatment of intersex babies started to be discussed in Orthodox Jewish medical halacha by prominent rabbinic leaders, for example Eliezer Waldenberg and Moshe Feinstein . [127]  Sport [ edit ]      Stanisława Walasiewicz (Stella Walsh) in 1933    Main article: Sex verification in sports  Multiple athletes have been humiliated, excluded from competition or been forced to return medals following discovery of an intersex trait. Examples include Erik Schinegger , Foekje Dillema , Maria José Martínez-Patiño and Santhi Soundarajan . In contrast, Stanisława Walasiewicz (also known as Stella Walsh) was the subject of posthumous controversy. [128]  The South African middle-distance runner Caster Semenya won gold at the World Championships in the women's 800 meter and won silver in the 2012 Summer Olympics. When Semenya won gold in the World Championships, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) requested sex verification tests. The results were not released, but Semenya was cleared to race with other women. [129]  Katrina Karkazis , Rebecca Jordan-Young , Georgiann Davis and Silvia Camporesi argued that new IAAF policies on "hyperandrogenism" in female athletes (applied for example to the case of Dutee Chand ), established in response to the Semenya case, are "significantly flawed", arguing that the policy will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify "gender policing". They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender. [130]  In April 2014, the BMJ reported that four elite women athletes with 5-ARD were subjected to sterilization and "partial clitoridectomies" in order to compete in sport. The authors noted that "partial clitoridectomy" was "not medically indicated, does not relate to real or perceived athletic "advantage". [17] Intersex advocates regard this intervention as "a clearly coercive process". [131] In 2016, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on health, Dainius Pūras, criticized "current and historic" sex verification policies, describing how "a number of athletes have undergone gonadectomy (removal of reproductive organs) and partial clitoridectomy (a form of female genital mutilation ) in the absence of symptoms or health issues warranting those procedures." [132]  Population figures [ edit ]  There are few firm estimates of the number of intersex people. While human rights institutions have called for the demedicalisation of intersex traits, as far as possible, [21] [51] [133] [134] medical definitions are often still used. The now-defunct Intersex Society of North America stated that:   If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won't show up until later in life. [135]   According to Blackless, Fausto-Sterling et al., 1.7 percent of human births are intersex, including variations that may not become apparent until, for example, puberty, or until attempting to conceive. [136] [137] Some clinicians do not favor such definitions. According to Leonard Sax, intersex should be "restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female", around 0.018%. This definition excludes Klinefelter syndrome and many other variations. [138] He in turn criticizes Fausto-Sterling for counting Late-Onset Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia for 88% of her figure. His rebuttal concludes,   "The most original feature of Fausto-Sterling's book is her reluctance to classify true intersex conditions as pathological (Fausto-Sterling, 2000, p. 113) ... She often uses the word natural synonymously with normal. However, natural and normal are not synonyms. A cow may give birth to a two-headed or Siamese calf by natural processes, natural being understood as per Fausto-Sterling's definition as "produced by nature." Nevertheless, that two-headed calf unarguably manifests an abnormal condition. Fausto-Sterling's insistence that all combinations of sexual anatomy be regarded as normal... follows that classifications of normal and abnormal sexual anatomy are mere social conventions, prejudices which can and should be set aside by an enlightened intelligentsia. This type of extreme social constructionism is confusing and is not helpful to clinicians, to their patients, or to their patients' families. Diluting the term intersex to include "any deviation from the Platonic ideal of sexual dimorphism" (Blackless et al., 2000, p. 152), as Fausto-Sterling suggests, deprives the term of any clinically useful meaning." [139]   However, many conditions excluded from Sax's analysis are currently regarded as disorders of sex development . Individuals with those diagnoses may experience stigma and discrimination due to their sex characteristics, including sex "normalizing" interventions, and so those diagnoses and life experiences meet definitions of intersex in use by UN and other bodies. As a result, the statistical analyses by Blackless and Fausto-Sterling, despite her outdated and perceived offensive use of the term hermaphrodite, [140] have become widely quoted, [51] [141] including by other clinicians. [142] The following summarizes those frequency statistics:    Sex Variation  Frequency    Not XX, XY, Klinefelter, or Turner  one in 1,666 births    Klinefelter syndrome (XXY)  one in 1,000 births    Turner syndrome (45,X)  one in 2,710 births [143]    Androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 13,000 births    Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 130,000 births    Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia  one in 13,000 births    Late onset adrenal hyperplasia  one in 10,000 births. [144]    Vaginal agenesis  one in 6,000 births    Ovotestes  one in 83,000 births    Idiopathic (no discernable medical cause)  one in 110,000 births    Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment, e.g. progestin administered to pregnant mother)  No estimate    5-alpha-reductase deficiency  No estimate    Mixed gonadal dysgenesis  No estimate    MRKH Syndrome  1 in 4,500-5,000 births    Complete gonadal dysgenesis  one in 150,000 births    Hypospadias (urethral opening in perineum or along penile shaft)  one in 250 births [145]    Epispadias (urethral opening between corona and tip of glans penis)  one in 117,000 births [146]    Population figures can vary due to genetic causes. In the Dominican Republic , 5-alpha-reductase deficiency is not uncommon in the town of Las Salinas resulting in social acceptance of the intersex trait. [147] Men with the trait are called "guevedoces" (Spanish for "eggs at twelve"). 12 out of 13 families had one or more male family members that carried the gene. The overall incidence for the town was 1 in every 90 males were carriers, with other males either non-carriers or non-affected carriers. [148]  Medical classifications [ edit ]  Signs [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia may appear as a large clitoris or as a small penis.     The Quigley scale is a method for describing genital development in AIS.    Because there is variation in all of the processes of the development of the sex organs , a child can be born with a sexual anatomy that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average clitoris ( clitoral hypertrophy ) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average penis that is open along the underside. The appearance may be quite ambiguous, describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia, or as male genitals with a very small penis, completely open along the midline (" hypospadic "), and empty scrotum. Fertility is variable.  Measurement systems [ edit ]  The Orchidometer is a medical instrument to measure the volume of the testicles. It was developed by Swiss pediatric endocrinologist Andrea Prader . The Prader scale [149] and Quigley scale are visual rating systems that measure genital appearance.  Other signs [ edit ]  In order to help in classification, methods other than a genitalia inspection can be performed. For instance, a karyotype display of a tissue sample may determine which of the causes of intersex is prevalent in the case.  Causes [ edit ]  Main article: Sexual differentiation  The common pathway of sexual differentiation , where a productive human female has an XX chromosome pair, and a productive male has an XY pair, is relevant to the development of intersex conditions.  During fertilization, the sperm adds either an X (female) or a Y (male) chromosome to the X in the ovum. This determines the genetic sex of the embryo. [150] During the first weeks of development, genetic male and female fetuses are "anatomically indistinguishable", with primitive gonads beginning to develop during approximately the sixth week of gestation. The gonads, in a "bipotential state", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events. [150] Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.  At around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In normal female differentiation, the Müllerian duct system develops into the uterus , Fallopian tubes , and inner third of the vagina. In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone MIH causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the Wolffian duct system , which develops into the vas deferens , seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts. [150] By birth, the typical fetus has been completely "sexed" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.  Conditions [ edit ]  Further information: disorders of sex development  There are a variety of opinions on what conditions or traits are and are not intersex, dependent on the definition of intersex that is used. Current human rights based definitions stress a broad diversity of sex characteristics that differ from expectations for male or female bodies. [2] During 2015, the Council of Europe , [51] the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights [133] and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights [134] have called for a review of medical classifications on the basis that they presently impede enjoyment of the right to health ; the Council of Europe expressed concern that "the gap between the expectations of human rights organisations of intersex people and the development of medical classifications has possibly widened over the past decade". [51] [133] [134]    List of conditions    Sex chromosomes  Name  Description    XX  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  The most common cause of sexual ambiguity is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands produce abnormally high levels of virilizing hormones in utero. The genes that cause CAH can now be detected in the developing embryo. As Fausto-Sterling mentioned in chapter 3 of Sexing the Body , "a woman who suspects she may be pregnant with a CAH baby (if she or someone in her family carries CAH) can undergo treatment and then get tested." To prevent an XX-CAH child's genitalia from becoming masculinized, a treatment, which includes the use of the steroid dexamethasone, must begin as early as four weeks after formation. Many do not favor this process because "the safety of this experimental therapy has not been established in rigorously controlled trials", it does allow physicians to detect abnormalities, therefore starting treatment right after birth. Starting treatment as soon as an XX-CAH baby is born not only minimizes, but also may even eliminate the chances of genital surgery from being performed. [137] However, the necessity of such surgery itself is disputed. Meta-analysis of the studies supporting the use of dexamethasone on CAH at-risk fetuses found "less than one half of one percent of published 'studies' of this intervention were regarded as being of high enough quality to provide meaningful data for a meta-analysis. Even these four studies were of low quality" ... "in ways so slipshod as to breach professional standards of medical ethics" [151] and "there were no data on long-term follow-up of physical and metabolic outcomes in children exposed to dexamethasone". [152]  In XX-females, this can range from partial masculinization that produces a large clitoris, to virilization and male appearance. The latter applies in particular to congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency , which is the most common form of CAH.  Individuals born with XX chromosomes affected by 17α-hydroxylase deficiency are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.  See below for XY CAH 17α-hydroxylase deficiency.     XX  Progestin-induced virilisation  In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by the use of progestin , a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals normally have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males. [153]    XX  Freemartinism  This condition occurs commonly in all species of cattle and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the placentae of fraternal twins usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a freemartin is very like a normal female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a castrated male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs – in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop normally as in other mammals.    XY  Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)  People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees. Cases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a vagina and no uterus , cervix , or ovaries , and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.  In mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as clitoromegaly , or a small penis, which is called micropenis or microphallus; hypospadias and cryptorchidism may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.     XY  5-alpha-reductase deficiency (5-ARD)  The condition affects individuals with a Y chromosome , making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS. [154] Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth. Such individuals are usually raised as girls. The lack of DHT also limits the development of facial hair.    XY  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  In individuals with a Y chromosome (typically XY) who have Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency , CAH inhibits virilization, unlike cases without a Y chromosome.    XY  Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS)  The child has XY chromosomes typical of a male. The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce Müllerian inhibiting factor during fetal development.    XY  Anorchia  Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce gametes necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to gender dysphoria , as anorchic individuals are typically assigned male at birth .    XY  Gonadal dysgenesis  It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whose gonads don't develop properly. Clinical features are heterogeneous. [137]    XY  Hypospadias  It is caused by various causes, including alterations in testosterone metabolism. The urethra does not run to the tip of the penis. In mild forms, the opening is just shy of the tip; in moderate forms, it is along the shaft; and in severe forms, it may open at the base of the penis. [155]    Other  Unusual chromosomal sex  In addition to the most common XX and XY chromosomal sexes, there are several other possible combinations, for example Turner syndrome ( XO ), Triple X syndrome (XXX), Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) and variants ( XXYY , XXXY , XXXXY ), XYY syndrome , de la Chapelle syndrome ( XX male ), Swyer syndrome (XY female).    Other  Mosaicism and chimerism  A mix can occur, where some of the cells of the body have the common XX or XY, while some have one of the less usual chromosomal contents above. Such a mixture is caused by either mosaicism or chimerism . In mosaicism, the mixture is caused by a mutation in one of the cells of the embryo after fertilization, whereas chimerism is a fusion of two embryos. In alternative fashion, it is simply a mixture between XX and XY, and does not have to involve any less-common genotypes in individual cells. This, too, can occur both as chimerism and as a result of one sex chromosome having mutated into the other. [156]  Mosaicism and chimerism may involve chromosomes other than the sex chromosomes, and not result in intersex traits.     Other  True hermaphroditism and ovotestis  A " true hermaphrodite " is defined as someone with both testicular and ovarian tissue. Though naturally occurring true hermaphroditism in humans is unknown, there is, on the other hand, a spectrum of forms of ovotestes . The varieties include having two ovotestes or one ovary and one ovotestis, often in the form of streak gonads . Phenotype is not determinable from the ovotestes; in some cases, the appearance is "fairly typically female"; in others, it is "fairly typically male", and it may also be "fairly in-between in terms of genital development." [157] Intersex activist Cheryl Chase is an example of someone with ovotestes. [158]    Medical interventions [ edit ]     Hong Kong intersex activist Small Luk    Main article: Intersex medical interventions  Further information: History of intersex surgery  Rationales [ edit ]  Medical interventions take place to address physical health concerns, and psychosocial risks. Both types of rationale are the subject of debate, particularly as the consequences of surgical (and many hormonal) interventions are lifelong and irreversible. Questions regarding physical health include accurately assessing risk levels, necessity and timing. Psychosocial rationales are particularly susceptible to questions of necessity as they reflect social and cultural concerns.  There remains no clinical consensus about an evidence base, surgical timing, necessity, type of surgical intervention, and degree of difference warranting intervention. [159] [160] [161] Such surgeries are the subject of significant contention due to consequences that include trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] This includes community activism, [40] and multiple reports by international human rights [19] [51] [23] [162] and health [72] institutions and national ethics bodies. [22] [163]  In the cases where gonads may pose a cancer risk, as in some cases of androgen insensitivity syndrome , [164] concern has been expressed that treatment rationales and decision-making regarding cancer risk may encapsulate decisions around a desire for surgical normalization. [21]  Types [ edit ]   Feminizing and masculinizing surgeries : Surgical procedures depend on diagnosis, and there is often concern as to whether surgery should be performed at all. Typically, surgery is performed shortly after birth. Defenders of the practice argue that it is necessary for individuals to be clearly identified as male or female in order for them to function socially and develop normally. Psychosocial reasons are often stated. [12] This is criticised by many human rights institutions, and authors. Unlike other aesthetic surgical procedures performed on infants, such as corrective surgery for a cleft lip , genital surgery may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life, or feelings of freakishness and unacceptability. [165]  Hormone treatment : There is widespread evidence of prenatal testing and hormone treatment to prevent or eliminate intersex traits, [166] [167] associated also with the problematization of sexual orientation and gender non-conformity. [166] [168]  Psychosocial support : All stakeholders support psychosocial support. A joint international statement by participants at the Third International Intersex Forum in 2013 sought, amongst other demands: "Recognition that medicalization and stigmatisation of intersex people result in significant trauma and mental health concerns. In view of ensuring the bodily integrity and well-being of intersex people, autonomous non-pathologising psycho-social and peer support be available to intersex people throughout their life (as self-required), as well as to parents and/or care providers."  Genetic selection and terminations : The ethics of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to select against intersex traits was the subject of 11 papers in the October 2013 issue of the American Journal of Bioethics . [169] There is widespread evidence of pregnancy terminations arising from prenatal testing, as well as prenatal hormone treatment to prevent intersex traits. Behrmann and Ravitsky find social concepts of sex, gender and sexual orientation to be "intertwined on many levels. Parental choice against intersex may thus conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  Gender dysphoria : The DSM-5 included a change from using gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria. This revised code now specifically includes intersex people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth and experience clinically significant distress or impairment, using the language of disorders of sex development . [170] This move was criticised by intersex advocacy groups in Australia and New Zealand . [171]  Medical photography and display : Photographs of intersex children's genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes. Problems associated with medical photography of intersex children have been discussed due to experiences of humiliation and powerlessness by child subjects, [172] along with their ethics, control and usage.

[1] [2] Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female . [3] [4]  Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites , "congenital eunuchs", [5] [6] or congenitally "frigid". [7] Such terms have fallen out of favor; in particular, the term "hermaphrodite" is considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious. [8] Medical description of intersex traits as disorders of sex development has been controversial [9] [10] [11] since the label was introduced in 2006. [12]  Intersex people may face stigmatization and discrimination from birth or discovery of an intersex trait. This may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. [13] [14] [15] Globally, some intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, are surgically or hormonally altered to create more socially acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of good outcomes. [16] Such treatments may involve sterilization . Adults, including elite female athletes, have also been subjects of such treatment. [17] [18] Increasingly these issues are considered human rights abuses, with statements from international [19] [20] and national human rights and ethics institutions. [21] [22] Intersex organizations have also issued statements about human rights violations, including the Malta declaration of the third International Intersex Forum . [23]  In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] [26]  Some intersex persons may be assigned and raised as a girl or boy but then identify with another gender later in life, while most continue to identify with their assigned sex.

Odiele disclosed that she has the intersex trait androgen insensitivity syndrome in 2017    According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights :   Intersex people are born with sex characteristics (including genitals, gonads and chromosome patterns) that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies.  Intersex is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of natural bodily variations. In some cases, intersex traits are visible at birth while in others, they are not apparent until puberty. Some chromosomal intersex variations may not be physically apparent at all. [2]   In biological terms, sex may be determined by a number of factors present at birth, including: [30]   the number and type of sex chromosomes ;  the type of gonads —ovaries or testicles;  the sex hormones ;  the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the uterus in females); and  the external genitalia.   People whose characteristics are not either all typically male or all typically female at birth are intersex. [31]  Some intersex traits are not always visible at birth; some babies may be born with ambiguous genitals, while others may have ambiguous internal organs (testes and ovaries). Others will not become aware that they are intersex unless they receive genetic testing, because it does not manifest in their phenotype.  History [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex in history , Timeline of intersex history , and History of intersex surgery      Hermaphroditus in a wall painting from Herculaneum (first half of the 1st century AD)    Whether or not they were socially tolerated or accepted by any particular culture, the existence of intersex people was known to many ancient and pre-modern cultures. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote of "hermaphroditus" in the first century BCE that Hermaphroditus "is born with a physical body which is a combination of that of a man and that of a woman", and with supernatural properties. [32]      Edward Coke , The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England (1st ed, 1628, title page)    In European societies, Roman law , post-classical canon law , and later common law , referred to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. [33] The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani states that "Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails". [34] [35] [36] The foundation of common law, the 17th Century Institutes of the Lawes of England described how a hermaphrodite could inherit "either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile." [37] [38] Legal cases have been described in canon law and elsewhere over the centuries.  In some non-European societies, sex or gender systems with more than two categories may have allowed for other forms of inclusion of both intersex and transgender people. Such societies have been characterized as "primitive", while Morgan Holmes states that subsequent analysis has been simplistic or romanticized, failing to take account of the ways that subjects of all categories are treated. [39]  During the Victorian era , medical authors introduced the terms " true hermaphrodite " for an individual who has both ovarian and testicular tissue, "male pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with testicular tissue, but either female or ambiguous sexual anatomy, and "female pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with ovarian tissue, but either male or ambiguous sexual anatomy. Some later shifts in terminology have reflected advances in genetics, while other shifts are suggested to be due to pejorative associations. [40]  The term intersexuality was coined by Richard Goldschmidt in 1917. [41] The first suggestion to replace the term 'hermaphrodite' with 'intersex' was made by Cawadias in the 1940s. [42]  Since the rise of modern medical science, some intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals. Surgeons pinpointed intersex babies as a "social emergency" when born. [43] An 'optimal gender policy', initially developed by John Money , stated that early intervention helped avoid gender identity confusion, but this lacks evidence, [44] and early interventions have adverse consequences for psychological and physical health. [22] Since advances in surgery have made it possible for intersex conditions to be concealed, many people are not aware of how frequently intersex conditions arise in human beings or that they occur at all. [45]  Dialog between what were once antagonistic groups of activists and clinicians has led to only slight changes in medical policies and how intersex patients and their families are treated in some locations. [46] In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] Many civil society organizations and human rights institutions now call for an end to unnecessary "normalizing" interventions, including in the Malta declaration . [47] [1]  Human rights and legal issues [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex rights by country  Human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on harmful practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions including, in 2015, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the World Health Organization . These developments have been accompanied by International Intersex Forums and increased cooperation amongst civil society organizations. However, the implementation, codification and enforcement of intersex human rights in national legal systems remains slow.  Areas of concern include: non-consensual medical interventions; stigma, discrimination and equal treatment; access to reparations and justice; access to information and support, and legal recognition.  Physical integrity and bodily autonomy [ edit ]       Legal prohibition of non-consensual medical interventions   Regulatory suspension of non-consensual medical interventions     Main articles: Intersex human rights and Intersex medical interventions  Stigmatization and discrimination from birth may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in east Africa may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a curse. [13] [14] Abandonments and infanticides have been reported in Uganda , [13]  Kenya , [48]  south Asia , [49] and China . [15]  Infants, children and adolescents also experience "normalising" interventions on intersex persons that are medically unnecessary and the unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics. Medical interventions to modify the sex characteristics of intersex people, without the consent of the intersex person have taken place in all countries where the human rights of intersex people have been studied. [50] These interventions have frequently been performed with the consent of the intersex person's parents, when the person is legally too young to consent. Such interventions have been criticized by the World Health Organization, other UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and an increasing number of regional and national institutions due to their adverse consequences, including trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw surgical intervention without consent. [25] [26] In the same year, the Council of Europe became the first institution to state that intersex people have the right not to undergo sex affirmation interventions. [25] [26] [51] [52] [53]  Anti-discrimination and equal treatment [ edit ]       Explicit protection on grounds of sex characteristics   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex status   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex within attribute of sex     Main article: Discrimination against intersex people  Inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law . Because people born with intersex bodies are seen as different, intersex infants, children, adolescents and adults "are often stigmatized and subjected to multiple human rights violations", including discrimination in education, healthcare, employment, sport, and public services. [2] [1] [54] Several countries have so far explicitly protected intersex people from discrimination, with landmarks including South Africa , [26] [55]  Australia , [56] [57] and, most comprehensively, Malta. [58] [59] [60] [61] [62]  Reparations and justice [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Facilitating access to justice and reparations . Access to reparation appears limited, with a scarcity of legal cases, such as the 2011 case of Christiane Völling in Germany . [24] [63] A second case was adjudicated in Chile in 2012, involving a child and his parents. [64] [65] A further successful case in Germany, taken by Michaela Raab, was reported in 2015. [66] In the United States , the "M.C." legal case, advanced by Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth with the Southern Poverty Law Centre is still before the courts. [67] [68]  Information and support [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Access to information , medical records, peer and other counselling and support. With the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, a secrecy-based model was also adopted, in the belief that this was necessary to ensure "normal" physical and psychosocial development. [21] [22] [69] [70] [71] [72]  Legal recognition [ edit ]  Main article: Legal recognition of intersex people  The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions states that legal recognition is firstly "about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women." [23] In some regions, obtaining any form of birth certification may be an issue. A Kenyan court case in 2014 established the right of an intersex boy, "Baby A", to a birth certificate. [73]  Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a certain sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not. [3] [4] [28] [29] Recognition of third sex or gender classifications occurs in several countries, [74] [75] [76] [77] however, it is controversial when it becomes assumed or coercive, as is the case with some German infants . [78] [79] [80] Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third 'X' sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an "X" or "other" option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure. [27] [81]  Language [ edit ]     U.S. intersex activist Pidgeon Pagonis    Research in the late 20th century led to a growing medical consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal, but relatively rare, forms of human biology. [4] [82] [83] [84] Clinician and researcher Milton Diamond stresses the importance of care in the selection of language related to intersex people:   Foremost, we advocate use of the terms "typical", "usual", or "most frequent" where it is more common to use the term "normal." When possible avoid expressions like maldeveloped or undeveloped, errors of development, defective genitals, abnormal, or mistakes of nature. Emphasize that all of these conditions are biologically understandable while they are statistically uncommon. [85]   The term 'intersex' [ edit ]  Some people with intersex traits self-identify as intersex, and some do not. [86] [87] Australian sociological research published in 2016, found that 60% of respondents used the term "intersex" to self-describe their sex characteristics, including people identifying themselves as intersex, describing themselves as having an intersex variation or, in smaller numbers, having an intersex condition. A majority of 75% of survey respondents also self-described as male or female. [27] Respondents also commonly used diagnostic labels and referred to their sex chromosomes, with word choices depending on audience. [27] [81] Research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that 80% of affected Support Group respondents "strongly liked, liked or felt neutral about intersex" as a term, while caregivers were less supportive. [88] The hospital reported that "disorders of sex development" may negatively affect care. [89]  Some intersex organizations reference "intersex people" and "intersex variations or traits" [90] while others use more medicalized language such as "people with intersex conditions", [91] or people "with intersex conditions or DSDs (differences of sex development)" and "children born with variations of sex anatomy". [92] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth published a statement recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  Hermaphrodite [ edit ]  Main article: Hermaphrodite  A hermaphrodite is an organism that has both male and female reproductive organs. Until the mid-20th century, "hermaphrodite" was used synonymously with "intersex". [42] The distinctions "male pseudohermaphrodite", "female pseudohermaphrodite" and especially " true hermaphrodite " [94] are vestiges of outdated 19th-century thinking, reflecting histology (microscopic appearance) of the gonads . [95] [96] [97] Medical terminology has shifted not only due to concerns about language, but also a shift to understandings based on genetics .  Currently, hermaphroditism is not to be confused with intersex, as the former refers only to a specific phenotypical presentation of sex organs and the latter to more complex combination of phenotypical and genotypical presentation. Using "hermaphrodite" to refer to intersex individuals is considered to be stigmatizing and misleading. [98]  Hermaphrodite is used for animal and vegetal species in which the possession of both ovaries and testes is either serial or concurrent, and for living organisms without such gonads but present binary form of reproduction, which is part of the typical life history of those species; intersex has come to be used when this is not the case.  Disorders of sex development [ edit ]  Main article: Disorders of sex development  " Disorders of sex development " (DSD) is a contested term, [9] [10] defined to include congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. Members of the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric  Endocrine Society and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology adopted this term in their "Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders". [12] [44] While it adopted the term, to open "many more doors", the now defunct Intersex Society of North America itself remarked that intersex is not a disorder. [99] Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested the adoption of the terminology and its implied status as a "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who do not feel that there is something wrong with them, regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy. [100]  Sociological research in Australia, published in 2016, found that 3% of respondents used the term "disorders of sex development" or "DSD" to define their sex characteristics, while 21% use the term when accessing medical services. In contrast, 60% used the term "intersex" in some form to self-describe their sex characteristics. [81] U.S. research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that "disorders of sex development" terminology may negatively affect care, give offence, and result in lower attendance at medical clinics. [89] [88]  Alternatives to categorizing intersex conditions as "disorders" have been suggested, including "variations of sex development". [11]  Organisation Intersex International (OII) questions a disease/disability approach, argues for deferral of intervention unless medically necessary, when fully informed consent of the individual involved is possible, and self-determination of sex/gender orientation and identity. [101] The UK Intersex Association is also highly critical of the label 'disorders' and points to the fact that there was minimal involvement of intersex representatives in the debate which led to the change in terminology. [102] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth also published a statement opposing pathologizing language to describe people born with intersex traits, recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  LGBT and LGBTI [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex and LGBT  Intersex can be contrasted with homosexuality or same-sex attraction . Numerous studies have shown higher rates of same sex attraction in intersex people, [103] [104] with a recent Australian study of people born with atypical sex characteristics finding that 52% of respondents were non-heterosexual, [27] [81] thus research on intersex subjects has been used to explore means of preventing homosexuality. [103] [104] However, current studies do not support a statistical correlation between genetic intersex traits and transsexual persons. [105] [106]  Intersex can therefore be contrasted with transgender , [107] which describes the condition in which one's gender identity does not match one's assigned sex. [107] [108] [109] Some people are both intersex and transgender. [110] A 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced gender dysphoria . [28] In an analysis of the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to eliminate intersex traits, Behrmann and Ravitsky state: "Parental choice against intersex may ... conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  The relationship of intersex to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans, and queer communities is complex, [112] but intersex people are often added to LGBT to create an LGBTI community. Emi Koyama describes how inclusion of intersex in LGBTI can fail to address intersex-specific human rights issues, including creating false impressions "that intersex people's rights are protected" by laws protecting LGBT people, and failing to acknowledge that many intersex people are not LGBT. [113]  Organisation Intersex International Australia states that some intersex individuals are same sex attracted, and some are heterosexual, but "LGBTI activism has fought for the rights of people who fall outside of expected binary sex and gender norms." [114] [115]  Julius Kaggwa of SIPD Uganda has written that, while the gay community "offers us a place of relative safety, it is also oblivious to our specific needs". [116]  Mauro Cabral has written that transgender people and organizations "need to stop approaching intersex issues as if they were trans issues" including use of intersex as a means of explaining being transgender; "we can collaborate a lot with the intersex movement by making it clear how wrong that approach is". [117]  Intersex in society [ edit ]     Kristi Bruce after shooting the documentary XXXY , 2000    Fiction and media [ edit ]  Main articles: Literature about intersex and Intersex characters in fiction  An intersex character is the narrator in Jeffrey Eugenides ' Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Middlesex .  Television works about intersex and films about intersex are scarce. The Spanish-language film XXY won the Critics' Week grand prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and the ACID/CCAS Support Award. [118]  Faking It is notable for providing the first intersex main character in a television show, [119] and television's first intersex character played by an intersex actor. [120]  Civil society institutions [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex civil society organizations  Intersex peer support and advocacy organizations have existed since at least 1985, with the establishment of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia in 1985. [121] The Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (UK) established in 1988. [122] The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) may have been one of the first intersex civil society organizations to have been open to people regardless of diagnosis; it was active from 1993 to 2008. [123]  Events [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex Awareness Day and Intersex Day of Remembrance  Intersex Awareness Day is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight the challenges faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 26 October. It marks the first public demonstration by intersex people, which took place in Boston on October 26, 1996, outside a venue where the American Academy of Pediatrics was holding its annual conference. [124]  Intersex Day of Remembrance , also known as Intersex Solidarity Day, is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight issues faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 8 November. It marks the birthday of Herculine Barbin , a French intersex person whose memoirs were later published by Michel Foucault in Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite .  Flag [ edit ]     Intersex Pride flag    Main article: Intersex flag  The intersex flag was created by Organisation Intersex International Australia in July 2013 to create a flag "that is not derivative, but is yet firmly grounded in meaning". The organization aimed to create a symbol without gendered pink and blue colors. It describes yellow and purple as " hermaphrodite " colors. The organization describes it as freely available "for use by any intersex person or organization who wishes to use it, in a human rights affirming community context". [125]  Religion [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex people and religion  In Hinduism , Sangam literature uses the word pedi to refer to people born with an intersex condition; it also refers to antharlinga hijras and various other hijras . [126] Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded but provokes parental fear. [49]  In Islam , scholars of Islamic jurisprudence have detailed discussions on the status and rights of intersex based on what mainly exhibits in their external sexual organs. Yet, modern Islamic jurisprudence scholars turn to medical screening to determine the dominance of their sex. The intersex rights includes rights of inheritance, rights to marriage, rights to live like any other male or female. The rights are generally based on whether they are true hermaphrodites, or pseudo hermaphrodite. Scholars of Islamic jurisprudence generally consider their rights based on the majority of what appears from their external sexual organs. [ citation needed ]  In Judaism , the Talmud contains extensive discussion concerning the status of two intersex types in Jewish law; namely the androginus , which exhibits both male and female external sexual organs, and the tumtum which exhibits neither. In the 1970s and 1980s, the treatment of intersex babies started to be discussed in Orthodox Jewish medical halacha by prominent rabbinic leaders, for example Eliezer Waldenberg and Moshe Feinstein . [127]  Sport [ edit ]      Stanisława Walasiewicz (Stella Walsh) in 1933    Main article: Sex verification in sports  Multiple athletes have been humiliated, excluded from competition or been forced to return medals following discovery of an intersex trait. Examples include Erik Schinegger , Foekje Dillema , Maria José Martínez-Patiño and Santhi Soundarajan . In contrast, Stanisława Walasiewicz (also known as Stella Walsh) was the subject of posthumous controversy. [128]  The South African middle-distance runner Caster Semenya won gold at the World Championships in the women's 800 meter and won silver in the 2012 Summer Olympics. When Semenya won gold in the World Championships, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) requested sex verification tests. The results were not released, but Semenya was cleared to race with other women. [129]  Katrina Karkazis , Rebecca Jordan-Young , Georgiann Davis and Silvia Camporesi argued that new IAAF policies on "hyperandrogenism" in female athletes (applied for example to the case of Dutee Chand ), established in response to the Semenya case, are "significantly flawed", arguing that the policy will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify "gender policing". They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender. [130]  In April 2014, the BMJ reported that four elite women athletes with 5-ARD were subjected to sterilization and "partial clitoridectomies" in order to compete in sport. The authors noted that "partial clitoridectomy" was "not medically indicated, does not relate to real or perceived athletic "advantage". [17] Intersex advocates regard this intervention as "a clearly coercive process". [131] In 2016, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on health, Dainius Pūras, criticized "current and historic" sex verification policies, describing how "a number of athletes have undergone gonadectomy (removal of reproductive organs) and partial clitoridectomy (a form of female genital mutilation ) in the absence of symptoms or health issues warranting those procedures." [132]  Population figures [ edit ]  There are few firm estimates of the number of intersex people. While human rights institutions have called for the demedicalisation of intersex traits, as far as possible, [21] [51] [133] [134] medical definitions are often still used. The now-defunct Intersex Society of North America stated that:   If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won't show up until later in life. [135]   According to Blackless, Fausto-Sterling et al., 1.7 percent of human births are intersex, including variations that may not become apparent until, for example, puberty, or until attempting to conceive. [136] [137] Some clinicians do not favor such definitions. According to Leonard Sax, intersex should be "restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female", around 0.018%. This definition excludes Klinefelter syndrome and many other variations. [138] He in turn criticizes Fausto-Sterling for counting Late-Onset Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia for 88% of her figure. His rebuttal concludes,   "The most original feature of Fausto-Sterling's book is her reluctance to classify true intersex conditions as pathological (Fausto-Sterling, 2000, p. 113) ... She often uses the word natural synonymously with normal. However, natural and normal are not synonyms. A cow may give birth to a two-headed or Siamese calf by natural processes, natural being understood as per Fausto-Sterling's definition as "produced by nature." Nevertheless, that two-headed calf unarguably manifests an abnormal condition. Fausto-Sterling's insistence that all combinations of sexual anatomy be regarded as normal... follows that classifications of normal and abnormal sexual anatomy are mere social conventions, prejudices which can and should be set aside by an enlightened intelligentsia. This type of extreme social constructionism is confusing and is not helpful to clinicians, to their patients, or to their patients' families. Diluting the term intersex to include "any deviation from the Platonic ideal of sexual dimorphism" (Blackless et al., 2000, p. 152), as Fausto-Sterling suggests, deprives the term of any clinically useful meaning." [139]   However, many conditions excluded from Sax's analysis are currently regarded as disorders of sex development . Individuals with those diagnoses may experience stigma and discrimination due to their sex characteristics, including sex "normalizing" interventions, and so those diagnoses and life experiences meet definitions of intersex in use by UN and other bodies. As a result, the statistical analyses by Blackless and Fausto-Sterling, despite her outdated and perceived offensive use of the term hermaphrodite, [140] have become widely quoted, [51] [141] including by other clinicians. [142] The following summarizes those frequency statistics:    Sex Variation  Frequency    Not XX, XY, Klinefelter, or Turner  one in 1,666 births    Klinefelter syndrome (XXY)  one in 1,000 births    Turner syndrome (45,X)  one in 2,710 births [143]    Androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 13,000 births    Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 130,000 births    Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia  one in 13,000 births    Late onset adrenal hyperplasia  one in 10,000 births. [144]    Vaginal agenesis  one in 6,000 births    Ovotestes  one in 83,000 births    Idiopathic (no discernable medical cause)  one in 110,000 births    Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment, e.g. progestin administered to pregnant mother)  No estimate    5-alpha-reductase deficiency  No estimate    Mixed gonadal dysgenesis  No estimate    MRKH Syndrome  1 in 4,500-5,000 births    Complete gonadal dysgenesis  one in 150,000 births    Hypospadias (urethral opening in perineum or along penile shaft)  one in 250 births [145]    Epispadias (urethral opening between corona and tip of glans penis)  one in 117,000 births [146]    Population figures can vary due to genetic causes. In the Dominican Republic , 5-alpha-reductase deficiency is not uncommon in the town of Las Salinas resulting in social acceptance of the intersex trait. [147] Men with the trait are called "guevedoces" (Spanish for "eggs at twelve"). 12 out of 13 families had one or more male family members that carried the gene. The overall incidence for the town was 1 in every 90 males were carriers, with other males either non-carriers or non-affected carriers. [148]  Medical classifications [ edit ]  Signs [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia may appear as a large clitoris or as a small penis.     The Quigley scale is a method for describing genital development in AIS.    Because there is variation in all of the processes of the development of the sex organs , a child can be born with a sexual anatomy that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average clitoris ( clitoral hypertrophy ) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average penis that is open along the underside. The appearance may be quite ambiguous, describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia, or as male genitals with a very small penis, completely open along the midline (" hypospadic "), and empty scrotum. Fertility is variable.  Measurement systems [ edit ]  The Orchidometer is a medical instrument to measure the volume of the testicles. It was developed by Swiss pediatric endocrinologist Andrea Prader . The Prader scale [149] and Quigley scale are visual rating systems that measure genital appearance.  Other signs [ edit ]  In order to help in classification, methods other than a genitalia inspection can be performed. For instance, a karyotype display of a tissue sample may determine which of the causes of intersex is prevalent in the case.  Causes [ edit ]  Main article: Sexual differentiation  The common pathway of sexual differentiation , where a productive human female has an XX chromosome pair, and a productive male has an XY pair, is relevant to the development of intersex conditions.  During fertilization, the sperm adds either an X (female) or a Y (male) chromosome to the X in the ovum. This determines the genetic sex of the embryo. [150] During the first weeks of development, genetic male and female fetuses are "anatomically indistinguishable", with primitive gonads beginning to develop during approximately the sixth week of gestation. The gonads, in a "bipotential state", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events. [150] Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.  At around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In normal female differentiation, the Müllerian duct system develops into the uterus , Fallopian tubes , and inner third of the vagina. In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone MIH causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the Wolffian duct system , which develops into the vas deferens , seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts. [150] By birth, the typical fetus has been completely "sexed" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.  Conditions [ edit ]  Further information: disorders of sex development  There are a variety of opinions on what conditions or traits are and are not intersex, dependent on the definition of intersex that is used. Current human rights based definitions stress a broad diversity of sex characteristics that differ from expectations for male or female bodies. [2] During 2015, the Council of Europe , [51] the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights [133] and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights [134] have called for a review of medical classifications on the basis that they presently impede enjoyment of the right to health ; the Council of Europe expressed concern that "the gap between the expectations of human rights organisations of intersex people and the development of medical classifications has possibly widened over the past decade". [51] [133] [134]    List of conditions    Sex chromosomes  Name  Description    XX  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  The most common cause of sexual ambiguity is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands produce abnormally high levels of virilizing hormones in utero. The genes that cause CAH can now be detected in the developing embryo. As Fausto-Sterling mentioned in chapter 3 of Sexing the Body , "a woman who suspects she may be pregnant with a CAH baby (if she or someone in her family carries CAH) can undergo treatment and then get tested." To prevent an XX-CAH child's genitalia from becoming masculinized, a treatment, which includes the use of the steroid dexamethasone, must begin as early as four weeks after formation. Many do not favor this process because "the safety of this experimental therapy has not been established in rigorously controlled trials", it does allow physicians to detect abnormalities, therefore starting treatment right after birth. Starting treatment as soon as an XX-CAH baby is born not only minimizes, but also may even eliminate the chances of genital surgery from being performed. [137] However, the necessity of such surgery itself is disputed. Meta-analysis of the studies supporting the use of dexamethasone on CAH at-risk fetuses found "less than one half of one percent of published 'studies' of this intervention were regarded as being of high enough quality to provide meaningful data for a meta-analysis. Even these four studies were of low quality" ... "in ways so slipshod as to breach professional standards of medical ethics" [151] and "there were no data on long-term follow-up of physical and metabolic outcomes in children exposed to dexamethasone". [152]  In XX-females, this can range from partial masculinization that produces a large clitoris, to virilization and male appearance. The latter applies in particular to congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency , which is the most common form of CAH.  Individuals born with XX chromosomes affected by 17α-hydroxylase deficiency are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.  See below for XY CAH 17α-hydroxylase deficiency.     XX  Progestin-induced virilisation  In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by the use of progestin , a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals normally have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males. [153]    XX  Freemartinism  This condition occurs commonly in all species of cattle and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the placentae of fraternal twins usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a freemartin is very like a normal female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a castrated male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs – in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop normally as in other mammals.    XY  Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)  People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees. Cases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a vagina and no uterus , cervix , or ovaries , and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.  In mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as clitoromegaly , or a small penis, which is called micropenis or microphallus; hypospadias and cryptorchidism may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.     XY  5-alpha-reductase deficiency (5-ARD)  The condition affects individuals with a Y chromosome , making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS. [154] Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth. Such individuals are usually raised as girls. The lack of DHT also limits the development of facial hair.    XY  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  In individuals with a Y chromosome (typically XY) who have Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency , CAH inhibits virilization, unlike cases without a Y chromosome.    XY  Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS)  The child has XY chromosomes typical of a male. The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce Müllerian inhibiting factor during fetal development.    XY  Anorchia  Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce gametes necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to gender dysphoria , as anorchic individuals are typically assigned male at birth .    XY  Gonadal dysgenesis  It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whose gonads don't develop properly. Clinical features are heterogeneous. [137]    XY  Hypospadias  It is caused by various causes, including alterations in testosterone metabolism. The urethra does not run to the tip of the penis. In mild forms, the opening is just shy of the tip; in moderate forms, it is along the shaft; and in severe forms, it may open at the base of the penis. [155]    Other  Unusual chromosomal sex  In addition to the most common XX and XY chromosomal sexes, there are several other possible combinations, for example Turner syndrome ( XO ), Triple X syndrome (XXX), Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) and variants ( XXYY , XXXY , XXXXY ), XYY syndrome , de la Chapelle syndrome ( XX male ), Swyer syndrome (XY female).    Other  Mosaicism and chimerism  A mix can occur, where some of the cells of the body have the common XX or XY, while some have one of the less usual chromosomal contents above. Such a mixture is caused by either mosaicism or chimerism . In mosaicism, the mixture is caused by a mutation in one of the cells of the embryo after fertilization, whereas chimerism is a fusion of two embryos. In alternative fashion, it is simply a mixture between XX and XY, and does not have to involve any less-common genotypes in individual cells. This, too, can occur both as chimerism and as a result of one sex chromosome having mutated into the other. [156]  Mosaicism and chimerism may involve chromosomes other than the sex chromosomes, and not result in intersex traits.     Other  True hermaphroditism and ovotestis  A " true hermaphrodite " is defined as someone with both testicular and ovarian tissue. Though naturally occurring true hermaphroditism in humans is unknown, there is, on the other hand, a spectrum of forms of ovotestes . The varieties include having two ovotestes or one ovary and one ovotestis, often in the form of streak gonads . Phenotype is not determinable from the ovotestes; in some cases, the appearance is "fairly typically female"; in others, it is "fairly typically male", and it may also be "fairly in-between in terms of genital development." [157] Intersex activist Cheryl Chase is an example of someone with ovotestes. [158]    Medical interventions [ edit ]     Hong Kong intersex activist Small Luk    Main article: Intersex medical interventions  Further information: History of intersex surgery  Rationales [ edit ]  Medical interventions take place to address physical health concerns, and psychosocial risks. Both types of rationale are the subject of debate, particularly as the consequences of surgical (and many hormonal) interventions are lifelong and irreversible. Questions regarding physical health include accurately assessing risk levels, necessity and timing. Psychosocial rationales are particularly susceptible to questions of necessity as they reflect social and cultural concerns.  There remains no clinical consensus about an evidence base, surgical timing, necessity, type of surgical intervention, and degree of difference warranting intervention. [159] [160] [161] Such surgeries are the subject of significant contention due to consequences that include trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] This includes community activism, [40] and multiple reports by international human rights [19] [51] [23] [162] and health [72] institutions and national ethics bodies. [22] [163]  In the cases where gonads may pose a cancer risk, as in some cases of androgen insensitivity syndrome , [164] concern has been expressed that treatment rationales and decision-making regarding cancer risk may encapsulate decisions around a desire for surgical normalization. [21]  Types [ edit ]   Feminizing and masculinizing surgeries : Surgical procedures depend on diagnosis, and there is often concern as to whether surgery should be performed at all. Typically, surgery is performed shortly after birth. Defenders of the practice argue that it is necessary for individuals to be clearly identified as male or female in order for them to function socially and develop normally. Psychosocial reasons are often stated. [12] This is criticised by many human rights institutions, and authors. Unlike other aesthetic surgical procedures performed on infants, such as corrective surgery for a cleft lip , genital surgery may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life, or feelings of freakishness and unacceptability. [165]  Hormone treatment : There is widespread evidence of prenatal testing and hormone treatment to prevent or eliminate intersex traits, [166] [167] associated also with the problematization of sexual orientation and gender non-conformity. [166] [168]  Psychosocial support : All stakeholders support psychosocial support. A joint international statement by participants at the Third International Intersex Forum in 2013 sought, amongst other demands: "Recognition that medicalization and stigmatisation of intersex people result in significant trauma and mental health concerns. In view of ensuring the bodily integrity and well-being of intersex people, autonomous non-pathologising psycho-social and peer support be available to intersex people throughout their life (as self-required), as well as to parents and/or care providers."  Genetic selection and terminations : The ethics of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to select against intersex traits was the subject of 11 papers in the October 2013 issue of the American Journal of Bioethics . [169] There is widespread evidence of pregnancy terminations arising from prenatal testing, as well as prenatal hormone treatment to prevent intersex traits. Behrmann and Ravitsky find social concepts of sex, gender and sexual orientation to be "intertwined on many levels. Parental choice against intersex may thus conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  Gender dysphoria : The DSM-5 included a change from using gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria. This revised code now specifically includes intersex people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth and experience clinically significant distress or impairment, using the language of disorders of sex development . [170] This move was criticised by intersex advocacy groups in Australia and New Zealand . [171]  Medical photography and display : Photographs of intersex children's genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes. Problems associated with medical photography of intersex children have been discussed due to experiences of humiliation and powerlessness by child subjects, [172] along with their ethics, control and usage.

[1] [2] Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female . [3] [4]  Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites , "congenital eunuchs", [5] [6] or congenitally "frigid". [7] Such terms have fallen out of favor; in particular, the term "hermaphrodite" is considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious. [8] Medical description of intersex traits as disorders of sex development has been controversial [9] [10] [11] since the label was introduced in 2006. [12]  Intersex people may face stigmatization and discrimination from birth or discovery of an intersex trait. This may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. [13] [14] [15] Globally, some intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, are surgically or hormonally altered to create more socially acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of good outcomes. [16] Such treatments may involve sterilization . Adults, including elite female athletes, have also been subjects of such treatment. [17] [18] Increasingly these issues are considered human rights abuses, with statements from international [19] [20] and national human rights and ethics institutions. [21] [22] Intersex organizations have also issued statements about human rights violations, including the Malta declaration of the third International Intersex Forum . [23]  In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] [26]  Some intersex persons may be assigned and raised as a girl or boy but then identify with another gender later in life, while most continue to identify with their assigned sex.

Odiele disclosed that she has the intersex trait androgen insensitivity syndrome in 2017    According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights :   Intersex people are born with sex characteristics (including genitals, gonads and chromosome patterns) that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies.  Intersex is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of natural bodily variations. In some cases, intersex traits are visible at birth while in others, they are not apparent until puberty. Some chromosomal intersex variations may not be physically apparent at all. [2]   In biological terms, sex may be determined by a number of factors present at birth, including: [30]   the number and type of sex chromosomes ;  the type of gonads —ovaries or testicles;  the sex hormones ;  the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the uterus in females); and  the external genitalia.   People whose characteristics are not either all typically male or all typically female at birth are intersex. [31]  Some intersex traits are not always visible at birth; some babies may be born with ambiguous genitals, while others may have ambiguous internal organs (testes and ovaries). Others will not become aware that they are intersex unless they receive genetic testing, because it does not manifest in their phenotype.  History [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex in history , Timeline of intersex history , and History of intersex surgery      Hermaphroditus in a wall painting from Herculaneum (first half of the 1st century AD)    Whether or not they were socially tolerated or accepted by any particular culture, the existence of intersex people was known to many ancient and pre-modern cultures. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote of "hermaphroditus" in the first century BCE that Hermaphroditus "is born with a physical body which is a combination of that of a man and that of a woman", and with supernatural properties. [32]      Edward Coke , The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England (1st ed, 1628, title page)    In European societies, Roman law , post-classical canon law , and later common law , referred to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. [33] The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani states that "Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails". [34] [35] [36] The foundation of common law, the 17th Century Institutes of the Lawes of England described how a hermaphrodite could inherit "either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile." [37] [38] Legal cases have been described in canon law and elsewhere over the centuries.  In some non-European societies, sex or gender systems with more than two categories may have allowed for other forms of inclusion of both intersex and transgender people. Such societies have been characterized as "primitive", while Morgan Holmes states that subsequent analysis has been simplistic or romanticized, failing to take account of the ways that subjects of all categories are treated. [39]  During the Victorian era , medical authors introduced the terms " true hermaphrodite " for an individual who has both ovarian and testicular tissue, "male pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with testicular tissue, but either female or ambiguous sexual anatomy, and "female pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with ovarian tissue, but either male or ambiguous sexual anatomy. Some later shifts in terminology have reflected advances in genetics, while other shifts are suggested to be due to pejorative associations. [40]  The term intersexuality was coined by Richard Goldschmidt in 1917. [41] The first suggestion to replace the term 'hermaphrodite' with 'intersex' was made by Cawadias in the 1940s. [42]  Since the rise of modern medical science, some intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals. Surgeons pinpointed intersex babies as a "social emergency" when born. [43] An 'optimal gender policy', initially developed by John Money , stated that early intervention helped avoid gender identity confusion, but this lacks evidence, [44] and early interventions have adverse consequences for psychological and physical health. [22] Since advances in surgery have made it possible for intersex conditions to be concealed, many people are not aware of how frequently intersex conditions arise in human beings or that they occur at all. [45]  Dialog between what were once antagonistic groups of activists and clinicians has led to only slight changes in medical policies and how intersex patients and their families are treated in some locations. [46] In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] Many civil society organizations and human rights institutions now call for an end to unnecessary "normalizing" interventions, including in the Malta declaration . [47] [1]  Human rights and legal issues [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex rights by country  Human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on harmful practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions including, in 2015, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the World Health Organization . These developments have been accompanied by International Intersex Forums and increased cooperation amongst civil society organizations. However, the implementation, codification and enforcement of intersex human rights in national legal systems remains slow.  Areas of concern include: non-consensual medical interventions; stigma, discrimination and equal treatment; access to reparations and justice; access to information and support, and legal recognition.  Physical integrity and bodily autonomy [ edit ]       Legal prohibition of non-consensual medical interventions   Regulatory suspension of non-consensual medical interventions     Main articles: Intersex human rights and Intersex medical interventions  Stigmatization and discrimination from birth may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in east Africa may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a curse. [13] [14] Abandonments and infanticides have been reported in Uganda , [13]  Kenya , [48]  south Asia , [49] and China . [15]  Infants, children and adolescents also experience "normalising" interventions on intersex persons that are medically unnecessary and the unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics. Medical interventions to modify the sex characteristics of intersex people, without the consent of the intersex person have taken place in all countries where the human rights of intersex people have been studied. [50] These interventions have frequently been performed with the consent of the intersex person's parents, when the person is legally too young to consent. Such interventions have been criticized by the World Health Organization, other UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and an increasing number of regional and national institutions due to their adverse consequences, including trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw surgical intervention without consent. [25] [26] In the same year, the Council of Europe became the first institution to state that intersex people have the right not to undergo sex affirmation interventions. [25] [26] [51] [52] [53]  Anti-discrimination and equal treatment [ edit ]       Explicit protection on grounds of sex characteristics   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex status   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex within attribute of sex     Main article: Discrimination against intersex people  Inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law . Because people born with intersex bodies are seen as different, intersex infants, children, adolescents and adults "are often stigmatized and subjected to multiple human rights violations", including discrimination in education, healthcare, employment, sport, and public services. [2] [1] [54] Several countries have so far explicitly protected intersex people from discrimination, with landmarks including South Africa , [26] [55]  Australia , [56] [57] and, most comprehensively, Malta. [58] [59] [60] [61] [62]  Reparations and justice [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Facilitating access to justice and reparations . Access to reparation appears limited, with a scarcity of legal cases, such as the 2011 case of Christiane Völling in Germany . [24] [63] A second case was adjudicated in Chile in 2012, involving a child and his parents. [64] [65] A further successful case in Germany, taken by Michaela Raab, was reported in 2015. [66] In the United States , the "M.C." legal case, advanced by Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth with the Southern Poverty Law Centre is still before the courts. [67] [68]  Information and support [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Access to information , medical records, peer and other counselling and support. With the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, a secrecy-based model was also adopted, in the belief that this was necessary to ensure "normal" physical and psychosocial development. [21] [22] [69] [70] [71] [72]  Legal recognition [ edit ]  Main article: Legal recognition of intersex people  The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions states that legal recognition is firstly "about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women." [23] In some regions, obtaining any form of birth certification may be an issue. A Kenyan court case in 2014 established the right of an intersex boy, "Baby A", to a birth certificate. [73]  Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a certain sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not. [3] [4] [28] [29] Recognition of third sex or gender classifications occurs in several countries, [74] [75] [76] [77] however, it is controversial when it becomes assumed or coercive, as is the case with some German infants . [78] [79] [80] Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third 'X' sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an "X" or "other" option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure. [27] [81]  Language [ edit ]     U.S. intersex activist Pidgeon Pagonis    Research in the late 20th century led to a growing medical consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal, but relatively rare, forms of human biology. [4] [82] [83] [84] Clinician and researcher Milton Diamond stresses the importance of care in the selection of language related to intersex people:   Foremost, we advocate use of the terms "typical", "usual", or "most frequent" where it is more common to use the term "normal." When possible avoid expressions like maldeveloped or undeveloped, errors of development, defective genitals, abnormal, or mistakes of nature. Emphasize that all of these conditions are biologically understandable while they are statistically uncommon. [85]   The term 'intersex' [ edit ]  Some people with intersex traits self-identify as intersex, and some do not. [86] [87] Australian sociological research published in 2016, found that 60% of respondents used the term "intersex" to self-describe their sex characteristics, including people identifying themselves as intersex, describing themselves as having an intersex variation or, in smaller numbers, having an intersex condition. A majority of 75% of survey respondents also self-described as male or female. [27] Respondents also commonly used diagnostic labels and referred to their sex chromosomes, with word choices depending on audience. [27] [81] Research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that 80% of affected Support Group respondents "strongly liked, liked or felt neutral about intersex" as a term, while caregivers were less supportive. [88] The hospital reported that "disorders of sex development" may negatively affect care. [89]  Some intersex organizations reference "intersex people" and "intersex variations or traits" [90] while others use more medicalized language such as "people with intersex conditions", [91] or people "with intersex conditions or DSDs (differences of sex development)" and "children born with variations of sex anatomy". [92] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth published a statement recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  Hermaphrodite [ edit ]  Main article: Hermaphrodite  A hermaphrodite is an organism that has both male and female reproductive organs. Until the mid-20th century, "hermaphrodite" was used synonymously with "intersex". [42] The distinctions "male pseudohermaphrodite", "female pseudohermaphrodite" and especially " true hermaphrodite " [94] are vestiges of outdated 19th-century thinking, reflecting histology (microscopic appearance) of the gonads . [95] [96] [97] Medical terminology has shifted not only due to concerns about language, but also a shift to understandings based on genetics .  Currently, hermaphroditism is not to be confused with intersex, as the former refers only to a specific phenotypical presentation of sex organs and the latter to more complex combination of phenotypical and genotypical presentation. Using "hermaphrodite" to refer to intersex individuals is considered to be stigmatizing and misleading. [98]  Hermaphrodite is used for animal and vegetal species in which the possession of both ovaries and testes is either serial or concurrent, and for living organisms without such gonads but present binary form of reproduction, which is part of the typical life history of those species; intersex has come to be used when this is not the case.  Disorders of sex development [ edit ]  Main article: Disorders of sex development  " Disorders of sex development " (DSD) is a contested term, [9] [10] defined to include congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. Members of the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric  Endocrine Society and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology adopted this term in their "Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders". [12] [44] While it adopted the term, to open "many more doors", the now defunct Intersex Society of North America itself remarked that intersex is not a disorder. [99] Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested the adoption of the terminology and its implied status as a "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who do not feel that there is something wrong with them, regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy. [100]  Sociological research in Australia, published in 2016, found that 3% of respondents used the term "disorders of sex development" or "DSD" to define their sex characteristics, while 21% use the term when accessing medical services. In contrast, 60% used the term "intersex" in some form to self-describe their sex characteristics. [81] U.S. research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that "disorders of sex development" terminology may negatively affect care, give offence, and result in lower attendance at medical clinics. [89] [88]  Alternatives to categorizing intersex conditions as "disorders" have been suggested, including "variations of sex development". [11]  Organisation Intersex International (OII) questions a disease/disability approach, argues for deferral of intervention unless medically necessary, when fully informed consent of the individual involved is possible, and self-determination of sex/gender orientation and identity. [101] The UK Intersex Association is also highly critical of the label 'disorders' and points to the fact that there was minimal involvement of intersex representatives in the debate which led to the change in terminology. [102] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth also published a statement opposing pathologizing language to describe people born with intersex traits, recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  LGBT and LGBTI [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex and LGBT  Intersex can be contrasted with homosexuality or same-sex attraction . Numerous studies have shown higher rates of same sex attraction in intersex people, [103] [104] with a recent Australian study of people born with atypical sex characteristics finding that 52% of respondents were non-heterosexual, [27] [81] thus research on intersex subjects has been used to explore means of preventing homosexuality. [103] [104] However, current studies do not support a statistical correlation between genetic intersex traits and transsexual persons. [105] [106]  Intersex can therefore be contrasted with transgender , [107] which describes the condition in which one's gender identity does not match one's assigned sex. [107] [108] [109] Some people are both intersex and transgender. [110] A 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced gender dysphoria . [28] In an analysis of the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to eliminate intersex traits, Behrmann and Ravitsky state: "Parental choice against intersex may ... conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  The relationship of intersex to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans, and queer communities is complex, [112] but intersex people are often added to LGBT to create an LGBTI community. Emi Koyama describes how inclusion of intersex in LGBTI can fail to address intersex-specific human rights issues, including creating false impressions "that intersex people's rights are protected" by laws protecting LGBT people, and failing to acknowledge that many intersex people are not LGBT. [113]  Organisation Intersex International Australia states that some intersex individuals are same sex attracted, and some are heterosexual, but "LGBTI activism has fought for the rights of people who fall outside of expected binary sex and gender norms." [114] [115]  Julius Kaggwa of SIPD Uganda has written that, while the gay community "offers us a place of relative safety, it is also oblivious to our specific needs". [116]  Mauro Cabral has written that transgender people and organizations "need to stop approaching intersex issues as if they were trans issues" including use of intersex as a means of explaining being transgender; "we can collaborate a lot with the intersex movement by making it clear how wrong that approach is". [117]  Intersex in society [ edit ]     Kristi Bruce after shooting the documentary XXXY , 2000    Fiction and media [ edit ]  Main articles: Literature about intersex and Intersex characters in fiction  An intersex character is the narrator in Jeffrey Eugenides ' Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Middlesex .  Television works about intersex and films about intersex are scarce. The Spanish-language film XXY won the Critics' Week grand prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and the ACID/CCAS Support Award. [118]  Faking It is notable for providing the first intersex main character in a television show, [119] and television's first intersex character played by an intersex actor. [120]  Civil society institutions [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex civil society organizations  Intersex peer support and advocacy organizations have existed since at least 1985, with the establishment of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia in 1985. [121] The Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (UK) established in 1988. [122] The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) may have been one of the first intersex civil society organizations to have been open to people regardless of diagnosis; it was active from 1993 to 2008. [123]  Events [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex Awareness Day and Intersex Day of Remembrance  Intersex Awareness Day is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight the challenges faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 26 October. It marks the first public demonstration by intersex people, which took place in Boston on October 26, 1996, outside a venue where the American Academy of Pediatrics was holding its annual conference. [124]  Intersex Day of Remembrance , also known as Intersex Solidarity Day, is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight issues faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 8 November. It marks the birthday of Herculine Barbin , a French intersex person whose memoirs were later published by Michel Foucault in Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite .  Flag [ edit ]     Intersex Pride flag    Main article: Intersex flag  The intersex flag was created by Organisation Intersex International Australia in July 2013 to create a flag "that is not derivative, but is yet firmly grounded in meaning". The organization aimed to create a symbol without gendered pink and blue colors. It describes yellow and purple as " hermaphrodite " colors. The organization describes it as freely available "for use by any intersex person or organization who wishes to use it, in a human rights affirming community context". [125]  Religion [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex people and religion  In Hinduism , Sangam literature uses the word pedi to refer to people born with an intersex condition; it also refers to antharlinga hijras and various other hijras . [126] Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded but provokes parental fear. [49]  In Islam , scholars of Islamic jurisprudence have detailed discussions on the status and rights of intersex based on what mainly exhibits in their external sexual organs. Yet, modern Islamic jurisprudence scholars turn to medical screening to determine the dominance of their sex. The intersex rights includes rights of inheritance, rights to marriage, rights to live like any other male or female. The rights are generally based on whether they are true hermaphrodites, or pseudo hermaphrodite. Scholars of Islamic jurisprudence generally consider their rights based on the majority of what appears from their external sexual organs. [ citation needed ]  In Judaism , the Talmud contains extensive discussion concerning the status of two intersex types in Jewish law; namely the androginus , which exhibits both male and female external sexual organs, and the tumtum which exhibits neither. In the 1970s and 1980s, the treatment of intersex babies started to be discussed in Orthodox Jewish medical halacha by prominent rabbinic leaders, for example Eliezer Waldenberg and Moshe Feinstein . [127]  Sport [ edit ]      Stanisława Walasiewicz (Stella Walsh) in 1933    Main article: Sex verification in sports  Multiple athletes have been humiliated, excluded from competition or been forced to return medals following discovery of an intersex trait. Examples include Erik Schinegger , Foekje Dillema , Maria José Martínez-Patiño and Santhi Soundarajan . In contrast, Stanisława Walasiewicz (also known as Stella Walsh) was the subject of posthumous controversy. [128]  The South African middle-distance runner Caster Semenya won gold at the World Championships in the women's 800 meter and won silver in the 2012 Summer Olympics. When Semenya won gold in the World Championships, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) requested sex verification tests. The results were not released, but Semenya was cleared to race with other women. [129]  Katrina Karkazis , Rebecca Jordan-Young , Georgiann Davis and Silvia Camporesi argued that new IAAF policies on "hyperandrogenism" in female athletes (applied for example to the case of Dutee Chand ), established in response to the Semenya case, are "significantly flawed", arguing that the policy will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify "gender policing". They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender. [130]  In April 2014, the BMJ reported that four elite women athletes with 5-ARD were subjected to sterilization and "partial clitoridectomies" in order to compete in sport. The authors noted that "partial clitoridectomy" was "not medically indicated, does not relate to real or perceived athletic "advantage". [17] Intersex advocates regard this intervention as "a clearly coercive process". [131] In 2016, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on health, Dainius Pūras, criticized "current and historic" sex verification policies, describing how "a number of athletes have undergone gonadectomy (removal of reproductive organs) and partial clitoridectomy (a form of female genital mutilation ) in the absence of symptoms or health issues warranting those procedures." [132]  Population figures [ edit ]  There are few firm estimates of the number of intersex people. While human rights institutions have called for the demedicalisation of intersex traits, as far as possible, [21] [51] [133] [134] medical definitions are often still used. The now-defunct Intersex Society of North America stated that:   If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won't show up until later in life. [135]   According to Blackless, Fausto-Sterling et al., 1.7 percent of human births are intersex, including variations that may not become apparent until, for example, puberty, or until attempting to conceive. [136] [137] Some clinicians do not favor such definitions. According to Leonard Sax, intersex should be "restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female", around 0.018%. This definition excludes Klinefelter syndrome and many other variations. [138] He in turn criticizes Fausto-Sterling for counting Late-Onset Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia for 88% of her figure. His rebuttal concludes,   "The most original feature of Fausto-Sterling's book is her reluctance to classify true intersex conditions as pathological (Fausto-Sterling, 2000, p. 113) ... She often uses the word natural synonymously with normal. However, natural and normal are not synonyms. A cow may give birth to a two-headed or Siamese calf by natural processes, natural being understood as per Fausto-Sterling's definition as "produced by nature." Nevertheless, that two-headed calf unarguably manifests an abnormal condition. Fausto-Sterling's insistence that all combinations of sexual anatomy be regarded as normal... follows that classifications of normal and abnormal sexual anatomy are mere social conventions, prejudices which can and should be set aside by an enlightened intelligentsia. This type of extreme social constructionism is confusing and is not helpful to clinicians, to their patients, or to their patients' families. Diluting the term intersex to include "any deviation from the Platonic ideal of sexual dimorphism" (Blackless et al., 2000, p. 152), as Fausto-Sterling suggests, deprives the term of any clinically useful meaning." [139]   However, many conditions excluded from Sax's analysis are currently regarded as disorders of sex development . Individuals with those diagnoses may experience stigma and discrimination due to their sex characteristics, including sex "normalizing" interventions, and so those diagnoses and life experiences meet definitions of intersex in use by UN and other bodies. As a result, the statistical analyses by Blackless and Fausto-Sterling, despite her outdated and perceived offensive use of the term hermaphrodite, [140] have become widely quoted, [51] [141] including by other clinicians. [142] The following summarizes those frequency statistics:    Sex Variation  Frequency    Not XX, XY, Klinefelter, or Turner  one in 1,666 births    Klinefelter syndrome (XXY)  one in 1,000 births    Turner syndrome (45,X)  one in 2,710 births [143]    Androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 13,000 births    Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 130,000 births    Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia  one in 13,000 births    Late onset adrenal hyperplasia  one in 10,000 births. [144]    Vaginal agenesis  one in 6,000 births    Ovotestes  one in 83,000 births    Idiopathic (no discernable medical cause)  one in 110,000 births    Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment, e.g. progestin administered to pregnant mother)  No estimate    5-alpha-reductase deficiency  No estimate    Mixed gonadal dysgenesis  No estimate    MRKH Syndrome  1 in 4,500-5,000 births    Complete gonadal dysgenesis  one in 150,000 births    Hypospadias (urethral opening in perineum or along penile shaft)  one in 250 births [145]    Epispadias (urethral opening between corona and tip of glans penis)  one in 117,000 births [146]    Population figures can vary due to genetic causes. In the Dominican Republic , 5-alpha-reductase deficiency is not uncommon in the town of Las Salinas resulting in social acceptance of the intersex trait. [147] Men with the trait are called "guevedoces" (Spanish for "eggs at twelve"). 12 out of 13 families had one or more male family members that carried the gene. The overall incidence for the town was 1 in every 90 males were carriers, with other males either non-carriers or non-affected carriers. [148]  Medical classifications [ edit ]  Signs [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia may appear as a large clitoris or as a small penis.     The Quigley scale is a method for describing genital development in AIS.    Because there is variation in all of the processes of the development of the sex organs , a child can be born with a sexual anatomy that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average clitoris ( clitoral hypertrophy ) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average penis that is open along the underside. The appearance may be quite ambiguous, describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia, or as male genitals with a very small penis, completely open along the midline (" hypospadic "), and empty scrotum. Fertility is variable.  Measurement systems [ edit ]  The Orchidometer is a medical instrument to measure the volume of the testicles. It was developed by Swiss pediatric endocrinologist Andrea Prader . The Prader scale [149] and Quigley scale are visual rating systems that measure genital appearance.  Other signs [ edit ]  In order to help in classification, methods other than a genitalia inspection can be performed. For instance, a karyotype display of a tissue sample may determine which of the causes of intersex is prevalent in the case.  Causes [ edit ]  Main article: Sexual differentiation  The common pathway of sexual differentiation , where a productive human female has an XX chromosome pair, and a productive male has an XY pair, is relevant to the development of intersex conditions.  During fertilization, the sperm adds either an X (female) or a Y (male) chromosome to the X in the ovum. This determines the genetic sex of the embryo. [150] During the first weeks of development, genetic male and female fetuses are "anatomically indistinguishable", with primitive gonads beginning to develop during approximately the sixth week of gestation. The gonads, in a "bipotential state", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events. [150] Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.  At around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In normal female differentiation, the Müllerian duct system develops into the uterus , Fallopian tubes , and inner third of the vagina. In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone MIH causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the Wolffian duct system , which develops into the vas deferens , seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts. [150] By birth, the typical fetus has been completely "sexed" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.  Conditions [ edit ]  Further information: disorders of sex development  There are a variety of opinions on what conditions or traits are and are not intersex, dependent on the definition of intersex that is used. Current human rights based definitions stress a broad diversity of sex characteristics that differ from expectations for male or female bodies. [2] During 2015, the Council of Europe , [51] the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights [133] and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights [134] have called for a review of medical classifications on the basis that they presently impede enjoyment of the right to health ; the Council of Europe expressed concern that "the gap between the expectations of human rights organisations of intersex people and the development of medical classifications has possibly widened over the past decade". [51] [133] [134]    List of conditions    Sex chromosomes  Name  Description    XX  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  The most common cause of sexual ambiguity is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands produce abnormally high levels of virilizing hormones in utero. The genes that cause CAH can now be detected in the developing embryo. As Fausto-Sterling mentioned in chapter 3 of Sexing the Body , "a woman who suspects she may be pregnant with a CAH baby (if she or someone in her family carries CAH) can undergo treatment and then get tested." To prevent an XX-CAH child's genitalia from becoming masculinized, a treatment, which includes the use of the steroid dexamethasone, must begin as early as four weeks after formation. Many do not favor this process because "the safety of this experimental therapy has not been established in rigorously controlled trials", it does allow physicians to detect abnormalities, therefore starting treatment right after birth. Starting treatment as soon as an XX-CAH baby is born not only minimizes, but also may even eliminate the chances of genital surgery from being performed. [137] However, the necessity of such surgery itself is disputed. Meta-analysis of the studies supporting the use of dexamethasone on CAH at-risk fetuses found "less than one half of one percent of published 'studies' of this intervention were regarded as being of high enough quality to provide meaningful data for a meta-analysis. Even these four studies were of low quality" ... "in ways so slipshod as to breach professional standards of medical ethics" [151] and "there were no data on long-term follow-up of physical and metabolic outcomes in children exposed to dexamethasone". [152]  In XX-females, this can range from partial masculinization that produces a large clitoris, to virilization and male appearance. The latter applies in particular to congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency , which is the most common form of CAH.  Individuals born with XX chromosomes affected by 17α-hydroxylase deficiency are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.  See below for XY CAH 17α-hydroxylase deficiency.     XX  Progestin-induced virilisation  In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by the use of progestin , a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals normally have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males. [153]    XX  Freemartinism  This condition occurs commonly in all species of cattle and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the placentae of fraternal twins usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a freemartin is very like a normal female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a castrated male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs – in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop normally as in other mammals.    XY  Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)  People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees. Cases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a vagina and no uterus , cervix , or ovaries , and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.  In mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as clitoromegaly , or a small penis, which is called micropenis or microphallus; hypospadias and cryptorchidism may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.     XY  5-alpha-reductase deficiency (5-ARD)  The condition affects individuals with a Y chromosome , making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS. [154] Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth. Such individuals are usually raised as girls. The lack of DHT also limits the development of facial hair.    XY  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  In individuals with a Y chromosome (typically XY) who have Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency , CAH inhibits virilization, unlike cases without a Y chromosome.    XY  Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS)  The child has XY chromosomes typical of a male. The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce Müllerian inhibiting factor during fetal development.    XY  Anorchia  Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce gametes necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to gender dysphoria , as anorchic individuals are typically assigned male at birth .    XY  Gonadal dysgenesis  It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whose gonads don't develop properly. Clinical features are heterogeneous. [137]    XY  Hypospadias  It is caused by various causes, including alterations in testosterone metabolism. The urethra does not run to the tip of the penis. In mild forms, the opening is just shy of the tip; in moderate forms, it is along the shaft; and in severe forms, it may open at the base of the penis. [155]    Other  Unusual chromosomal sex  In addition to the most common XX and XY chromosomal sexes, there are several other possible combinations, for example Turner syndrome ( XO ), Triple X syndrome (XXX), Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) and variants ( XXYY , XXXY , XXXXY ), XYY syndrome , de la Chapelle syndrome ( XX male ), Swyer syndrome (XY female).    Other  Mosaicism and chimerism  A mix can occur, where some of the cells of the body have the common XX or XY, while some have one of the less usual chromosomal contents above. Such a mixture is caused by either mosaicism or chimerism . In mosaicism, the mixture is caused by a mutation in one of the cells of the embryo after fertilization, whereas chimerism is a fusion of two embryos. In alternative fashion, it is simply a mixture between XX and XY, and does not have to involve any less-common genotypes in individual cells. This, too, can occur both as chimerism and as a result of one sex chromosome having mutated into the other. [156]  Mosaicism and chimerism may involve chromosomes other than the sex chromosomes, and not result in intersex traits.     Other  True hermaphroditism and ovotestis  A " true hermaphrodite " is defined as someone with both testicular and ovarian tissue. Though naturally occurring true hermaphroditism in humans is unknown, there is, on the other hand, a spectrum of forms of ovotestes . The varieties include having two ovotestes or one ovary and one ovotestis, often in the form of streak gonads . Phenotype is not determinable from the ovotestes; in some cases, the appearance is "fairly typically female"; in others, it is "fairly typically male", and it may also be "fairly in-between in terms of genital development." [157] Intersex activist Cheryl Chase is an example of someone with ovotestes. [158]    Medical interventions [ edit ]     Hong Kong intersex activist Small Luk    Main article: Intersex medical interventions  Further information: History of intersex surgery  Rationales [ edit ]  Medical interventions take place to address physical health concerns, and psychosocial risks. Both types of rationale are the subject of debate, particularly as the consequences of surgical (and many hormonal) interventions are lifelong and irreversible. Questions regarding physical health include accurately assessing risk levels, necessity and timing. Psychosocial rationales are particularly susceptible to questions of necessity as they reflect social and cultural concerns.  There remains no clinical consensus about an evidence base, surgical timing, necessity, type of surgical intervention, and degree of difference warranting intervention. [159] [160] [161] Such surgeries are the subject of significant contention due to consequences that include trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] This includes community activism, [40] and multiple reports by international human rights [19] [51] [23] [162] and health [72] institutions and national ethics bodies. [22] [163]  In the cases where gonads may pose a cancer risk, as in some cases of androgen insensitivity syndrome , [164] concern has been expressed that treatment rationales and decision-making regarding cancer risk may encapsulate decisions around a desire for surgical normalization. [21]  Types [ edit ]   Feminizing and masculinizing surgeries : Surgical procedures depend on diagnosis, and there is often concern as to whether surgery should be performed at all. Typically, surgery is performed shortly after birth. Defenders of the practice argue that it is necessary for individuals to be clearly identified as male or female in order for them to function socially and develop normally. Psychosocial reasons are often stated. [12] This is criticised by many human rights institutions, and authors. Unlike other aesthetic surgical procedures performed on infants, such as corrective surgery for a cleft lip , genital surgery may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life, or feelings of freakishness and unacceptability. [165]  Hormone treatment : There is widespread evidence of prenatal testing and hormone treatment to prevent or eliminate intersex traits, [166] [167] associated also with the problematization of sexual orientation and gender non-conformity. [166] [168]  Psychosocial support : All stakeholders support psychosocial support. A joint international statement by participants at the Third International Intersex Forum in 2013 sought, amongst other demands: "Recognition that medicalization and stigmatisation of intersex people result in significant trauma and mental health concerns. In view of ensuring the bodily integrity and well-being of intersex people, autonomous non-pathologising psycho-social and peer support be available to intersex people throughout their life (as self-required), as well as to parents and/or care providers."  Genetic selection and terminations : The ethics of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to select against intersex traits was the subject of 11 papers in the October 2013 issue of the American Journal of Bioethics . [169] There is widespread evidence of pregnancy terminations arising from prenatal testing, as well as prenatal hormone treatment to prevent intersex traits. Behrmann and Ravitsky find social concepts of sex, gender and sexual orientation to be "intertwined on many levels. Parental choice against intersex may thus conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  Gender dysphoria : The DSM-5 included a change from using gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria. This revised code now specifically includes intersex people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth and experience clinically significant distress or impairment, using the language of disorders of sex development . [170] This move was criticised by intersex advocacy groups in Australia and New Zealand . [171]  Medical photography and display : Photographs of intersex children's genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes. Problems associated with medical photography of intersex children have been discussed due to experiences of humiliation and powerlessness by child subjects, [172] along with their ethics, control and usage.

[1] [2] Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female . [3] [4]  Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites , "congenital eunuchs", [5] [6] or congenitally "frigid". [7] Such terms have fallen out of favor; in particular, the term "hermaphrodite" is considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious. [8] Medical description of intersex traits as disorders of sex development has been controversial [9] [10] [11] since the label was introduced in 2006. [12]  Intersex people may face stigmatization and discrimination from birth or discovery of an intersex trait. This may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. [13] [14] [15] Globally, some intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, are surgically or hormonally altered to create more socially acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of good outcomes. [16] Such treatments may involve sterilization . Adults, including elite female athletes, have also been subjects of such treatment. [17] [18] Increasingly these issues are considered human rights abuses, with statements from international [19] [20] and national human rights and ethics institutions. [21] [22] Intersex organizations have also issued statements about human rights violations, including the Malta declaration of the third International Intersex Forum . [23]  In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] [26]  Some intersex persons may be assigned and raised as a girl or boy but then identify with another gender later in life, while most continue to identify with their assigned sex.

Odiele disclosed that she has the intersex trait androgen insensitivity syndrome in 2017    According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights :   Intersex people are born with sex characteristics (including genitals, gonads and chromosome patterns) that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies.  Intersex is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of natural bodily variations. In some cases, intersex traits are visible at birth while in others, they are not apparent until puberty. Some chromosomal intersex variations may not be physically apparent at all. [2]   In biological terms, sex may be determined by a number of factors present at birth, including: [30]   the number and type of sex chromosomes ;  the type of gonads —ovaries or testicles;  the sex hormones ;  the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the uterus in females); and  the external genitalia.   People whose characteristics are not either all typically male or all typically female at birth are intersex. [31]  Some intersex traits are not always visible at birth; some babies may be born with ambiguous genitals, while others may have ambiguous internal organs (testes and ovaries). Others will not become aware that they are intersex unless they receive genetic testing, because it does not manifest in their phenotype.  History [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex in history , Timeline of intersex history , and History of intersex surgery      Hermaphroditus in a wall painting from Herculaneum (first half of the 1st century AD)    Whether or not they were socially tolerated or accepted by any particular culture, the existence of intersex people was known to many ancient and pre-modern cultures. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote of "hermaphroditus" in the first century BCE that Hermaphroditus "is born with a physical body which is a combination of that of a man and that of a woman", and with supernatural properties. [32]      Edward Coke , The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England (1st ed, 1628, title page)    In European societies, Roman law , post-classical canon law , and later common law , referred to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. [33] The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani states that "Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails". [34] [35] [36] The foundation of common law, the 17th Century Institutes of the Lawes of England described how a hermaphrodite could inherit "either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile." [37] [38] Legal cases have been described in canon law and elsewhere over the centuries.  In some non-European societies, sex or gender systems with more than two categories may have allowed for other forms of inclusion of both intersex and transgender people. Such societies have been characterized as "primitive", while Morgan Holmes states that subsequent analysis has been simplistic or romanticized, failing to take account of the ways that subjects of all categories are treated. [39]  During the Victorian era , medical authors introduced the terms " true hermaphrodite " for an individual who has both ovarian and testicular tissue, "male pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with testicular tissue, but either female or ambiguous sexual anatomy, and "female pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with ovarian tissue, but either male or ambiguous sexual anatomy. Some later shifts in terminology have reflected advances in genetics, while other shifts are suggested to be due to pejorative associations. [40]  The term intersexuality was coined by Richard Goldschmidt in 1917. [41] The first suggestion to replace the term 'hermaphrodite' with 'intersex' was made by Cawadias in the 1940s. [42]  Since the rise of modern medical science, some intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals. Surgeons pinpointed intersex babies as a "social emergency" when born. [43] An 'optimal gender policy', initially developed by John Money , stated that early intervention helped avoid gender identity confusion, but this lacks evidence, [44] and early interventions have adverse consequences for psychological and physical health. [22] Since advances in surgery have made it possible for intersex conditions to be concealed, many people are not aware of how frequently intersex conditions arise in human beings or that they occur at all. [45]  Dialog between what were once antagonistic groups of activists and clinicians has led to only slight changes in medical policies and how intersex patients and their families are treated in some locations. [46] In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] Many civil society organizations and human rights institutions now call for an end to unnecessary "normalizing" interventions, including in the Malta declaration . [47] [1]  Human rights and legal issues [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex rights by country  Human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on harmful practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions including, in 2015, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the World Health Organization . These developments have been accompanied by International Intersex Forums and increased cooperation amongst civil society organizations. However, the implementation, codification and enforcement of intersex human rights in national legal systems remains slow.  Areas of concern include: non-consensual medical interventions; stigma, discrimination and equal treatment; access to reparations and justice; access to information and support, and legal recognition.  Physical integrity and bodily autonomy [ edit ]       Legal prohibition of non-consensual medical interventions   Regulatory suspension of non-consensual medical interventions     Main articles: Intersex human rights and Intersex medical interventions  Stigmatization and discrimination from birth may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in east Africa may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a curse. [13] [14] Abandonments and infanticides have been reported in Uganda , [13]  Kenya , [48]  south Asia , [49] and China . [15]  Infants, children and adolescents also experience "normalising" interventions on intersex persons that are medically unnecessary and the unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics. Medical interventions to modify the sex characteristics of intersex people, without the consent of the intersex person have taken place in all countries where the human rights of intersex people have been studied. [50] These interventions have frequently been performed with the consent of the intersex person's parents, when the person is legally too young to consent. Such interventions have been criticized by the World Health Organization, other UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and an increasing number of regional and national institutions due to their adverse consequences, including trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw surgical intervention without consent. [25] [26] In the same year, the Council of Europe became the first institution to state that intersex people have the right not to undergo sex affirmation interventions. [25] [26] [51] [52] [53]  Anti-discrimination and equal treatment [ edit ]       Explicit protection on grounds of sex characteristics   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex status   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex within attribute of sex     Main article: Discrimination against intersex people  Inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law . Because people born with intersex bodies are seen as different, intersex infants, children, adolescents and adults "are often stigmatized and subjected to multiple human rights violations", including discrimination in education, healthcare, employment, sport, and public services. [2] [1] [54] Several countries have so far explicitly protected intersex people from discrimination, with landmarks including South Africa , [26] [55]  Australia , [56] [57] and, most comprehensively, Malta. [58] [59] [60] [61] [62]  Reparations and justice [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Facilitating access to justice and reparations . Access to reparation appears limited, with a scarcity of legal cases, such as the 2011 case of Christiane Völling in Germany . [24] [63] A second case was adjudicated in Chile in 2012, involving a child and his parents. [64] [65] A further successful case in Germany, taken by Michaela Raab, was reported in 2015. [66] In the United States , the "M.C." legal case, advanced by Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth with the Southern Poverty Law Centre is still before the courts. [67] [68]  Information and support [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Access to information , medical records, peer and other counselling and support. With the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, a secrecy-based model was also adopted, in the belief that this was necessary to ensure "normal" physical and psychosocial development. [21] [22] [69] [70] [71] [72]  Legal recognition [ edit ]  Main article: Legal recognition of intersex people  The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions states that legal recognition is firstly "about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women." [23] In some regions, obtaining any form of birth certification may be an issue. A Kenyan court case in 2014 established the right of an intersex boy, "Baby A", to a birth certificate. [73]  Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a certain sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not. [3] [4] [28] [29] Recognition of third sex or gender classifications occurs in several countries, [74] [75] [76] [77] however, it is controversial when it becomes assumed or coercive, as is the case with some German infants . [78] [79] [80] Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third 'X' sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an "X" or "other" option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure. [27] [81]  Language [ edit ]     U.S. intersex activist Pidgeon Pagonis    Research in the late 20th century led to a growing medical consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal, but relatively rare, forms of human biology. [4] [82] [83] [84] Clinician and researcher Milton Diamond stresses the importance of care in the selection of language related to intersex people:   Foremost, we advocate use of the terms "typical", "usual", or "most frequent" where it is more common to use the term "normal." When possible avoid expressions like maldeveloped or undeveloped, errors of development, defective genitals, abnormal, or mistakes of nature. Emphasize that all of these conditions are biologically understandable while they are statistically uncommon. [85]   The term 'intersex' [ edit ]  Some people with intersex traits self-identify as intersex, and some do not. [86] [87] Australian sociological research published in 2016, found that 60% of respondents used the term "intersex" to self-describe their sex characteristics, including people identifying themselves as intersex, describing themselves as having an intersex variation or, in smaller numbers, having an intersex condition. A majority of 75% of survey respondents also self-described as male or female. [27] Respondents also commonly used diagnostic labels and referred to their sex chromosomes, with word choices depending on audience. [27] [81] Research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that 80% of affected Support Group respondents "strongly liked, liked or felt neutral about intersex" as a term, while caregivers were less supportive. [88] The hospital reported that "disorders of sex development" may negatively affect care. [89]  Some intersex organizations reference "intersex people" and "intersex variations or traits" [90] while others use more medicalized language such as "people with intersex conditions", [91] or people "with intersex conditions or DSDs (differences of sex development)" and "children born with variations of sex anatomy". [92] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth published a statement recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  Hermaphrodite [ edit ]  Main article: Hermaphrodite  A hermaphrodite is an organism that has both male and female reproductive organs. Until the mid-20th century, "hermaphrodite" was used synonymously with "intersex". [42] The distinctions "male pseudohermaphrodite", "female pseudohermaphrodite" and especially " true hermaphrodite " [94] are vestiges of outdated 19th-century thinking, reflecting histology (microscopic appearance) of the gonads . [95] [96] [97] Medical terminology has shifted not only due to concerns about language, but also a shift to understandings based on genetics .  Currently, hermaphroditism is not to be confused with intersex, as the former refers only to a specific phenotypical presentation of sex organs and the latter to more complex combination of phenotypical and genotypical presentation. Using "hermaphrodite" to refer to intersex individuals is considered to be stigmatizing and misleading. [98]  Hermaphrodite is used for animal and vegetal species in which the possession of both ovaries and testes is either serial or concurrent, and for living organisms without such gonads but present binary form of reproduction, which is part of the typical life history of those species; intersex has come to be used when this is not the case.  Disorders of sex development [ edit ]  Main article: Disorders of sex development  " Disorders of sex development " (DSD) is a contested term, [9] [10] defined to include congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. Members of the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric  Endocrine Society and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology adopted this term in their "Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders". [12] [44] While it adopted the term, to open "many more doors", the now defunct Intersex Society of North America itself remarked that intersex is not a disorder. [99] Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested the adoption of the terminology and its implied status as a "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who do not feel that there is something wrong with them, regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy. [100]  Sociological research in Australia, published in 2016, found that 3% of respondents used the term "disorders of sex development" or "DSD" to define their sex characteristics, while 21% use the term when accessing medical services. In contrast, 60% used the term "intersex" in some form to self-describe their sex characteristics. [81] U.S. research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that "disorders of sex development" terminology may negatively affect care, give offence, and result in lower attendance at medical clinics. [89] [88]  Alternatives to categorizing intersex conditions as "disorders" have been suggested, including "variations of sex development". [11]  Organisation Intersex International (OII) questions a disease/disability approach, argues for deferral of intervention unless medically necessary, when fully informed consent of the individual involved is possible, and self-determination of sex/gender orientation and identity. [101] The UK Intersex Association is also highly critical of the label 'disorders' and points to the fact that there was minimal involvement of intersex representatives in the debate which led to the change in terminology. [102] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth also published a statement opposing pathologizing language to describe people born with intersex traits, recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  LGBT and LGBTI [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex and LGBT  Intersex can be contrasted with homosexuality or same-sex attraction . Numerous studies have shown higher rates of same sex attraction in intersex people, [103] [104] with a recent Australian study of people born with atypical sex characteristics finding that 52% of respondents were non-heterosexual, [27] [81] thus research on intersex subjects has been used to explore means of preventing homosexuality. [103] [104] However, current studies do not support a statistical correlation between genetic intersex traits and transsexual persons. [105] [106]  Intersex can therefore be contrasted with transgender , [107] which describes the condition in which one's gender identity does not match one's assigned sex. [107] [108] [109] Some people are both intersex and transgender. [110] A 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced gender dysphoria . [28] In an analysis of the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to eliminate intersex traits, Behrmann and Ravitsky state: "Parental choice against intersex may ... conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  The relationship of intersex to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans, and queer communities is complex, [112] but intersex people are often added to LGBT to create an LGBTI community. Emi Koyama describes how inclusion of intersex in LGBTI can fail to address intersex-specific human rights issues, including creating false impressions "that intersex people's rights are protected" by laws protecting LGBT people, and failing to acknowledge that many intersex people are not LGBT. [113]  Organisation Intersex International Australia states that some intersex individuals are same sex attracted, and some are heterosexual, but "LGBTI activism has fought for the rights of people who fall outside of expected binary sex and gender norms." [114] [115]  Julius Kaggwa of SIPD Uganda has written that, while the gay community "offers us a place of relative safety, it is also oblivious to our specific needs". [116]  Mauro Cabral has written that transgender people and organizations "need to stop approaching intersex issues as if they were trans issues" including use of intersex as a means of explaining being transgender; "we can collaborate a lot with the intersex movement by making it clear how wrong that approach is". [117]  Intersex in society [ edit ]     Kristi Bruce after shooting the documentary XXXY , 2000    Fiction and media [ edit ]  Main articles: Literature about intersex and Intersex characters in fiction  An intersex character is the narrator in Jeffrey Eugenides ' Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Middlesex .  Television works about intersex and films about intersex are scarce. The Spanish-language film XXY won the Critics' Week grand prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and the ACID/CCAS Support Award. [118]  Faking It is notable for providing the first intersex main character in a television show, [119] and television's first intersex character played by an intersex actor. [120]  Civil society institutions [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex civil society organizations  Intersex peer support and advocacy organizations have existed since at least 1985, with the establishment of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia in 1985. [121] The Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (UK) established in 1988. [122] The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) may have been one of the first intersex civil society organizations to have been open to people regardless of diagnosis; it was active from 1993 to 2008. [123]  Events [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex Awareness Day and Intersex Day of Remembrance  Intersex Awareness Day is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight the challenges faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 26 October. It marks the first public demonstration by intersex people, which took place in Boston on October 26, 1996, outside a venue where the American Academy of Pediatrics was holding its annual conference. [124]  Intersex Day of Remembrance , also known as Intersex Solidarity Day, is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight issues faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 8 November. It marks the birthday of Herculine Barbin , a French intersex person whose memoirs were later published by Michel Foucault in Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite .  Flag [ edit ]     Intersex Pride flag    Main article: Intersex flag  The intersex flag was created by Organisation Intersex International Australia in July 2013 to create a flag "that is not derivative, but is yet firmly grounded in meaning". The organization aimed to create a symbol without gendered pink and blue colors. It describes yellow and purple as " hermaphrodite " colors. The organization describes it as freely available "for use by any intersex person or organization who wishes to use it, in a human rights affirming community context". [125]  Religion [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex people and religion  In Hinduism , Sangam literature uses the word pedi to refer to people born with an intersex condition; it also refers to antharlinga hijras and various other hijras . [126] Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded but provokes parental fear. [49]  In Islam , scholars of Islamic jurisprudence have detailed discussions on the status and rights of intersex based on what mainly exhibits in their external sexual organs. Yet, modern Islamic jurisprudence scholars turn to medical screening to determine the dominance of their sex. The intersex rights includes rights of inheritance, rights to marriage, rights to live like any other male or female. The rights are generally based on whether they are true hermaphrodites, or pseudo hermaphrodite. Scholars of Islamic jurisprudence generally consider their rights based on the majority of what appears from their external sexual organs. [ citation needed ]  In Judaism , the Talmud contains extensive discussion concerning the status of two intersex types in Jewish law; namely the androginus , which exhibits both male and female external sexual organs, and the tumtum which exhibits neither. In the 1970s and 1980s, the treatment of intersex babies started to be discussed in Orthodox Jewish medical halacha by prominent rabbinic leaders, for example Eliezer Waldenberg and Moshe Feinstein . [127]  Sport [ edit ]      Stanisława Walasiewicz (Stella Walsh) in 1933    Main article: Sex verification in sports  Multiple athletes have been humiliated, excluded from competition or been forced to return medals following discovery of an intersex trait. Examples include Erik Schinegger , Foekje Dillema , Maria José Martínez-Patiño and Santhi Soundarajan . In contrast, Stanisława Walasiewicz (also known as Stella Walsh) was the subject of posthumous controversy. [128]  The South African middle-distance runner Caster Semenya won gold at the World Championships in the women's 800 meter and won silver in the 2012 Summer Olympics. When Semenya won gold in the World Championships, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) requested sex verification tests. The results were not released, but Semenya was cleared to race with other women. [129]  Katrina Karkazis , Rebecca Jordan-Young , Georgiann Davis and Silvia Camporesi argued that new IAAF policies on "hyperandrogenism" in female athletes (applied for example to the case of Dutee Chand ), established in response to the Semenya case, are "significantly flawed", arguing that the policy will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify "gender policing". They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender. [130]  In April 2014, the BMJ reported that four elite women athletes with 5-ARD were subjected to sterilization and "partial clitoridectomies" in order to compete in sport. The authors noted that "partial clitoridectomy" was "not medically indicated, does not relate to real or perceived athletic "advantage". [17] Intersex advocates regard this intervention as "a clearly coercive process". [131] In 2016, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on health, Dainius Pūras, criticized "current and historic" sex verification policies, describing how "a number of athletes have undergone gonadectomy (removal of reproductive organs) and partial clitoridectomy (a form of female genital mutilation ) in the absence of symptoms or health issues warranting those procedures." [132]  Population figures [ edit ]  There are few firm estimates of the number of intersex people. While human rights institutions have called for the demedicalisation of intersex traits, as far as possible, [21] [51] [133] [134] medical definitions are often still used. The now-defunct Intersex Society of North America stated that:   If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won't show up until later in life. [135]   According to Blackless, Fausto-Sterling et al., 1.7 percent of human births are intersex, including variations that may not become apparent until, for example, puberty, or until attempting to conceive. [136] [137] Some clinicians do not favor such definitions. According to Leonard Sax, intersex should be "restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female", around 0.018%. This definition excludes Klinefelter syndrome and many other variations. [138] He in turn criticizes Fausto-Sterling for counting Late-Onset Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia for 88% of her figure. His rebuttal concludes,   "The most original feature of Fausto-Sterling's book is her reluctance to classify true intersex conditions as pathological (Fausto-Sterling, 2000, p. 113) ... She often uses the word natural synonymously with normal. However, natural and normal are not synonyms. A cow may give birth to a two-headed or Siamese calf by natural processes, natural being understood as per Fausto-Sterling's definition as "produced by nature." Nevertheless, that two-headed calf unarguably manifests an abnormal condition. Fausto-Sterling's insistence that all combinations of sexual anatomy be regarded as normal... follows that classifications of normal and abnormal sexual anatomy are mere social conventions, prejudices which can and should be set aside by an enlightened intelligentsia. This type of extreme social constructionism is confusing and is not helpful to clinicians, to their patients, or to their patients' families. Diluting the term intersex to include "any deviation from the Platonic ideal of sexual dimorphism" (Blackless et al., 2000, p. 152), as Fausto-Sterling suggests, deprives the term of any clinically useful meaning." [139]   However, many conditions excluded from Sax's analysis are currently regarded as disorders of sex development . Individuals with those diagnoses may experience stigma and discrimination due to their sex characteristics, including sex "normalizing" interventions, and so those diagnoses and life experiences meet definitions of intersex in use by UN and other bodies. As a result, the statistical analyses by Blackless and Fausto-Sterling, despite her outdated and perceived offensive use of the term hermaphrodite, [140] have become widely quoted, [51] [141] including by other clinicians. [142] The following summarizes those frequency statistics:    Sex Variation  Frequency    Not XX, XY, Klinefelter, or Turner  one in 1,666 births    Klinefelter syndrome (XXY)  one in 1,000 births    Turner syndrome (45,X)  one in 2,710 births [143]    Androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 13,000 births    Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 130,000 births    Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia  one in 13,000 births    Late onset adrenal hyperplasia  one in 10,000 births. [144]    Vaginal agenesis  one in 6,000 births    Ovotestes  one in 83,000 births    Idiopathic (no discernable medical cause)  one in 110,000 births    Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment, e.g. progestin administered to pregnant mother)  No estimate    5-alpha-reductase deficiency  No estimate    Mixed gonadal dysgenesis  No estimate    MRKH Syndrome  1 in 4,500-5,000 births    Complete gonadal dysgenesis  one in 150,000 births    Hypospadias (urethral opening in perineum or along penile shaft)  one in 250 births [145]    Epispadias (urethral opening between corona and tip of glans penis)  one in 117,000 births [146]    Population figures can vary due to genetic causes. In the Dominican Republic , 5-alpha-reductase deficiency is not uncommon in the town of Las Salinas resulting in social acceptance of the intersex trait. [147] Men with the trait are called "guevedoces" (Spanish for "eggs at twelve"). 12 out of 13 families had one or more male family members that carried the gene. The overall incidence for the town was 1 in every 90 males were carriers, with other males either non-carriers or non-affected carriers. [148]  Medical classifications [ edit ]  Signs [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia may appear as a large clitoris or as a small penis.     The Quigley scale is a method for describing genital development in AIS.    Because there is variation in all of the processes of the development of the sex organs , a child can be born with a sexual anatomy that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average clitoris ( clitoral hypertrophy ) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average penis that is open along the underside. The appearance may be quite ambiguous, describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia, or as male genitals with a very small penis, completely open along the midline (" hypospadic "), and empty scrotum. Fertility is variable.  Measurement systems [ edit ]  The Orchidometer is a medical instrument to measure the volume of the testicles. It was developed by Swiss pediatric endocrinologist Andrea Prader . The Prader scale [149] and Quigley scale are visual rating systems that measure genital appearance.  Other signs [ edit ]  In order to help in classification, methods other than a genitalia inspection can be performed. For instance, a karyotype display of a tissue sample may determine which of the causes of intersex is prevalent in the case.  Causes [ edit ]  Main article: Sexual differentiation  The common pathway of sexual differentiation , where a productive human female has an XX chromosome pair, and a productive male has an XY pair, is relevant to the development of intersex conditions.  During fertilization, the sperm adds either an X (female) or a Y (male) chromosome to the X in the ovum. This determines the genetic sex of the embryo. [150] During the first weeks of development, genetic male and female fetuses are "anatomically indistinguishable", with primitive gonads beginning to develop during approximately the sixth week of gestation. The gonads, in a "bipotential state", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events. [150] Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.  At around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In normal female differentiation, the Müllerian duct system develops into the uterus , Fallopian tubes , and inner third of the vagina. In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone MIH causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the Wolffian duct system , which develops into the vas deferens , seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts. [150] By birth, the typical fetus has been completely "sexed" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.  Conditions [ edit ]  Further information: disorders of sex development  There are a variety of opinions on what conditions or traits are and are not intersex, dependent on the definition of intersex that is used. Current human rights based definitions stress a broad diversity of sex characteristics that differ from expectations for male or female bodies. [2] During 2015, the Council of Europe , [51] the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights [133] and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights [134] have called for a review of medical classifications on the basis that they presently impede enjoyment of the right to health ; the Council of Europe expressed concern that "the gap between the expectations of human rights organisations of intersex people and the development of medical classifications has possibly widened over the past decade". [51] [133] [134]    List of conditions    Sex chromosomes  Name  Description    XX  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  The most common cause of sexual ambiguity is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands produce abnormally high levels of virilizing hormones in utero. The genes that cause CAH can now be detected in the developing embryo. As Fausto-Sterling mentioned in chapter 3 of Sexing the Body , "a woman who suspects she may be pregnant with a CAH baby (if she or someone in her family carries CAH) can undergo treatment and then get tested." To prevent an XX-CAH child's genitalia from becoming masculinized, a treatment, which includes the use of the steroid dexamethasone, must begin as early as four weeks after formation. Many do not favor this process because "the safety of this experimental therapy has not been established in rigorously controlled trials", it does allow physicians to detect abnormalities, therefore starting treatment right after birth. Starting treatment as soon as an XX-CAH baby is born not only minimizes, but also may even eliminate the chances of genital surgery from being performed. [137] However, the necessity of such surgery itself is disputed. Meta-analysis of the studies supporting the use of dexamethasone on CAH at-risk fetuses found "less than one half of one percent of published 'studies' of this intervention were regarded as being of high enough quality to provide meaningful data for a meta-analysis. Even these four studies were of low quality" ... "in ways so slipshod as to breach professional standards of medical ethics" [151] and "there were no data on long-term follow-up of physical and metabolic outcomes in children exposed to dexamethasone". [152]  In XX-females, this can range from partial masculinization that produces a large clitoris, to virilization and male appearance. The latter applies in particular to congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency , which is the most common form of CAH.  Individuals born with XX chromosomes affected by 17α-hydroxylase deficiency are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.  See below for XY CAH 17α-hydroxylase deficiency.     XX  Progestin-induced virilisation  In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by the use of progestin , a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals normally have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males. [153]    XX  Freemartinism  This condition occurs commonly in all species of cattle and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the placentae of fraternal twins usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a freemartin is very like a normal female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a castrated male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs – in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop normally as in other mammals.    XY  Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)  People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees. Cases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a vagina and no uterus , cervix , or ovaries , and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.  In mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as clitoromegaly , or a small penis, which is called micropenis or microphallus; hypospadias and cryptorchidism may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.     XY  5-alpha-reductase deficiency (5-ARD)  The condition affects individuals with a Y chromosome , making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS. [154] Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth. Such individuals are usually raised as girls. The lack of DHT also limits the development of facial hair.    XY  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  In individuals with a Y chromosome (typically XY) who have Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency , CAH inhibits virilization, unlike cases without a Y chromosome.    XY  Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS)  The child has XY chromosomes typical of a male. The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce Müllerian inhibiting factor during fetal development.    XY  Anorchia  Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce gametes necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to gender dysphoria , as anorchic individuals are typically assigned male at birth .    XY  Gonadal dysgenesis  It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whose gonads don't develop properly. Clinical features are heterogeneous. [137]    XY  Hypospadias  It is caused by various causes, including alterations in testosterone metabolism. The urethra does not run to the tip of the penis. In mild forms, the opening is just shy of the tip; in moderate forms, it is along the shaft; and in severe forms, it may open at the base of the penis. [155]    Other  Unusual chromosomal sex  In addition to the most common XX and XY chromosomal sexes, there are several other possible combinations, for example Turner syndrome ( XO ), Triple X syndrome (XXX), Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) and variants ( XXYY , XXXY , XXXXY ), XYY syndrome , de la Chapelle syndrome ( XX male ), Swyer syndrome (XY female).    Other  Mosaicism and chimerism  A mix can occur, where some of the cells of the body have the common XX or XY, while some have one of the less usual chromosomal contents above. Such a mixture is caused by either mosaicism or chimerism . In mosaicism, the mixture is caused by a mutation in one of the cells of the embryo after fertilization, whereas chimerism is a fusion of two embryos. In alternative fashion, it is simply a mixture between XX and XY, and does not have to involve any less-common genotypes in individual cells. This, too, can occur both as chimerism and as a result of one sex chromosome having mutated into the other. [156]  Mosaicism and chimerism may involve chromosomes other than the sex chromosomes, and not result in intersex traits.     Other  True hermaphroditism and ovotestis  A " true hermaphrodite " is defined as someone with both testicular and ovarian tissue. Though naturally occurring true hermaphroditism in humans is unknown, there is, on the other hand, a spectrum of forms of ovotestes . The varieties include having two ovotestes or one ovary and one ovotestis, often in the form of streak gonads . Phenotype is not determinable from the ovotestes; in some cases, the appearance is "fairly typically female"; in others, it is "fairly typically male", and it may also be "fairly in-between in terms of genital development." [157] Intersex activist Cheryl Chase is an example of someone with ovotestes. [158]    Medical interventions [ edit ]     Hong Kong intersex activist Small Luk    Main article: Intersex medical interventions  Further information: History of intersex surgery  Rationales [ edit ]  Medical interventions take place to address physical health concerns, and psychosocial risks. Both types of rationale are the subject of debate, particularly as the consequences of surgical (and many hormonal) interventions are lifelong and irreversible. Questions regarding physical health include accurately assessing risk levels, necessity and timing. Psychosocial rationales are particularly susceptible to questions of necessity as they reflect social and cultural concerns.  There remains no clinical consensus about an evidence base, surgical timing, necessity, type of surgical intervention, and degree of difference warranting intervention. [159] [160] [161] Such surgeries are the subject of significant contention due to consequences that include trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] This includes community activism, [40] and multiple reports by international human rights [19] [51] [23] [162] and health [72] institutions and national ethics bodies. [22] [163]  In the cases where gonads may pose a cancer risk, as in some cases of androgen insensitivity syndrome , [164] concern has been expressed that treatment rationales and decision-making regarding cancer risk may encapsulate decisions around a desire for surgical normalization. [21]  Types [ edit ]   Feminizing and masculinizing surgeries : Surgical procedures depend on diagnosis, and there is often concern as to whether surgery should be performed at all. Typically, surgery is performed shortly after birth. Defenders of the practice argue that it is necessary for individuals to be clearly identified as male or female in order for them to function socially and develop normally. Psychosocial reasons are often stated. [12] This is criticised by many human rights institutions, and authors. Unlike other aesthetic surgical procedures performed on infants, such as corrective surgery for a cleft lip , genital surgery may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life, or feelings of freakishness and unacceptability. [165]  Hormone treatment : There is widespread evidence of prenatal testing and hormone treatment to prevent or eliminate intersex traits, [166] [167] associated also with the problematization of sexual orientation and gender non-conformity. [166] [168]  Psychosocial support : All stakeholders support psychosocial support. A joint international statement by participants at the Third International Intersex Forum in 2013 sought, amongst other demands: "Recognition that medicalization and stigmatisation of intersex people result in significant trauma and mental health concerns. In view of ensuring the bodily integrity and well-being of intersex people, autonomous non-pathologising psycho-social and peer support be available to intersex people throughout their life (as self-required), as well as to parents and/or care providers."  Genetic selection and terminations : The ethics of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to select against intersex traits was the subject of 11 papers in the October 2013 issue of the American Journal of Bioethics . [169] There is widespread evidence of pregnancy terminations arising from prenatal testing, as well as prenatal hormone treatment to prevent intersex traits. Behrmann and Ravitsky find social concepts of sex, gender and sexual orientation to be "intertwined on many levels. Parental choice against intersex may thus conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  Gender dysphoria : The DSM-5 included a change from using gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria. This revised code now specifically includes intersex people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth and experience clinically significant distress or impairment, using the language of disorders of sex development . [170] This move was criticised by intersex advocacy groups in Australia and New Zealand . [171]  Medical photography and display : Photographs of intersex children's genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes. Problems associated with medical photography of intersex children have been discussed due to experiences of humiliation and powerlessness by child subjects, [172] along with their ethics, control and usage.

Gaga said:  “It’s not something that I’m ashamed of, just isn’t something that I go around telling everyone. Yes. I have both male and female genitalia, but I consider myself a female. It’s just a little bit of a penis and really doesn’t interfere much with my life. The reason I haven’t talked about it is that it’s not a big deal to me. Like come on, it’s not like we all go around talking about our vags. I think this is a great opportunity to make other multiple gendered people feel more comfortable with their bodies.

Question: "What does the Bible say about hermaphrodites?" Answer: Babies that are born with both male and female sexual organs, or characteristics of both organs, are called hermaphrodites or intersex. A child who is in an intersexual state is classified in one of three categories: 1) true hermaphrodite – an infant born with both ovaries and testicles and has both male and female sex organs. 2) female pseudohermaphrodite – a genetic female with male external sex organs. 3) male pseudohermaphrodite – a genetic male with external sex organs that fail to develop properly, resulting in female or male/female physical characteristics. In times past, doctors would perform surgeries without first testing the infant to find out its true sex, and the child would sometimes grow up very obviously a man, with female genitalia. Now, specialists can perform an ultrasound, blood test, chromosome analysis, and even do exploratory surgery to find out the baby's true sex. The treatment is still controversial, however. Some believe that surgery and/or hormonal therapy should begin within the first 15 months of life, and others believe these things should be put off until the child is old enough to make his or her own decision about it. There are pros and cons for each side. Either way, any family with an intersexual infant should begin counseling, as should the child when he or she is old enough. When babies are developing in the womb, they all begin with sex organs that look female. If the baby is male, he begins to produce testosterone, and if the hormone reaches the tissues correctly, the external genitals become a scrotum and penis. Chromosomal or sex hormone abnormalities can produce an infant in an intersexual state. It can also be caused by a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is a disease that blocks the baby's metabolism. It is not as uncommon as we might think; about 1 in every 2,000 newborns is born in an intersexual state. Babies are not born with physical disorders to punish their parents in any way. Although God created the earth perfectly, it soon brought destruction upon itself with the onset of human sin (Romans 5:12). Before the Flood in Genesis chapter 7 that wiped out almost all living things on the earth, people had the potential to live for several hundred years. After the Flood, human life spans grew progressively shorter, indicating a change in the environment which resulted in damage to the human genetic structure. This also explains why incest was necessary for the population of the earth in Genesis, but was forbidden later in the laws of Leviticus (18:6-18). Now, thousands of years later as sin continues to permeate the world, the human race has been bombarded with every kind of sickness, disease, disorder and birth defect we can imagine. It is very possible for a child born with both sex organs to grow up to have a healthy view of sexuality and successful relationships. From early on, the child should be taught how valuable, loved and accepted he is by his family and also by God. He or she is not a victim of divine judgment, but God has a plan for each one of us that will bring Him glory, as we can learn from a man who was healed by Jesus Christ: “'Teacher,' his disciples asked him, 'why was this man born blind? Was it a result of his own sins or those of his parents?' 'It was not because of his sins or his parents' sins,' Jesus answered. 'He was born blind so the power of God could be seen in him'” (John 9:2-3).

An Explanation of the Stats.  By Hida | April 1, 2015    The most thorough existing research finds intersex people to constitute an estimated 1.7% of the population*, which makes being intersex about as common as having red hair (1%-2%). However, popularly misinterpretted, much referenced statistics would have you believe are numbers are much lower. Here’s why.  Some groups use an old prevalence statistic that says we make up 1 in 2000, or .05%, percent of the population, but that statistic refers to one specific intersex trait, ambiguous genitalia, which is but one of many variations which, combined (as they are in medical diagnostics and coding), constitute the 1.7% estimate by esteemed Professor of Biology and Gender Studies, Anne Fausto-Sterling, of Brown University*. A similar, slightly higher, statistic was also reported in, “How Sexually Dimorphic Are We?”, by Blackless, et al, in The American Journal of Human Biology. “The belief that Homo sapiens is absolutely dimorphic with the respect to sex chromosome composition, gonadal structure, hormone levels, and the structure of the internal genital duct systems and external genitalia, derives from the platonic ideal that for each sex there is a single, universally correct developmental pathway and outcome. We surveyed the medical literature from 1955 to the present for studies of the frequency of deviation from the ideal male or female. We conclude that this frequency may be as high as 2% of live births. The frequency of individuals receiving “corrective” genital surgery, however, probably runs between 1 and 2 per 1,000 live births (0.1–0.2%).” Am. J. Hum. Biol. 12:151–166, 2000. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6300(200003/04)12:2%3C151::AID-AJHB1%3E3.0.CO;2-F/abstract These two findings are the most thorough scientific research which exists on the statistical prevalence of congenital intersex traits in humans.  The erroneous belief that we are an extremely tiny percentage of the population is often used to dismiss our need for legal rights and protections. Thus, we encourage everyone — particularly allies and/or members of the press educating others about intersex people — to please use the information and prevalence statistic provided here to accurately do so.

How porn addiction can affect your sex life         What is hermaphrodism and is it something that should be 'treated'? A hermaphrodite (or intersexed person ) is someone who has some or all of the primary sex characteristics of both genders (for example, a penis and a vulva). There are three types of hermaphrodites: true, male pseudo and female pseudo. A true hermaphrodite is someone who has both ovary and testicular tissue. The genitalia can vary from completely male or female, to a combination of both or even ambiguous looking. Female pseudo means that a person has XX chromosomes with normal female internal organs but with masculanised genitalia, while male psuedo means that person is born with XY chromosomes. Such a person has testes which are usually hidden in the abdominal cavity. The external genitalia are usually female. The situation in South Africa In South Africa, as in the rest of the world, hermaphrodite babies are not unusual. The first two questions parents ask when their baby is born, are '"'Is it a girl or boy?' and 'Is everything OK?' In the case of hermaphrodite babies, both questions are difficult to answer, even though these babies are usually perfectly healthy in all other respects," says Dr Philip Henning, a paediatrician at the Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town. “There is a fair amount of societal pressure on parents and doctors to make a decision one way or another. When surgery or hormonal treatment is considered, many factors are taken into account. The dominant sex of the baby is determined using many tests, including chromosome tests, urine tests and ultrasound to determine the internal genitalia of the baby. "The baby’s appearance is considered, and all factors are considered before this life-changing decision gets made. In many cases, hormonal treatment is sufficient and no surgery is needed,” Henning added. Many hermaphrodite babies have an extra sex chromosome, making them babies with 47 chromosomes instead of 46, including a XXY pair instead of either XX (female), or XY (male). These children thus have two X-chromosomes (like a normal female), as well as a XY-pair (like a normal male). With a Y-chromosome present, the babies have testes and will produce testosterone, with the likelihood of a male orientation. The possibilities of modern surgery There always have been such babies, but it wasn't until the post-World War II years that the American medical community developed the skills and tools to surgically correct genital abnormalities. Surgery soon became routine for the one in 2 000 children born with a genital malformation. But now many experts would like to see a change in that routine. They contend that surgery should be put off until the child is old enough to have a say in the matter. "The surgery isn't actually done for the baby," says Cheryl Chase, founder and executive director of the Intersex Society of North America. "They do it, because they think it's disturbing to the parents." "When a child is born with unusual genitals, the doctors take over," Chase says. "They say, 'We can fix it.' Parents don't have any information." "The problem is, doctors aren't necessarily the people in our society who have a special understanding of sexual issues or emotionally difficult issues," she says. 'Protecting kids from ridicule' The medical establishment generally has defended the surgeries, saying that intersex children would be ridiculed for not conforming to societal expectations of genital appearance. But critics don’t agree. "Some kids are born with big ears," says Alice Dreger, an assistant professor of science and technology studies at Michigan State University who has researched extensively on intersex issues. "Do we say, 'My God, this kid can't survive with big ears?’" The birth of a hermaphrodite baby, Dreger says, is not a medical emergency, but a psycho/social emergency. "But we almost never call in a psychologist," she says. "We call in a surgeon." Surgery's serious side effects Surgeries and hormonal treatments are not reversible, she notes, and that can cause problems if adults don't fit the sex chosen for them in infancy. Surgery also can have side effects such as incontinence or a loss of sexual sensation. Dreger proposes that hermaphrodites be treated as an anatomical variation, like differences in skin or hair colour, rather than as an abnormality. Families of hermaphrodite children should receive psychological support , she says, and early surgery should be done only when there's a real medical concern, like urinary infection. Dr William Reiner performed nearly 100 genital reconstructive surgeries at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore before deciding to look at the psychology of intersex. He went back to school to get certified as a psychiatrist and now counsels intersex patients and their families as a professor of child and adolescent psychology at Johns Hopkins. He, too, has become an advocate for delaying genital surgery on hermaphrodite babies. Society's beliefs and genital surgery "I think people are hung up about genitalia and sexuality," Reiner says. "We get mixed up, and these things scare us in some way. It may stimulate a drive to correct, a drive to make things right. Paediatric surgeons see all kinds of anomalies, and they are trained to make those anomalies normal." But Reiner doesn't blame surgeons, saying they merely reflect the beliefs of society. "We can't really blame this all on medicine," he says. "Part of it is a social problem. We have treated science as if it possesses the truth. It doesn't. Science is just a model." "But we thought we were finding the truth," he says. "We thought we were God. We didn't realise that you can't make anybody anything. They are what they are." "Philosophers have known for thousands of years that identity is built in, but in the last half of the 20th century, we thought identity could be created by society," Reiner says. Nature, not nurture In two studies, Reiner and other Johns Hopkins researchers found that prenatal exposure to normal male hormones determines male gender, even in chromosomal males born without a penis. The researchers studied 27 genetically male children born with testicles but no penis, 25 of whom had been castrated at birth, "reassigned" and raised as females. All 27 children showed strong male behaviours, and the majority reassigned themselves as males between the ages of 5 and 16. "Rather than the environment forming these children's gender identity , their identity and gender role seem to have developed despite a total environment telling them they are female," Reiner says. "They seem to be quite capable of telling us who they are." The two children in the study who weren't reassigned as females at birth were developmentally more like their male peers and psychologically better adjusted than the sex-reassigned children, the study shows. "The solution is to leave them alone," Reiner says. "Most of them, by the time they're of kindergarten age, will figure out who they are." And there still will be a role for surgeons. "Eventually, they are almost all going to want surgical reconstruction," Reiner says. "So surgeons are still going to be reconstructing these kids." "But instead of doing it at two days, two weeks or two months, it's going to be later," he says. "Will the surgeries be more difficult? Sure. But that's life." "Better to have a difficult surgery on a 15-year-old than a beautiful surgical outcome on a one-year-old that turns out to be the wrong sex," he says.

\n   Answer    \n. 
\nIndeed, there are chances even with a properly carried out vasectomy. A family friend conceived at 43 after her husband had this surgery. She was told that her chances of conceiving were about 1 in 3,000 and then another doctor told her 1 in 5,000. I have also talked to a reliable (many-times certified) MD who said it was about 1 in 250,000 chances. Apparently, this number isn't a certain statistic, but the obvious factors are (1) that conceiving is probable, and (2) the chances of this are rare.

age - with older women at higher risk,. 
ethnicity/race, - with black/Africans at highest risk of fraternal twins, and Asians at lowest risk. The risk of identical twins is the same across ethnic groups,. 
family history of multiple births - for fraternal twins, the expectant mother's family history, for identical twins, the family history of both expectant parents.. 
All in all, the usual quoted risk is about 2-5% naturally, up to 10% for oral fertility drugs, and higher for injectable medications.

Marie Curie      I am having a baby?  If you think you are pregnant or may be pregnant, get a pregnancy test kit from the pharmacy or go to your doctor to get tested. You should find out as soon as possible so you and your baby can start getting prenatal care.     In general no! I'm not saying it's completely impossible but it is not likely at all. The main reason being most girls don't start their period until they are at the youngest 11. and most girls don't start ovulating until about a year after their first period. However I have heard of a girl as young as eight having a baby, so five may not be completely impossible. However, a five year old is too young to make the concious decision to have sexual intercourse so therefore  no  five year old should ever get pregnant.    the male would also have to have to have hit puperty and i never heard of a 5 year old that's has puperty yet. so yes it is impossable               Susie Dresh  256,581 Contributions      If a baby boy is born without testicles a hermaphrodite or can he develop testicles later?

Hi,    The chances of you & your partner/wife having twins because you're a twin yourself increases the chances a little, however, It doesn't mean that you will NO DOUGHT have twins, it just increases the chances.    For example, I'm 13 and we're from Easterhouse in Glasgow, and I'm an identical triplet, me & my two triplet brothers were born on 25th December 1997, but that does not mean I will have twins/triplets/quads with my wife when I'm older, it stays the same because I'm identical with my brothers. Only fraternal twins/triplets increase the chances.    So you might have twins, you might not! But your just a little more prone to twins & triplets because your one yourself.  For some reason, if your an identical twin, your chances do not increase any because the genes are exactly the same between u and ur twin. But as I'm identical with my triplets, it won't increase my chances any.    P.S. Hope this helps from thetroublesomethree            Can hermaphrodites have babies?

Avid0g  914 Contributions      What are the odds at 17 of having a baby with Down syndrome?  If you are worried or concerned then you should try and speak to a medical professional. There are tests and screenings available between 11 & 20 weeks; the results of these are not always conclusive. Speak to a doctor who will be able to advise you.    The male contributes about 5% of the risk, statistically.    The female contribution of risk increases with her age. A woman's statistical risk at age 20 is 1 in 1529, so a 17 year old should be safer - much less than 1/10 of 1%.    Since this disease is linked to accumulating damage to the parents egg and/or sperm, you should also consider personal exposure to mutagens/radiation or dietary deficiencies.    Oddly enough, immediately after a Down syndrome birth, a higher risk  drops  to about 1% for subsequent pregnancies, indicating some kind of repair or elimination of defective cells. This is the same risk faced by 40 year old women.            If are having a baby and you get a pregnancy shot what will it do to the baby?

Jamesgrant  1,136 Contributions      What are the odds of having a baby with 3 very rare diseases?  If you know nothing about the parents' risk for these diseases or other contributing factors (race, environment, etc.), then the answer depends solely on the probabilities of getting any one of those diseases.    Let's say the risks are P1, P2 and P3 where P1 is the probability of the baby having rare disease #1 and so on. A probability of 1 is a sure thing and 0 means no chance, so the probability of a rare disease is a number slightly greater than 0.    The risk of getting disease #1 AND #2 AND #3 is the product: P1xP2xP3.    If, for example, the each risk is one in a million (P1=P2=P3=0.000001), then the odds of having a baby with all three is 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.    The math changes severely if one of the parents is at risk for the disease. Let's say the mother has one gene that causes the disease #1. Then P1 is no longer 1 in a million, it is 0.5. If the parent's racial group is afflicted with P2=0.001 as well, then P=0.5x0.001x0.000001=0.000000005, which is 500,000 the risk of others.

About  · FAQ · Law · Library · Bibliographies · Books · History · Videos · People       Home  How common is intersex?      To answer this question in an uncontroversial way, you’d have to first get everyone to agree on what counts as intersex —and also to agree on what should count as strictly male or strictly female. That’s hard to do. How small does a penis have to be before it counts as intersex? Do you count “sex chromosome” anomalies as intersex if there’s no apparent external sexual ambiguity? 1 (Alice Dreger explores this question in greater depth in her book Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex .)  Here’s what we do know: If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won’t show up until later in life.  Below we provide a summary of statistics drawn from an article by Brown University researcher Anne Fausto-Sterling. 2 The basis for that article was an extensive review of the medical literature from 1955 to 1998 aimed at producing numeric estimates for the frequency of sex variations. Note that the frequency of some of these conditions, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, differs for different populations. These statistics are approximations.  Not XX and not XY one in 1,666 births Klinefelter (XXY) one in 1,000 births Androgen insensitivity syndrome one in 13,000 births Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome one in 130,000 births Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia one in 13,000 births Late onset adrenal hyperplasia one in 66 individuals Vaginal agenesis one in 6,000 births Ovotestes one in 83,000 births Idiopathic (no discernable medical cause) one in 110,000 births Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment, for instance progestin administered to pregnant mother) no estimate 5 alpha reductase deficiency no estimate Mixed gonadal dysgenesis no estimate Complete gonadal dysgenesis one in 150,000 births Hypospadias (urethral opening in perineum or along penile shaft) one in 2,000 births Hypospadias (urethral opening between corona and tip of glans penis) one in 770 births Total number of people whose bodies differ from standard male or female one in 100 births Total number of people receiving surgery to “normalize” genital appearance one or two in 1,000 births  1 Dreger, Alice Domurat. 1998.

More commonly one or both gonads is an ovotestis containing both types of tissue.  Although similar in some ways to mixed gonadal dysgenesis , the conditions can be distinguished histologically. [2]     Contents    1  Presentation  2  Causes   2.1  Karyotypes    3  Human prevalence  4  Etymology  5  Society and culture   5.1  M.C. v. Aaronson    6  References  7  External links     Presentation [ edit ]  External genitalia are often ambiguous, the degree depending mainly on the amount of testosterone produced by the testicular tissue between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation .  Causes [ edit ]  There are several ways in which this may occur.   It can be caused by the division of one ovum, followed by fertilization of each haploid ovum and fusion of the two zygotes early in development.  Alternately, an ovum can be fertilized by two sperm followed by trisomic rescue in one or more daughter cells.  Two ova fertilized by two sperm cells will occasionally fuse to form a tetragametic chimera . If one male zygote and one female zygote fuse, a hermaphroditic individual may result.  It can be associated with mutation in the SRY gene. [3]   Karyotypes [ edit ]  Encountered karyotypes include 47XXY , 46XX/46XY, or 46XX/47XXY or XX & XY with SRY Mutations, Mixed Chromosomal abnormalities or hormone deficiency/excess disorders, and various degrees of mosaicism of these and a variety of others. The 3 Primary Karyotypes for True Hermaphroditism are XX with genetic defects (55-70% of cases), XX/XY (20-30% of cases) & XY (5-15% of cases) with the remainder being a variety of other Chromosomal abnormalities and Mosaicisms.  Human prevalence [ edit ]  There are no documented cases in which both types of gonadal tissue function. [4]  Although fertility is possible in true hermaphrodites, there has yet to be a documented case where both gonadal tissues function, contrary to the misconception that hermaphrodites can impregnate themselves. As of 2010, there have been at least 11 reported cases of fertility in true hermaphrodite humans in the scientific literature, [2] with one case of a person with XY-predominant (96%) mosaic giving birth. [4]  Etymology [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex in history  The term derives from the Latin : hermaphroditus , from Ancient Greek : ἑρμαφρόδιτος , translit.  hermaphroditos , [5] which derives from Hermaphroditos ( Ἑρμαϕρόδιτος), the son of Hermes and Aphrodite in Greek mythology . According to Ovid , he fused with the nymph  Salmacis resulting in one individual possessing physical traits of both sexes; [6] according to the earlier Diodorus Siculus , he was born with a physical body combining both sexes. [7] The word hermaphrodite entered the English lexicon in the late fourteenth century. [8]  Society and culture [ edit ]  M.C. v. Aaronson [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex rights in the United States  The U.S. legal case of M.C. v. Aaronson , advanced by intersex civil society organization  interACT with the Southern Poverty Law Center was brought before the courts in 2013. [9] [10] [11] [12] The child in the case was born in December 2004 with ovotestes, initially determined as male, but subsequently assigned female and placed in the care of South Carolina Department of Social Services in February 2005. [13] Physicians responsible for M.C. initially concluded that surgery was not urgent or necessary and M.C. had potential to identify as male or female, but, in April 2006, M.C. was subjected to feminizing medical interventions. [13] He was adopted in December 2006. Aged 8 at the time the case was taken, he now identifies as male. The Southern Poverty Law Center state: "In M.C.’s condition, there is no way to tell whether the child will ultimately identify as a boy or a girl. Instead, the doctors decided to assign M.C. female and change his body to fit their stereotype of how a girl should look." [10] [14] The defendant in the case, Dr Ian Aaronson, had written in 2001 that "feminizing genitoplasty on an infant who might eventually identify herself as a boy would be catastrophic". [15] [13]  The defendants sought to dismiss the case and seek a defense of qualified immunity, but these were denied by the District Court for the District of South Carolina. In January 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed this decision and dismissed the complaint, stating that, "it did not “mean to diminish the severe harm that M.C. claims to have suffered” but that a reasonable official in 2006 did not have fair warning from then-existing precedent that performing sex assignment surgery on sixteen-month-old M.C. violated a clearly established constitutional right." [16] The Court did not rule on whether or not the surgery violated M.C.'s constitutional rights. [17]  State suits were subsequently filed. [16] In July 2017, it was reported that the case had been settled out of court by the Medical University of South Carolina for $440,000. The University denied negligence, but agreed to a "compromise" settlement to avoid "costs of litigation." [18]  References [ edit ]     ^  Lee P. A., Houk C. P., Ahmed S. F., Hughes I.

MOST POPULAR   5 May 2011      Share      Tweet      Share      Email   Question I am a 30-year-old woman. Since I was a child I have had a very large clitoris, which has always protruded significantly. I am worried that I may be a hermaphrodite. I now have normal regular periods and no other signs of masculinity (excessive body hair etc.) Why could this be and will it affect my future fertility? I would like to have children. Answer I am sorry to hear of your concerns about your body. ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW As you are no doubt aware, hermaphrodites (people with both female and male internal reproductive organs, ie testicles and ovaries) do exist but the condition is very rare, only about four hundred sufferers being known of today. Most hermaphrodites do not have complete female or male genitalia or complete internal organs. In about one quarter of female hermaphrodites, there is a menstrual cycle with periods and the development of breasts (gynaecomastia). MOST POPULAR I would think that it is much more likely that your clitoris is within the normal size range for a woman. Everybody is different when it comes to the genital area and like men with different sized penises – women have different sized clitorises. I suspect that your doctor has not commented when you have attended for smears that there is any particular abnormality in that area. As you are considering having children in the future, I would advise you to have a chat with your doctor about your worries. A physical examination, combined with an internal examination of the vagina (bi-manual examination) will confirm that you have ovaries and a womb (uterus). Blood tests (to check hormone levels) and an ultrasound scan of your pelvis (to look for any internal tissues that could indicate hermaphroditism) should be enough to allay your fears. If there are any areas of doubt remaining, I am sure that your GP would be happy to refer you on to a specialist gynaecologist or endocrinologist for further investigations. Thank you for raising this question on such a sensitive subject.

In Summary  Is it true that hermaphrodites ‘do sex on themselves’? There is a rumour in school that one of us does so.   Advertisement             Dear doctor, Is it true that hermaphrodites ‘do sex on themselves’? There is a rumour in school that one of us does so. Student Dear student, A hermaphrodite is defined as any organism that has both male and female reproductive organs and this in human beings, is very rare indeed. What is found in humans is vague reproductive parts that make it difficult for those humans to be properly placed as either male or female. That hermaphrodites can have sex by themselves and even reproduce is not possible because either or both of their sex organs are non-functional. Naturally, sex is achieved with an erection that takes the manhood away from the body and therefore cannot be bent towards one’s own body for self-sex. Dear doctor, I take Indocid to relieve my menstrual pains every month. I combine it with my asthma medicine. Is this too strong? What could be the danger of doing this? Shakira Dear Shakira, Indocid is one of the so-called Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) which work by interfering with production of the substances ( prostaglandins), that are mainly responsible for period pains. Prostaglandins cause period pain the same way they cause labour pains by contracting the uterus. However, the likes of Indocid by this action can also lead to wounds in the alimentary canal called peptic ulcers. Also, they lead to accumulation of other substances that can easily lead to an asthma attack. So since you are asthmatic, apart from other undesirable effects from the drug, you are likely to worsen your asthma and therefore need to consult your doctor about use of other painkiller drugs that won’t worsen the asthma. Too many tablets can increase the pill burden, with risk of not taking all the given treatment and in the long run, the ailment not being cured. Dear doctor, I had a C-section after the doctor declared my situation an emergency because the baby stopped moving in the womb. Personally, I knew I had lost my baby on seeing the doctor’s reaction. Though I was very positive about giving birth normally, I was advised not to push because my cervix was not opening. But I’m now pregnant again. Is it possible for me to give birth normally or I should arrange with my doctor for another c-section since I do not want to take chances and end up losing my baby? And what causes the cervix not to open even after the waters have broken? Please advise. Fiona Dear Fiona, A caesarean operation whereby a baby is delivered through a cut on the abdomen is normally done if the baby or the mother’s health is in danger.  Some of the problems that put their health in danger may be present during one pregnancy and not the next and therefore do not necessitate the repeat of the operation during other pregnancies. If the baby got tired and yet the cervix was not open, this necessitated an operation but the same problem may or may not happen during your current pregnancy. That said, you need to religiously attend antenatal clinics for proper care, monitoring and advice. Meanwhile, avoid use of herbs like mumbwa during labour because some contain alcohol which makes the baby tired while others cause the uterus to contract too strongly and may cause the scar to give way, with more dangerous consequences. To answer your second question, cervical dystocia is where the cervix fails to dilate during labour. This can result from scars due to previous injuries or operations to the cervix. This then may call for delivering by caesarean operation whenever a woman has to deliver. Sometimes, failure of cervical dilation may be due to uncoordinated uterine contractions but this may respond to drugs and a caesarean may be done if the baby is tired. Dear doctor, I pass hot wind and even when I’ am seated, I feel it burning my behind. I get embarrassed and look around to see whether people near me smell it. What can I do to solve this problem? Agripina      Dear Agripina, you need not get embarrassed because wind is a normal byproduct of food digestion passed by all humans except those with some sort of obstruction to the intestines. Those who do not pass gas are the ones who need treatment. A feeling that gas is burning might indicate that the anal area is irritated or inflamed, requiring a medic to check it out. The irritation could be due to soap used for washing the anus or other applications and semen if you are a homosexual. That you fear that the gas smells is normal and everyone who passes gas has the same fears. The smell of gas depends on the diet and intestinal bacteria and it is normal for gas to smell. That you are getting jittery over normal events that are performed by everyone  may be an indication that you may have other fears or worries that need to be addressed in their own right. Homosexuality creates guilt feelings in a society that abhors it like in this country. The feelings can lead to being too sensitive, hence the fear about smell and feeling that the gas is hot. Dear doctor, I’m an epileptic who passes wind, stool and foam from my mouth. What worries me is the stool. Is there a way to stop this? Remmy Dear Remmy, epilepsy results from the generation of electrical signals inside the brain, causing one to have fits now and then. The type of fits one gets vary from person to person but usually, the same person may get the same type of fits. Some people with epilepsy simply stare blankly for a few seconds during a fit, but what is locally called epilepsy in Uganda is the worse type where one (1) Loses control and falls to the ground (2) Loses consciousness (3) Gets stiff and starts jerking without control. (4) Stops breathing for some seconds (5) Bites the tongue (6) Loses control of the bladder or rectum and foams at the mouth. (7) Gets confused on waking up. Therefore, uncontrollable passage of stool is one of the few symptoms of epilepsy. Epilepsy in Uganda carries a lot of stigma and people are oblivious of its complications including sudden death. This therefore calls for proper investigation and treatment of epilepsy as a whole instead of seeking to eliminate only one of the embarrassing symptoms. Epilepsy can be properly managed, for one to live a normal life without fear of the embarrassing symptoms like loss of bladder and bowel control. So please see a doctor nearest to you.

Intersex is a group of conditions where there is a discrepancy between the external genitals and the internal genitals (the testes and ovaries). The older term for this condition is hermaphroditism. Although the older terms are still included in this article for reference, they have been replaced by most experts, patients and families. Increasingly, this group of conditions is being called disorders of sex development (DSDs). Causes   Intersex can be divided into 4 categories: 46, XX intersex 46, XY intersex True gonadal intersex Complex or undetermined intersex Each one is discussed in more detail below. Note: In many children, the cause of intersex may remain undetermined, even with modern diagnostic techniques. 46, XX INTERSEX The person has the chromosomes of a woman, the ovaries of a woman, but external (outside) genitals that appear male. This most often is the result of a female fetus having been exposed to excess male hormones before birth. The labia ("lips" or folds of skin of the external female genitals) fuse, and the clitoris enlarges to appear like a penis. In most cases, this person has a normal uterus and fallopian tubes. This condition is also called 46, XX with virilization . It used to be called female pseudohermaphroditism. There are several possible causes: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (the most common cause). Male hormones (such as testosterone ) taken or encountered by the mother during pregnancy. Male hormone-producing tumors in the mother: These are most often ovarian tumors . Mothers who have children with 46, XX intersex should be checked unless there is another clear cause. Aromatase deficiency: This one may not be noticeable until puberty. Aromatase is an enzyme that normally converts male hormones to female hormones. Too much aromatase activity can lead to excess estrogen (female hormone); too little to 46, XX intersex. At puberty, these XX children, who had been raised as girls, may begin to take on male characteristics. 46, XY INTERSEX The person has the chromosomes of a man, but the external genitals are incompletely formed, ambiguous, or clearly female. Internally, testes may be normal, malformed, or absent. This condition is also called 46, XY with undervirilization. It used to be called male pseudohermaphroditism. Formation of normal male external genitals depends on the appropriate balance between male and female hormones. Therefore, it requires the adequate production and function of male hormones. 46, XY intersex has many possible causes: Problems with the testes: The testes normally produce male hormones. If the testes do not form properly, it will lead to undervirilization. There are a number of possible causes for this, including XY pure gonadal dysgenesis . Problems with testosterone formation: Testosterone is formed through a series of steps. Each of these steps requires a different enzyme. Deficiencies in any of these enzymes can result in inadequate testosterone and produce a different syndrome of 46, XY intersex. Different types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia can fall in this category. Problems with using testosterone: Some people have normal testes and make adequate amounts of testosterone, but still have 46, XY intersex due to conditions such as 5-alpha-reductase deficiency or androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). People with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency lack the enzyme needed to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). There are at least 5 different types of 5-alpha-reductase deficiency. Some of the babies have normal male genitalia, some have normal female genitalia, and many have something in between. Most change to external male genitalia around the time of puberty. AIS is the most common cause of 46, XY intersex. It has also been called testicular feminization. Here, the hormones are all normal, but the receptors to male hormones don't function properly. There are over 150 different defects that have been identified so far, and each causes a different type of AIS. TRUE GONADAL INTERSEX The person must have both ovarian and testicular tissue. This may be in the same gonad (an ovotestis), or the person might have 1 ovary and 1 testis. The person may have XX chromosomes, XY chromosomes, or both. The external genitals may be ambiguous or may appear to be female or male. This condition used to be called true hermaphroditism. In most people with true gonadal intersex, the underlying cause is unknown, although in some animal studies it has been linked to exposure to common agricultural pesticides. COMPLEX OR UNDETERMINED INTERSEX DISORDERS OF SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT Many chromosome configurations other than simple 46, XX or 46, XY can result in disorders of sex development. These include 45, XO (only one X chromosome), and 47, XXY, 47, XXX - both cases have an extra sex chromosome, either an X or a Y. These disorders do not result in a condition where there is discrepancy between internal and external genitalia. However, there may be problems with sex hormone levels, overall sexual development, and altered numbers of sex chromosomes. Symptoms   The symptoms associated with intersex will depend on the underlying cause. They may include: Ambiguous genitalia at birth Micropenis Clitoromegaly (an enlarged clitoris) Partial labial fusion Apparently undescended testes (which may turn out to be ovaries) in boys Labial or inguinal (groin) masses (which may turn out to be testes) in girls Hypospadias (the opening of the penis is somewhere other than at the tip; in females, the urethra [urine canal] opens into the vagina) Otherwise unusual-appearing genitalia at birth Electrolyte abnormalities Delayed or absent puberty Unexpected changes at puberty Exams and Tests   The following tests and exams may be done: Chromosome analysis Hormone levels (for example, testosterone level) Hormone stimulation tests Electrolyte tests Specific molecular testing Endoscopic exam (to verify the absence or presence of a vagina or cervix ) Ultrasound or MRI to evaluate whether internal sex organs are present (for example, a uterus) Treatment   Ideally, a team of health care professionals with expertise in intersex should work together to understand and treat the child with intersex and support the family. Parents should understand controversies and changes in treating intersex in recent years. In the past, the prevailing opinion was that it was generally best to assign a gender as quickly as possible. This was often based on the external genitals rather than the chromosomal gender. Parents were told to have no ambiguity in their minds as to the gender of the child. Prompt surgery was often recommended. Ovarian or testicular tissue from the other gender would be removed. In general, it was considered easier to reconstruct female genitalia than functioning male genitalia, so if the "correct" choice was not clear, the child was often assigned to be a girl. More recently, the opinion of many experts has shifted. Greater respect for the complexities of female sexual functioning has led them to conclude that suboptimal female genitalia may not be inherently better than suboptimal male genitalia, even if the reconstruction is "easier." In addition, other factors may be more important in gender satisfaction than functioning external genitals. Chromosomal, neural, hormonal, psychological, and behavioral factors can all influence gender identity. Many experts now urge delaying definitive surgery for as long as is healthy, and ideally involving the child in the gender decision. Clearly, intersex is a complex issue, and its treatment has short- and long-term consequences. The best answer will depend on many factors, including the specific cause of the intersex. It is best to take the time to understand the issues before rushing into a decision. An intersex support group may help acquaint families with the latest research, and may provide a community of other families, children, and adult individuals who have faced the same issues. Support Groups   Support groups are very important for families dealing with intersex. Different support groups may differ in their thoughts regarding this very sensitive topic. Look for one that supports your thoughts and feelings on the topic.

The prognosis depends on the specific cause of intersex. With understanding, support, and appropriate treatment, overall outlook is excellent.

I saw this program on the Discovery Channel about kids who were born with both male and female genitalia and for the rest of my pregnancy I was like 'I'm definitely going to have a hermaphrodite baby.'" â€“ Heather Armstrong of Dooce  Reality check: Luckily, the odds are on your side on this one. Hermaphrodites (or intersex babies, as theyâ€™re now called) make up a measly one percent of all live births. As for the chance that baby will be born with other physical deformities, recent stats say only three percent of all babies born in the U.S. wind up with significant physical birth defects each year (though this number reflects a very wide range of defects, big and small). While the rates are pretty slim, it's definitely still possible. But until you know for sure, try to curb some of your anxiety. (And lay off any documentaries on delivery mishaps, pregnancy phenomenons, or any other crazy-making programs that may lead you to freak out -- it won't do you or baby any good to worry.)    --  Natalie Lindsay 8/30/07 ~ ^ Gage^ & ^William^ 9/19/09 ~ Sophia Leeann  6/2/11 Baby BOY  Wyatt  due 8/7/12              Reply            Report this comment       0                  stephjayne · Original Poster    Posted 01/28/2012      It also could mean that someone on this board was born with that condition :P    --  Stephanie  Mama to  H  8/8/12 Loving J Since 3/10/11 I socialize at work and have never tongued any of my coworkers. - Sarcasm-Is-Free             Reply            Report this comment       0                     pinupmama912    Posted 01/28/2012     It's a scary thought, because as a parent, what would you do? I'd be so torn. If the baby was born a true intersection baby, wouldn't you then get the option to choose the sex? Even if the reproductive organs weren't working (which I think would be the case in a true intersex baby, because otherwise it'd more or less be just a genital deformation requiring corrective surgery, right?), you'd at least get to choose the "cosmetic" procedure to give your child a vagina or penis. But what if they hit puberty and don't identify with the sex you chose? I'd feel so guilty, knowing the confusion and pain transsexuals have had to deal with. I think if that happened, I know I'd support my child's decision if they wanted to change their sex, but I think I'd be so mad at myself (because I know myself and can be extremely hard and critical of myself at times) because I'd feel that I should have instinctively known or something. Wow. I've never thought of the possibility of having an "it" before. I should stop talking now. Haha Sorry. I tend to analyze and think deeply about everything. :-p  P.S. If any of you have been in this situation or ever find yourself in this situation, my post in no way reflects my opinion of transsexuals or their parents. I'm very open minded about that. I'm just saying I think I'd feel guilty for choosing "incorrectly".    --  Erica & Bernard (9/10/05)- Nathan (1/29/09), Roman Lucas (8/16/12), Crowley (Furbaby)             Reply            Report this comment       0                     pinupmama912    Posted 01/28/2012      Ahh!

We were having a conversation on the phone last night about the sex of our babies. She mentioned to me that her friend thought she was having a boy throughout her whole pregnancy and delivered a girl then somewhere in the conversation she brought up hermaphrodites!! She asked me ''what are the chances that we might deliver an intersex baby?'' What would you do? I have actually never thought about that and it kind of freaked me out a bit. I immediately starting googling the chances, found this website that said 1 in 20,0000. I also googled ''Would you be able to tell in an ultrasound if the baby has both male and female parts (hermaphrodite) couldn't find an answer. I know that this is very rare but I don't know why still kinda freaking me out lol I guess because the subject never crossed my mind and now it just won't leave my brain lol. What do you know about the subject? Do you know anyone that had an intersex baby? Do you know if you can tell on an ultrasound? What would you do? Has this subject cross your mind?  I really want to read any of your thoughts on this or anything you might now on the subject.

Once the baby identified with a certain gender they could decided later on to have a surgery to fit that identification. It happens, whether a baby is born intersex or with a certain defined sex. It doesn't mean it automatically is that gender. Wouldn't be any different for me I guess.    --  Proud & Happy Single Mom DS- 9/2004 DD-10/2014             Reply            Report this comment        5                     MercyAnew    Posted 07/19/2014      It's crossed my mind a lot. I have a hermaphrodite cousin and a transgender friend. I wouldn't choose and I would protect their gender identity until they were older, 18 (not six) and felt they could choose for themselves. I think having genetic tests and ultrasounds of internal organs would be helpful information for them in deciding so i would be a medical advocate for my child to provide that information and opportunities for him/her.

It's so rare you probably don't need to be worrying about it. BUT if it were me ... I would do tons of research, because I want to do the right thing but also because  I like to research. :) If I HAD to choose, I'd probably discuss with the doctor which hormones are most likely to take over at puberty and go with that. But I wouldn't force any gender identity. I'd buy the most neutural toys/clothes possible and come up with a more androgynous nickname until the child was old enough to tell me what clothes and toys they want. I have lots of LGBT friends and most knew pretty early in life how they identified, so I figure the kid would tell me when he or she got old enough. (Editing to clarify that I would not have the child have surgery. If that was necessary later in life after puberty, we'd do it then). Honestly, regardless of what gender my baby is (we're going to be surprised, so I have no idea), I will try not to force gender expectations. Sure, I'll dress a girl in cute frilly clothes as long as I can get away with it, but if she wants to play sports and get muddy with the boys, that's fine. If I have a boy who wants me to paint his room pink and play with barbies, that's awesome too. If my child turns out to be transgender, I'll look for a doctor and cousnelor that can best help him or her work through things and when the kid is old enough, if he or she wants to transition, I'll be supportive and say, "What pronouns and name would you like me to use?" If I have a gay kid, I'll become president of the local PFLAG chapter.

I read that based on that it is how the parents decide the sex.... But I guess that could always change :( I mean it does in people that were born with just one sex organ as well so its hit or miss.

About  · FAQ · Law · Library · Bibliographies · Books · History · Videos · People       Home  How common is intersex?      To answer this question in an uncontroversial way, you’d have to first get everyone to agree on what counts as intersex —and also to agree on what should count as strictly male or strictly female. That’s hard to do. How small does a penis have to be before it counts as intersex? Do you count “sex chromosome” anomalies as intersex if there’s no apparent external sexual ambiguity? 1 (Alice Dreger explores this question in greater depth in her book Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex .)  Here’s what we do know: If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won’t show up until later in life.  Below we provide a summary of statistics drawn from an article by Brown University researcher Anne Fausto-Sterling. 2 The basis for that article was an extensive review of the medical literature from 1955 to 1998 aimed at producing numeric estimates for the frequency of sex variations. Note that the frequency of some of these conditions, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, differs for different populations. These statistics are approximations.  Not XX and not XY one in 1,666 births Klinefelter (XXY) one in 1,000 births Androgen insensitivity syndrome one in 13,000 births Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome one in 130,000 births Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia one in 13,000 births Late onset adrenal hyperplasia one in 66 individuals Vaginal agenesis one in 6,000 births Ovotestes one in 83,000 births Idiopathic (no discernable medical cause) one in 110,000 births Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment, for instance progestin administered to pregnant mother) no estimate 5 alpha reductase deficiency no estimate Mixed gonadal dysgenesis no estimate Complete gonadal dysgenesis one in 150,000 births Hypospadias (urethral opening in perineum or along penile shaft) one in 2,000 births Hypospadias (urethral opening between corona and tip of glans penis) one in 770 births Total number of people whose bodies differ from standard male or female one in 100 births Total number of people receiving surgery to “normalize” genital appearance one or two in 1,000 births  1 Dreger, Alice Domurat. 1998.

More commonly one or both gonads is an ovotestis containing both types of tissue.  Although similar in some ways to mixed gonadal dysgenesis , the conditions can be distinguished histologically. [2]     Contents    1  Presentation  2  Causes   2.1  Karyotypes    3  Human prevalence  4  Etymology  5  Society and culture   5.1  M.C. v. Aaronson    6  References  7  External links     Presentation [ edit ]  External genitalia are often ambiguous, the degree depending mainly on the amount of testosterone produced by the testicular tissue between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation .  Causes [ edit ]  There are several ways in which this may occur.   It can be caused by the division of one ovum, followed by fertilization of each haploid ovum and fusion of the two zygotes early in development.  Alternately, an ovum can be fertilized by two sperm followed by trisomic rescue in one or more daughter cells.  Two ova fertilized by two sperm cells will occasionally fuse to form a tetragametic chimera . If one male zygote and one female zygote fuse, a hermaphroditic individual may result.  It can be associated with mutation in the SRY gene. [3]   Karyotypes [ edit ]  Encountered karyotypes include 47XXY , 46XX/46XY, or 46XX/47XXY or XX & XY with SRY Mutations, Mixed Chromosomal abnormalities or hormone deficiency/excess disorders, and various degrees of mosaicism of these and a variety of others. The 3 Primary Karyotypes for True Hermaphroditism are XX with genetic defects (55-70% of cases), XX/XY (20-30% of cases) & XY (5-15% of cases) with the remainder being a variety of other Chromosomal abnormalities and Mosaicisms.  Human prevalence [ edit ]  There are no documented cases in which both types of gonadal tissue function. [4]  Although fertility is possible in true hermaphrodites, there has yet to be a documented case where both gonadal tissues function, contrary to the misconception that hermaphrodites can impregnate themselves. As of 2010, there have been at least 11 reported cases of fertility in true hermaphrodite humans in the scientific literature, [2] with one case of a person with XY-predominant (96%) mosaic giving birth. [4]  Etymology [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex in history  The term derives from the Latin : hermaphroditus , from Ancient Greek : ἑρμαφρόδιτος , translit.  hermaphroditos , [5] which derives from Hermaphroditos ( Ἑρμαϕρόδιτος), the son of Hermes and Aphrodite in Greek mythology . According to Ovid , he fused with the nymph  Salmacis resulting in one individual possessing physical traits of both sexes; [6] according to the earlier Diodorus Siculus , he was born with a physical body combining both sexes. [7] The word hermaphrodite entered the English lexicon in the late fourteenth century. [8]  Society and culture [ edit ]  M.C. v. Aaronson [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex rights in the United States  The U.S. legal case of M.C. v. Aaronson , advanced by intersex civil society organization  interACT with the Southern Poverty Law Center was brought before the courts in 2013. [9] [10] [11] [12] The child in the case was born in December 2004 with ovotestes, initially determined as male, but subsequently assigned female and placed in the care of South Carolina Department of Social Services in February 2005. [13] Physicians responsible for M.C. initially concluded that surgery was not urgent or necessary and M.C. had potential to identify as male or female, but, in April 2006, M.C. was subjected to feminizing medical interventions. [13] He was adopted in December 2006. Aged 8 at the time the case was taken, he now identifies as male. The Southern Poverty Law Center state: "In M.C.’s condition, there is no way to tell whether the child will ultimately identify as a boy or a girl. Instead, the doctors decided to assign M.C. female and change his body to fit their stereotype of how a girl should look." [10] [14] The defendant in the case, Dr Ian Aaronson, had written in 2001 that "feminizing genitoplasty on an infant who might eventually identify herself as a boy would be catastrophic". [15] [13]  The defendants sought to dismiss the case and seek a defense of qualified immunity, but these were denied by the District Court for the District of South Carolina. In January 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed this decision and dismissed the complaint, stating that, "it did not “mean to diminish the severe harm that M.C. claims to have suffered” but that a reasonable official in 2006 did not have fair warning from then-existing precedent that performing sex assignment surgery on sixteen-month-old M.C. violated a clearly established constitutional right." [16] The Court did not rule on whether or not the surgery violated M.C.'s constitutional rights. [17]  State suits were subsequently filed. [16] In July 2017, it was reported that the case had been settled out of court by the Medical University of South Carolina for $440,000. The University denied negligence, but agreed to a "compromise" settlement to avoid "costs of litigation." [18]  References [ edit ]     ^  Lee P. A., Houk C. P., Ahmed S. F., Hughes I.

[1] [2] Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female . [3] [4]  Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites , "congenital eunuchs", [5] [6] or congenitally "frigid". [7] Such terms have fallen out of favor; in particular, the term "hermaphrodite" is considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious. [8] Medical description of intersex traits as disorders of sex development has been controversial [9] [10] [11] since the label was introduced in 2006. [12]  Intersex people may face stigmatization and discrimination from birth or discovery of an intersex trait. This may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. [13] [14] [15] Globally, some intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, are surgically or hormonally altered to create more socially acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of good outcomes. [16] Such treatments may involve sterilization . Adults, including elite female athletes, have also been subjects of such treatment. [17] [18] Increasingly these issues are considered human rights abuses, with statements from international [19] [20] and national human rights and ethics institutions. [21] [22] Intersex organizations have also issued statements about human rights violations, including the Malta declaration of the third International Intersex Forum . [23]  In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] [26]  Some intersex persons may be assigned and raised as a girl or boy but then identify with another gender later in life, while most continue to identify with their assigned sex.

Odiele disclosed that she has the intersex trait androgen insensitivity syndrome in 2017    According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights :   Intersex people are born with sex characteristics (including genitals, gonads and chromosome patterns) that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies.  Intersex is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of natural bodily variations. In some cases, intersex traits are visible at birth while in others, they are not apparent until puberty. Some chromosomal intersex variations may not be physically apparent at all. [2]   In biological terms, sex may be determined by a number of factors present at birth, including: [30]   the number and type of sex chromosomes ;  the type of gonads —ovaries or testicles;  the sex hormones ;  the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the uterus in females); and  the external genitalia.   People whose characteristics are not either all typically male or all typically female at birth are intersex. [31]  Some intersex traits are not always visible at birth; some babies may be born with ambiguous genitals, while others may have ambiguous internal organs (testes and ovaries). Others will not become aware that they are intersex unless they receive genetic testing, because it does not manifest in their phenotype.  History [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex in history , Timeline of intersex history , and History of intersex surgery      Hermaphroditus in a wall painting from Herculaneum (first half of the 1st century AD)    Whether or not they were socially tolerated or accepted by any particular culture, the existence of intersex people was known to many ancient and pre-modern cultures. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote of "hermaphroditus" in the first century BCE that Hermaphroditus "is born with a physical body which is a combination of that of a man and that of a woman", and with supernatural properties. [32]      Edward Coke , The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England (1st ed, 1628, title page)    In European societies, Roman law , post-classical canon law , and later common law , referred to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. [33] The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani states that "Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails". [34] [35] [36] The foundation of common law, the 17th Century Institutes of the Lawes of England described how a hermaphrodite could inherit "either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile." [37] [38] Legal cases have been described in canon law and elsewhere over the centuries.  In some non-European societies, sex or gender systems with more than two categories may have allowed for other forms of inclusion of both intersex and transgender people. Such societies have been characterized as "primitive", while Morgan Holmes states that subsequent analysis has been simplistic or romanticized, failing to take account of the ways that subjects of all categories are treated. [39]  During the Victorian era , medical authors introduced the terms " true hermaphrodite " for an individual who has both ovarian and testicular tissue, "male pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with testicular tissue, but either female or ambiguous sexual anatomy, and "female pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with ovarian tissue, but either male or ambiguous sexual anatomy. Some later shifts in terminology have reflected advances in genetics, while other shifts are suggested to be due to pejorative associations. [40]  The term intersexuality was coined by Richard Goldschmidt in 1917. [41] The first suggestion to replace the term 'hermaphrodite' with 'intersex' was made by Cawadias in the 1940s. [42]  Since the rise of modern medical science, some intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals. Surgeons pinpointed intersex babies as a "social emergency" when born. [43] An 'optimal gender policy', initially developed by John Money , stated that early intervention helped avoid gender identity confusion, but this lacks evidence, [44] and early interventions have adverse consequences for psychological and physical health. [22] Since advances in surgery have made it possible for intersex conditions to be concealed, many people are not aware of how frequently intersex conditions arise in human beings or that they occur at all. [45]  Dialog between what were once antagonistic groups of activists and clinicians has led to only slight changes in medical policies and how intersex patients and their families are treated in some locations. [46] In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] Many civil society organizations and human rights institutions now call for an end to unnecessary "normalizing" interventions, including in the Malta declaration . [47] [1]  Human rights and legal issues [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex rights by country  Human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on harmful practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions including, in 2015, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the World Health Organization . These developments have been accompanied by International Intersex Forums and increased cooperation amongst civil society organizations. However, the implementation, codification and enforcement of intersex human rights in national legal systems remains slow.  Areas of concern include: non-consensual medical interventions; stigma, discrimination and equal treatment; access to reparations and justice; access to information and support, and legal recognition.  Physical integrity and bodily autonomy [ edit ]       Legal prohibition of non-consensual medical interventions   Regulatory suspension of non-consensual medical interventions     Main articles: Intersex human rights and Intersex medical interventions  Stigmatization and discrimination from birth may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in east Africa may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a curse. [13] [14] Abandonments and infanticides have been reported in Uganda , [13]  Kenya , [48]  south Asia , [49] and China . [15]  Infants, children and adolescents also experience "normalising" interventions on intersex persons that are medically unnecessary and the unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics. Medical interventions to modify the sex characteristics of intersex people, without the consent of the intersex person have taken place in all countries where the human rights of intersex people have been studied. [50] These interventions have frequently been performed with the consent of the intersex person's parents, when the person is legally too young to consent. Such interventions have been criticized by the World Health Organization, other UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and an increasing number of regional and national institutions due to their adverse consequences, including trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw surgical intervention without consent. [25] [26] In the same year, the Council of Europe became the first institution to state that intersex people have the right not to undergo sex affirmation interventions. [25] [26] [51] [52] [53]  Anti-discrimination and equal treatment [ edit ]       Explicit protection on grounds of sex characteristics   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex status   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex within attribute of sex     Main article: Discrimination against intersex people  Inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law . Because people born with intersex bodies are seen as different, intersex infants, children, adolescents and adults "are often stigmatized and subjected to multiple human rights violations", including discrimination in education, healthcare, employment, sport, and public services. [2] [1] [54] Several countries have so far explicitly protected intersex people from discrimination, with landmarks including South Africa , [26] [55]  Australia , [56] [57] and, most comprehensively, Malta. [58] [59] [60] [61] [62]  Reparations and justice [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Facilitating access to justice and reparations . Access to reparation appears limited, with a scarcity of legal cases, such as the 2011 case of Christiane Völling in Germany . [24] [63] A second case was adjudicated in Chile in 2012, involving a child and his parents. [64] [65] A further successful case in Germany, taken by Michaela Raab, was reported in 2015. [66] In the United States , the "M.C." legal case, advanced by Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth with the Southern Poverty Law Centre is still before the courts. [67] [68]  Information and support [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Access to information , medical records, peer and other counselling and support. With the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, a secrecy-based model was also adopted, in the belief that this was necessary to ensure "normal" physical and psychosocial development. [21] [22] [69] [70] [71] [72]  Legal recognition [ edit ]  Main article: Legal recognition of intersex people  The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions states that legal recognition is firstly "about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women." [23] In some regions, obtaining any form of birth certification may be an issue. A Kenyan court case in 2014 established the right of an intersex boy, "Baby A", to a birth certificate. [73]  Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a certain sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not. [3] [4] [28] [29] Recognition of third sex or gender classifications occurs in several countries, [74] [75] [76] [77] however, it is controversial when it becomes assumed or coercive, as is the case with some German infants . [78] [79] [80] Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third 'X' sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an "X" or "other" option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure. [27] [81]  Language [ edit ]     U.S. intersex activist Pidgeon Pagonis    Research in the late 20th century led to a growing medical consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal, but relatively rare, forms of human biology. [4] [82] [83] [84] Clinician and researcher Milton Diamond stresses the importance of care in the selection of language related to intersex people:   Foremost, we advocate use of the terms "typical", "usual", or "most frequent" where it is more common to use the term "normal." When possible avoid expressions like maldeveloped or undeveloped, errors of development, defective genitals, abnormal, or mistakes of nature. Emphasize that all of these conditions are biologically understandable while they are statistically uncommon. [85]   The term 'intersex' [ edit ]  Some people with intersex traits self-identify as intersex, and some do not. [86] [87] Australian sociological research published in 2016, found that 60% of respondents used the term "intersex" to self-describe their sex characteristics, including people identifying themselves as intersex, describing themselves as having an intersex variation or, in smaller numbers, having an intersex condition. A majority of 75% of survey respondents also self-described as male or female. [27] Respondents also commonly used diagnostic labels and referred to their sex chromosomes, with word choices depending on audience. [27] [81] Research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that 80% of affected Support Group respondents "strongly liked, liked or felt neutral about intersex" as a term, while caregivers were less supportive. [88] The hospital reported that "disorders of sex development" may negatively affect care. [89]  Some intersex organizations reference "intersex people" and "intersex variations or traits" [90] while others use more medicalized language such as "people with intersex conditions", [91] or people "with intersex conditions or DSDs (differences of sex development)" and "children born with variations of sex anatomy". [92] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth published a statement recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  Hermaphrodite [ edit ]  Main article: Hermaphrodite  A hermaphrodite is an organism that has both male and female reproductive organs. Until the mid-20th century, "hermaphrodite" was used synonymously with "intersex". [42] The distinctions "male pseudohermaphrodite", "female pseudohermaphrodite" and especially " true hermaphrodite " [94] are vestiges of outdated 19th-century thinking, reflecting histology (microscopic appearance) of the gonads . [95] [96] [97] Medical terminology has shifted not only due to concerns about language, but also a shift to understandings based on genetics .  Currently, hermaphroditism is not to be confused with intersex, as the former refers only to a specific phenotypical presentation of sex organs and the latter to more complex combination of phenotypical and genotypical presentation. Using "hermaphrodite" to refer to intersex individuals is considered to be stigmatizing and misleading. [98]  Hermaphrodite is used for animal and vegetal species in which the possession of both ovaries and testes is either serial or concurrent, and for living organisms without such gonads but present binary form of reproduction, which is part of the typical life history of those species; intersex has come to be used when this is not the case.  Disorders of sex development [ edit ]  Main article: Disorders of sex development  " Disorders of sex development " (DSD) is a contested term, [9] [10] defined to include congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. Members of the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric  Endocrine Society and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology adopted this term in their "Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders". [12] [44] While it adopted the term, to open "many more doors", the now defunct Intersex Society of North America itself remarked that intersex is not a disorder. [99] Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested the adoption of the terminology and its implied status as a "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who do not feel that there is something wrong with them, regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy. [100]  Sociological research in Australia, published in 2016, found that 3% of respondents used the term "disorders of sex development" or "DSD" to define their sex characteristics, while 21% use the term when accessing medical services. In contrast, 60% used the term "intersex" in some form to self-describe their sex characteristics. [81] U.S. research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that "disorders of sex development" terminology may negatively affect care, give offence, and result in lower attendance at medical clinics. [89] [88]  Alternatives to categorizing intersex conditions as "disorders" have been suggested, including "variations of sex development". [11]  Organisation Intersex International (OII) questions a disease/disability approach, argues for deferral of intervention unless medically necessary, when fully informed consent of the individual involved is possible, and self-determination of sex/gender orientation and identity. [101] The UK Intersex Association is also highly critical of the label 'disorders' and points to the fact that there was minimal involvement of intersex representatives in the debate which led to the change in terminology. [102] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth also published a statement opposing pathologizing language to describe people born with intersex traits, recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  LGBT and LGBTI [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex and LGBT  Intersex can be contrasted with homosexuality or same-sex attraction . Numerous studies have shown higher rates of same sex attraction in intersex people, [103] [104] with a recent Australian study of people born with atypical sex characteristics finding that 52% of respondents were non-heterosexual, [27] [81] thus research on intersex subjects has been used to explore means of preventing homosexuality. [103] [104] However, current studies do not support a statistical correlation between genetic intersex traits and transsexual persons. [105] [106]  Intersex can therefore be contrasted with transgender , [107] which describes the condition in which one's gender identity does not match one's assigned sex. [107] [108] [109] Some people are both intersex and transgender. [110] A 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced gender dysphoria . [28] In an analysis of the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to eliminate intersex traits, Behrmann and Ravitsky state: "Parental choice against intersex may ... conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  The relationship of intersex to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans, and queer communities is complex, [112] but intersex people are often added to LGBT to create an LGBTI community. Emi Koyama describes how inclusion of intersex in LGBTI can fail to address intersex-specific human rights issues, including creating false impressions "that intersex people's rights are protected" by laws protecting LGBT people, and failing to acknowledge that many intersex people are not LGBT. [113]  Organisation Intersex International Australia states that some intersex individuals are same sex attracted, and some are heterosexual, but "LGBTI activism has fought for the rights of people who fall outside of expected binary sex and gender norms." [114] [115]  Julius Kaggwa of SIPD Uganda has written that, while the gay community "offers us a place of relative safety, it is also oblivious to our specific needs". [116]  Mauro Cabral has written that transgender people and organizations "need to stop approaching intersex issues as if they were trans issues" including use of intersex as a means of explaining being transgender; "we can collaborate a lot with the intersex movement by making it clear how wrong that approach is". [117]  Intersex in society [ edit ]     Kristi Bruce after shooting the documentary XXXY , 2000    Fiction and media [ edit ]  Main articles: Literature about intersex and Intersex characters in fiction  An intersex character is the narrator in Jeffrey Eugenides ' Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Middlesex .  Television works about intersex and films about intersex are scarce. The Spanish-language film XXY won the Critics' Week grand prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and the ACID/CCAS Support Award. [118]  Faking It is notable for providing the first intersex main character in a television show, [119] and television's first intersex character played by an intersex actor. [120]  Civil society institutions [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex civil society organizations  Intersex peer support and advocacy organizations have existed since at least 1985, with the establishment of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia in 1985. [121] The Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (UK) established in 1988. [122] The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) may have been one of the first intersex civil society organizations to have been open to people regardless of diagnosis; it was active from 1993 to 2008. [123]  Events [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex Awareness Day and Intersex Day of Remembrance  Intersex Awareness Day is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight the challenges faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 26 October. It marks the first public demonstration by intersex people, which took place in Boston on October 26, 1996, outside a venue where the American Academy of Pediatrics was holding its annual conference. [124]  Intersex Day of Remembrance , also known as Intersex Solidarity Day, is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight issues faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 8 November. It marks the birthday of Herculine Barbin , a French intersex person whose memoirs were later published by Michel Foucault in Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite .  Flag [ edit ]     Intersex Pride flag    Main article: Intersex flag  The intersex flag was created by Organisation Intersex International Australia in July 2013 to create a flag "that is not derivative, but is yet firmly grounded in meaning". The organization aimed to create a symbol without gendered pink and blue colors. It describes yellow and purple as " hermaphrodite " colors. The organization describes it as freely available "for use by any intersex person or organization who wishes to use it, in a human rights affirming community context". [125]  Religion [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex people and religion  In Hinduism , Sangam literature uses the word pedi to refer to people born with an intersex condition; it also refers to antharlinga hijras and various other hijras . [126] Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded but provokes parental fear. [49]  In Islam , scholars of Islamic jurisprudence have detailed discussions on the status and rights of intersex based on what mainly exhibits in their external sexual organs. Yet, modern Islamic jurisprudence scholars turn to medical screening to determine the dominance of their sex. The intersex rights includes rights of inheritance, rights to marriage, rights to live like any other male or female. The rights are generally based on whether they are true hermaphrodites, or pseudo hermaphrodite. Scholars of Islamic jurisprudence generally consider their rights based on the majority of what appears from their external sexual organs. [ citation needed ]  In Judaism , the Talmud contains extensive discussion concerning the status of two intersex types in Jewish law; namely the androginus , which exhibits both male and female external sexual organs, and the tumtum which exhibits neither. In the 1970s and 1980s, the treatment of intersex babies started to be discussed in Orthodox Jewish medical halacha by prominent rabbinic leaders, for example Eliezer Waldenberg and Moshe Feinstein . [127]  Sport [ edit ]      Stanisława Walasiewicz (Stella Walsh) in 1933    Main article: Sex verification in sports  Multiple athletes have been humiliated, excluded from competition or been forced to return medals following discovery of an intersex trait. Examples include Erik Schinegger , Foekje Dillema , Maria José Martínez-Patiño and Santhi Soundarajan . In contrast, Stanisława Walasiewicz (also known as Stella Walsh) was the subject of posthumous controversy. [128]  The South African middle-distance runner Caster Semenya won gold at the World Championships in the women's 800 meter and won silver in the 2012 Summer Olympics. When Semenya won gold in the World Championships, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) requested sex verification tests. The results were not released, but Semenya was cleared to race with other women. [129]  Katrina Karkazis , Rebecca Jordan-Young , Georgiann Davis and Silvia Camporesi argued that new IAAF policies on "hyperandrogenism" in female athletes (applied for example to the case of Dutee Chand ), established in response to the Semenya case, are "significantly flawed", arguing that the policy will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify "gender policing". They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender. [130]  In April 2014, the BMJ reported that four elite women athletes with 5-ARD were subjected to sterilization and "partial clitoridectomies" in order to compete in sport. The authors noted that "partial clitoridectomy" was "not medically indicated, does not relate to real or perceived athletic "advantage". [17] Intersex advocates regard this intervention as "a clearly coercive process". [131] In 2016, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on health, Dainius Pūras, criticized "current and historic" sex verification policies, describing how "a number of athletes have undergone gonadectomy (removal of reproductive organs) and partial clitoridectomy (a form of female genital mutilation ) in the absence of symptoms or health issues warranting those procedures." [132]  Population figures [ edit ]  There are few firm estimates of the number of intersex people. While human rights institutions have called for the demedicalisation of intersex traits, as far as possible, [21] [51] [133] [134] medical definitions are often still used. The now-defunct Intersex Society of North America stated that:   If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won't show up until later in life. [135]   According to Blackless, Fausto-Sterling et al., 1.7 percent of human births are intersex, including variations that may not become apparent until, for example, puberty, or until attempting to conceive. [136] [137] Some clinicians do not favor such definitions. According to Leonard Sax, intersex should be "restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female", around 0.018%. This definition excludes Klinefelter syndrome and many other variations. [138] He in turn criticizes Fausto-Sterling for counting Late-Onset Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia for 88% of her figure. His rebuttal concludes,   "The most original feature of Fausto-Sterling's book is her reluctance to classify true intersex conditions as pathological (Fausto-Sterling, 2000, p. 113) ... She often uses the word natural synonymously with normal. However, natural and normal are not synonyms. A cow may give birth to a two-headed or Siamese calf by natural processes, natural being understood as per Fausto-Sterling's definition as "produced by nature." Nevertheless, that two-headed calf unarguably manifests an abnormal condition. Fausto-Sterling's insistence that all combinations of sexual anatomy be regarded as normal... follows that classifications of normal and abnormal sexual anatomy are mere social conventions, prejudices which can and should be set aside by an enlightened intelligentsia. This type of extreme social constructionism is confusing and is not helpful to clinicians, to their patients, or to their patients' families. Diluting the term intersex to include "any deviation from the Platonic ideal of sexual dimorphism" (Blackless et al., 2000, p. 152), as Fausto-Sterling suggests, deprives the term of any clinically useful meaning." [139]   However, many conditions excluded from Sax's analysis are currently regarded as disorders of sex development . Individuals with those diagnoses may experience stigma and discrimination due to their sex characteristics, including sex "normalizing" interventions, and so those diagnoses and life experiences meet definitions of intersex in use by UN and other bodies. As a result, the statistical analyses by Blackless and Fausto-Sterling, despite her outdated and perceived offensive use of the term hermaphrodite, [140] have become widely quoted, [51] [141] including by other clinicians. [142] The following summarizes those frequency statistics:    Sex Variation  Frequency    Not XX, XY, Klinefelter, or Turner  one in 1,666 births    Klinefelter syndrome (XXY)  one in 1,000 births    Turner syndrome (45,X)  one in 2,710 births [143]    Androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 13,000 births    Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 130,000 births    Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia  one in 13,000 births    Late onset adrenal hyperplasia  one in 10,000 births. [144]    Vaginal agenesis  one in 6,000 births    Ovotestes  one in 83,000 births    Idiopathic (no discernable medical cause)  one in 110,000 births    Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment, e.g. progestin administered to pregnant mother)  No estimate    5-alpha-reductase deficiency  No estimate    Mixed gonadal dysgenesis  No estimate    MRKH Syndrome  1 in 4,500-5,000 births    Complete gonadal dysgenesis  one in 150,000 births    Hypospadias (urethral opening in perineum or along penile shaft)  one in 250 births [145]    Epispadias (urethral opening between corona and tip of glans penis)  one in 117,000 births [146]    Population figures can vary due to genetic causes. In the Dominican Republic , 5-alpha-reductase deficiency is not uncommon in the town of Las Salinas resulting in social acceptance of the intersex trait. [147] Men with the trait are called "guevedoces" (Spanish for "eggs at twelve"). 12 out of 13 families had one or more male family members that carried the gene. The overall incidence for the town was 1 in every 90 males were carriers, with other males either non-carriers or non-affected carriers. [148]  Medical classifications [ edit ]  Signs [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia may appear as a large clitoris or as a small penis.     The Quigley scale is a method for describing genital development in AIS.    Because there is variation in all of the processes of the development of the sex organs , a child can be born with a sexual anatomy that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average clitoris ( clitoral hypertrophy ) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average penis that is open along the underside. The appearance may be quite ambiguous, describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia, or as male genitals with a very small penis, completely open along the midline (" hypospadic "), and empty scrotum. Fertility is variable.  Measurement systems [ edit ]  The Orchidometer is a medical instrument to measure the volume of the testicles. It was developed by Swiss pediatric endocrinologist Andrea Prader . The Prader scale [149] and Quigley scale are visual rating systems that measure genital appearance.  Other signs [ edit ]  In order to help in classification, methods other than a genitalia inspection can be performed. For instance, a karyotype display of a tissue sample may determine which of the causes of intersex is prevalent in the case.  Causes [ edit ]  Main article: Sexual differentiation  The common pathway of sexual differentiation , where a productive human female has an XX chromosome pair, and a productive male has an XY pair, is relevant to the development of intersex conditions.  During fertilization, the sperm adds either an X (female) or a Y (male) chromosome to the X in the ovum. This determines the genetic sex of the embryo. [150] During the first weeks of development, genetic male and female fetuses are "anatomically indistinguishable", with primitive gonads beginning to develop during approximately the sixth week of gestation. The gonads, in a "bipotential state", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events. [150] Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.  At around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In normal female differentiation, the Müllerian duct system develops into the uterus , Fallopian tubes , and inner third of the vagina. In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone MIH causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the Wolffian duct system , which develops into the vas deferens , seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts. [150] By birth, the typical fetus has been completely "sexed" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.  Conditions [ edit ]  Further information: disorders of sex development  There are a variety of opinions on what conditions or traits are and are not intersex, dependent on the definition of intersex that is used. Current human rights based definitions stress a broad diversity of sex characteristics that differ from expectations for male or female bodies. [2] During 2015, the Council of Europe , [51] the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights [133] and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights [134] have called for a review of medical classifications on the basis that they presently impede enjoyment of the right to health ; the Council of Europe expressed concern that "the gap between the expectations of human rights organisations of intersex people and the development of medical classifications has possibly widened over the past decade". [51] [133] [134]    List of conditions    Sex chromosomes  Name  Description    XX  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  The most common cause of sexual ambiguity is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands produce abnormally high levels of virilizing hormones in utero. The genes that cause CAH can now be detected in the developing embryo. As Fausto-Sterling mentioned in chapter 3 of Sexing the Body , "a woman who suspects she may be pregnant with a CAH baby (if she or someone in her family carries CAH) can undergo treatment and then get tested." To prevent an XX-CAH child's genitalia from becoming masculinized, a treatment, which includes the use of the steroid dexamethasone, must begin as early as four weeks after formation. Many do not favor this process because "the safety of this experimental therapy has not been established in rigorously controlled trials", it does allow physicians to detect abnormalities, therefore starting treatment right after birth. Starting treatment as soon as an XX-CAH baby is born not only minimizes, but also may even eliminate the chances of genital surgery from being performed. [137] However, the necessity of such surgery itself is disputed. Meta-analysis of the studies supporting the use of dexamethasone on CAH at-risk fetuses found "less than one half of one percent of published 'studies' of this intervention were regarded as being of high enough quality to provide meaningful data for a meta-analysis. Even these four studies were of low quality" ... "in ways so slipshod as to breach professional standards of medical ethics" [151] and "there were no data on long-term follow-up of physical and metabolic outcomes in children exposed to dexamethasone". [152]  In XX-females, this can range from partial masculinization that produces a large clitoris, to virilization and male appearance. The latter applies in particular to congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency , which is the most common form of CAH.  Individuals born with XX chromosomes affected by 17α-hydroxylase deficiency are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.  See below for XY CAH 17α-hydroxylase deficiency.     XX  Progestin-induced virilisation  In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by the use of progestin , a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals normally have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males. [153]    XX  Freemartinism  This condition occurs commonly in all species of cattle and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the placentae of fraternal twins usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a freemartin is very like a normal female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a castrated male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs – in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop normally as in other mammals.    XY  Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)  People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees. Cases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a vagina and no uterus , cervix , or ovaries , and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.  In mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as clitoromegaly , or a small penis, which is called micropenis or microphallus; hypospadias and cryptorchidism may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.     XY  5-alpha-reductase deficiency (5-ARD)  The condition affects individuals with a Y chromosome , making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS. [154] Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth. Such individuals are usually raised as girls. The lack of DHT also limits the development of facial hair.    XY  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  In individuals with a Y chromosome (typically XY) who have Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency , CAH inhibits virilization, unlike cases without a Y chromosome.    XY  Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS)  The child has XY chromosomes typical of a male. The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce Müllerian inhibiting factor during fetal development.    XY  Anorchia  Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce gametes necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to gender dysphoria , as anorchic individuals are typically assigned male at birth .    XY  Gonadal dysgenesis  It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whose gonads don't develop properly. Clinical features are heterogeneous. [137]    XY  Hypospadias  It is caused by various causes, including alterations in testosterone metabolism. The urethra does not run to the tip of the penis. In mild forms, the opening is just shy of the tip; in moderate forms, it is along the shaft; and in severe forms, it may open at the base of the penis. [155]    Other  Unusual chromosomal sex  In addition to the most common XX and XY chromosomal sexes, there are several other possible combinations, for example Turner syndrome ( XO ), Triple X syndrome (XXX), Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) and variants ( XXYY , XXXY , XXXXY ), XYY syndrome , de la Chapelle syndrome ( XX male ), Swyer syndrome (XY female).    Other  Mosaicism and chimerism  A mix can occur, where some of the cells of the body have the common XX or XY, while some have one of the less usual chromosomal contents above. Such a mixture is caused by either mosaicism or chimerism . In mosaicism, the mixture is caused by a mutation in one of the cells of the embryo after fertilization, whereas chimerism is a fusion of two embryos. In alternative fashion, it is simply a mixture between XX and XY, and does not have to involve any less-common genotypes in individual cells. This, too, can occur both as chimerism and as a result of one sex chromosome having mutated into the other. [156]  Mosaicism and chimerism may involve chromosomes other than the sex chromosomes, and not result in intersex traits.     Other  True hermaphroditism and ovotestis  A " true hermaphrodite " is defined as someone with both testicular and ovarian tissue. Though naturally occurring true hermaphroditism in humans is unknown, there is, on the other hand, a spectrum of forms of ovotestes . The varieties include having two ovotestes or one ovary and one ovotestis, often in the form of streak gonads . Phenotype is not determinable from the ovotestes; in some cases, the appearance is "fairly typically female"; in others, it is "fairly typically male", and it may also be "fairly in-between in terms of genital development." [157] Intersex activist Cheryl Chase is an example of someone with ovotestes. [158]    Medical interventions [ edit ]     Hong Kong intersex activist Small Luk    Main article: Intersex medical interventions  Further information: History of intersex surgery  Rationales [ edit ]  Medical interventions take place to address physical health concerns, and psychosocial risks. Both types of rationale are the subject of debate, particularly as the consequences of surgical (and many hormonal) interventions are lifelong and irreversible. Questions regarding physical health include accurately assessing risk levels, necessity and timing. Psychosocial rationales are particularly susceptible to questions of necessity as they reflect social and cultural concerns.  There remains no clinical consensus about an evidence base, surgical timing, necessity, type of surgical intervention, and degree of difference warranting intervention. [159] [160] [161] Such surgeries are the subject of significant contention due to consequences that include trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] This includes community activism, [40] and multiple reports by international human rights [19] [51] [23] [162] and health [72] institutions and national ethics bodies. [22] [163]  In the cases where gonads may pose a cancer risk, as in some cases of androgen insensitivity syndrome , [164] concern has been expressed that treatment rationales and decision-making regarding cancer risk may encapsulate decisions around a desire for surgical normalization. [21]  Types [ edit ]   Feminizing and masculinizing surgeries : Surgical procedures depend on diagnosis, and there is often concern as to whether surgery should be performed at all. Typically, surgery is performed shortly after birth. Defenders of the practice argue that it is necessary for individuals to be clearly identified as male or female in order for them to function socially and develop normally. Psychosocial reasons are often stated. [12] This is criticised by many human rights institutions, and authors. Unlike other aesthetic surgical procedures performed on infants, such as corrective surgery for a cleft lip , genital surgery may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life, or feelings of freakishness and unacceptability. [165]  Hormone treatment : There is widespread evidence of prenatal testing and hormone treatment to prevent or eliminate intersex traits, [166] [167] associated also with the problematization of sexual orientation and gender non-conformity. [166] [168]  Psychosocial support : All stakeholders support psychosocial support. A joint international statement by participants at the Third International Intersex Forum in 2013 sought, amongst other demands: "Recognition that medicalization and stigmatisation of intersex people result in significant trauma and mental health concerns. In view of ensuring the bodily integrity and well-being of intersex people, autonomous non-pathologising psycho-social and peer support be available to intersex people throughout their life (as self-required), as well as to parents and/or care providers."  Genetic selection and terminations : The ethics of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to select against intersex traits was the subject of 11 papers in the October 2013 issue of the American Journal of Bioethics . [169] There is widespread evidence of pregnancy terminations arising from prenatal testing, as well as prenatal hormone treatment to prevent intersex traits. Behrmann and Ravitsky find social concepts of sex, gender and sexual orientation to be "intertwined on many levels. Parental choice against intersex may thus conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  Gender dysphoria : The DSM-5 included a change from using gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria. This revised code now specifically includes intersex people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth and experience clinically significant distress or impairment, using the language of disorders of sex development . [170] This move was criticised by intersex advocacy groups in Australia and New Zealand . [171]  Medical photography and display : Photographs of intersex children's genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes. Problems associated with medical photography of intersex children have been discussed due to experiences of humiliation and powerlessness by child subjects, [172] along with their ethics, control and usage.

[1] [2] Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female . [3] [4]  Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites , "congenital eunuchs", [5] [6] or congenitally "frigid". [7] Such terms have fallen out of favor; in particular, the term "hermaphrodite" is considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious. [8] Medical description of intersex traits as disorders of sex development has been controversial [9] [10] [11] since the label was introduced in 2006. [12]  Intersex people may face stigmatization and discrimination from birth or discovery of an intersex trait. This may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. [13] [14] [15] Globally, some intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, are surgically or hormonally altered to create more socially acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of good outcomes. [16] Such treatments may involve sterilization . Adults, including elite female athletes, have also been subjects of such treatment. [17] [18] Increasingly these issues are considered human rights abuses, with statements from international [19] [20] and national human rights and ethics institutions. [21] [22] Intersex organizations have also issued statements about human rights violations, including the Malta declaration of the third International Intersex Forum . [23]  In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] [26]  Some intersex persons may be assigned and raised as a girl or boy but then identify with another gender later in life, while most continue to identify with their assigned sex.

Odiele disclosed that she has the intersex trait androgen insensitivity syndrome in 2017    According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights :   Intersex people are born with sex characteristics (including genitals, gonads and chromosome patterns) that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies.  Intersex is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of natural bodily variations. In some cases, intersex traits are visible at birth while in others, they are not apparent until puberty. Some chromosomal intersex variations may not be physically apparent at all. [2]   In biological terms, sex may be determined by a number of factors present at birth, including: [30]   the number and type of sex chromosomes ;  the type of gonads —ovaries or testicles;  the sex hormones ;  the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the uterus in females); and  the external genitalia.   People whose characteristics are not either all typically male or all typically female at birth are intersex. [31]  Some intersex traits are not always visible at birth; some babies may be born with ambiguous genitals, while others may have ambiguous internal organs (testes and ovaries). Others will not become aware that they are intersex unless they receive genetic testing, because it does not manifest in their phenotype.  History [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex in history , Timeline of intersex history , and History of intersex surgery      Hermaphroditus in a wall painting from Herculaneum (first half of the 1st century AD)    Whether or not they were socially tolerated or accepted by any particular culture, the existence of intersex people was known to many ancient and pre-modern cultures. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote of "hermaphroditus" in the first century BCE that Hermaphroditus "is born with a physical body which is a combination of that of a man and that of a woman", and with supernatural properties. [32]      Edward Coke , The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England (1st ed, 1628, title page)    In European societies, Roman law , post-classical canon law , and later common law , referred to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. [33] The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani states that "Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails". [34] [35] [36] The foundation of common law, the 17th Century Institutes of the Lawes of England described how a hermaphrodite could inherit "either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile." [37] [38] Legal cases have been described in canon law and elsewhere over the centuries.  In some non-European societies, sex or gender systems with more than two categories may have allowed for other forms of inclusion of both intersex and transgender people. Such societies have been characterized as "primitive", while Morgan Holmes states that subsequent analysis has been simplistic or romanticized, failing to take account of the ways that subjects of all categories are treated. [39]  During the Victorian era , medical authors introduced the terms " true hermaphrodite " for an individual who has both ovarian and testicular tissue, "male pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with testicular tissue, but either female or ambiguous sexual anatomy, and "female pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with ovarian tissue, but either male or ambiguous sexual anatomy. Some later shifts in terminology have reflected advances in genetics, while other shifts are suggested to be due to pejorative associations. [40]  The term intersexuality was coined by Richard Goldschmidt in 1917. [41] The first suggestion to replace the term 'hermaphrodite' with 'intersex' was made by Cawadias in the 1940s. [42]  Since the rise of modern medical science, some intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals. Surgeons pinpointed intersex babies as a "social emergency" when born. [43] An 'optimal gender policy', initially developed by John Money , stated that early intervention helped avoid gender identity confusion, but this lacks evidence, [44] and early interventions have adverse consequences for psychological and physical health. [22] Since advances in surgery have made it possible for intersex conditions to be concealed, many people are not aware of how frequently intersex conditions arise in human beings or that they occur at all. [45]  Dialog between what were once antagonistic groups of activists and clinicians has led to only slight changes in medical policies and how intersex patients and their families are treated in some locations. [46] In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] Many civil society organizations and human rights institutions now call for an end to unnecessary "normalizing" interventions, including in the Malta declaration . [47] [1]  Human rights and legal issues [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex rights by country  Human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on harmful practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions including, in 2015, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the World Health Organization . These developments have been accompanied by International Intersex Forums and increased cooperation amongst civil society organizations. However, the implementation, codification and enforcement of intersex human rights in national legal systems remains slow.  Areas of concern include: non-consensual medical interventions; stigma, discrimination and equal treatment; access to reparations and justice; access to information and support, and legal recognition.  Physical integrity and bodily autonomy [ edit ]       Legal prohibition of non-consensual medical interventions   Regulatory suspension of non-consensual medical interventions     Main articles: Intersex human rights and Intersex medical interventions  Stigmatization and discrimination from birth may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in east Africa may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a curse. [13] [14] Abandonments and infanticides have been reported in Uganda , [13]  Kenya , [48]  south Asia , [49] and China . [15]  Infants, children and adolescents also experience "normalising" interventions on intersex persons that are medically unnecessary and the unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics. Medical interventions to modify the sex characteristics of intersex people, without the consent of the intersex person have taken place in all countries where the human rights of intersex people have been studied. [50] These interventions have frequently been performed with the consent of the intersex person's parents, when the person is legally too young to consent. Such interventions have been criticized by the World Health Organization, other UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and an increasing number of regional and national institutions due to their adverse consequences, including trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw surgical intervention without consent. [25] [26] In the same year, the Council of Europe became the first institution to state that intersex people have the right not to undergo sex affirmation interventions. [25] [26] [51] [52] [53]  Anti-discrimination and equal treatment [ edit ]       Explicit protection on grounds of sex characteristics   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex status   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex within attribute of sex     Main article: Discrimination against intersex people  Inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law . Because people born with intersex bodies are seen as different, intersex infants, children, adolescents and adults "are often stigmatized and subjected to multiple human rights violations", including discrimination in education, healthcare, employment, sport, and public services. [2] [1] [54] Several countries have so far explicitly protected intersex people from discrimination, with landmarks including South Africa , [26] [55]  Australia , [56] [57] and, most comprehensively, Malta. [58] [59] [60] [61] [62]  Reparations and justice [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Facilitating access to justice and reparations . Access to reparation appears limited, with a scarcity of legal cases, such as the 2011 case of Christiane Völling in Germany . [24] [63] A second case was adjudicated in Chile in 2012, involving a child and his parents. [64] [65] A further successful case in Germany, taken by Michaela Raab, was reported in 2015. [66] In the United States , the "M.C." legal case, advanced by Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth with the Southern Poverty Law Centre is still before the courts. [67] [68]  Information and support [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Access to information , medical records, peer and other counselling and support. With the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, a secrecy-based model was also adopted, in the belief that this was necessary to ensure "normal" physical and psychosocial development. [21] [22] [69] [70] [71] [72]  Legal recognition [ edit ]  Main article: Legal recognition of intersex people  The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions states that legal recognition is firstly "about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women." [23] In some regions, obtaining any form of birth certification may be an issue. A Kenyan court case in 2014 established the right of an intersex boy, "Baby A", to a birth certificate. [73]  Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a certain sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not. [3] [4] [28] [29] Recognition of third sex or gender classifications occurs in several countries, [74] [75] [76] [77] however, it is controversial when it becomes assumed or coercive, as is the case with some German infants . [78] [79] [80] Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third 'X' sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an "X" or "other" option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure. [27] [81]  Language [ edit ]     U.S. intersex activist Pidgeon Pagonis    Research in the late 20th century led to a growing medical consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal, but relatively rare, forms of human biology. [4] [82] [83] [84] Clinician and researcher Milton Diamond stresses the importance of care in the selection of language related to intersex people:   Foremost, we advocate use of the terms "typical", "usual", or "most frequent" where it is more common to use the term "normal." When possible avoid expressions like maldeveloped or undeveloped, errors of development, defective genitals, abnormal, or mistakes of nature. Emphasize that all of these conditions are biologically understandable while they are statistically uncommon. [85]   The term 'intersex' [ edit ]  Some people with intersex traits self-identify as intersex, and some do not. [86] [87] Australian sociological research published in 2016, found that 60% of respondents used the term "intersex" to self-describe their sex characteristics, including people identifying themselves as intersex, describing themselves as having an intersex variation or, in smaller numbers, having an intersex condition. A majority of 75% of survey respondents also self-described as male or female. [27] Respondents also commonly used diagnostic labels and referred to their sex chromosomes, with word choices depending on audience. [27] [81] Research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that 80% of affected Support Group respondents "strongly liked, liked or felt neutral about intersex" as a term, while caregivers were less supportive. [88] The hospital reported that "disorders of sex development" may negatively affect care. [89]  Some intersex organizations reference "intersex people" and "intersex variations or traits" [90] while others use more medicalized language such as "people with intersex conditions", [91] or people "with intersex conditions or DSDs (differences of sex development)" and "children born with variations of sex anatomy". [92] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth published a statement recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  Hermaphrodite [ edit ]  Main article: Hermaphrodite  A hermaphrodite is an organism that has both male and female reproductive organs. Until the mid-20th century, "hermaphrodite" was used synonymously with "intersex". [42] The distinctions "male pseudohermaphrodite", "female pseudohermaphrodite" and especially " true hermaphrodite " [94] are vestiges of outdated 19th-century thinking, reflecting histology (microscopic appearance) of the gonads . [95] [96] [97] Medical terminology has shifted not only due to concerns about language, but also a shift to understandings based on genetics .  Currently, hermaphroditism is not to be confused with intersex, as the former refers only to a specific phenotypical presentation of sex organs and the latter to more complex combination of phenotypical and genotypical presentation. Using "hermaphrodite" to refer to intersex individuals is considered to be stigmatizing and misleading. [98]  Hermaphrodite is used for animal and vegetal species in which the possession of both ovaries and testes is either serial or concurrent, and for living organisms without such gonads but present binary form of reproduction, which is part of the typical life history of those species; intersex has come to be used when this is not the case.  Disorders of sex development [ edit ]  Main article: Disorders of sex development  " Disorders of sex development " (DSD) is a contested term, [9] [10] defined to include congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. Members of the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric  Endocrine Society and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology adopted this term in their "Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders". [12] [44] While it adopted the term, to open "many more doors", the now defunct Intersex Society of North America itself remarked that intersex is not a disorder. [99] Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested the adoption of the terminology and its implied status as a "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who do not feel that there is something wrong with them, regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy. [100]  Sociological research in Australia, published in 2016, found that 3% of respondents used the term "disorders of sex development" or "DSD" to define their sex characteristics, while 21% use the term when accessing medical services. In contrast, 60% used the term "intersex" in some form to self-describe their sex characteristics. [81] U.S. research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that "disorders of sex development" terminology may negatively affect care, give offence, and result in lower attendance at medical clinics. [89] [88]  Alternatives to categorizing intersex conditions as "disorders" have been suggested, including "variations of sex development". [11]  Organisation Intersex International (OII) questions a disease/disability approach, argues for deferral of intervention unless medically necessary, when fully informed consent of the individual involved is possible, and self-determination of sex/gender orientation and identity. [101] The UK Intersex Association is also highly critical of the label 'disorders' and points to the fact that there was minimal involvement of intersex representatives in the debate which led to the change in terminology. [102] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth also published a statement opposing pathologizing language to describe people born with intersex traits, recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  LGBT and LGBTI [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex and LGBT  Intersex can be contrasted with homosexuality or same-sex attraction . Numerous studies have shown higher rates of same sex attraction in intersex people, [103] [104] with a recent Australian study of people born with atypical sex characteristics finding that 52% of respondents were non-heterosexual, [27] [81] thus research on intersex subjects has been used to explore means of preventing homosexuality. [103] [104] However, current studies do not support a statistical correlation between genetic intersex traits and transsexual persons. [105] [106]  Intersex can therefore be contrasted with transgender , [107] which describes the condition in which one's gender identity does not match one's assigned sex. [107] [108] [109] Some people are both intersex and transgender. [110] A 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced gender dysphoria . [28] In an analysis of the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to eliminate intersex traits, Behrmann and Ravitsky state: "Parental choice against intersex may ... conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  The relationship of intersex to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans, and queer communities is complex, [112] but intersex people are often added to LGBT to create an LGBTI community. Emi Koyama describes how inclusion of intersex in LGBTI can fail to address intersex-specific human rights issues, including creating false impressions "that intersex people's rights are protected" by laws protecting LGBT people, and failing to acknowledge that many intersex people are not LGBT. [113]  Organisation Intersex International Australia states that some intersex individuals are same sex attracted, and some are heterosexual, but "LGBTI activism has fought for the rights of people who fall outside of expected binary sex and gender norms." [114] [115]  Julius Kaggwa of SIPD Uganda has written that, while the gay community "offers us a place of relative safety, it is also oblivious to our specific needs". [116]  Mauro Cabral has written that transgender people and organizations "need to stop approaching intersex issues as if they were trans issues" including use of intersex as a means of explaining being transgender; "we can collaborate a lot with the intersex movement by making it clear how wrong that approach is". [117]  Intersex in society [ edit ]     Kristi Bruce after shooting the documentary XXXY , 2000    Fiction and media [ edit ]  Main articles: Literature about intersex and Intersex characters in fiction  An intersex character is the narrator in Jeffrey Eugenides ' Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Middlesex .  Television works about intersex and films about intersex are scarce. The Spanish-language film XXY won the Critics' Week grand prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and the ACID/CCAS Support Award. [118]  Faking It is notable for providing the first intersex main character in a television show, [119] and television's first intersex character played by an intersex actor. [120]  Civil society institutions [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex civil society organizations  Intersex peer support and advocacy organizations have existed since at least 1985, with the establishment of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia in 1985. [121] The Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (UK) established in 1988. [122] The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) may have been one of the first intersex civil society organizations to have been open to people regardless of diagnosis; it was active from 1993 to 2008. [123]  Events [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex Awareness Day and Intersex Day of Remembrance  Intersex Awareness Day is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight the challenges faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 26 October. It marks the first public demonstration by intersex people, which took place in Boston on October 26, 1996, outside a venue where the American Academy of Pediatrics was holding its annual conference. [124]  Intersex Day of Remembrance , also known as Intersex Solidarity Day, is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight issues faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 8 November. It marks the birthday of Herculine Barbin , a French intersex person whose memoirs were later published by Michel Foucault in Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite .  Flag [ edit ]     Intersex Pride flag    Main article: Intersex flag  The intersex flag was created by Organisation Intersex International Australia in July 2013 to create a flag "that is not derivative, but is yet firmly grounded in meaning". The organization aimed to create a symbol without gendered pink and blue colors. It describes yellow and purple as " hermaphrodite " colors. The organization describes it as freely available "for use by any intersex person or organization who wishes to use it, in a human rights affirming community context". [125]  Religion [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex people and religion  In Hinduism , Sangam literature uses the word pedi to refer to people born with an intersex condition; it also refers to antharlinga hijras and various other hijras . [126] Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded but provokes parental fear. [49]  In Islam , scholars of Islamic jurisprudence have detailed discussions on the status and rights of intersex based on what mainly exhibits in their external sexual organs. Yet, modern Islamic jurisprudence scholars turn to medical screening to determine the dominance of their sex. The intersex rights includes rights of inheritance, rights to marriage, rights to live like any other male or female. The rights are generally based on whether they are true hermaphrodites, or pseudo hermaphrodite. Scholars of Islamic jurisprudence generally consider their rights based on the majority of what appears from their external sexual organs. [ citation needed ]  In Judaism , the Talmud contains extensive discussion concerning the status of two intersex types in Jewish law; namely the androginus , which exhibits both male and female external sexual organs, and the tumtum which exhibits neither. In the 1970s and 1980s, the treatment of intersex babies started to be discussed in Orthodox Jewish medical halacha by prominent rabbinic leaders, for example Eliezer Waldenberg and Moshe Feinstein . [127]  Sport [ edit ]      Stanisława Walasiewicz (Stella Walsh) in 1933    Main article: Sex verification in sports  Multiple athletes have been humiliated, excluded from competition or been forced to return medals following discovery of an intersex trait. Examples include Erik Schinegger , Foekje Dillema , Maria José Martínez-Patiño and Santhi Soundarajan . In contrast, Stanisława Walasiewicz (also known as Stella Walsh) was the subject of posthumous controversy. [128]  The South African middle-distance runner Caster Semenya won gold at the World Championships in the women's 800 meter and won silver in the 2012 Summer Olympics. When Semenya won gold in the World Championships, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) requested sex verification tests. The results were not released, but Semenya was cleared to race with other women. [129]  Katrina Karkazis , Rebecca Jordan-Young , Georgiann Davis and Silvia Camporesi argued that new IAAF policies on "hyperandrogenism" in female athletes (applied for example to the case of Dutee Chand ), established in response to the Semenya case, are "significantly flawed", arguing that the policy will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify "gender policing". They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender. [130]  In April 2014, the BMJ reported that four elite women athletes with 5-ARD were subjected to sterilization and "partial clitoridectomies" in order to compete in sport. The authors noted that "partial clitoridectomy" was "not medically indicated, does not relate to real or perceived athletic "advantage". [17] Intersex advocates regard this intervention as "a clearly coercive process". [131] In 2016, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on health, Dainius Pūras, criticized "current and historic" sex verification policies, describing how "a number of athletes have undergone gonadectomy (removal of reproductive organs) and partial clitoridectomy (a form of female genital mutilation ) in the absence of symptoms or health issues warranting those procedures." [132]  Population figures [ edit ]  There are few firm estimates of the number of intersex people. While human rights institutions have called for the demedicalisation of intersex traits, as far as possible, [21] [51] [133] [134] medical definitions are often still used. The now-defunct Intersex Society of North America stated that:   If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won't show up until later in life. [135]   According to Blackless, Fausto-Sterling et al., 1.7 percent of human births are intersex, including variations that may not become apparent until, for example, puberty, or until attempting to conceive. [136] [137] Some clinicians do not favor such definitions. According to Leonard Sax, intersex should be "restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female", around 0.018%. This definition excludes Klinefelter syndrome and many other variations. [138] He in turn criticizes Fausto-Sterling for counting Late-Onset Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia for 88% of her figure. His rebuttal concludes,   "The most original feature of Fausto-Sterling's book is her reluctance to classify true intersex conditions as pathological (Fausto-Sterling, 2000, p. 113) ... She often uses the word natural synonymously with normal. However, natural and normal are not synonyms. A cow may give birth to a two-headed or Siamese calf by natural processes, natural being understood as per Fausto-Sterling's definition as "produced by nature." Nevertheless, that two-headed calf unarguably manifests an abnormal condition. Fausto-Sterling's insistence that all combinations of sexual anatomy be regarded as normal... follows that classifications of normal and abnormal sexual anatomy are mere social conventions, prejudices which can and should be set aside by an enlightened intelligentsia. This type of extreme social constructionism is confusing and is not helpful to clinicians, to their patients, or to their patients' families. Diluting the term intersex to include "any deviation from the Platonic ideal of sexual dimorphism" (Blackless et al., 2000, p. 152), as Fausto-Sterling suggests, deprives the term of any clinically useful meaning." [139]   However, many conditions excluded from Sax's analysis are currently regarded as disorders of sex development . Individuals with those diagnoses may experience stigma and discrimination due to their sex characteristics, including sex "normalizing" interventions, and so those diagnoses and life experiences meet definitions of intersex in use by UN and other bodies. As a result, the statistical analyses by Blackless and Fausto-Sterling, despite her outdated and perceived offensive use of the term hermaphrodite, [140] have become widely quoted, [51] [141] including by other clinicians. [142] The following summarizes those frequency statistics:    Sex Variation  Frequency    Not XX, XY, Klinefelter, or Turner  one in 1,666 births    Klinefelter syndrome (XXY)  one in 1,000 births    Turner syndrome (45,X)  one in 2,710 births [143]    Androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 13,000 births    Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 130,000 births    Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia  one in 13,000 births    Late onset adrenal hyperplasia  one in 10,000 births. [144]    Vaginal agenesis  one in 6,000 births    Ovotestes  one in 83,000 births    Idiopathic (no discernable medical cause)  one in 110,000 births    Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment, e.g. progestin administered to pregnant mother)  No estimate    5-alpha-reductase deficiency  No estimate    Mixed gonadal dysgenesis  No estimate    MRKH Syndrome  1 in 4,500-5,000 births    Complete gonadal dysgenesis  one in 150,000 births    Hypospadias (urethral opening in perineum or along penile shaft)  one in 250 births [145]    Epispadias (urethral opening between corona and tip of glans penis)  one in 117,000 births [146]    Population figures can vary due to genetic causes. In the Dominican Republic , 5-alpha-reductase deficiency is not uncommon in the town of Las Salinas resulting in social acceptance of the intersex trait. [147] Men with the trait are called "guevedoces" (Spanish for "eggs at twelve"). 12 out of 13 families had one or more male family members that carried the gene. The overall incidence for the town was 1 in every 90 males were carriers, with other males either non-carriers or non-affected carriers. [148]  Medical classifications [ edit ]  Signs [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia may appear as a large clitoris or as a small penis.     The Quigley scale is a method for describing genital development in AIS.    Because there is variation in all of the processes of the development of the sex organs , a child can be born with a sexual anatomy that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average clitoris ( clitoral hypertrophy ) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average penis that is open along the underside. The appearance may be quite ambiguous, describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia, or as male genitals with a very small penis, completely open along the midline (" hypospadic "), and empty scrotum. Fertility is variable.  Measurement systems [ edit ]  The Orchidometer is a medical instrument to measure the volume of the testicles. It was developed by Swiss pediatric endocrinologist Andrea Prader . The Prader scale [149] and Quigley scale are visual rating systems that measure genital appearance.  Other signs [ edit ]  In order to help in classification, methods other than a genitalia inspection can be performed. For instance, a karyotype display of a tissue sample may determine which of the causes of intersex is prevalent in the case.  Causes [ edit ]  Main article: Sexual differentiation  The common pathway of sexual differentiation , where a productive human female has an XX chromosome pair, and a productive male has an XY pair, is relevant to the development of intersex conditions.  During fertilization, the sperm adds either an X (female) or a Y (male) chromosome to the X in the ovum. This determines the genetic sex of the embryo. [150] During the first weeks of development, genetic male and female fetuses are "anatomically indistinguishable", with primitive gonads beginning to develop during approximately the sixth week of gestation. The gonads, in a "bipotential state", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events. [150] Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.  At around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In normal female differentiation, the Müllerian duct system develops into the uterus , Fallopian tubes , and inner third of the vagina. In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone MIH causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the Wolffian duct system , which develops into the vas deferens , seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts. [150] By birth, the typical fetus has been completely "sexed" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.  Conditions [ edit ]  Further information: disorders of sex development  There are a variety of opinions on what conditions or traits are and are not intersex, dependent on the definition of intersex that is used. Current human rights based definitions stress a broad diversity of sex characteristics that differ from expectations for male or female bodies. [2] During 2015, the Council of Europe , [51] the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights [133] and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights [134] have called for a review of medical classifications on the basis that they presently impede enjoyment of the right to health ; the Council of Europe expressed concern that "the gap between the expectations of human rights organisations of intersex people and the development of medical classifications has possibly widened over the past decade". [51] [133] [134]    List of conditions    Sex chromosomes  Name  Description    XX  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  The most common cause of sexual ambiguity is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands produce abnormally high levels of virilizing hormones in utero. The genes that cause CAH can now be detected in the developing embryo. As Fausto-Sterling mentioned in chapter 3 of Sexing the Body , "a woman who suspects she may be pregnant with a CAH baby (if she or someone in her family carries CAH) can undergo treatment and then get tested." To prevent an XX-CAH child's genitalia from becoming masculinized, a treatment, which includes the use of the steroid dexamethasone, must begin as early as four weeks after formation. Many do not favor this process because "the safety of this experimental therapy has not been established in rigorously controlled trials", it does allow physicians to detect abnormalities, therefore starting treatment right after birth. Starting treatment as soon as an XX-CAH baby is born not only minimizes, but also may even eliminate the chances of genital surgery from being performed. [137] However, the necessity of such surgery itself is disputed. Meta-analysis of the studies supporting the use of dexamethasone on CAH at-risk fetuses found "less than one half of one percent of published 'studies' of this intervention were regarded as being of high enough quality to provide meaningful data for a meta-analysis. Even these four studies were of low quality" ... "in ways so slipshod as to breach professional standards of medical ethics" [151] and "there were no data on long-term follow-up of physical and metabolic outcomes in children exposed to dexamethasone". [152]  In XX-females, this can range from partial masculinization that produces a large clitoris, to virilization and male appearance. The latter applies in particular to congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency , which is the most common form of CAH.  Individuals born with XX chromosomes affected by 17α-hydroxylase deficiency are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.  See below for XY CAH 17α-hydroxylase deficiency.     XX  Progestin-induced virilisation  In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by the use of progestin , a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals normally have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males. [153]    XX  Freemartinism  This condition occurs commonly in all species of cattle and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the placentae of fraternal twins usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a freemartin is very like a normal female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a castrated male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs – in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop normally as in other mammals.    XY  Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)  People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees. Cases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a vagina and no uterus , cervix , or ovaries , and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.  In mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as clitoromegaly , or a small penis, which is called micropenis or microphallus; hypospadias and cryptorchidism may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.     XY  5-alpha-reductase deficiency (5-ARD)  The condition affects individuals with a Y chromosome , making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS. [154] Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth. Such individuals are usually raised as girls. The lack of DHT also limits the development of facial hair.    XY  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  In individuals with a Y chromosome (typically XY) who have Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency , CAH inhibits virilization, unlike cases without a Y chromosome.    XY  Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS)  The child has XY chromosomes typical of a male. The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce Müllerian inhibiting factor during fetal development.    XY  Anorchia  Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce gametes necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to gender dysphoria , as anorchic individuals are typically assigned male at birth .    XY  Gonadal dysgenesis  It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whose gonads don't develop properly. Clinical features are heterogeneous. [137]    XY  Hypospadias  It is caused by various causes, including alterations in testosterone metabolism. The urethra does not run to the tip of the penis. In mild forms, the opening is just shy of the tip; in moderate forms, it is along the shaft; and in severe forms, it may open at the base of the penis. [155]    Other  Unusual chromosomal sex  In addition to the most common XX and XY chromosomal sexes, there are several other possible combinations, for example Turner syndrome ( XO ), Triple X syndrome (XXX), Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) and variants ( XXYY , XXXY , XXXXY ), XYY syndrome , de la Chapelle syndrome ( XX male ), Swyer syndrome (XY female).    Other  Mosaicism and chimerism  A mix can occur, where some of the cells of the body have the common XX or XY, while some have one of the less usual chromosomal contents above. Such a mixture is caused by either mosaicism or chimerism . In mosaicism, the mixture is caused by a mutation in one of the cells of the embryo after fertilization, whereas chimerism is a fusion of two embryos. In alternative fashion, it is simply a mixture between XX and XY, and does not have to involve any less-common genotypes in individual cells. This, too, can occur both as chimerism and as a result of one sex chromosome having mutated into the other. [156]  Mosaicism and chimerism may involve chromosomes other than the sex chromosomes, and not result in intersex traits.     Other  True hermaphroditism and ovotestis  A " true hermaphrodite " is defined as someone with both testicular and ovarian tissue. Though naturally occurring true hermaphroditism in humans is unknown, there is, on the other hand, a spectrum of forms of ovotestes . The varieties include having two ovotestes or one ovary and one ovotestis, often in the form of streak gonads . Phenotype is not determinable from the ovotestes; in some cases, the appearance is "fairly typically female"; in others, it is "fairly typically male", and it may also be "fairly in-between in terms of genital development." [157] Intersex activist Cheryl Chase is an example of someone with ovotestes. [158]    Medical interventions [ edit ]     Hong Kong intersex activist Small Luk    Main article: Intersex medical interventions  Further information: History of intersex surgery  Rationales [ edit ]  Medical interventions take place to address physical health concerns, and psychosocial risks. Both types of rationale are the subject of debate, particularly as the consequences of surgical (and many hormonal) interventions are lifelong and irreversible. Questions regarding physical health include accurately assessing risk levels, necessity and timing. Psychosocial rationales are particularly susceptible to questions of necessity as they reflect social and cultural concerns.  There remains no clinical consensus about an evidence base, surgical timing, necessity, type of surgical intervention, and degree of difference warranting intervention. [159] [160] [161] Such surgeries are the subject of significant contention due to consequences that include trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] This includes community activism, [40] and multiple reports by international human rights [19] [51] [23] [162] and health [72] institutions and national ethics bodies. [22] [163]  In the cases where gonads may pose a cancer risk, as in some cases of androgen insensitivity syndrome , [164] concern has been expressed that treatment rationales and decision-making regarding cancer risk may encapsulate decisions around a desire for surgical normalization. [21]  Types [ edit ]   Feminizing and masculinizing surgeries : Surgical procedures depend on diagnosis, and there is often concern as to whether surgery should be performed at all. Typically, surgery is performed shortly after birth. Defenders of the practice argue that it is necessary for individuals to be clearly identified as male or female in order for them to function socially and develop normally. Psychosocial reasons are often stated. [12] This is criticised by many human rights institutions, and authors. Unlike other aesthetic surgical procedures performed on infants, such as corrective surgery for a cleft lip , genital surgery may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life, or feelings of freakishness and unacceptability. [165]  Hormone treatment : There is widespread evidence of prenatal testing and hormone treatment to prevent or eliminate intersex traits, [166] [167] associated also with the problematization of sexual orientation and gender non-conformity. [166] [168]  Psychosocial support : All stakeholders support psychosocial support. A joint international statement by participants at the Third International Intersex Forum in 2013 sought, amongst other demands: "Recognition that medicalization and stigmatisation of intersex people result in significant trauma and mental health concerns. In view of ensuring the bodily integrity and well-being of intersex people, autonomous non-pathologising psycho-social and peer support be available to intersex people throughout their life (as self-required), as well as to parents and/or care providers."  Genetic selection and terminations : The ethics of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to select against intersex traits was the subject of 11 papers in the October 2013 issue of the American Journal of Bioethics . [169] There is widespread evidence of pregnancy terminations arising from prenatal testing, as well as prenatal hormone treatment to prevent intersex traits. Behrmann and Ravitsky find social concepts of sex, gender and sexual orientation to be "intertwined on many levels. Parental choice against intersex may thus conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  Gender dysphoria : The DSM-5 included a change from using gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria. This revised code now specifically includes intersex people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth and experience clinically significant distress or impairment, using the language of disorders of sex development . [170] This move was criticised by intersex advocacy groups in Australia and New Zealand . [171]  Medical photography and display : Photographs of intersex children's genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes. Problems associated with medical photography of intersex children have been discussed due to experiences of humiliation and powerlessness by child subjects, [172] along with their ethics, control and usage.

[1] [2] Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female . [3] [4]  Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites , "congenital eunuchs", [5] [6] or congenitally "frigid". [7] Such terms have fallen out of favor; in particular, the term "hermaphrodite" is considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious. [8] Medical description of intersex traits as disorders of sex development has been controversial [9] [10] [11] since the label was introduced in 2006. [12]  Intersex people may face stigmatization and discrimination from birth or discovery of an intersex trait. This may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. [13] [14] [15] Globally, some intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, are surgically or hormonally altered to create more socially acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of good outcomes. [16] Such treatments may involve sterilization . Adults, including elite female athletes, have also been subjects of such treatment. [17] [18] Increasingly these issues are considered human rights abuses, with statements from international [19] [20] and national human rights and ethics institutions. [21] [22] Intersex organizations have also issued statements about human rights violations, including the Malta declaration of the third International Intersex Forum . [23]  In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] [26]  Some intersex persons may be assigned and raised as a girl or boy but then identify with another gender later in life, while most continue to identify with their assigned sex.

Odiele disclosed that she has the intersex trait androgen insensitivity syndrome in 2017    According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights :   Intersex people are born with sex characteristics (including genitals, gonads and chromosome patterns) that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies.  Intersex is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of natural bodily variations. In some cases, intersex traits are visible at birth while in others, they are not apparent until puberty. Some chromosomal intersex variations may not be physically apparent at all. [2]   In biological terms, sex may be determined by a number of factors present at birth, including: [30]   the number and type of sex chromosomes ;  the type of gonads —ovaries or testicles;  the sex hormones ;  the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the uterus in females); and  the external genitalia.   People whose characteristics are not either all typically male or all typically female at birth are intersex. [31]  Some intersex traits are not always visible at birth; some babies may be born with ambiguous genitals, while others may have ambiguous internal organs (testes and ovaries). Others will not become aware that they are intersex unless they receive genetic testing, because it does not manifest in their phenotype.  History [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex in history , Timeline of intersex history , and History of intersex surgery      Hermaphroditus in a wall painting from Herculaneum (first half of the 1st century AD)    Whether or not they were socially tolerated or accepted by any particular culture, the existence of intersex people was known to many ancient and pre-modern cultures. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote of "hermaphroditus" in the first century BCE that Hermaphroditus "is born with a physical body which is a combination of that of a man and that of a woman", and with supernatural properties. [32]      Edward Coke , The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England (1st ed, 1628, title page)    In European societies, Roman law , post-classical canon law , and later common law , referred to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. [33] The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani states that "Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails". [34] [35] [36] The foundation of common law, the 17th Century Institutes of the Lawes of England described how a hermaphrodite could inherit "either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile." [37] [38] Legal cases have been described in canon law and elsewhere over the centuries.  In some non-European societies, sex or gender systems with more than two categories may have allowed for other forms of inclusion of both intersex and transgender people. Such societies have been characterized as "primitive", while Morgan Holmes states that subsequent analysis has been simplistic or romanticized, failing to take account of the ways that subjects of all categories are treated. [39]  During the Victorian era , medical authors introduced the terms " true hermaphrodite " for an individual who has both ovarian and testicular tissue, "male pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with testicular tissue, but either female or ambiguous sexual anatomy, and "female pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with ovarian tissue, but either male or ambiguous sexual anatomy. Some later shifts in terminology have reflected advances in genetics, while other shifts are suggested to be due to pejorative associations. [40]  The term intersexuality was coined by Richard Goldschmidt in 1917. [41] The first suggestion to replace the term 'hermaphrodite' with 'intersex' was made by Cawadias in the 1940s. [42]  Since the rise of modern medical science, some intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals. Surgeons pinpointed intersex babies as a "social emergency" when born. [43] An 'optimal gender policy', initially developed by John Money , stated that early intervention helped avoid gender identity confusion, but this lacks evidence, [44] and early interventions have adverse consequences for psychological and physical health. [22] Since advances in surgery have made it possible for intersex conditions to be concealed, many people are not aware of how frequently intersex conditions arise in human beings or that they occur at all. [45]  Dialog between what were once antagonistic groups of activists and clinicians has led to only slight changes in medical policies and how intersex patients and their families are treated in some locations. [46] In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] Many civil society organizations and human rights institutions now call for an end to unnecessary "normalizing" interventions, including in the Malta declaration . [47] [1]  Human rights and legal issues [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex rights by country  Human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on harmful practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions including, in 2015, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the World Health Organization . These developments have been accompanied by International Intersex Forums and increased cooperation amongst civil society organizations. However, the implementation, codification and enforcement of intersex human rights in national legal systems remains slow.  Areas of concern include: non-consensual medical interventions; stigma, discrimination and equal treatment; access to reparations and justice; access to information and support, and legal recognition.  Physical integrity and bodily autonomy [ edit ]       Legal prohibition of non-consensual medical interventions   Regulatory suspension of non-consensual medical interventions     Main articles: Intersex human rights and Intersex medical interventions  Stigmatization and discrimination from birth may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in east Africa may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a curse. [13] [14] Abandonments and infanticides have been reported in Uganda , [13]  Kenya , [48]  south Asia , [49] and China . [15]  Infants, children and adolescents also experience "normalising" interventions on intersex persons that are medically unnecessary and the unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics. Medical interventions to modify the sex characteristics of intersex people, without the consent of the intersex person have taken place in all countries where the human rights of intersex people have been studied. [50] These interventions have frequently been performed with the consent of the intersex person's parents, when the person is legally too young to consent. Such interventions have been criticized by the World Health Organization, other UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and an increasing number of regional and national institutions due to their adverse consequences, including trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw surgical intervention without consent. [25] [26] In the same year, the Council of Europe became the first institution to state that intersex people have the right not to undergo sex affirmation interventions. [25] [26] [51] [52] [53]  Anti-discrimination and equal treatment [ edit ]       Explicit protection on grounds of sex characteristics   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex status   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex within attribute of sex     Main article: Discrimination against intersex people  Inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law . Because people born with intersex bodies are seen as different, intersex infants, children, adolescents and adults "are often stigmatized and subjected to multiple human rights violations", including discrimination in education, healthcare, employment, sport, and public services. [2] [1] [54] Several countries have so far explicitly protected intersex people from discrimination, with landmarks including South Africa , [26] [55]  Australia , [56] [57] and, most comprehensively, Malta. [58] [59] [60] [61] [62]  Reparations and justice [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Facilitating access to justice and reparations . Access to reparation appears limited, with a scarcity of legal cases, such as the 2011 case of Christiane Völling in Germany . [24] [63] A second case was adjudicated in Chile in 2012, involving a child and his parents. [64] [65] A further successful case in Germany, taken by Michaela Raab, was reported in 2015. [66] In the United States , the "M.C." legal case, advanced by Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth with the Southern Poverty Law Centre is still before the courts. [67] [68]  Information and support [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Access to information , medical records, peer and other counselling and support. With the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, a secrecy-based model was also adopted, in the belief that this was necessary to ensure "normal" physical and psychosocial development. [21] [22] [69] [70] [71] [72]  Legal recognition [ edit ]  Main article: Legal recognition of intersex people  The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions states that legal recognition is firstly "about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women." [23] In some regions, obtaining any form of birth certification may be an issue. A Kenyan court case in 2014 established the right of an intersex boy, "Baby A", to a birth certificate. [73]  Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a certain sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not. [3] [4] [28] [29] Recognition of third sex or gender classifications occurs in several countries, [74] [75] [76] [77] however, it is controversial when it becomes assumed or coercive, as is the case with some German infants . [78] [79] [80] Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third 'X' sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an "X" or "other" option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure. [27] [81]  Language [ edit ]     U.S. intersex activist Pidgeon Pagonis    Research in the late 20th century led to a growing medical consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal, but relatively rare, forms of human biology. [4] [82] [83] [84] Clinician and researcher Milton Diamond stresses the importance of care in the selection of language related to intersex people:   Foremost, we advocate use of the terms "typical", "usual", or "most frequent" where it is more common to use the term "normal." When possible avoid expressions like maldeveloped or undeveloped, errors of development, defective genitals, abnormal, or mistakes of nature. Emphasize that all of these conditions are biologically understandable while they are statistically uncommon. [85]   The term 'intersex' [ edit ]  Some people with intersex traits self-identify as intersex, and some do not. [86] [87] Australian sociological research published in 2016, found that 60% of respondents used the term "intersex" to self-describe their sex characteristics, including people identifying themselves as intersex, describing themselves as having an intersex variation or, in smaller numbers, having an intersex condition. A majority of 75% of survey respondents also self-described as male or female. [27] Respondents also commonly used diagnostic labels and referred to their sex chromosomes, with word choices depending on audience. [27] [81] Research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that 80% of affected Support Group respondents "strongly liked, liked or felt neutral about intersex" as a term, while caregivers were less supportive. [88] The hospital reported that "disorders of sex development" may negatively affect care. [89]  Some intersex organizations reference "intersex people" and "intersex variations or traits" [90] while others use more medicalized language such as "people with intersex conditions", [91] or people "with intersex conditions or DSDs (differences of sex development)" and "children born with variations of sex anatomy". [92] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth published a statement recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  Hermaphrodite [ edit ]  Main article: Hermaphrodite  A hermaphrodite is an organism that has both male and female reproductive organs. Until the mid-20th century, "hermaphrodite" was used synonymously with "intersex". [42] The distinctions "male pseudohermaphrodite", "female pseudohermaphrodite" and especially " true hermaphrodite " [94] are vestiges of outdated 19th-century thinking, reflecting histology (microscopic appearance) of the gonads . [95] [96] [97] Medical terminology has shifted not only due to concerns about language, but also a shift to understandings based on genetics .  Currently, hermaphroditism is not to be confused with intersex, as the former refers only to a specific phenotypical presentation of sex organs and the latter to more complex combination of phenotypical and genotypical presentation. Using "hermaphrodite" to refer to intersex individuals is considered to be stigmatizing and misleading. [98]  Hermaphrodite is used for animal and vegetal species in which the possession of both ovaries and testes is either serial or concurrent, and for living organisms without such gonads but present binary form of reproduction, which is part of the typical life history of those species; intersex has come to be used when this is not the case.  Disorders of sex development [ edit ]  Main article: Disorders of sex development  " Disorders of sex development " (DSD) is a contested term, [9] [10] defined to include congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. Members of the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric  Endocrine Society and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology adopted this term in their "Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders". [12] [44] While it adopted the term, to open "many more doors", the now defunct Intersex Society of North America itself remarked that intersex is not a disorder. [99] Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested the adoption of the terminology and its implied status as a "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who do not feel that there is something wrong with them, regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy. [100]  Sociological research in Australia, published in 2016, found that 3% of respondents used the term "disorders of sex development" or "DSD" to define their sex characteristics, while 21% use the term when accessing medical services. In contrast, 60% used the term "intersex" in some form to self-describe their sex characteristics. [81] U.S. research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that "disorders of sex development" terminology may negatively affect care, give offence, and result in lower attendance at medical clinics. [89] [88]  Alternatives to categorizing intersex conditions as "disorders" have been suggested, including "variations of sex development". [11]  Organisation Intersex International (OII) questions a disease/disability approach, argues for deferral of intervention unless medically necessary, when fully informed consent of the individual involved is possible, and self-determination of sex/gender orientation and identity. [101] The UK Intersex Association is also highly critical of the label 'disorders' and points to the fact that there was minimal involvement of intersex representatives in the debate which led to the change in terminology. [102] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth also published a statement opposing pathologizing language to describe people born with intersex traits, recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  LGBT and LGBTI [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex and LGBT  Intersex can be contrasted with homosexuality or same-sex attraction . Numerous studies have shown higher rates of same sex attraction in intersex people, [103] [104] with a recent Australian study of people born with atypical sex characteristics finding that 52% of respondents were non-heterosexual, [27] [81] thus research on intersex subjects has been used to explore means of preventing homosexuality. [103] [104] However, current studies do not support a statistical correlation between genetic intersex traits and transsexual persons. [105] [106]  Intersex can therefore be contrasted with transgender , [107] which describes the condition in which one's gender identity does not match one's assigned sex. [107] [108] [109] Some people are both intersex and transgender. [110] A 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced gender dysphoria . [28] In an analysis of the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to eliminate intersex traits, Behrmann and Ravitsky state: "Parental choice against intersex may ... conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  The relationship of intersex to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans, and queer communities is complex, [112] but intersex people are often added to LGBT to create an LGBTI community. Emi Koyama describes how inclusion of intersex in LGBTI can fail to address intersex-specific human rights issues, including creating false impressions "that intersex people's rights are protected" by laws protecting LGBT people, and failing to acknowledge that many intersex people are not LGBT. [113]  Organisation Intersex International Australia states that some intersex individuals are same sex attracted, and some are heterosexual, but "LGBTI activism has fought for the rights of people who fall outside of expected binary sex and gender norms." [114] [115]  Julius Kaggwa of SIPD Uganda has written that, while the gay community "offers us a place of relative safety, it is also oblivious to our specific needs". [116]  Mauro Cabral has written that transgender people and organizations "need to stop approaching intersex issues as if they were trans issues" including use of intersex as a means of explaining being transgender; "we can collaborate a lot with the intersex movement by making it clear how wrong that approach is". [117]  Intersex in society [ edit ]     Kristi Bruce after shooting the documentary XXXY , 2000    Fiction and media [ edit ]  Main articles: Literature about intersex and Intersex characters in fiction  An intersex character is the narrator in Jeffrey Eugenides ' Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Middlesex .  Television works about intersex and films about intersex are scarce. The Spanish-language film XXY won the Critics' Week grand prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and the ACID/CCAS Support Award. [118]  Faking It is notable for providing the first intersex main character in a television show, [119] and television's first intersex character played by an intersex actor. [120]  Civil society institutions [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex civil society organizations  Intersex peer support and advocacy organizations have existed since at least 1985, with the establishment of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia in 1985. [121] The Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (UK) established in 1988. [122] The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) may have been one of the first intersex civil society organizations to have been open to people regardless of diagnosis; it was active from 1993 to 2008. [123]  Events [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex Awareness Day and Intersex Day of Remembrance  Intersex Awareness Day is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight the challenges faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 26 October. It marks the first public demonstration by intersex people, which took place in Boston on October 26, 1996, outside a venue where the American Academy of Pediatrics was holding its annual conference. [124]  Intersex Day of Remembrance , also known as Intersex Solidarity Day, is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight issues faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 8 November. It marks the birthday of Herculine Barbin , a French intersex person whose memoirs were later published by Michel Foucault in Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite .  Flag [ edit ]     Intersex Pride flag    Main article: Intersex flag  The intersex flag was created by Organisation Intersex International Australia in July 2013 to create a flag "that is not derivative, but is yet firmly grounded in meaning". The organization aimed to create a symbol without gendered pink and blue colors. It describes yellow and purple as " hermaphrodite " colors. The organization describes it as freely available "for use by any intersex person or organization who wishes to use it, in a human rights affirming community context". [125]  Religion [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex people and religion  In Hinduism , Sangam literature uses the word pedi to refer to people born with an intersex condition; it also refers to antharlinga hijras and various other hijras . [126] Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded but provokes parental fear. [49]  In Islam , scholars of Islamic jurisprudence have detailed discussions on the status and rights of intersex based on what mainly exhibits in their external sexual organs. Yet, modern Islamic jurisprudence scholars turn to medical screening to determine the dominance of their sex. The intersex rights includes rights of inheritance, rights to marriage, rights to live like any other male or female. The rights are generally based on whether they are true hermaphrodites, or pseudo hermaphrodite. Scholars of Islamic jurisprudence generally consider their rights based on the majority of what appears from their external sexual organs. [ citation needed ]  In Judaism , the Talmud contains extensive discussion concerning the status of two intersex types in Jewish law; namely the androginus , which exhibits both male and female external sexual organs, and the tumtum which exhibits neither. In the 1970s and 1980s, the treatment of intersex babies started to be discussed in Orthodox Jewish medical halacha by prominent rabbinic leaders, for example Eliezer Waldenberg and Moshe Feinstein . [127]  Sport [ edit ]      Stanisława Walasiewicz (Stella Walsh) in 1933    Main article: Sex verification in sports  Multiple athletes have been humiliated, excluded from competition or been forced to return medals following discovery of an intersex trait. Examples include Erik Schinegger , Foekje Dillema , Maria José Martínez-Patiño and Santhi Soundarajan . In contrast, Stanisława Walasiewicz (also known as Stella Walsh) was the subject of posthumous controversy. [128]  The South African middle-distance runner Caster Semenya won gold at the World Championships in the women's 800 meter and won silver in the 2012 Summer Olympics. When Semenya won gold in the World Championships, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) requested sex verification tests. The results were not released, but Semenya was cleared to race with other women. [129]  Katrina Karkazis , Rebecca Jordan-Young , Georgiann Davis and Silvia Camporesi argued that new IAAF policies on "hyperandrogenism" in female athletes (applied for example to the case of Dutee Chand ), established in response to the Semenya case, are "significantly flawed", arguing that the policy will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify "gender policing". They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender. [130]  In April 2014, the BMJ reported that four elite women athletes with 5-ARD were subjected to sterilization and "partial clitoridectomies" in order to compete in sport. The authors noted that "partial clitoridectomy" was "not medically indicated, does not relate to real or perceived athletic "advantage". [17] Intersex advocates regard this intervention as "a clearly coercive process". [131] In 2016, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on health, Dainius Pūras, criticized "current and historic" sex verification policies, describing how "a number of athletes have undergone gonadectomy (removal of reproductive organs) and partial clitoridectomy (a form of female genital mutilation ) in the absence of symptoms or health issues warranting those procedures." [132]  Population figures [ edit ]  There are few firm estimates of the number of intersex people. While human rights institutions have called for the demedicalisation of intersex traits, as far as possible, [21] [51] [133] [134] medical definitions are often still used. The now-defunct Intersex Society of North America stated that:   If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won't show up until later in life. [135]   According to Blackless, Fausto-Sterling et al., 1.7 percent of human births are intersex, including variations that may not become apparent until, for example, puberty, or until attempting to conceive. [136] [137] Some clinicians do not favor such definitions. According to Leonard Sax, intersex should be "restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female", around 0.018%. This definition excludes Klinefelter syndrome and many other variations. [138] He in turn criticizes Fausto-Sterling for counting Late-Onset Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia for 88% of her figure. His rebuttal concludes,   "The most original feature of Fausto-Sterling's book is her reluctance to classify true intersex conditions as pathological (Fausto-Sterling, 2000, p. 113) ... She often uses the word natural synonymously with normal. However, natural and normal are not synonyms. A cow may give birth to a two-headed or Siamese calf by natural processes, natural being understood as per Fausto-Sterling's definition as "produced by nature." Nevertheless, that two-headed calf unarguably manifests an abnormal condition. Fausto-Sterling's insistence that all combinations of sexual anatomy be regarded as normal... follows that classifications of normal and abnormal sexual anatomy are mere social conventions, prejudices which can and should be set aside by an enlightened intelligentsia. This type of extreme social constructionism is confusing and is not helpful to clinicians, to their patients, or to their patients' families. Diluting the term intersex to include "any deviation from the Platonic ideal of sexual dimorphism" (Blackless et al., 2000, p. 152), as Fausto-Sterling suggests, deprives the term of any clinically useful meaning." [139]   However, many conditions excluded from Sax's analysis are currently regarded as disorders of sex development . Individuals with those diagnoses may experience stigma and discrimination due to their sex characteristics, including sex "normalizing" interventions, and so those diagnoses and life experiences meet definitions of intersex in use by UN and other bodies. As a result, the statistical analyses by Blackless and Fausto-Sterling, despite her outdated and perceived offensive use of the term hermaphrodite, [140] have become widely quoted, [51] [141] including by other clinicians. [142] The following summarizes those frequency statistics:    Sex Variation  Frequency    Not XX, XY, Klinefelter, or Turner  one in 1,666 births    Klinefelter syndrome (XXY)  one in 1,000 births    Turner syndrome (45,X)  one in 2,710 births [143]    Androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 13,000 births    Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 130,000 births    Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia  one in 13,000 births    Late onset adrenal hyperplasia  one in 10,000 births. [144]    Vaginal agenesis  one in 6,000 births    Ovotestes  one in 83,000 births    Idiopathic (no discernable medical cause)  one in 110,000 births    Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment, e.g. progestin administered to pregnant mother)  No estimate    5-alpha-reductase deficiency  No estimate    Mixed gonadal dysgenesis  No estimate    MRKH Syndrome  1 in 4,500-5,000 births    Complete gonadal dysgenesis  one in 150,000 births    Hypospadias (urethral opening in perineum or along penile shaft)  one in 250 births [145]    Epispadias (urethral opening between corona and tip of glans penis)  one in 117,000 births [146]    Population figures can vary due to genetic causes. In the Dominican Republic , 5-alpha-reductase deficiency is not uncommon in the town of Las Salinas resulting in social acceptance of the intersex trait. [147] Men with the trait are called "guevedoces" (Spanish for "eggs at twelve"). 12 out of 13 families had one or more male family members that carried the gene. The overall incidence for the town was 1 in every 90 males were carriers, with other males either non-carriers or non-affected carriers. [148]  Medical classifications [ edit ]  Signs [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia may appear as a large clitoris or as a small penis.     The Quigley scale is a method for describing genital development in AIS.    Because there is variation in all of the processes of the development of the sex organs , a child can be born with a sexual anatomy that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average clitoris ( clitoral hypertrophy ) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average penis that is open along the underside. The appearance may be quite ambiguous, describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia, or as male genitals with a very small penis, completely open along the midline (" hypospadic "), and empty scrotum. Fertility is variable.  Measurement systems [ edit ]  The Orchidometer is a medical instrument to measure the volume of the testicles. It was developed by Swiss pediatric endocrinologist Andrea Prader . The Prader scale [149] and Quigley scale are visual rating systems that measure genital appearance.  Other signs [ edit ]  In order to help in classification, methods other than a genitalia inspection can be performed. For instance, a karyotype display of a tissue sample may determine which of the causes of intersex is prevalent in the case.  Causes [ edit ]  Main article: Sexual differentiation  The common pathway of sexual differentiation , where a productive human female has an XX chromosome pair, and a productive male has an XY pair, is relevant to the development of intersex conditions.  During fertilization, the sperm adds either an X (female) or a Y (male) chromosome to the X in the ovum. This determines the genetic sex of the embryo. [150] During the first weeks of development, genetic male and female fetuses are "anatomically indistinguishable", with primitive gonads beginning to develop during approximately the sixth week of gestation. The gonads, in a "bipotential state", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events. [150] Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.  At around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In normal female differentiation, the Müllerian duct system develops into the uterus , Fallopian tubes , and inner third of the vagina. In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone MIH causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the Wolffian duct system , which develops into the vas deferens , seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts. [150] By birth, the typical fetus has been completely "sexed" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.  Conditions [ edit ]  Further information: disorders of sex development  There are a variety of opinions on what conditions or traits are and are not intersex, dependent on the definition of intersex that is used. Current human rights based definitions stress a broad diversity of sex characteristics that differ from expectations for male or female bodies. [2] During 2015, the Council of Europe , [51] the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights [133] and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights [134] have called for a review of medical classifications on the basis that they presently impede enjoyment of the right to health ; the Council of Europe expressed concern that "the gap between the expectations of human rights organisations of intersex people and the development of medical classifications has possibly widened over the past decade". [51] [133] [134]    List of conditions    Sex chromosomes  Name  Description    XX  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  The most common cause of sexual ambiguity is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands produce abnormally high levels of virilizing hormones in utero. The genes that cause CAH can now be detected in the developing embryo. As Fausto-Sterling mentioned in chapter 3 of Sexing the Body , "a woman who suspects she may be pregnant with a CAH baby (if she or someone in her family carries CAH) can undergo treatment and then get tested." To prevent an XX-CAH child's genitalia from becoming masculinized, a treatment, which includes the use of the steroid dexamethasone, must begin as early as four weeks after formation. Many do not favor this process because "the safety of this experimental therapy has not been established in rigorously controlled trials", it does allow physicians to detect abnormalities, therefore starting treatment right after birth. Starting treatment as soon as an XX-CAH baby is born not only minimizes, but also may even eliminate the chances of genital surgery from being performed. [137] However, the necessity of such surgery itself is disputed. Meta-analysis of the studies supporting the use of dexamethasone on CAH at-risk fetuses found "less than one half of one percent of published 'studies' of this intervention were regarded as being of high enough quality to provide meaningful data for a meta-analysis. Even these four studies were of low quality" ... "in ways so slipshod as to breach professional standards of medical ethics" [151] and "there were no data on long-term follow-up of physical and metabolic outcomes in children exposed to dexamethasone". [152]  In XX-females, this can range from partial masculinization that produces a large clitoris, to virilization and male appearance. The latter applies in particular to congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency , which is the most common form of CAH.  Individuals born with XX chromosomes affected by 17α-hydroxylase deficiency are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.  See below for XY CAH 17α-hydroxylase deficiency.     XX  Progestin-induced virilisation  In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by the use of progestin , a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals normally have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males. [153]    XX  Freemartinism  This condition occurs commonly in all species of cattle and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the placentae of fraternal twins usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a freemartin is very like a normal female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a castrated male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs – in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop normally as in other mammals.    XY  Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)  People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees. Cases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a vagina and no uterus , cervix , or ovaries , and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.  In mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as clitoromegaly , or a small penis, which is called micropenis or microphallus; hypospadias and cryptorchidism may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.     XY  5-alpha-reductase deficiency (5-ARD)  The condition affects individuals with a Y chromosome , making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS. [154] Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth. Such individuals are usually raised as girls. The lack of DHT also limits the development of facial hair.    XY  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  In individuals with a Y chromosome (typically XY) who have Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency , CAH inhibits virilization, unlike cases without a Y chromosome.    XY  Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS)  The child has XY chromosomes typical of a male. The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce Müllerian inhibiting factor during fetal development.    XY  Anorchia  Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce gametes necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to gender dysphoria , as anorchic individuals are typically assigned male at birth .    XY  Gonadal dysgenesis  It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whose gonads don't develop properly. Clinical features are heterogeneous. [137]    XY  Hypospadias  It is caused by various causes, including alterations in testosterone metabolism. The urethra does not run to the tip of the penis. In mild forms, the opening is just shy of the tip; in moderate forms, it is along the shaft; and in severe forms, it may open at the base of the penis. [155]    Other  Unusual chromosomal sex  In addition to the most common XX and XY chromosomal sexes, there are several other possible combinations, for example Turner syndrome ( XO ), Triple X syndrome (XXX), Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) and variants ( XXYY , XXXY , XXXXY ), XYY syndrome , de la Chapelle syndrome ( XX male ), Swyer syndrome (XY female).    Other  Mosaicism and chimerism  A mix can occur, where some of the cells of the body have the common XX or XY, while some have one of the less usual chromosomal contents above. Such a mixture is caused by either mosaicism or chimerism . In mosaicism, the mixture is caused by a mutation in one of the cells of the embryo after fertilization, whereas chimerism is a fusion of two embryos. In alternative fashion, it is simply a mixture between XX and XY, and does not have to involve any less-common genotypes in individual cells. This, too, can occur both as chimerism and as a result of one sex chromosome having mutated into the other. [156]  Mosaicism and chimerism may involve chromosomes other than the sex chromosomes, and not result in intersex traits.     Other  True hermaphroditism and ovotestis  A " true hermaphrodite " is defined as someone with both testicular and ovarian tissue. Though naturally occurring true hermaphroditism in humans is unknown, there is, on the other hand, a spectrum of forms of ovotestes . The varieties include having two ovotestes or one ovary and one ovotestis, often in the form of streak gonads . Phenotype is not determinable from the ovotestes; in some cases, the appearance is "fairly typically female"; in others, it is "fairly typically male", and it may also be "fairly in-between in terms of genital development." [157] Intersex activist Cheryl Chase is an example of someone with ovotestes. [158]    Medical interventions [ edit ]     Hong Kong intersex activist Small Luk    Main article: Intersex medical interventions  Further information: History of intersex surgery  Rationales [ edit ]  Medical interventions take place to address physical health concerns, and psychosocial risks. Both types of rationale are the subject of debate, particularly as the consequences of surgical (and many hormonal) interventions are lifelong and irreversible. Questions regarding physical health include accurately assessing risk levels, necessity and timing. Psychosocial rationales are particularly susceptible to questions of necessity as they reflect social and cultural concerns.  There remains no clinical consensus about an evidence base, surgical timing, necessity, type of surgical intervention, and degree of difference warranting intervention. [159] [160] [161] Such surgeries are the subject of significant contention due to consequences that include trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] This includes community activism, [40] and multiple reports by international human rights [19] [51] [23] [162] and health [72] institutions and national ethics bodies. [22] [163]  In the cases where gonads may pose a cancer risk, as in some cases of androgen insensitivity syndrome , [164] concern has been expressed that treatment rationales and decision-making regarding cancer risk may encapsulate decisions around a desire for surgical normalization. [21]  Types [ edit ]   Feminizing and masculinizing surgeries : Surgical procedures depend on diagnosis, and there is often concern as to whether surgery should be performed at all. Typically, surgery is performed shortly after birth. Defenders of the practice argue that it is necessary for individuals to be clearly identified as male or female in order for them to function socially and develop normally. Psychosocial reasons are often stated. [12] This is criticised by many human rights institutions, and authors. Unlike other aesthetic surgical procedures performed on infants, such as corrective surgery for a cleft lip , genital surgery may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life, or feelings of freakishness and unacceptability. [165]  Hormone treatment : There is widespread evidence of prenatal testing and hormone treatment to prevent or eliminate intersex traits, [166] [167] associated also with the problematization of sexual orientation and gender non-conformity. [166] [168]  Psychosocial support : All stakeholders support psychosocial support. A joint international statement by participants at the Third International Intersex Forum in 2013 sought, amongst other demands: "Recognition that medicalization and stigmatisation of intersex people result in significant trauma and mental health concerns. In view of ensuring the bodily integrity and well-being of intersex people, autonomous non-pathologising psycho-social and peer support be available to intersex people throughout their life (as self-required), as well as to parents and/or care providers."  Genetic selection and terminations : The ethics of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to select against intersex traits was the subject of 11 papers in the October 2013 issue of the American Journal of Bioethics . [169] There is widespread evidence of pregnancy terminations arising from prenatal testing, as well as prenatal hormone treatment to prevent intersex traits. Behrmann and Ravitsky find social concepts of sex, gender and sexual orientation to be "intertwined on many levels. Parental choice against intersex may thus conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  Gender dysphoria : The DSM-5 included a change from using gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria. This revised code now specifically includes intersex people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth and experience clinically significant distress or impairment, using the language of disorders of sex development . [170] This move was criticised by intersex advocacy groups in Australia and New Zealand . [171]  Medical photography and display : Photographs of intersex children's genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes. Problems associated with medical photography of intersex children have been discussed due to experiences of humiliation and powerlessness by child subjects, [172] along with their ethics, control and usage.

[1] [2] Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female . [3] [4]  Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites , "congenital eunuchs", [5] [6] or congenitally "frigid". [7] Such terms have fallen out of favor; in particular, the term "hermaphrodite" is considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious. [8] Medical description of intersex traits as disorders of sex development has been controversial [9] [10] [11] since the label was introduced in 2006. [12]  Intersex people may face stigmatization and discrimination from birth or discovery of an intersex trait. This may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. [13] [14] [15] Globally, some intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, are surgically or hormonally altered to create more socially acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of good outcomes. [16] Such treatments may involve sterilization . Adults, including elite female athletes, have also been subjects of such treatment. [17] [18] Increasingly these issues are considered human rights abuses, with statements from international [19] [20] and national human rights and ethics institutions. [21] [22] Intersex organizations have also issued statements about human rights violations, including the Malta declaration of the third International Intersex Forum . [23]  In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] [26]  Some intersex persons may be assigned and raised as a girl or boy but then identify with another gender later in life, while most continue to identify with their assigned sex.

Odiele disclosed that she has the intersex trait androgen insensitivity syndrome in 2017    According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights :   Intersex people are born with sex characteristics (including genitals, gonads and chromosome patterns) that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies.  Intersex is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of natural bodily variations. In some cases, intersex traits are visible at birth while in others, they are not apparent until puberty. Some chromosomal intersex variations may not be physically apparent at all. [2]   In biological terms, sex may be determined by a number of factors present at birth, including: [30]   the number and type of sex chromosomes ;  the type of gonads —ovaries or testicles;  the sex hormones ;  the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the uterus in females); and  the external genitalia.   People whose characteristics are not either all typically male or all typically female at birth are intersex. [31]  Some intersex traits are not always visible at birth; some babies may be born with ambiguous genitals, while others may have ambiguous internal organs (testes and ovaries). Others will not become aware that they are intersex unless they receive genetic testing, because it does not manifest in their phenotype.  History [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex in history , Timeline of intersex history , and History of intersex surgery      Hermaphroditus in a wall painting from Herculaneum (first half of the 1st century AD)    Whether or not they were socially tolerated or accepted by any particular culture, the existence of intersex people was known to many ancient and pre-modern cultures. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote of "hermaphroditus" in the first century BCE that Hermaphroditus "is born with a physical body which is a combination of that of a man and that of a woman", and with supernatural properties. [32]      Edward Coke , The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England (1st ed, 1628, title page)    In European societies, Roman law , post-classical canon law , and later common law , referred to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. [33] The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani states that "Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails". [34] [35] [36] The foundation of common law, the 17th Century Institutes of the Lawes of England described how a hermaphrodite could inherit "either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile." [37] [38] Legal cases have been described in canon law and elsewhere over the centuries.  In some non-European societies, sex or gender systems with more than two categories may have allowed for other forms of inclusion of both intersex and transgender people. Such societies have been characterized as "primitive", while Morgan Holmes states that subsequent analysis has been simplistic or romanticized, failing to take account of the ways that subjects of all categories are treated. [39]  During the Victorian era , medical authors introduced the terms " true hermaphrodite " for an individual who has both ovarian and testicular tissue, "male pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with testicular tissue, but either female or ambiguous sexual anatomy, and "female pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with ovarian tissue, but either male or ambiguous sexual anatomy. Some later shifts in terminology have reflected advances in genetics, while other shifts are suggested to be due to pejorative associations. [40]  The term intersexuality was coined by Richard Goldschmidt in 1917. [41] The first suggestion to replace the term 'hermaphrodite' with 'intersex' was made by Cawadias in the 1940s. [42]  Since the rise of modern medical science, some intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals. Surgeons pinpointed intersex babies as a "social emergency" when born. [43] An 'optimal gender policy', initially developed by John Money , stated that early intervention helped avoid gender identity confusion, but this lacks evidence, [44] and early interventions have adverse consequences for psychological and physical health. [22] Since advances in surgery have made it possible for intersex conditions to be concealed, many people are not aware of how frequently intersex conditions arise in human beings or that they occur at all. [45]  Dialog between what were once antagonistic groups of activists and clinicians has led to only slight changes in medical policies and how intersex patients and their families are treated in some locations. [46] In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] Many civil society organizations and human rights institutions now call for an end to unnecessary "normalizing" interventions, including in the Malta declaration . [47] [1]  Human rights and legal issues [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex rights by country  Human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on harmful practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions including, in 2015, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the World Health Organization . These developments have been accompanied by International Intersex Forums and increased cooperation amongst civil society organizations. However, the implementation, codification and enforcement of intersex human rights in national legal systems remains slow.  Areas of concern include: non-consensual medical interventions; stigma, discrimination and equal treatment; access to reparations and justice; access to information and support, and legal recognition.  Physical integrity and bodily autonomy [ edit ]       Legal prohibition of non-consensual medical interventions   Regulatory suspension of non-consensual medical interventions     Main articles: Intersex human rights and Intersex medical interventions  Stigmatization and discrimination from birth may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in east Africa may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a curse. [13] [14] Abandonments and infanticides have been reported in Uganda , [13]  Kenya , [48]  south Asia , [49] and China . [15]  Infants, children and adolescents also experience "normalising" interventions on intersex persons that are medically unnecessary and the unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics. Medical interventions to modify the sex characteristics of intersex people, without the consent of the intersex person have taken place in all countries where the human rights of intersex people have been studied. [50] These interventions have frequently been performed with the consent of the intersex person's parents, when the person is legally too young to consent. Such interventions have been criticized by the World Health Organization, other UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and an increasing number of regional and national institutions due to their adverse consequences, including trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw surgical intervention without consent. [25] [26] In the same year, the Council of Europe became the first institution to state that intersex people have the right not to undergo sex affirmation interventions. [25] [26] [51] [52] [53]  Anti-discrimination and equal treatment [ edit ]       Explicit protection on grounds of sex characteristics   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex status   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex within attribute of sex     Main article: Discrimination against intersex people  Inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law . Because people born with intersex bodies are seen as different, intersex infants, children, adolescents and adults "are often stigmatized and subjected to multiple human rights violations", including discrimination in education, healthcare, employment, sport, and public services. [2] [1] [54] Several countries have so far explicitly protected intersex people from discrimination, with landmarks including South Africa , [26] [55]  Australia , [56] [57] and, most comprehensively, Malta. [58] [59] [60] [61] [62]  Reparations and justice [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Facilitating access to justice and reparations . Access to reparation appears limited, with a scarcity of legal cases, such as the 2011 case of Christiane Völling in Germany . [24] [63] A second case was adjudicated in Chile in 2012, involving a child and his parents. [64] [65] A further successful case in Germany, taken by Michaela Raab, was reported in 2015. [66] In the United States , the "M.C." legal case, advanced by Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth with the Southern Poverty Law Centre is still before the courts. [67] [68]  Information and support [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Access to information , medical records, peer and other counselling and support. With the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, a secrecy-based model was also adopted, in the belief that this was necessary to ensure "normal" physical and psychosocial development. [21] [22] [69] [70] [71] [72]  Legal recognition [ edit ]  Main article: Legal recognition of intersex people  The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions states that legal recognition is firstly "about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women." [23] In some regions, obtaining any form of birth certification may be an issue. A Kenyan court case in 2014 established the right of an intersex boy, "Baby A", to a birth certificate. [73]  Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a certain sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not. [3] [4] [28] [29] Recognition of third sex or gender classifications occurs in several countries, [74] [75] [76] [77] however, it is controversial when it becomes assumed or coercive, as is the case with some German infants . [78] [79] [80] Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third 'X' sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an "X" or "other" option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure. [27] [81]  Language [ edit ]     U.S. intersex activist Pidgeon Pagonis    Research in the late 20th century led to a growing medical consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal, but relatively rare, forms of human biology. [4] [82] [83] [84] Clinician and researcher Milton Diamond stresses the importance of care in the selection of language related to intersex people:   Foremost, we advocate use of the terms "typical", "usual", or "most frequent" where it is more common to use the term "normal." When possible avoid expressions like maldeveloped or undeveloped, errors of development, defective genitals, abnormal, or mistakes of nature. Emphasize that all of these conditions are biologically understandable while they are statistically uncommon. [85]   The term 'intersex' [ edit ]  Some people with intersex traits self-identify as intersex, and some do not. [86] [87] Australian sociological research published in 2016, found that 60% of respondents used the term "intersex" to self-describe their sex characteristics, including people identifying themselves as intersex, describing themselves as having an intersex variation or, in smaller numbers, having an intersex condition. A majority of 75% of survey respondents also self-described as male or female. [27] Respondents also commonly used diagnostic labels and referred to their sex chromosomes, with word choices depending on audience. [27] [81] Research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that 80% of affected Support Group respondents "strongly liked, liked or felt neutral about intersex" as a term, while caregivers were less supportive. [88] The hospital reported that "disorders of sex development" may negatively affect care. [89]  Some intersex organizations reference "intersex people" and "intersex variations or traits" [90] while others use more medicalized language such as "people with intersex conditions", [91] or people "with intersex conditions or DSDs (differences of sex development)" and "children born with variations of sex anatomy". [92] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth published a statement recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  Hermaphrodite [ edit ]  Main article: Hermaphrodite  A hermaphrodite is an organism that has both male and female reproductive organs. Until the mid-20th century, "hermaphrodite" was used synonymously with "intersex". [42] The distinctions "male pseudohermaphrodite", "female pseudohermaphrodite" and especially " true hermaphrodite " [94] are vestiges of outdated 19th-century thinking, reflecting histology (microscopic appearance) of the gonads . [95] [96] [97] Medical terminology has shifted not only due to concerns about language, but also a shift to understandings based on genetics .  Currently, hermaphroditism is not to be confused with intersex, as the former refers only to a specific phenotypical presentation of sex organs and the latter to more complex combination of phenotypical and genotypical presentation. Using "hermaphrodite" to refer to intersex individuals is considered to be stigmatizing and misleading. [98]  Hermaphrodite is used for animal and vegetal species in which the possession of both ovaries and testes is either serial or concurrent, and for living organisms without such gonads but present binary form of reproduction, which is part of the typical life history of those species; intersex has come to be used when this is not the case.  Disorders of sex development [ edit ]  Main article: Disorders of sex development  " Disorders of sex development " (DSD) is a contested term, [9] [10] defined to include congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. Members of the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric  Endocrine Society and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology adopted this term in their "Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders". [12] [44] While it adopted the term, to open "many more doors", the now defunct Intersex Society of North America itself remarked that intersex is not a disorder. [99] Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested the adoption of the terminology and its implied status as a "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who do not feel that there is something wrong with them, regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy. [100]  Sociological research in Australia, published in 2016, found that 3% of respondents used the term "disorders of sex development" or "DSD" to define their sex characteristics, while 21% use the term when accessing medical services. In contrast, 60% used the term "intersex" in some form to self-describe their sex characteristics. [81] U.S. research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that "disorders of sex development" terminology may negatively affect care, give offence, and result in lower attendance at medical clinics. [89] [88]  Alternatives to categorizing intersex conditions as "disorders" have been suggested, including "variations of sex development". [11]  Organisation Intersex International (OII) questions a disease/disability approach, argues for deferral of intervention unless medically necessary, when fully informed consent of the individual involved is possible, and self-determination of sex/gender orientation and identity. [101] The UK Intersex Association is also highly critical of the label 'disorders' and points to the fact that there was minimal involvement of intersex representatives in the debate which led to the change in terminology. [102] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth also published a statement opposing pathologizing language to describe people born with intersex traits, recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  LGBT and LGBTI [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex and LGBT  Intersex can be contrasted with homosexuality or same-sex attraction . Numerous studies have shown higher rates of same sex attraction in intersex people, [103] [104] with a recent Australian study of people born with atypical sex characteristics finding that 52% of respondents were non-heterosexual, [27] [81] thus research on intersex subjects has been used to explore means of preventing homosexuality. [103] [104] However, current studies do not support a statistical correlation between genetic intersex traits and transsexual persons. [105] [106]  Intersex can therefore be contrasted with transgender , [107] which describes the condition in which one's gender identity does not match one's assigned sex. [107] [108] [109] Some people are both intersex and transgender. [110] A 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced gender dysphoria . [28] In an analysis of the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to eliminate intersex traits, Behrmann and Ravitsky state: "Parental choice against intersex may ... conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  The relationship of intersex to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans, and queer communities is complex, [112] but intersex people are often added to LGBT to create an LGBTI community. Emi Koyama describes how inclusion of intersex in LGBTI can fail to address intersex-specific human rights issues, including creating false impressions "that intersex people's rights are protected" by laws protecting LGBT people, and failing to acknowledge that many intersex people are not LGBT. [113]  Organisation Intersex International Australia states that some intersex individuals are same sex attracted, and some are heterosexual, but "LGBTI activism has fought for the rights of people who fall outside of expected binary sex and gender norms." [114] [115]  Julius Kaggwa of SIPD Uganda has written that, while the gay community "offers us a place of relative safety, it is also oblivious to our specific needs". [116]  Mauro Cabral has written that transgender people and organizations "need to stop approaching intersex issues as if they were trans issues" including use of intersex as a means of explaining being transgender; "we can collaborate a lot with the intersex movement by making it clear how wrong that approach is". [117]  Intersex in society [ edit ]     Kristi Bruce after shooting the documentary XXXY , 2000    Fiction and media [ edit ]  Main articles: Literature about intersex and Intersex characters in fiction  An intersex character is the narrator in Jeffrey Eugenides ' Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Middlesex .  Television works about intersex and films about intersex are scarce. The Spanish-language film XXY won the Critics' Week grand prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and the ACID/CCAS Support Award. [118]  Faking It is notable for providing the first intersex main character in a television show, [119] and television's first intersex character played by an intersex actor. [120]  Civil society institutions [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex civil society organizations  Intersex peer support and advocacy organizations have existed since at least 1985, with the establishment of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia in 1985. [121] The Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (UK) established in 1988. [122] The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) may have been one of the first intersex civil society organizations to have been open to people regardless of diagnosis; it was active from 1993 to 2008. [123]  Events [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex Awareness Day and Intersex Day of Remembrance  Intersex Awareness Day is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight the challenges faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 26 October. It marks the first public demonstration by intersex people, which took place in Boston on October 26, 1996, outside a venue where the American Academy of Pediatrics was holding its annual conference. [124]  Intersex Day of Remembrance , also known as Intersex Solidarity Day, is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight issues faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 8 November. It marks the birthday of Herculine Barbin , a French intersex person whose memoirs were later published by Michel Foucault in Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite .  Flag [ edit ]     Intersex Pride flag    Main article: Intersex flag  The intersex flag was created by Organisation Intersex International Australia in July 2013 to create a flag "that is not derivative, but is yet firmly grounded in meaning". The organization aimed to create a symbol without gendered pink and blue colors. It describes yellow and purple as " hermaphrodite " colors. The organization describes it as freely available "for use by any intersex person or organization who wishes to use it, in a human rights affirming community context". [125]  Religion [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex people and religion  In Hinduism , Sangam literature uses the word pedi to refer to people born with an intersex condition; it also refers to antharlinga hijras and various other hijras . [126] Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded but provokes parental fear. [49]  In Islam , scholars of Islamic jurisprudence have detailed discussions on the status and rights of intersex based on what mainly exhibits in their external sexual organs. Yet, modern Islamic jurisprudence scholars turn to medical screening to determine the dominance of their sex. The intersex rights includes rights of inheritance, rights to marriage, rights to live like any other male or female. The rights are generally based on whether they are true hermaphrodites, or pseudo hermaphrodite. Scholars of Islamic jurisprudence generally consider their rights based on the majority of what appears from their external sexual organs. [ citation needed ]  In Judaism , the Talmud contains extensive discussion concerning the status of two intersex types in Jewish law; namely the androginus , which exhibits both male and female external sexual organs, and the tumtum which exhibits neither. In the 1970s and 1980s, the treatment of intersex babies started to be discussed in Orthodox Jewish medical halacha by prominent rabbinic leaders, for example Eliezer Waldenberg and Moshe Feinstein . [127]  Sport [ edit ]      Stanisława Walasiewicz (Stella Walsh) in 1933    Main article: Sex verification in sports  Multiple athletes have been humiliated, excluded from competition or been forced to return medals following discovery of an intersex trait. Examples include Erik Schinegger , Foekje Dillema , Maria José Martínez-Patiño and Santhi Soundarajan . In contrast, Stanisława Walasiewicz (also known as Stella Walsh) was the subject of posthumous controversy. [128]  The South African middle-distance runner Caster Semenya won gold at the World Championships in the women's 800 meter and won silver in the 2012 Summer Olympics. When Semenya won gold in the World Championships, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) requested sex verification tests. The results were not released, but Semenya was cleared to race with other women. [129]  Katrina Karkazis , Rebecca Jordan-Young , Georgiann Davis and Silvia Camporesi argued that new IAAF policies on "hyperandrogenism" in female athletes (applied for example to the case of Dutee Chand ), established in response to the Semenya case, are "significantly flawed", arguing that the policy will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify "gender policing". They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender. [130]  In April 2014, the BMJ reported that four elite women athletes with 5-ARD were subjected to sterilization and "partial clitoridectomies" in order to compete in sport. The authors noted that "partial clitoridectomy" was "not medically indicated, does not relate to real or perceived athletic "advantage". [17] Intersex advocates regard this intervention as "a clearly coercive process". [131] In 2016, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on health, Dainius Pūras, criticized "current and historic" sex verification policies, describing how "a number of athletes have undergone gonadectomy (removal of reproductive organs) and partial clitoridectomy (a form of female genital mutilation ) in the absence of symptoms or health issues warranting those procedures." [132]  Population figures [ edit ]  There are few firm estimates of the number of intersex people. While human rights institutions have called for the demedicalisation of intersex traits, as far as possible, [21] [51] [133] [134] medical definitions are often still used. The now-defunct Intersex Society of North America stated that:   If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won't show up until later in life. [135]   According to Blackless, Fausto-Sterling et al., 1.7 percent of human births are intersex, including variations that may not become apparent until, for example, puberty, or until attempting to conceive. [136] [137] Some clinicians do not favor such definitions. According to Leonard Sax, intersex should be "restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female", around 0.018%. This definition excludes Klinefelter syndrome and many other variations. [138] He in turn criticizes Fausto-Sterling for counting Late-Onset Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia for 88% of her figure. His rebuttal concludes,   "The most original feature of Fausto-Sterling's book is her reluctance to classify true intersex conditions as pathological (Fausto-Sterling, 2000, p. 113) ... She often uses the word natural synonymously with normal. However, natural and normal are not synonyms. A cow may give birth to a two-headed or Siamese calf by natural processes, natural being understood as per Fausto-Sterling's definition as "produced by nature." Nevertheless, that two-headed calf unarguably manifests an abnormal condition. Fausto-Sterling's insistence that all combinations of sexual anatomy be regarded as normal... follows that classifications of normal and abnormal sexual anatomy are mere social conventions, prejudices which can and should be set aside by an enlightened intelligentsia. This type of extreme social constructionism is confusing and is not helpful to clinicians, to their patients, or to their patients' families. Diluting the term intersex to include "any deviation from the Platonic ideal of sexual dimorphism" (Blackless et al., 2000, p. 152), as Fausto-Sterling suggests, deprives the term of any clinically useful meaning." [139]   However, many conditions excluded from Sax's analysis are currently regarded as disorders of sex development . Individuals with those diagnoses may experience stigma and discrimination due to their sex characteristics, including sex "normalizing" interventions, and so those diagnoses and life experiences meet definitions of intersex in use by UN and other bodies. As a result, the statistical analyses by Blackless and Fausto-Sterling, despite her outdated and perceived offensive use of the term hermaphrodite, [140] have become widely quoted, [51] [141] including by other clinicians. [142] The following summarizes those frequency statistics:    Sex Variation  Frequency    Not XX, XY, Klinefelter, or Turner  one in 1,666 births    Klinefelter syndrome (XXY)  one in 1,000 births    Turner syndrome (45,X)  one in 2,710 births [143]    Androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 13,000 births    Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 130,000 births    Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia  one in 13,000 births    Late onset adrenal hyperplasia  one in 10,000 births. [144]    Vaginal agenesis  one in 6,000 births    Ovotestes  one in 83,000 births    Idiopathic (no discernable medical cause)  one in 110,000 births    Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment, e.g. progestin administered to pregnant mother)  No estimate    5-alpha-reductase deficiency  No estimate    Mixed gonadal dysgenesis  No estimate    MRKH Syndrome  1 in 4,500-5,000 births    Complete gonadal dysgenesis  one in 150,000 births    Hypospadias (urethral opening in perineum or along penile shaft)  one in 250 births [145]    Epispadias (urethral opening between corona and tip of glans penis)  one in 117,000 births [146]    Population figures can vary due to genetic causes. In the Dominican Republic , 5-alpha-reductase deficiency is not uncommon in the town of Las Salinas resulting in social acceptance of the intersex trait. [147] Men with the trait are called "guevedoces" (Spanish for "eggs at twelve"). 12 out of 13 families had one or more male family members that carried the gene. The overall incidence for the town was 1 in every 90 males were carriers, with other males either non-carriers or non-affected carriers. [148]  Medical classifications [ edit ]  Signs [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia may appear as a large clitoris or as a small penis.     The Quigley scale is a method for describing genital development in AIS.    Because there is variation in all of the processes of the development of the sex organs , a child can be born with a sexual anatomy that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average clitoris ( clitoral hypertrophy ) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average penis that is open along the underside. The appearance may be quite ambiguous, describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia, or as male genitals with a very small penis, completely open along the midline (" hypospadic "), and empty scrotum. Fertility is variable.  Measurement systems [ edit ]  The Orchidometer is a medical instrument to measure the volume of the testicles. It was developed by Swiss pediatric endocrinologist Andrea Prader . The Prader scale [149] and Quigley scale are visual rating systems that measure genital appearance.  Other signs [ edit ]  In order to help in classification, methods other than a genitalia inspection can be performed. For instance, a karyotype display of a tissue sample may determine which of the causes of intersex is prevalent in the case.  Causes [ edit ]  Main article: Sexual differentiation  The common pathway of sexual differentiation , where a productive human female has an XX chromosome pair, and a productive male has an XY pair, is relevant to the development of intersex conditions.  During fertilization, the sperm adds either an X (female) or a Y (male) chromosome to the X in the ovum. This determines the genetic sex of the embryo. [150] During the first weeks of development, genetic male and female fetuses are "anatomically indistinguishable", with primitive gonads beginning to develop during approximately the sixth week of gestation. The gonads, in a "bipotential state", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events. [150] Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.  At around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In normal female differentiation, the Müllerian duct system develops into the uterus , Fallopian tubes , and inner third of the vagina. In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone MIH causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the Wolffian duct system , which develops into the vas deferens , seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts. [150] By birth, the typical fetus has been completely "sexed" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.  Conditions [ edit ]  Further information: disorders of sex development  There are a variety of opinions on what conditions or traits are and are not intersex, dependent on the definition of intersex that is used. Current human rights based definitions stress a broad diversity of sex characteristics that differ from expectations for male or female bodies. [2] During 2015, the Council of Europe , [51] the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights [133] and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights [134] have called for a review of medical classifications on the basis that they presently impede enjoyment of the right to health ; the Council of Europe expressed concern that "the gap between the expectations of human rights organisations of intersex people and the development of medical classifications has possibly widened over the past decade". [51] [133] [134]    List of conditions    Sex chromosomes  Name  Description    XX  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  The most common cause of sexual ambiguity is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands produce abnormally high levels of virilizing hormones in utero. The genes that cause CAH can now be detected in the developing embryo. As Fausto-Sterling mentioned in chapter 3 of Sexing the Body , "a woman who suspects she may be pregnant with a CAH baby (if she or someone in her family carries CAH) can undergo treatment and then get tested." To prevent an XX-CAH child's genitalia from becoming masculinized, a treatment, which includes the use of the steroid dexamethasone, must begin as early as four weeks after formation. Many do not favor this process because "the safety of this experimental therapy has not been established in rigorously controlled trials", it does allow physicians to detect abnormalities, therefore starting treatment right after birth. Starting treatment as soon as an XX-CAH baby is born not only minimizes, but also may even eliminate the chances of genital surgery from being performed. [137] However, the necessity of such surgery itself is disputed. Meta-analysis of the studies supporting the use of dexamethasone on CAH at-risk fetuses found "less than one half of one percent of published 'studies' of this intervention were regarded as being of high enough quality to provide meaningful data for a meta-analysis. Even these four studies were of low quality" ... "in ways so slipshod as to breach professional standards of medical ethics" [151] and "there were no data on long-term follow-up of physical and metabolic outcomes in children exposed to dexamethasone". [152]  In XX-females, this can range from partial masculinization that produces a large clitoris, to virilization and male appearance. The latter applies in particular to congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency , which is the most common form of CAH.  Individuals born with XX chromosomes affected by 17α-hydroxylase deficiency are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.  See below for XY CAH 17α-hydroxylase deficiency.     XX  Progestin-induced virilisation  In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by the use of progestin , a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals normally have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males. [153]    XX  Freemartinism  This condition occurs commonly in all species of cattle and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the placentae of fraternal twins usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a freemartin is very like a normal female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a castrated male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs – in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop normally as in other mammals.    XY  Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)  People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees. Cases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a vagina and no uterus , cervix , or ovaries , and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.  In mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as clitoromegaly , or a small penis, which is called micropenis or microphallus; hypospadias and cryptorchidism may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.     XY  5-alpha-reductase deficiency (5-ARD)  The condition affects individuals with a Y chromosome , making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS. [154] Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth. Such individuals are usually raised as girls. The lack of DHT also limits the development of facial hair.    XY  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  In individuals with a Y chromosome (typically XY) who have Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency , CAH inhibits virilization, unlike cases without a Y chromosome.    XY  Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS)  The child has XY chromosomes typical of a male. The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce Müllerian inhibiting factor during fetal development.    XY  Anorchia  Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce gametes necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to gender dysphoria , as anorchic individuals are typically assigned male at birth .    XY  Gonadal dysgenesis  It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whose gonads don't develop properly. Clinical features are heterogeneous. [137]    XY  Hypospadias  It is caused by various causes, including alterations in testosterone metabolism. The urethra does not run to the tip of the penis. In mild forms, the opening is just shy of the tip; in moderate forms, it is along the shaft; and in severe forms, it may open at the base of the penis. [155]    Other  Unusual chromosomal sex  In addition to the most common XX and XY chromosomal sexes, there are several other possible combinations, for example Turner syndrome ( XO ), Triple X syndrome (XXX), Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) and variants ( XXYY , XXXY , XXXXY ), XYY syndrome , de la Chapelle syndrome ( XX male ), Swyer syndrome (XY female).    Other  Mosaicism and chimerism  A mix can occur, where some of the cells of the body have the common XX or XY, while some have one of the less usual chromosomal contents above. Such a mixture is caused by either mosaicism or chimerism . In mosaicism, the mixture is caused by a mutation in one of the cells of the embryo after fertilization, whereas chimerism is a fusion of two embryos. In alternative fashion, it is simply a mixture between XX and XY, and does not have to involve any less-common genotypes in individual cells. This, too, can occur both as chimerism and as a result of one sex chromosome having mutated into the other. [156]  Mosaicism and chimerism may involve chromosomes other than the sex chromosomes, and not result in intersex traits.     Other  True hermaphroditism and ovotestis  A " true hermaphrodite " is defined as someone with both testicular and ovarian tissue. Though naturally occurring true hermaphroditism in humans is unknown, there is, on the other hand, a spectrum of forms of ovotestes . The varieties include having two ovotestes or one ovary and one ovotestis, often in the form of streak gonads . Phenotype is not determinable from the ovotestes; in some cases, the appearance is "fairly typically female"; in others, it is "fairly typically male", and it may also be "fairly in-between in terms of genital development." [157] Intersex activist Cheryl Chase is an example of someone with ovotestes. [158]    Medical interventions [ edit ]     Hong Kong intersex activist Small Luk    Main article: Intersex medical interventions  Further information: History of intersex surgery  Rationales [ edit ]  Medical interventions take place to address physical health concerns, and psychosocial risks. Both types of rationale are the subject of debate, particularly as the consequences of surgical (and many hormonal) interventions are lifelong and irreversible. Questions regarding physical health include accurately assessing risk levels, necessity and timing. Psychosocial rationales are particularly susceptible to questions of necessity as they reflect social and cultural concerns.  There remains no clinical consensus about an evidence base, surgical timing, necessity, type of surgical intervention, and degree of difference warranting intervention. [159] [160] [161] Such surgeries are the subject of significant contention due to consequences that include trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] This includes community activism, [40] and multiple reports by international human rights [19] [51] [23] [162] and health [72] institutions and national ethics bodies. [22] [163]  In the cases where gonads may pose a cancer risk, as in some cases of androgen insensitivity syndrome , [164] concern has been expressed that treatment rationales and decision-making regarding cancer risk may encapsulate decisions around a desire for surgical normalization. [21]  Types [ edit ]   Feminizing and masculinizing surgeries : Surgical procedures depend on diagnosis, and there is often concern as to whether surgery should be performed at all. Typically, surgery is performed shortly after birth. Defenders of the practice argue that it is necessary for individuals to be clearly identified as male or female in order for them to function socially and develop normally. Psychosocial reasons are often stated. [12] This is criticised by many human rights institutions, and authors. Unlike other aesthetic surgical procedures performed on infants, such as corrective surgery for a cleft lip , genital surgery may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life, or feelings of freakishness and unacceptability. [165]  Hormone treatment : There is widespread evidence of prenatal testing and hormone treatment to prevent or eliminate intersex traits, [166] [167] associated also with the problematization of sexual orientation and gender non-conformity. [166] [168]  Psychosocial support : All stakeholders support psychosocial support. A joint international statement by participants at the Third International Intersex Forum in 2013 sought, amongst other demands: "Recognition that medicalization and stigmatisation of intersex people result in significant trauma and mental health concerns. In view of ensuring the bodily integrity and well-being of intersex people, autonomous non-pathologising psycho-social and peer support be available to intersex people throughout their life (as self-required), as well as to parents and/or care providers."  Genetic selection and terminations : The ethics of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to select against intersex traits was the subject of 11 papers in the October 2013 issue of the American Journal of Bioethics . [169] There is widespread evidence of pregnancy terminations arising from prenatal testing, as well as prenatal hormone treatment to prevent intersex traits. Behrmann and Ravitsky find social concepts of sex, gender and sexual orientation to be "intertwined on many levels. Parental choice against intersex may thus conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  Gender dysphoria : The DSM-5 included a change from using gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria. This revised code now specifically includes intersex people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth and experience clinically significant distress or impairment, using the language of disorders of sex development . [170] This move was criticised by intersex advocacy groups in Australia and New Zealand . [171]  Medical photography and display : Photographs of intersex children's genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes. Problems associated with medical photography of intersex children have been discussed due to experiences of humiliation and powerlessness by child subjects, [172] along with their ethics, control and usage.

[1] [2] Such variations may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female . [3] [4]  Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites , "congenital eunuchs", [5] [6] or congenitally "frigid". [7] Such terms have fallen out of favor; in particular, the term "hermaphrodite" is considered to be misleading, stigmatizing, and scientifically specious. [8] Medical description of intersex traits as disorders of sex development has been controversial [9] [10] [11] since the label was introduced in 2006. [12]  Intersex people may face stigmatization and discrimination from birth or discovery of an intersex trait. This may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. [13] [14] [15] Globally, some intersex infants and children, such as those with ambiguous outer genitalia, are surgically or hormonally altered to create more socially acceptable sex characteristics. However, this is considered controversial, with no firm evidence of good outcomes. [16] Such treatments may involve sterilization . Adults, including elite female athletes, have also been subjects of such treatment. [17] [18] Increasingly these issues are considered human rights abuses, with statements from international [19] [20] and national human rights and ethics institutions. [21] [22] Intersex organizations have also issued statements about human rights violations, including the Malta declaration of the third International Intersex Forum . [23]  In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] [26]  Some intersex persons may be assigned and raised as a girl or boy but then identify with another gender later in life, while most continue to identify with their assigned sex.

Odiele disclosed that she has the intersex trait androgen insensitivity syndrome in 2017    According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights :   Intersex people are born with sex characteristics (including genitals, gonads and chromosome patterns) that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies.  Intersex is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of natural bodily variations. In some cases, intersex traits are visible at birth while in others, they are not apparent until puberty. Some chromosomal intersex variations may not be physically apparent at all. [2]   In biological terms, sex may be determined by a number of factors present at birth, including: [30]   the number and type of sex chromosomes ;  the type of gonads —ovaries or testicles;  the sex hormones ;  the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the uterus in females); and  the external genitalia.   People whose characteristics are not either all typically male or all typically female at birth are intersex. [31]  Some intersex traits are not always visible at birth; some babies may be born with ambiguous genitals, while others may have ambiguous internal organs (testes and ovaries). Others will not become aware that they are intersex unless they receive genetic testing, because it does not manifest in their phenotype.  History [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex in history , Timeline of intersex history , and History of intersex surgery      Hermaphroditus in a wall painting from Herculaneum (first half of the 1st century AD)    Whether or not they were socially tolerated or accepted by any particular culture, the existence of intersex people was known to many ancient and pre-modern cultures. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote of "hermaphroditus" in the first century BCE that Hermaphroditus "is born with a physical body which is a combination of that of a man and that of a woman", and with supernatural properties. [32]      Edward Coke , The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England (1st ed, 1628, title page)    In European societies, Roman law , post-classical canon law , and later common law , referred to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. [33] The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani states that "Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails". [34] [35] [36] The foundation of common law, the 17th Century Institutes of the Lawes of England described how a hermaphrodite could inherit "either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile." [37] [38] Legal cases have been described in canon law and elsewhere over the centuries.  In some non-European societies, sex or gender systems with more than two categories may have allowed for other forms of inclusion of both intersex and transgender people. Such societies have been characterized as "primitive", while Morgan Holmes states that subsequent analysis has been simplistic or romanticized, failing to take account of the ways that subjects of all categories are treated. [39]  During the Victorian era , medical authors introduced the terms " true hermaphrodite " for an individual who has both ovarian and testicular tissue, "male pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with testicular tissue, but either female or ambiguous sexual anatomy, and "female pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with ovarian tissue, but either male or ambiguous sexual anatomy. Some later shifts in terminology have reflected advances in genetics, while other shifts are suggested to be due to pejorative associations. [40]  The term intersexuality was coined by Richard Goldschmidt in 1917. [41] The first suggestion to replace the term 'hermaphrodite' with 'intersex' was made by Cawadias in the 1940s. [42]  Since the rise of modern medical science, some intersex people with ambiguous external genitalia have had their genitalia surgically modified to resemble either female or male genitals. Surgeons pinpointed intersex babies as a "social emergency" when born. [43] An 'optimal gender policy', initially developed by John Money , stated that early intervention helped avoid gender identity confusion, but this lacks evidence, [44] and early interventions have adverse consequences for psychological and physical health. [22] Since advances in surgery have made it possible for intersex conditions to be concealed, many people are not aware of how frequently intersex conditions arise in human beings or that they occur at all. [45]  Dialog between what were once antagonistic groups of activists and clinicians has led to only slight changes in medical policies and how intersex patients and their families are treated in some locations. [46] In 2011, Christiane Völling became the first intersex person known to have successfully sued for damages in a case brought for non-consensual surgical intervention. [24] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw non-consensual medical interventions to modify sex anatomy, including that of intersex people. [25] Many civil society organizations and human rights institutions now call for an end to unnecessary "normalizing" interventions, including in the Malta declaration . [47] [1]  Human rights and legal issues [ edit ]  Further information: Intersex rights by country  Human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on harmful practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions including, in 2015, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the World Health Organization . These developments have been accompanied by International Intersex Forums and increased cooperation amongst civil society organizations. However, the implementation, codification and enforcement of intersex human rights in national legal systems remains slow.  Areas of concern include: non-consensual medical interventions; stigma, discrimination and equal treatment; access to reparations and justice; access to information and support, and legal recognition.  Physical integrity and bodily autonomy [ edit ]       Legal prohibition of non-consensual medical interventions   Regulatory suspension of non-consensual medical interventions     Main articles: Intersex human rights and Intersex medical interventions  Stigmatization and discrimination from birth may include infanticide, abandonment and the stigmatization of families. Mothers in east Africa may be accused of witchcraft, and the birth of an intersex child may be described as a curse. [13] [14] Abandonments and infanticides have been reported in Uganda , [13]  Kenya , [48]  south Asia , [49] and China . [15]  Infants, children and adolescents also experience "normalising" interventions on intersex persons that are medically unnecessary and the unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics. Medical interventions to modify the sex characteristics of intersex people, without the consent of the intersex person have taken place in all countries where the human rights of intersex people have been studied. [50] These interventions have frequently been performed with the consent of the intersex person's parents, when the person is legally too young to consent. Such interventions have been criticized by the World Health Organization, other UN bodies such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and an increasing number of regional and national institutions due to their adverse consequences, including trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] In April 2015, Malta became the first country to outlaw surgical intervention without consent. [25] [26] In the same year, the Council of Europe became the first institution to state that intersex people have the right not to undergo sex affirmation interventions. [25] [26] [51] [52] [53]  Anti-discrimination and equal treatment [ edit ]       Explicit protection on grounds of sex characteristics   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex status   Explicit protection on grounds of intersex within attribute of sex     Main article: Discrimination against intersex people  Inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law . Because people born with intersex bodies are seen as different, intersex infants, children, adolescents and adults "are often stigmatized and subjected to multiple human rights violations", including discrimination in education, healthcare, employment, sport, and public services. [2] [1] [54] Several countries have so far explicitly protected intersex people from discrimination, with landmarks including South Africa , [26] [55]  Australia , [56] [57] and, most comprehensively, Malta. [58] [59] [60] [61] [62]  Reparations and justice [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Facilitating access to justice and reparations . Access to reparation appears limited, with a scarcity of legal cases, such as the 2011 case of Christiane Völling in Germany . [24] [63] A second case was adjudicated in Chile in 2012, involving a child and his parents. [64] [65] A further successful case in Germany, taken by Michaela Raab, was reported in 2015. [66] In the United States , the "M.C." legal case, advanced by Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth with the Southern Poverty Law Centre is still before the courts. [67] [68]  Information and support [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex human rights  Access to information , medical records, peer and other counselling and support. With the rise of modern medical science in Western societies, a secrecy-based model was also adopted, in the belief that this was necessary to ensure "normal" physical and psychosocial development. [21] [22] [69] [70] [71] [72]  Legal recognition [ edit ]  Main article: Legal recognition of intersex people  The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions states that legal recognition is firstly "about intersex people who have been issued a male or a female birth certificate being able to enjoy the same legal rights as other men and women." [23] In some regions, obtaining any form of birth certification may be an issue. A Kenyan court case in 2014 established the right of an intersex boy, "Baby A", to a birth certificate. [73]  Like all individuals, some intersex individuals may be raised as a certain sex (male or female) but then identify with another later in life, while most do not. [3] [4] [28] [29] Recognition of third sex or gender classifications occurs in several countries, [74] [75] [76] [77] however, it is controversial when it becomes assumed or coercive, as is the case with some German infants . [78] [79] [80] Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third 'X' sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an "X" or "other" option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure. [27] [81]  Language [ edit ]     U.S. intersex activist Pidgeon Pagonis    Research in the late 20th century led to a growing medical consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal, but relatively rare, forms of human biology. [4] [82] [83] [84] Clinician and researcher Milton Diamond stresses the importance of care in the selection of language related to intersex people:   Foremost, we advocate use of the terms "typical", "usual", or "most frequent" where it is more common to use the term "normal." When possible avoid expressions like maldeveloped or undeveloped, errors of development, defective genitals, abnormal, or mistakes of nature. Emphasize that all of these conditions are biologically understandable while they are statistically uncommon. [85]   The term 'intersex' [ edit ]  Some people with intersex traits self-identify as intersex, and some do not. [86] [87] Australian sociological research published in 2016, found that 60% of respondents used the term "intersex" to self-describe their sex characteristics, including people identifying themselves as intersex, describing themselves as having an intersex variation or, in smaller numbers, having an intersex condition. A majority of 75% of survey respondents also self-described as male or female. [27] Respondents also commonly used diagnostic labels and referred to their sex chromosomes, with word choices depending on audience. [27] [81] Research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that 80% of affected Support Group respondents "strongly liked, liked or felt neutral about intersex" as a term, while caregivers were less supportive. [88] The hospital reported that "disorders of sex development" may negatively affect care. [89]  Some intersex organizations reference "intersex people" and "intersex variations or traits" [90] while others use more medicalized language such as "people with intersex conditions", [91] or people "with intersex conditions or DSDs (differences of sex development)" and "children born with variations of sex anatomy". [92] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth published a statement recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  Hermaphrodite [ edit ]  Main article: Hermaphrodite  A hermaphrodite is an organism that has both male and female reproductive organs. Until the mid-20th century, "hermaphrodite" was used synonymously with "intersex". [42] The distinctions "male pseudohermaphrodite", "female pseudohermaphrodite" and especially " true hermaphrodite " [94] are vestiges of outdated 19th-century thinking, reflecting histology (microscopic appearance) of the gonads . [95] [96] [97] Medical terminology has shifted not only due to concerns about language, but also a shift to understandings based on genetics .  Currently, hermaphroditism is not to be confused with intersex, as the former refers only to a specific phenotypical presentation of sex organs and the latter to more complex combination of phenotypical and genotypical presentation. Using "hermaphrodite" to refer to intersex individuals is considered to be stigmatizing and misleading. [98]  Hermaphrodite is used for animal and vegetal species in which the possession of both ovaries and testes is either serial or concurrent, and for living organisms without such gonads but present binary form of reproduction, which is part of the typical life history of those species; intersex has come to be used when this is not the case.  Disorders of sex development [ edit ]  Main article: Disorders of sex development  " Disorders of sex development " (DSD) is a contested term, [9] [10] defined to include congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. Members of the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric  Endocrine Society and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology adopted this term in their "Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders". [12] [44] While it adopted the term, to open "many more doors", the now defunct Intersex Society of North America itself remarked that intersex is not a disorder. [99] Other intersex people, activists, supporters, and academics have contested the adoption of the terminology and its implied status as a "disorder", seeing this as offensive to intersex individuals who do not feel that there is something wrong with them, regard the DSD consensus paper as reinforcing the normativity of early surgical interventions, and criticizing the treatment protocols associated with the new taxonomy. [100]  Sociological research in Australia, published in 2016, found that 3% of respondents used the term "disorders of sex development" or "DSD" to define their sex characteristics, while 21% use the term when accessing medical services. In contrast, 60% used the term "intersex" in some form to self-describe their sex characteristics. [81] U.S. research by the Lurie Children's Hospital , Chicago, and the AIS-DSD Support Group published in 2017 found that "disorders of sex development" terminology may negatively affect care, give offence, and result in lower attendance at medical clinics. [89] [88]  Alternatives to categorizing intersex conditions as "disorders" have been suggested, including "variations of sex development". [11]  Organisation Intersex International (OII) questions a disease/disability approach, argues for deferral of intervention unless medically necessary, when fully informed consent of the individual involved is possible, and self-determination of sex/gender orientation and identity. [101] The UK Intersex Association is also highly critical of the label 'disorders' and points to the fact that there was minimal involvement of intersex representatives in the debate which led to the change in terminology. [102] In May 2016, Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth also published a statement opposing pathologizing language to describe people born with intersex traits, recognizing "increasing general understanding and acceptance of the term "intersex"". [93]  LGBT and LGBTI [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex and LGBT  Intersex can be contrasted with homosexuality or same-sex attraction . Numerous studies have shown higher rates of same sex attraction in intersex people, [103] [104] with a recent Australian study of people born with atypical sex characteristics finding that 52% of respondents were non-heterosexual, [27] [81] thus research on intersex subjects has been used to explore means of preventing homosexuality. [103] [104] However, current studies do not support a statistical correlation between genetic intersex traits and transsexual persons. [105] [106]  Intersex can therefore be contrasted with transgender , [107] which describes the condition in which one's gender identity does not match one's assigned sex. [107] [108] [109] Some people are both intersex and transgender. [110] A 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced gender dysphoria . [28] In an analysis of the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to eliminate intersex traits, Behrmann and Ravitsky state: "Parental choice against intersex may ... conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  The relationship of intersex to lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans, and queer communities is complex, [112] but intersex people are often added to LGBT to create an LGBTI community. Emi Koyama describes how inclusion of intersex in LGBTI can fail to address intersex-specific human rights issues, including creating false impressions "that intersex people's rights are protected" by laws protecting LGBT people, and failing to acknowledge that many intersex people are not LGBT. [113]  Organisation Intersex International Australia states that some intersex individuals are same sex attracted, and some are heterosexual, but "LGBTI activism has fought for the rights of people who fall outside of expected binary sex and gender norms." [114] [115]  Julius Kaggwa of SIPD Uganda has written that, while the gay community "offers us a place of relative safety, it is also oblivious to our specific needs". [116]  Mauro Cabral has written that transgender people and organizations "need to stop approaching intersex issues as if they were trans issues" including use of intersex as a means of explaining being transgender; "we can collaborate a lot with the intersex movement by making it clear how wrong that approach is". [117]  Intersex in society [ edit ]     Kristi Bruce after shooting the documentary XXXY , 2000    Fiction and media [ edit ]  Main articles: Literature about intersex and Intersex characters in fiction  An intersex character is the narrator in Jeffrey Eugenides ' Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Middlesex .  Television works about intersex and films about intersex are scarce. The Spanish-language film XXY won the Critics' Week grand prize at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and the ACID/CCAS Support Award. [118]  Faking It is notable for providing the first intersex main character in a television show, [119] and television's first intersex character played by an intersex actor. [120]  Civil society institutions [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex civil society organizations  Intersex peer support and advocacy organizations have existed since at least 1985, with the establishment of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia in 1985. [121] The Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (UK) established in 1988. [122] The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) may have been one of the first intersex civil society organizations to have been open to people regardless of diagnosis; it was active from 1993 to 2008. [123]  Events [ edit ]  Main articles: Intersex Awareness Day and Intersex Day of Remembrance  Intersex Awareness Day is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight the challenges faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 26 October. It marks the first public demonstration by intersex people, which took place in Boston on October 26, 1996, outside a venue where the American Academy of Pediatrics was holding its annual conference. [124]  Intersex Day of Remembrance , also known as Intersex Solidarity Day, is an internationally observed civil awareness day designed to highlight issues faced by intersex people, occurring annually on 8 November. It marks the birthday of Herculine Barbin , a French intersex person whose memoirs were later published by Michel Foucault in Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite .  Flag [ edit ]     Intersex Pride flag    Main article: Intersex flag  The intersex flag was created by Organisation Intersex International Australia in July 2013 to create a flag "that is not derivative, but is yet firmly grounded in meaning". The organization aimed to create a symbol without gendered pink and blue colors. It describes yellow and purple as " hermaphrodite " colors. The organization describes it as freely available "for use by any intersex person or organization who wishes to use it, in a human rights affirming community context". [125]  Religion [ edit ]  Main article: Intersex people and religion  In Hinduism , Sangam literature uses the word pedi to refer to people born with an intersex condition; it also refers to antharlinga hijras and various other hijras . [126] Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded but provokes parental fear. [49]  In Islam , scholars of Islamic jurisprudence have detailed discussions on the status and rights of intersex based on what mainly exhibits in their external sexual organs. Yet, modern Islamic jurisprudence scholars turn to medical screening to determine the dominance of their sex. The intersex rights includes rights of inheritance, rights to marriage, rights to live like any other male or female. The rights are generally based on whether they are true hermaphrodites, or pseudo hermaphrodite. Scholars of Islamic jurisprudence generally consider their rights based on the majority of what appears from their external sexual organs. [ citation needed ]  In Judaism , the Talmud contains extensive discussion concerning the status of two intersex types in Jewish law; namely the androginus , which exhibits both male and female external sexual organs, and the tumtum which exhibits neither. In the 1970s and 1980s, the treatment of intersex babies started to be discussed in Orthodox Jewish medical halacha by prominent rabbinic leaders, for example Eliezer Waldenberg and Moshe Feinstein . [127]  Sport [ edit ]      Stanisława Walasiewicz (Stella Walsh) in 1933    Main article: Sex verification in sports  Multiple athletes have been humiliated, excluded from competition or been forced to return medals following discovery of an intersex trait. Examples include Erik Schinegger , Foekje Dillema , Maria José Martínez-Patiño and Santhi Soundarajan . In contrast, Stanisława Walasiewicz (also known as Stella Walsh) was the subject of posthumous controversy. [128]  The South African middle-distance runner Caster Semenya won gold at the World Championships in the women's 800 meter and won silver in the 2012 Summer Olympics. When Semenya won gold in the World Championships, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) requested sex verification tests. The results were not released, but Semenya was cleared to race with other women. [129]  Katrina Karkazis , Rebecca Jordan-Young , Georgiann Davis and Silvia Camporesi argued that new IAAF policies on "hyperandrogenism" in female athletes (applied for example to the case of Dutee Chand ), established in response to the Semenya case, are "significantly flawed", arguing that the policy will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify "gender policing". They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender. [130]  In April 2014, the BMJ reported that four elite women athletes with 5-ARD were subjected to sterilization and "partial clitoridectomies" in order to compete in sport. The authors noted that "partial clitoridectomy" was "not medically indicated, does not relate to real or perceived athletic "advantage". [17] Intersex advocates regard this intervention as "a clearly coercive process". [131] In 2016, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on health, Dainius Pūras, criticized "current and historic" sex verification policies, describing how "a number of athletes have undergone gonadectomy (removal of reproductive organs) and partial clitoridectomy (a form of female genital mutilation ) in the absence of symptoms or health issues warranting those procedures." [132]  Population figures [ edit ]  There are few firm estimates of the number of intersex people. While human rights institutions have called for the demedicalisation of intersex traits, as far as possible, [21] [51] [133] [134] medical definitions are often still used. The now-defunct Intersex Society of North America stated that:   If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won't show up until later in life. [135]   According to Blackless, Fausto-Sterling et al., 1.7 percent of human births are intersex, including variations that may not become apparent until, for example, puberty, or until attempting to conceive. [136] [137] Some clinicians do not favor such definitions. According to Leonard Sax, intersex should be "restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female", around 0.018%. This definition excludes Klinefelter syndrome and many other variations. [138] He in turn criticizes Fausto-Sterling for counting Late-Onset Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia for 88% of her figure. His rebuttal concludes,   "The most original feature of Fausto-Sterling's book is her reluctance to classify true intersex conditions as pathological (Fausto-Sterling, 2000, p. 113) ... She often uses the word natural synonymously with normal. However, natural and normal are not synonyms. A cow may give birth to a two-headed or Siamese calf by natural processes, natural being understood as per Fausto-Sterling's definition as "produced by nature." Nevertheless, that two-headed calf unarguably manifests an abnormal condition. Fausto-Sterling's insistence that all combinations of sexual anatomy be regarded as normal... follows that classifications of normal and abnormal sexual anatomy are mere social conventions, prejudices which can and should be set aside by an enlightened intelligentsia. This type of extreme social constructionism is confusing and is not helpful to clinicians, to their patients, or to their patients' families. Diluting the term intersex to include "any deviation from the Platonic ideal of sexual dimorphism" (Blackless et al., 2000, p. 152), as Fausto-Sterling suggests, deprives the term of any clinically useful meaning." [139]   However, many conditions excluded from Sax's analysis are currently regarded as disorders of sex development . Individuals with those diagnoses may experience stigma and discrimination due to their sex characteristics, including sex "normalizing" interventions, and so those diagnoses and life experiences meet definitions of intersex in use by UN and other bodies. As a result, the statistical analyses by Blackless and Fausto-Sterling, despite her outdated and perceived offensive use of the term hermaphrodite, [140] have become widely quoted, [51] [141] including by other clinicians. [142] The following summarizes those frequency statistics:    Sex Variation  Frequency    Not XX, XY, Klinefelter, or Turner  one in 1,666 births    Klinefelter syndrome (XXY)  one in 1,000 births    Turner syndrome (45,X)  one in 2,710 births [143]    Androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 13,000 births    Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome  one in 130,000 births    Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia  one in 13,000 births    Late onset adrenal hyperplasia  one in 10,000 births. [144]    Vaginal agenesis  one in 6,000 births    Ovotestes  one in 83,000 births    Idiopathic (no discernable medical cause)  one in 110,000 births    Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment, e.g. progestin administered to pregnant mother)  No estimate    5-alpha-reductase deficiency  No estimate    Mixed gonadal dysgenesis  No estimate    MRKH Syndrome  1 in 4,500-5,000 births    Complete gonadal dysgenesis  one in 150,000 births    Hypospadias (urethral opening in perineum or along penile shaft)  one in 250 births [145]    Epispadias (urethral opening between corona and tip of glans penis)  one in 117,000 births [146]    Population figures can vary due to genetic causes. In the Dominican Republic , 5-alpha-reductase deficiency is not uncommon in the town of Las Salinas resulting in social acceptance of the intersex trait. [147] Men with the trait are called "guevedoces" (Spanish for "eggs at twelve"). 12 out of 13 families had one or more male family members that carried the gene. The overall incidence for the town was 1 in every 90 males were carriers, with other males either non-carriers or non-affected carriers. [148]  Medical classifications [ edit ]  Signs [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia [ edit ]  Ambiguous genitalia may appear as a large clitoris or as a small penis.     The Quigley scale is a method for describing genital development in AIS.    Because there is variation in all of the processes of the development of the sex organs , a child can be born with a sexual anatomy that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average clitoris ( clitoral hypertrophy ) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average penis that is open along the underside. The appearance may be quite ambiguous, describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia, or as male genitals with a very small penis, completely open along the midline (" hypospadic "), and empty scrotum. Fertility is variable.  Measurement systems [ edit ]  The Orchidometer is a medical instrument to measure the volume of the testicles. It was developed by Swiss pediatric endocrinologist Andrea Prader . The Prader scale [149] and Quigley scale are visual rating systems that measure genital appearance.  Other signs [ edit ]  In order to help in classification, methods other than a genitalia inspection can be performed. For instance, a karyotype display of a tissue sample may determine which of the causes of intersex is prevalent in the case.  Causes [ edit ]  Main article: Sexual differentiation  The common pathway of sexual differentiation , where a productive human female has an XX chromosome pair, and a productive male has an XY pair, is relevant to the development of intersex conditions.  During fertilization, the sperm adds either an X (female) or a Y (male) chromosome to the X in the ovum. This determines the genetic sex of the embryo. [150] During the first weeks of development, genetic male and female fetuses are "anatomically indistinguishable", with primitive gonads beginning to develop during approximately the sixth week of gestation. The gonads, in a "bipotential state", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events. [150] Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.  At around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In normal female differentiation, the Müllerian duct system develops into the uterus , Fallopian tubes , and inner third of the vagina. In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone MIH causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the Wolffian duct system , which develops into the vas deferens , seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts. [150] By birth, the typical fetus has been completely "sexed" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.  Conditions [ edit ]  Further information: disorders of sex development  There are a variety of opinions on what conditions or traits are and are not intersex, dependent on the definition of intersex that is used. Current human rights based definitions stress a broad diversity of sex characteristics that differ from expectations for male or female bodies. [2] During 2015, the Council of Europe , [51] the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights [133] and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights [134] have called for a review of medical classifications on the basis that they presently impede enjoyment of the right to health ; the Council of Europe expressed concern that "the gap between the expectations of human rights organisations of intersex people and the development of medical classifications has possibly widened over the past decade". [51] [133] [134]    List of conditions    Sex chromosomes  Name  Description    XX  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  The most common cause of sexual ambiguity is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands produce abnormally high levels of virilizing hormones in utero. The genes that cause CAH can now be detected in the developing embryo. As Fausto-Sterling mentioned in chapter 3 of Sexing the Body , "a woman who suspects she may be pregnant with a CAH baby (if she or someone in her family carries CAH) can undergo treatment and then get tested." To prevent an XX-CAH child's genitalia from becoming masculinized, a treatment, which includes the use of the steroid dexamethasone, must begin as early as four weeks after formation. Many do not favor this process because "the safety of this experimental therapy has not been established in rigorously controlled trials", it does allow physicians to detect abnormalities, therefore starting treatment right after birth. Starting treatment as soon as an XX-CAH baby is born not only minimizes, but also may even eliminate the chances of genital surgery from being performed. [137] However, the necessity of such surgery itself is disputed. Meta-analysis of the studies supporting the use of dexamethasone on CAH at-risk fetuses found "less than one half of one percent of published 'studies' of this intervention were regarded as being of high enough quality to provide meaningful data for a meta-analysis. Even these four studies were of low quality" ... "in ways so slipshod as to breach professional standards of medical ethics" [151] and "there were no data on long-term follow-up of physical and metabolic outcomes in children exposed to dexamethasone". [152]  In XX-females, this can range from partial masculinization that produces a large clitoris, to virilization and male appearance. The latter applies in particular to congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency , which is the most common form of CAH.  Individuals born with XX chromosomes affected by 17α-hydroxylase deficiency are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.  See below for XY CAH 17α-hydroxylase deficiency.     XX  Progestin-induced virilisation  In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by the use of progestin , a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals normally have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males. [153]    XX  Freemartinism  This condition occurs commonly in all species of cattle and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the placentae of fraternal twins usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a freemartin is very like a normal female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a castrated male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs – in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop normally as in other mammals.    XY  Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)  People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees. Cases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a vagina and no uterus , cervix , or ovaries , and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.  In mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as clitoromegaly , or a small penis, which is called micropenis or microphallus; hypospadias and cryptorchidism may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.     XY  5-alpha-reductase deficiency (5-ARD)  The condition affects individuals with a Y chromosome , making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS. [154] Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth. Such individuals are usually raised as girls. The lack of DHT also limits the development of facial hair.    XY  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  In individuals with a Y chromosome (typically XY) who have Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency , CAH inhibits virilization, unlike cases without a Y chromosome.    XY  Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (PMDS)  The child has XY chromosomes typical of a male. The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce Müllerian inhibiting factor during fetal development.    XY  Anorchia  Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce gametes necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to gender dysphoria , as anorchic individuals are typically assigned male at birth .    XY  Gonadal dysgenesis  It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whose gonads don't develop properly. Clinical features are heterogeneous. [137]    XY  Hypospadias  It is caused by various causes, including alterations in testosterone metabolism. The urethra does not run to the tip of the penis. In mild forms, the opening is just shy of the tip; in moderate forms, it is along the shaft; and in severe forms, it may open at the base of the penis. [155]    Other  Unusual chromosomal sex  In addition to the most common XX and XY chromosomal sexes, there are several other possible combinations, for example Turner syndrome ( XO ), Triple X syndrome (XXX), Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) and variants ( XXYY , XXXY , XXXXY ), XYY syndrome , de la Chapelle syndrome ( XX male ), Swyer syndrome (XY female).    Other  Mosaicism and chimerism  A mix can occur, where some of the cells of the body have the common XX or XY, while some have one of the less usual chromosomal contents above. Such a mixture is caused by either mosaicism or chimerism . In mosaicism, the mixture is caused by a mutation in one of the cells of the embryo after fertilization, whereas chimerism is a fusion of two embryos. In alternative fashion, it is simply a mixture between XX and XY, and does not have to involve any less-common genotypes in individual cells. This, too, can occur both as chimerism and as a result of one sex chromosome having mutated into the other. [156]  Mosaicism and chimerism may involve chromosomes other than the sex chromosomes, and not result in intersex traits.     Other  True hermaphroditism and ovotestis  A " true hermaphrodite " is defined as someone with both testicular and ovarian tissue. Though naturally occurring true hermaphroditism in humans is unknown, there is, on the other hand, a spectrum of forms of ovotestes . The varieties include having two ovotestes or one ovary and one ovotestis, often in the form of streak gonads . Phenotype is not determinable from the ovotestes; in some cases, the appearance is "fairly typically female"; in others, it is "fairly typically male", and it may also be "fairly in-between in terms of genital development." [157] Intersex activist Cheryl Chase is an example of someone with ovotestes. [158]    Medical interventions [ edit ]     Hong Kong intersex activist Small Luk    Main article: Intersex medical interventions  Further information: History of intersex surgery  Rationales [ edit ]  Medical interventions take place to address physical health concerns, and psychosocial risks. Both types of rationale are the subject of debate, particularly as the consequences of surgical (and many hormonal) interventions are lifelong and irreversible. Questions regarding physical health include accurately assessing risk levels, necessity and timing. Psychosocial rationales are particularly susceptible to questions of necessity as they reflect social and cultural concerns.  There remains no clinical consensus about an evidence base, surgical timing, necessity, type of surgical intervention, and degree of difference warranting intervention. [159] [160] [161] Such surgeries are the subject of significant contention due to consequences that include trauma, impact on sexual function and sensation, and violation of rights to physical and mental integrity. [1] This includes community activism, [40] and multiple reports by international human rights [19] [51] [23] [162] and health [72] institutions and national ethics bodies. [22] [163]  In the cases where gonads may pose a cancer risk, as in some cases of androgen insensitivity syndrome , [164] concern has been expressed that treatment rationales and decision-making regarding cancer risk may encapsulate decisions around a desire for surgical normalization. [21]  Types [ edit ]   Feminizing and masculinizing surgeries : Surgical procedures depend on diagnosis, and there is often concern as to whether surgery should be performed at all. Typically, surgery is performed shortly after birth. Defenders of the practice argue that it is necessary for individuals to be clearly identified as male or female in order for them to function socially and develop normally. Psychosocial reasons are often stated. [12] This is criticised by many human rights institutions, and authors. Unlike other aesthetic surgical procedures performed on infants, such as corrective surgery for a cleft lip , genital surgery may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life, or feelings of freakishness and unacceptability. [165]  Hormone treatment : There is widespread evidence of prenatal testing and hormone treatment to prevent or eliminate intersex traits, [166] [167] associated also with the problematization of sexual orientation and gender non-conformity. [166] [168]  Psychosocial support : All stakeholders support psychosocial support. A joint international statement by participants at the Third International Intersex Forum in 2013 sought, amongst other demands: "Recognition that medicalization and stigmatisation of intersex people result in significant trauma and mental health concerns. In view of ensuring the bodily integrity and well-being of intersex people, autonomous non-pathologising psycho-social and peer support be available to intersex people throughout their life (as self-required), as well as to parents and/or care providers."  Genetic selection and terminations : The ethics of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to select against intersex traits was the subject of 11 papers in the October 2013 issue of the American Journal of Bioethics . [169] There is widespread evidence of pregnancy terminations arising from prenatal testing, as well as prenatal hormone treatment to prevent intersex traits. Behrmann and Ravitsky find social concepts of sex, gender and sexual orientation to be "intertwined on many levels. Parental choice against intersex may thus conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity." [111]  Gender dysphoria : The DSM-5 included a change from using gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria. This revised code now specifically includes intersex people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth and experience clinically significant distress or impairment, using the language of disorders of sex development . [170] This move was criticised by intersex advocacy groups in Australia and New Zealand . [171]  Medical photography and display : Photographs of intersex children's genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes. Problems associated with medical photography of intersex children have been discussed due to experiences of humiliation and powerlessness by child subjects, [172] along with their ethics, control and usage.

I am morbidly fascinated ever since I discovered she had a penis.  <-----I am 100% female.  I googled it and got answers ranging from 1/1000 to one in 6 million.  I just think it has to be so rare... she sounds like a woman but she has a penis.

Gaga said:  “It’s not something that I’m ashamed of, just isn’t something that I go around telling everyone. Yes. I have both male and female genitalia, but I consider myself a female. It’s just a little bit of a penis and really doesn’t interfere much with my life. The reason I haven’t talked about it is that it’s not a big deal to me. Like come on, it’s not like we all go around talking about our vags. I think this is a great opportunity to make other multiple gendered people feel more comfortable with their bodies. I’m sexy, I’m hot. I have both a poon and a peener. Big f*cking deal.”    I will not include the captioned picture..                    08-20-2009, 05:28 PM    #19        pie89     View Profile     View Forum Posts      gangster of 3.14(89)       Join Date: Jun 2009  Location: Australia  Age: 28  Posts: 1,147  Rep Power: 0                                 Originally Posted by vagiweener    wait wut?    lol!!!!     fatmorph                       08-20-2009, 05:30 PM    #20        mooseknuckles     View Profile     View Forum Posts      Registered User       Join Date: Dec 2006  Posts: 1,451  Rep Power: 641                           When I worked at the prison there was one in ad. seg.

Question: "What does the Bible say about hermaphrodites?" Answer: Babies that are born with both male and female sexual organs, or characteristics of both organs, are called hermaphrodites or intersex. A child who is in an intersexual state is classified in one of three categories: 1) true hermaphrodite – an infant born with both ovaries and testicles and has both male and female sex organs. 2) female pseudohermaphrodite – a genetic female with male external sex organs. 3) male pseudohermaphrodite – a genetic male with external sex organs that fail to develop properly, resulting in female or male/female physical characteristics. In times past, doctors would perform surgeries without first testing the infant to find out its true sex, and the child would sometimes grow up very obviously a man, with female genitalia. Now, specialists can perform an ultrasound, blood test, chromosome analysis, and even do exploratory surgery to find out the baby's true sex. The treatment is still controversial, however. Some believe that surgery and/or hormonal therapy should begin within the first 15 months of life, and others believe these things should be put off until the child is old enough to make his or her own decision about it. There are pros and cons for each side. Either way, any family with an intersexual infant should begin counseling, as should the child when he or she is old enough. When babies are developing in the womb, they all begin with sex organs that look female. If the baby is male, he begins to produce testosterone, and if the hormone reaches the tissues correctly, the external genitals become a scrotum and penis. Chromosomal or sex hormone abnormalities can produce an infant in an intersexual state. It can also be caused by a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is a disease that blocks the baby's metabolism. It is not as uncommon as we might think; about 1 in every 2,000 newborns is born in an intersexual state. Babies are not born with physical disorders to punish their parents in any way. Although God created the earth perfectly, it soon brought destruction upon itself with the onset of human sin (Romans 5:12). Before the Flood in Genesis chapter 7 that wiped out almost all living things on the earth, people had the potential to live for several hundred years. After the Flood, human life spans grew progressively shorter, indicating a change in the environment which resulted in damage to the human genetic structure. This also explains why incest was necessary for the population of the earth in Genesis, but was forbidden later in the laws of Leviticus (18:6-18). Now, thousands of years later as sin continues to permeate the world, the human race has been bombarded with every kind of sickness, disease, disorder and birth defect we can imagine. It is very possible for a child born with both sex organs to grow up to have a healthy view of sexuality and successful relationships. From early on, the child should be taught how valuable, loved and accepted he is by his family and also by God. He or she is not a victim of divine judgment, but God has a plan for each one of us that will bring Him glory, as we can learn from a man who was healed by Jesus Christ: “'Teacher,' his disciples asked him, 'why was this man born blind? Was it a result of his own sins or those of his parents?' 'It was not because of his sins or his parents' sins,' Jesus answered. 'He was born blind so the power of God could be seen in him'” (John 9:2-3).

An Explanation of the Stats.  By Hida | April 1, 2015    The most thorough existing research finds intersex people to constitute an estimated 1.7% of the population*, which makes being intersex about as common as having red hair (1%-2%). However, popularly misinterpretted, much referenced statistics would have you believe are numbers are much lower. Here’s why.  Some groups use an old prevalence statistic that says we make up 1 in 2000, or .05%, percent of the population, but that statistic refers to one specific intersex trait, ambiguous genitalia, which is but one of many variations which, combined (as they are in medical diagnostics and coding), constitute the 1.7% estimate by esteemed Professor of Biology and Gender Studies, Anne Fausto-Sterling, of Brown University*. A similar, slightly higher, statistic was also reported in, “How Sexually Dimorphic Are We?”, by Blackless, et al, in The American Journal of Human Biology. “The belief that Homo sapiens is absolutely dimorphic with the respect to sex chromosome composition, gonadal structure, hormone levels, and the structure of the internal genital duct systems and external genitalia, derives from the platonic ideal that for each sex there is a single, universally correct developmental pathway and outcome. We surveyed the medical literature from 1955 to the present for studies of the frequency of deviation from the ideal male or female. We conclude that this frequency may be as high as 2% of live births. The frequency of individuals receiving “corrective” genital surgery, however, probably runs between 1 and 2 per 1,000 live births (0.1–0.2%).” Am. J. Hum. Biol. 12:151–166, 2000. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6300(200003/04)12:2%3C151::AID-AJHB1%3E3.0.CO;2-F/abstract These two findings are the most thorough scientific research which exists on the statistical prevalence of congenital intersex traits in humans.  The erroneous belief that we are an extremely tiny percentage of the population is often used to dismiss our need for legal rights and protections. Thus, we encourage everyone — particularly allies and/or members of the press educating others about intersex people — to please use the information and prevalence statistic provided here to accurately do so.

ISBN 0-465-07713-7. . * The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA), 1993-2008, popularized the “1 in 2000″ (.05%) statistic, but clarified on its website : “Here’s what we do know: If you ask experts at medical centers how often a child is born so noticeably atypical in terms of genitalia that a specialist in sex differentiation is called in, the number comes out to about 1 in 1500 to 1 in 2000 births. But a lot more people than that are born with subtler forms of sex anatomy variations, some of which won’t show up until later in life.

How porn addiction can affect your sex life         What is hermaphrodism and is it something that should be 'treated'? A hermaphrodite (or intersexed person ) is someone who has some or all of the primary sex characteristics of both genders (for example, a penis and a vulva). There are three types of hermaphrodites: true, male pseudo and female pseudo. A true hermaphrodite is someone who has both ovary and testicular tissue. The genitalia can vary from completely male or female, to a combination of both or even ambiguous looking. Female pseudo means that a person has XX chromosomes with normal female internal organs but with masculanised genitalia, while male psuedo means that person is born with XY chromosomes. Such a person has testes which are usually hidden in the abdominal cavity. The external genitalia are usually female. The situation in South Africa In South Africa, as in the rest of the world, hermaphrodite babies are not unusual. The first two questions parents ask when their baby is born, are '"'Is it a girl or boy?' and 'Is everything OK?' In the case of hermaphrodite babies, both questions are difficult to answer, even though these babies are usually perfectly healthy in all other respects," says Dr Philip Henning, a paediatrician at the Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town. “There is a fair amount of societal pressure on parents and doctors to make a decision one way or another. When surgery or hormonal treatment is considered, many factors are taken into account. The dominant sex of the baby is determined using many tests, including chromosome tests, urine tests and ultrasound to determine the internal genitalia of the baby. "The baby’s appearance is considered, and all factors are considered before this life-changing decision gets made. In many cases, hormonal treatment is sufficient and no surgery is needed,” Henning added. Many hermaphrodite babies have an extra sex chromosome, making them babies with 47 chromosomes instead of 46, including a XXY pair instead of either XX (female), or XY (male). These children thus have two X-chromosomes (like a normal female), as well as a XY-pair (like a normal male). With a Y-chromosome present, the babies have testes and will produce testosterone, with the likelihood of a male orientation. The possibilities of modern surgery There always have been such babies, but it wasn't until the post-World War II years that the American medical community developed the skills and tools to surgically correct genital abnormalities. Surgery soon became routine for the one in 2 000 children born with a genital malformation. But now many experts would like to see a change in that routine. They contend that surgery should be put off until the child is old enough to have a say in the matter. "The surgery isn't actually done for the baby," says Cheryl Chase, founder and executive director of the Intersex Society of North America. "They do it, because they think it's disturbing to the parents." "When a child is born with unusual genitals, the doctors take over," Chase says. "They say, 'We can fix it.' Parents don't have any information." "The problem is, doctors aren't necessarily the people in our society who have a special understanding of sexual issues or emotionally difficult issues," she says. 'Protecting kids from ridicule' The medical establishment generally has defended the surgeries, saying that intersex children would be ridiculed for not conforming to societal expectations of genital appearance. But critics don’t agree. "Some kids are born with big ears," says Alice Dreger, an assistant professor of science and technology studies at Michigan State University who has researched extensively on intersex issues. "Do we say, 'My God, this kid can't survive with big ears?’" The birth of a hermaphrodite baby, Dreger says, is not a medical emergency, but a psycho/social emergency. "But we almost never call in a psychologist," she says. "We call in a surgeon." Surgery's serious side effects Surgeries and hormonal treatments are not reversible, she notes, and that can cause problems if adults don't fit the sex chosen for them in infancy. Surgery also can have side effects such as incontinence or a loss of sexual sensation. Dreger proposes that hermaphrodites be treated as an anatomical variation, like differences in skin or hair colour, rather than as an abnormality. Families of hermaphrodite children should receive psychological support , she says, and early surgery should be done only when there's a real medical concern, like urinary infection. Dr William Reiner performed nearly 100 genital reconstructive surgeries at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore before deciding to look at the psychology of intersex. He went back to school to get certified as a psychiatrist and now counsels intersex patients and their families as a professor of child and adolescent psychology at Johns Hopkins. He, too, has become an advocate for delaying genital surgery on hermaphrodite babies. Society's beliefs and genital surgery "I think people are hung up about genitalia and sexuality," Reiner says. "We get mixed up, and these things scare us in some way. It may stimulate a drive to correct, a drive to make things right. Paediatric surgeons see all kinds of anomalies, and they are trained to make those anomalies normal." But Reiner doesn't blame surgeons, saying they merely reflect the beliefs of society. "We can't really blame this all on medicine," he says. "Part of it is a social problem. We have treated science as if it possesses the truth. It doesn't. Science is just a model." "But we thought we were finding the truth," he says. "We thought we were God. We didn't realise that you can't make anybody anything. They are what they are." "Philosophers have known for thousands of years that identity is built in, but in the last half of the 20th century, we thought identity could be created by society," Reiner says. Nature, not nurture In two studies, Reiner and other Johns Hopkins researchers found that prenatal exposure to normal male hormones determines male gender, even in chromosomal males born without a penis. The researchers studied 27 genetically male children born with testicles but no penis, 25 of whom had been castrated at birth, "reassigned" and raised as females. All 27 children showed strong male behaviours, and the majority reassigned themselves as males between the ages of 5 and 16. "Rather than the environment forming these children's gender identity , their identity and gender role seem to have developed despite a total environment telling them they are female," Reiner says. "They seem to be quite capable of telling us who they are." The two children in the study who weren't reassigned as females at birth were developmentally more like their male peers and psychologically better adjusted than the sex-reassigned children, the study shows. "The solution is to leave them alone," Reiner says. "Most of them, by the time they're of kindergarten age, will figure out who they are." And there still will be a role for surgeons. "Eventually, they are almost all going to want surgical reconstruction," Reiner says. "So surgeons are still going to be reconstructing these kids." "But instead of doing it at two days, two weeks or two months, it's going to be later," he says. "Will the surgeries be more difficult? Sure. But that's life." "Better to have a difficult surgery on a 15-year-old than a beautiful surgical outcome on a one-year-old that turns out to be the wrong sex," he says.

\n   Answer    \n. 
\nIndeed, there are chances even with a properly carried out vasectomy. A family friend conceived at 43 after her husband had this surgery. She was told that her chances of conceiving were about 1 in 3,000 and then another doctor told her 1 in 5,000. I have also talked to a reliable (many-times certified) MD who said it was about 1 in 250,000 chances. Apparently, this number isn't a certain statistic, but the obvious factors are (1) that conceiving is probable, and (2) the chances of this are rare.

Marie Curie      I am having a baby?  If you think you are pregnant or may be pregnant, get a pregnancy test kit from the pharmacy or go to your doctor to get tested. You should find out as soon as possible so you and your baby can start getting prenatal care.     In general no! I'm not saying it's completely impossible but it is not likely at all. The main reason being most girls don't start their period until they are at the youngest 11. and most girls don't start ovulating until about a year after their first period. However I have heard of a girl as young as eight having a baby, so five may not be completely impossible. However, a five year old is too young to make the concious decision to have sexual intercourse so therefore  no  five year old should ever get pregnant.    the male would also have to have to have hit puperty and i never heard of a 5 year old that's has puperty yet. so yes it is impossable               Susie Dresh  256,581 Contributions      If a baby boy is born without testicles a hermaphrodite or can he develop testicles later?

Hi,    The chances of you & your partner/wife having twins because you're a twin yourself increases the chances a little, however, It doesn't mean that you will NO DOUGHT have twins, it just increases the chances.    For example, I'm 13 and we're from Easterhouse in Glasgow, and I'm an identical triplet, me & my two triplet brothers were born on 25th December 1997, but that does not mean I will have twins/triplets/quads with my wife when I'm older, it stays the same because I'm identical with my brothers. Only fraternal twins/triplets increase the chances.    So you might have twins, you might not! But your just a little more prone to twins & triplets because your one yourself.  For some reason, if your an identical twin, your chances do not increase any because the genes are exactly the same between u and ur twin. But as I'm identical with my triplets, it won't increase my chances any.    P.S. Hope this helps from thetroublesomethree            Can hermaphrodites have babies?

Avid0g  914 Contributions      What are the odds at 17 of having a baby with Down syndrome?  If you are worried or concerned then you should try and speak to a medical professional. There are tests and screenings available between 11 & 20 weeks; the results of these are not always conclusive. Speak to a doctor who will be able to advise you.    The male contributes about 5% of the risk, statistically.    The female contribution of risk increases with her age. A woman's statistical risk at age 20 is 1 in 1529, so a 17 year old should be safer - much less than 1/10 of 1%.    Since this disease is linked to accumulating damage to the parents egg and/or sperm, you should also consider personal exposure to mutagens/radiation or dietary deficiencies.    Oddly enough, immediately after a Down syndrome birth, a higher risk  drops  to about 1% for subsequent pregnancies, indicating some kind of repair or elimination of defective cells. This is the same risk faced by 40 year old women.            If are having a baby and you get a pregnancy shot what will it do to the baby?

Jamesgrant  1,136 Contributions      What are the odds of having a baby with 3 very rare diseases?  If you know nothing about the parents' risk for these diseases or other contributing factors (race, environment, etc.), then the answer depends solely on the probabilities of getting any one of those diseases.    Let's say the risks are P1, P2 and P3 where P1 is the probability of the baby having rare disease #1 and so on. A probability of 1 is a sure thing and 0 means no chance, so the probability of a rare disease is a number slightly greater than 0.    The risk of getting disease #1 AND #2 AND #3 is the product: P1xP2xP3.    If, for example, the each risk is one in a million (P1=P2=P3=0.000001), then the odds of having a baby with all three is 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.    The math changes severely if one of the parents is at risk for the disease. Let's say the mother has one gene that causes the disease #1. Then P1 is no longer 1 in a million, it is 0.5. If the parent's racial group is afflicted with P2=0.001 as well, then P=0.5x0.001x0.000001=0.000000005, which is 500,000 the risk of others.
