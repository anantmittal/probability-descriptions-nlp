 Newsletter Cysts and Ovarian Cancer Medically reviewed by Monica Bien, PA-C on  November 7, 2016 — Written by Ann Pietrangelo Types Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Outlook What are ovarian cysts?   Just because you’ve had an ovarian cyst or tumor doesn’t mean you have, or will develop, ovarian cancer. Many women get ovarian cysts or benign ovarian tumors at some point during their reproductive years. Most will never develop ovarian cancer.  Your ovaries are small organs located deep within your pelvis. Eggs grow inside them, within a sac or follicle. During ovulation an egg is released from its sac into one of your fallopian tubes. After that, the sac typically dissolves, but sometimes the sac can remain and fill with air or fluid to develop into a cyst. Cysts that form in or around your ovaries often go unnoticed. They may cause only mild symptoms or no noticeable symptoms at all.  It’s relatively rare, but some ovarian cysts are malignant, or cancerous. Fortunately, most are benign, or not cancerous. Your doctor’s recommended treatment plan will depend on the type of ovarian cyst or tumor that you have, as well as your symptoms. Oftentimes they won’t require any treatment.  Types Types
of ovarian cysts  Cysts that form during your menstrual cycle are called functional cysts. There are two types of functional ovarian cysts: follicle and corpus luteum cysts. Follicle cysts form when an egg fails to break out of its sac. These types of cysts usually disappear on their own within one to three months. Corpus luteum cysts develop when a sac closes up after releasing its egg, allowing fluid to accumulate inside. These cysts usually resolve on their own in a few weeks.   Sometimes, eggs mature in their sacs but are never released. As your menstrual cycle repeats, the sacs may grow larger and develop into multiple cysts. This condition is known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  There are other types of ovarian cysts and tumors too. For example:  Ovarian endometriomas can develop if you have endometriosis, a condition that causes the endometrial tissue lining your uterus to grow in other areas of your body. If this tissue attaches to one of your ovaries, an ovarian endometrioma can form. Ovarian cystadenomas are liquid-filled cysts that develop from cells on the surface of your ovary. While most are benign, some cystadenomas are cancerous. Ovarian dermoid cysts, or teratomas, are made up of a variety of different cell types. They’re a type of ovarian germ cell tumor. Usually these tumors are benign, but occasionally they can be malignant.  It’s most common for these types of benign cysts to develop during your reproductive years or after you start menstruating. It’s less common to develop an ovarian cyst before you experience your first menstrual period or after menopause has taken place. If it does happen, your doctor may want to investigate further.

Symptoms can range from mild to severe. They can include abdominal bloating and pressure, painful intercourse, and frequent urination. Some women experience menstrual irregularities, unusual hair growth, or fevers.  Like noncancerous ovarian cysts, cancerous tumors sometimes cause no or only minor symptoms at first. They’re typically hard to feel, even during a physical exam. That’s why it’s difficult to detect early-stage ovarian cancer.   Symptoms of ovarian cancer are similar to those of ovarian cysts. They can include:   abdominal swelling or bloating  abdominal pressure and pain  feeling overstuffed or having trouble eating  frequent or urgent urination  menstrual irregularities  painful intercourse   If you have symptoms associated with ovarian cysts or ovarian cancer, see your doctor as soon as possible.  Diagnosis How are ovarian
cysts and ovarian cancer diagnosed?  In some cases, you may not know that you have an ovarian cyst or tumor until your doctor detects it during a routine pelvic exam. In other cases, you might experience signs or symptoms first, which will lead to imagining studies that reveal an ovarian cyst or tumor. If you notice signs or symptoms, make an appointment with your doctor.  If your doctor suspects that you have an ovarian cyst or tumor, they will likely order imaging tests to examine your ovaries. Oftentimes imaging tests like ultrasound or MRI can determine if an ovarian cyst or tumor is benign or malignant. They may also want to test your blood for CA-125, a tumor marker, or preform a biopsy if there is any question. High levels of CA-125 may indicate the presence of ovarian cancer.  To confirm or rule out ovarian cancer, your doctor may perform a biopsy. They will collect a sample of the cyst or tumor for analysis under a microscope. This will help them determine if it’s cancerous.  Treatment Treating ovarian
cysts and ovarian cancer  In many cases, ovarian cysts resolve on their own without treatment. If you have an ovarian cyst that doesn’t go away on its own, or one that’s causing you pain, your doctor may recommend surgical removal. This can usually be accomplished without damaging your ovary or affecting fertility.  If you’re diagnosed with ovarian cancer, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following treatment options:  chemotherapy radiation surgery  There’s no known way to prevent ovarian cysts.  Outlook Outlook
for ovarian cysts and cancer  Your long-term outlook will depend on your diagnosis. Most ovarian cysts resolve within a few months, often without treatment. The outlook for ovarian cancer varies, depending on its stage and type.  It’s important to report unusual symptoms to your doctor immediately. The sooner you know what’s going on, the better. If you have ovarian cancer, your outlook will be better if it’s diagnosed and treated in its early stages.  Ovarian cancer is rare in young women. According to the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund Alliance , the median age of a diagnosis is 63. Your lifetime risk of developing it is about one in 75. Your risk could be higher if you have a strong family history of ovarian cancer or if you carry certain genetic mutations. Your lifetime risk of dying from ovarian cancer is about 1 in 100.

Build Number: 12823 Newsletter Complex Ovarian Cysts: What You Should Know Medically reviewed by Michael Weber, MD on  June 27, 2016 — Written by Ann Pietrangelo Symptoms Causes Risk factors Diagnosis Treatments Complications Outlook What are ovarian cysts?  Ovarian cysts are sacs that form on or inside the ovary. A fluid-filled ovarian cyst is a simple cyst. A complex ovarian cyst contains solid material or blood.  Simple cysts  Simple cysts are common. They develop when your ovary fails to release an egg or when a follicle in your ovary continues to grow after an egg has been released. Because they form due to your normal menstrual cycle , they’re also called functional cysts. Functional cysts usually have no symptoms. They tend to resolve on their own within a few menstrual cycles.  Complex cysts  Complex cysts aren’t related to your normal menstrual cycle, and they’re less common. The following are three common types of complex ovarian cysts:  Dermoid cysts are made up of cells you had since before you were born. Your body uses these cells to produce dermal tissue so they may contain fat, skin, hair, or even teeth. Cystadenomas contain ovarian tissue with fluid or mucus. Endometriomas form when cells from your uterine lining grow outside of your uterus and in or on your ovaries.  It’s rare, but ovarian cysts can be malignant. Most ovarian cysts are benign , especially those that develop before menopause.  Symptoms What are the symptoms?   It’s possible to have small ovarian cysts and not have any symptoms. Some of the more common symptoms of ovarian cysts include:  bloating or pressure in your lower abdomen lower abdominal pain nausea and vomiting if the cyst is twisting an ovary frequent urination if the cyst is large enough to press on your bladder sudden, severe pain if the cyst ruptures  Seek immediate medical attention if you have a fever, vomiting, or severe abdominal pain.  If you have endometriomas, the symptoms may include:  painful periods pain during intercourse painful urination and bowel movements during your period fatigue nausea diarrhea constipation fertility problems   Causes What causes complex ovarian cysts?   It’s often not possible to determine the cause of an ovarian cyst.  Functional cysts occur due to a minor problem, usually involving hormones, in your normal menstrual cycle. Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) is a condition that causes many small, simple ovarian cysts. The exact cause is unknown, but it involves a hormone imbalance .  Read more: What you should know about PCOS and pregnancy »  Endometriomas occur due to a condition called endometriosis , which causes cells from your uterine lining to grow outside of the uterus, including on your ovaries.  Cancerous cysts develop when mutated ovarian cells begin to grow and reproduce.  Risk factors Who is at risk for ovarian cysts?   Ovarian cysts are quite common in women who ovulate. You’re less likely to develop cysts after menopause. If you do develop an ovarian cyst after menopause, it increases your risk for ovarian cancer.  About 8 percent of premenopausal women have a cyst that’s large enough to need treatment.  Diagnosis How are complex ovarian cysts diagnosed?   If you’re experiencing symptoms of a cyst, see your doctor. You’ll probably need a pelvic exam . If your doctor suspects you have a cyst, they may take a wait-and-see approach because most ovarian cysts clear up without treatment. You may also want to take a pregnancy test because pregnancy can cause similar abdominal symptoms.  Other diagnostic tests may include an ultrasound or a CT scan.  Ultrasound  An ultrasound uses sound waves to produce real-time images of your ovaries and the surrounding area. It’s fast, safe, and painless. If your doctor suspects an ovarian cyst, they’ll likely use a transvaginal ultrasound to help identify the cyst. For this type of ultrasound, you’ll lie on your back and put your feet in the stirrups. They’ll insert the transducer, which looks like a long rod, a few inches into your vagina to produce images of your ovaries and uterus. The transducer is smaller than the speculum your doctor uses for a Pap test . It only takes a few minutes. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it doesn’t usually cause pain.  Ultrasound imaging can help determine the location, size, and shape of a cyst. It may also be able to tell if the ovarian cyst is simple or complex.   Ask your doctor if you should arrive with a full or empty bladder. You may need to have one ultrasound done while you have a full bladder and then empty it before having a second one. Alternatively, they may ask you to arrive at the ultrasound appointment with your bladder already empty.  Blood tests  You might also have a blood tests for cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), which is a protein that can be high in women who have ovarian cancer. CA 125 can also be high if you have endometriosis or you’re menstruating. Other blood tests can help determine if you have hormone imbalances.  Learn more: Cysts and ovarian cancer »  Treatments How is a complex ovarian cyst treated?   Over-the-counter pain relievers may be all you need for a simple cyst. If you have a lot of pain or discomfort, your doctor may be able to prescribe something stronger.  Complex ovarian cysts may need further treatment. Five to 10 percent of women need surgery to remove an ovarian cyst. Thirteen to 21 percent of these cysts turn out to be cancerous.  You may need the cyst removed if it’s growing too large, is painful, or is causing some other problem.   Your doctor can remove some cysts using a small, lighted instrument called a laparoscope.  Your doctor can insert it into your abdomen through a tiny incision. They’ll do this while you’re under anesthesia. Your doctor can remove large or complex cysts that appear to be cancerous with traditional surgery. They can then test the cyst to see if it contains cancerous cells.  If you frequently develop ovarian cysts, your doctor may recommend hormonal birth control. This can help prevent ovulation and lower the chances of developing more cysts.  Treatment for endometriosis can include hormone therapy , pain medications, and surgery.  Complications What complications can occur?   Most simple ovarian cysts aren’t harmful.  Complex ovarian cysts, such as dermoids and cystadenomas, can grow too large. This can push your ovary out of place. It can also cause a painful condition called ovarian torsion , which means your ovary has become twisted. Cysts can also press against your bladder, causing frequent or urgent urination.  If a cyst ruptures it can cause:  severe abdominal pain a fever dizziness weakness rapid breathing vomiting bleeding  If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor.  Both endometriosis and PCOS can cause fertility problems. Most ovarian cysts aren’t cancerous, but complex ovarian cysts raise the risk of ovarian cancer.  Outlook What is the outlook?   The outlook is generally very good, especially for simple ovarian cysts. What you can expect with a complex ovarian cyst depends on the cause and treatment.  It’s unlikely that you’ll have any long-term health issues once you’ve recovered from surgical removal of a cyst.  Treatment for severe endometriosis can involve surgery and hormonal therapy. In some cases, it leaves scar tissue that can harm your internal organs. About 30 to 40 percent of women with unexplained fertility have endometriosis.  If you have ovarian cancer, your outlook depends on how far the cancer has spread. Treatment options include surgical removal of the ovary, chemotherapy , and radiation. The outlook is best when the doctor diagnoses and treats ovarian cancer in the early stages.

In fact, according to the American Cancer Society, only about 20 percent of cases are diagnosed at an early stage. Typically, this is because ovarian cancer symptoms either aren’t apparent in the early stages of the disease or they mimic common stomach and digestive issues that are often mistaken for minor ailments. Women are more likely to experience symptoms once the disease has spread beyond the ovaries.  Many people mistakenly believe that a Pap smear test can detect ovarian cancer. In fact, there is no reliable routine screening test for ovarian cancer, so women with a family history of the disease or other risk factors should talk to their doctor about genetic testing and other steps to monitor or help reduce their risk.

They may also want to test your blood for CA-125, a tumor marker, or preform a biopsy if there is any question. High levels of CA-125 may indicate the presence of ovarian cancer.  To confirm or rule out ovarian cancer, your doctor may perform a biopsy. They will collect a sample of the cyst or tumor for analysis under a microscope. This will help them determine if it’s cancerous.  Treatment Treating ovarian
cysts and ovarian cancer  In many cases, ovarian cysts resolve on their own without treatment. If you have an ovarian cyst that doesn’t go away on its own, or one that’s causing you pain, your doctor may recommend surgical removal. This can usually be accomplished without damaging your ovary or affecting fertility.  If you’re diagnosed with ovarian cancer, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following treatment options:  chemotherapy radiation surgery  There’s no known way to prevent ovarian cysts.  Outlook Outlook
for ovarian cysts and cancer  Your long-term outlook will depend on your diagnosis. Most ovarian cysts resolve within a few months, often without treatment. The outlook for ovarian cancer varies, depending on its stage and type.  It’s important to report unusual symptoms to your doctor immediately. The sooner you know what’s going on, the better. If you have ovarian cancer, your outlook will be better if it’s diagnosed and treated in its early stages.  Ovarian cancer is rare in young women. According to the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund Alliance , the median age of a diagnosis is 63. Your lifetime risk of developing it is about one in 75. Your risk could be higher if you have a strong family history of ovarian cancer or if you carry certain genetic mutations. Your lifetime risk of dying from ovarian cancer is about 1 in 100.

Just because you’ve had an ovarian cyst or tumor doesn’t mean you have, or will develop, ovarian cancer. Many women get ovarian cysts or benign ovarian tumors at some point during their reproductive years. Most will never develop ovarian cancer.  Your ovaries are small organs located deep within your pelvis. Eggs grow inside them, within a sac or follicle. During ovulation an egg is released from its sac into one of your fallopian tubes. After that, the sac typically dissolves, but sometimes the sac can remain and fill with air or fluid to develop into a cyst. Cysts that form in or around your ovaries often go unnoticed. They may cause only mild symptoms or no noticeable symptoms at all.  It’s relatively rare, but some ovarian cysts are malignant, or cancerous. Fortunately, most are benign, or not cancerous. Your doctor’s recommended treatment plan will depend on the type of ovarian cyst or tumor that you have, as well as your symptoms. Oftentimes they won’t require any treatment.  Types Types
of ovarian cysts  Cysts that form during your menstrual cycle are called functional cysts. There are two types of functional ovarian cysts: follicle and corpus luteum cysts. Follicle cysts form when an egg fails to break out of its sac. These types of cysts usually disappear on their own within one to three months. Corpus luteum cysts develop when a sac closes up after releasing its egg, allowing fluid to accumulate inside. These cysts usually resolve on their own in a few weeks.   Sometimes, eggs mature in their sacs but are never released. As your menstrual cycle repeats, the sacs may grow larger and develop into multiple cysts. This condition is known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  There are other types of ovarian cysts and tumors too. For example:  Ovarian endometriomas can develop if you have endometriosis, a condition that causes the endometrial tissue lining your uterus to grow in other areas of your body. If this tissue attaches to one of your ovaries, an ovarian endometrioma can form. Ovarian cystadenomas are liquid-filled cysts that develop from cells on the surface of your ovary. While most are benign, some cystadenomas are cancerous. Ovarian dermoid cysts, or teratomas, are made up of a variety of different cell types. They’re a type of ovarian germ cell tumor. Usually these tumors are benign, but occasionally they can be malignant.  It’s most common for these types of benign cysts to develop during your reproductive years or after you start menstruating. It’s less common to develop an ovarian cyst before you experience your first menstrual period or after menopause has taken place. If it does happen, your doctor may want to investigate further.  Read more: Ovarian cysts: Types, symptoms, and treatment »  Symptoms Symptoms of ovarian cysts and ovarian cancer  It’s possible to have an ovarian cyst and not realize it. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. They can include abdominal bloating and pressure, painful intercourse, and frequent urination. Some women experience menstrual irregularities, unusual hair growth, or fevers.  Like noncancerous ovarian cysts, cancerous tumors sometimes cause no or only minor symptoms at first. They’re typically hard to feel, even during a physical exam. That’s why it’s difficult to detect early-stage ovarian cancer.   Symptoms of ovarian cancer are similar to those of ovarian cysts.

CTCA,  April 30, 2014                                                                       While pain is a common symptom of a woman’s period, it might seem uncommon if you’re having persistent pelvic pain. It might come every month for a few months, then stop. Or you might feel it randomly throughout the month, with no association with your period at all.  In this age of self-diagnosis, pelvic pain is just a Google search away from a cancer diagnosis. In fact, many young women who experience pain in their lower abdomen may simply have a benign ovarian cyst. Ovarian cancer is rare during a woman’s childbearing years (most women with ovarian cancer are between ages 55 to 64). But ovarian cysts are quite common and the symptoms can be similar to those of ovarian cancer: pelvic pain, bloating, back pain and nausea or vomiting.  So how can you know the difference? It’s important to know about various types of ovarian cysts and understand the symptoms of ovarian cancer.  Most women with an ovarian cyst have what’s called a functional cyst and is associated with their menstrual cycle. These types of cysts develop during or after ovulation, which is when an egg may be released for conception.   Follicular cysts form before the egg is released. They usually take one to three months to go away on their own.  Corpus luteum cysts form after the egg is released. These cysts usually go away on their own in a few weeks.   Other types of cysts include:   Endometriomas: Women with endometriosis can develop this type of cyst. With endometriosis, tissue that looks and acts like the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. Cysts can develop when the tissue attaches to the ovary.  Cystadenomas: These cysts can be filled with fluid and can become large, causing pain.  Dermoid cysts: These cysts can be filled with seemingly odd materials such as hair, teeth and other tissues. They also can become large and cause pain.  Polycystic ovaries: Many cysts form when follicles do not release their eggs on a cyclical basis.   A pelvic exam is the first step toward diagnosing ovarian cysts or ovarian cancer. During the exam, your doctor may be able to feel the cyst manually. Either way, your doctor may order an ultrasound to determine the cysts’ size, shape, location and composition before deciding next steps, either watchful waiting or surgery.  The symptoms of ovarian cancer, though vague, can be more extensive than those of ovarian cysts. Along with the symptoms shared with ovarian cysts, possible signs of ovarian cancer include: difficulty eating or feeling full quickly; a feeling of heaviness in the lower abdomen or pelvis; constipation and increased gas; lack of appetite; and urinating more frequently.  Any symptoms associated with ovarian cancer should not be ignored. But if you are younger, they should be kept in perspective. If you have experienced any of the above symptoms, pay particular attention to bloating or a swollen belly, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, and pelvic pain or pelvic heaviness. See your gynecologist if these occur every day for more than few weeks.  Learn about ovarian cancer risk factors.

In fact, according to the American Cancer Society, only about 20 percent of cases are diagnosed at an early stage. Typically, this is because ovarian cancer symptoms either aren’t apparent in the early stages of the disease or they mimic common stomach and digestive issues that are often mistaken for minor ailments. Women are more likely to experience symptoms once the disease has spread beyond the ovaries.  Many people mistakenly believe that a Pap smear test can detect ovarian cancer. In fact, there is no reliable routine screening test for ovarian cancer, so women with a family history of the disease or other risk factors should talk to their doctor about genetic testing and other steps to monitor or help reduce their risk. Routine gynecologic care and annual pelvic exams are recommended to follow up on symptoms of ovarian cancer.

Ovarian Cancer  About Ovarian Cancer             What Is Ovarian Cancer?   Cancer starts when cells in the body begin to grow out of control. Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer, and can spread to other areas of the body. To learn more about how cancers start and spread, see What Is Cancer?  Ovarian cancer begins in the ovaries. Ovaries are reproductive glands found only in females (women). The ovaries produce eggs (ova) for reproduction. The eggs travel through the fallopian tubes into the uterus where the fertilized egg implants and develops into a fetus. The ovaries are also the main source of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. One ovary is on each side of the uterus in the pelvis.             The ovaries are made up of 3 main kinds of cells. Each type of cell can develop into a different type of tumor:   Epithelial tumors start from the cells that cover the outer surface of the ovary. Most ovarian tumors are epithelial cell tumors.  Germ cell tumors start from the cells that produce the eggs (ova).  Stromal tumors start from structural tissue cells that hold the ovary together and produce the female hormones estrogen and progesterone.   Most of these tumors are benign (non-cancerous) and never spread beyond the ovary. Benign tumors can be treated by removing either the ovary or the part of the ovary that contains the tumor.  Malignant (cancerous) or low malignant potential ovarian tumors can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body and can be fatal. Their treatment is discussed later in this document.  Epithelial ovarian tumors  Benign epithelial ovarian tumors  Most epithelial ovarian tumors are benign, don’t spread, and usually don’t lead to serious illness. There are several types of benign epithelial tumors including serous cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenomas, and Brenner tumors.  Tumors of low malignant potential  When looked at under the microscope, some ovarian epithelial tumors don’t clearly appear to be cancerous. These are called tumors of low malignant potential (LMP tumors). They are also known as borderline epithelial ovarian cancer . These are different from typical ovarian cancers because they don’t grow into the supporting tissue of the ovary (called the ovarian stroma ). Likewise, if they spread outside the ovary, for example, into the abdominal cavity (belly), they might grow on the lining of the abdomen but often don’t grow into it.  LMP tumors tend to affect younger women than the typical ovarian cancers. These tumors grow slowly and are less life-threatening than most ovarian cancers. LMP tumors can be fatal, but this isn’t common.  Malignant epithelial ovarian tumors  Cancerous epithelial tumors are called carcinomas . About 85% to 90% of ovarian cancers are epithelial ovarian carcinomas. When someone says that they had ovarian cancer, they usually mean that they had this type of cancer. These tumor cells have several features (when viewed under a microscope) that can be used to classify epithelial ovarian carcinomas into different types. The serous type is by far the most common, but there are other types like mucinous , endometrioid , and clear cell .  If the cells don't look like any of these 4 subtypes, the tumor is called undifferentiated . Undifferentiated epithelial ovarian carcinomas tend to grow and spread more quickly than the other types. Epithelial ovarian carcinomas are classified by these subtypes, but they are also given a grade and a stage .  The grade classifies the tumor based on how much it looks like normal tissue on a scale of 1, 2, or 3. Grade 1 epithelial ovarian carcinomas look more like normal tissue and tend to have a better prognosis (outlook). Grade 3 epithelial ovarian carcinomas look less like normal tissue and usually have a worse outlook. Grade 2 tumors look and act in between grades 1 and 3.  The tumor stage describes how far the tumor has spread from where it started in the ovary. Epithelial ovarian cancers tend to spread to the lining and organs of the pelvis and abdomen (belly) first. This may lead to the build-up of fluid in the abdominal cavity (called ascites ). As it becomes more advanced, it may spread to the lung and liver, or, rarely, to the brain, bones, or skin. Staging is explained in detail in a later section .  Other cancers that are similar to epithelial ovarian cancer  Primary peritoneal carcinoma  Primary peritoneal carcinoma (PPC) is a rare cancer closely related to epithelial ovarian cancer. At surgery, it looks the same as an epithelial ovarian cancer that has spread through the abdomen. Under a microscope, PPC also looks just like epithelial ovarian cancer. Other names for this cancer include extra-ovarian (meaning outside the ovary) primary peritoneal carcinoma (EOPPC) and serous surface papillary carcinoma .  PPC seems to develop from cells in the lining of the pelvis and abdomen. This lining is called the peritoneum . These cells are very similar to the cells on the surface of the ovaries. Some experts believe that PPC may start in the cells lining the fallopian tubes.  Like ovarian cancer, PPC tends to spread along the surfaces of the pelvis and abdomen, so it is often difficult to tell exactly where the cancer first started. This type of cancer can occur in women who still have their ovaries, but it is of more concern for women who have had their ovaries removed to prevent ovarian cancer. This cancer does rarely occur in men.  Symptoms of PPC are similar to those of ovarian cancer, including abdominal pain or bloating, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, and a change in bowel habits. Also, like ovarian cancer, PPC may elevate the blood level of a tumor marker called CA-125.  Women with PPC usually get the same treatment as those with widespread ovarian cancer. This could include surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible (a process called debulking that is discussed in the section about surgery ), followed by chemotherapy like that given for ovarian cancer. Its outlook is likely to be similar to widespread ovarian cancer.  Fallopian tube cancer  This is another rare cancer that is similar to epithelial ovarian cancer. It begins in the tube that carries an egg from the ovary to the uterus (the fallopian tube). Like PPC, fallopian tube cancer and ovarian cancer have similar symptoms. The treatment for fallopian tube cancer is much like that for ovarian cancer, but the outlook (prognosis) is slightly better.  Ovarian germ cell tumors  Germ cells usually form the ova or eggs in females and the sperm in males. Most ovarian germ cell tumors are benign, but some are cancerous and may be life threatening. Less than 2% of ovarian cancers are germ cell tumors. Overall, they have a good outlook, with more than 9 out of 10 patients surviving at least 5 years after diagnosis. There are several subtypes of germ cell tumors. The most common germ cell tumors are teratomas , dysgerminomas , endodermal sinus tumors , and choriocarcinomas . Germ cell tumors can also be a mix of more than a single subtype.  Teratoma  Teratomas are germ cell tumors with areas that, when seen under the microscope, look like each of the 3 layers of a developing embryo: the endoderm (innermost layer), mesoderm (middle layer), and ectoderm (outer layer). This germ cell tumor has a benign form called mature teratoma and a cancerous form called immature teratoma.  The mature teratoma is by far the most common ovarian germ cell tumor. It is a benign tumor that usually affects women of reproductive age (teens through forties). It is often called a dermoid cyst because its lining is made up of tissue similar to skin (dermis). These tumors or cysts can contain different kinds of benign tissues including, bone, hair, and teeth. The patient is cured by surgical removal of the cyst, but sometimes a new cyst develops later in the other ovary.  Immature teratomas are a type of cancer. They occur in girls and young women, usually younger than 18. These are rare cancers that contain cells that look like those from embryonic or fetal tissues such as connective tissue, respiratory passages, and brain. Tumors that are relatively more mature (called grade 1 immature teratoma ) and haven’t spread beyond the ovary are treated by surgical removal of the ovary. When they have spread beyond the ovary and/or much of the tumor has a very immature appearance (grade 2 or 3 immature teratomas), chemotherapy is recommended in addition to surgery.  Dysgerminoma  This type of cancer is rare, but it is the most common ovarian germ cell cancer . It usually affects women in their teens and twenties. Dysgerminomas are considered malignant (cancerous), but most don’t grow or spread very rapidly. When they are limited to the ovary, more than 75% of patients are cured by surgically removing the ovary, without any further treatment. Even when the tumor has spread further (or if it comes back later), surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy are effective in controlling or curing the disease in about 90% of patients.  Endodermal sinus tumor (yolk sac tumor) and choriocarcinoma  These very rare tumors typically affect girls and young women. They tend to grow and spread rapidly but are usually very sensitive to chemotherapy. Choriocarcinoma that starts in the placenta (during pregnancy) is more common than the kind that starts in the ovary. Placental choriocarcinomas usually respond better to chemotherapy than ovarian choriocarcinomas do.  Ovarian stromal tumors  About 1% of ovarian cancers are ovarian stromal cell tumors. More than half of stromal tumors are found in women older than 50, but about 5% of stromal tumors occur in young girls.  The most common symptom of these tumors is abnormal vaginal bleeding. This happens because many of these tumors produce female hormones (estrogen). These hormones can cause vaginal bleeding (like a period) to start again after menopause. In young girls, these tumors can also cause menstrual periods and breast development to occur before puberty.  Less often, stromal tumors make male hormones (like testosterone). If male hormones are produced, the tumors can cause normal menstrual periods to stop. They can also make facial and body hair grow. If the stromal tumor starts to bleed, it can cause sudden, severe abdominal pain.  Types of malignant (cancerous) stromal tumors include granulosa cell tumors (the most common type), granulosa-theca tumors, and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, which are usually considered low-grade cancers. Thecomas and fibromas are benign stromal tumors. Cancerous stromal tumors are often found at an early stage and have a good outlook, with more than 75% of patients surviving long-term.  Ovarian cysts  An ovarian cyst is a collection of fluid inside an ovary. Most ovarian cysts occur as a normal part of the process of ovulation (egg release) -- these are called functional cysts . These cysts usually go away within a few months without any treatment. If you develop a cyst, your doctor may want to check it again after your next cycle (period) to see if it has gotten smaller.  An ovarian cyst can be more concerning in a female who isn't ovulating (like a woman after menopause or a girl who hasn't started her periods), and the doctor may want to do more tests. The doctor may also order other tests if the cyst is large or if it does not go away in a few months. Even though most of these cysts are benign (not cancer), a small number of them could be cancer. Sometimes the only way to know for sure if the cyst is cancer is to take it out with surgery. Cysts that appear to be benign (based on how they look on imaging tests ) can be observed (with repeated physical exams and imaging tests), or removed with surgery.

The ovaries are a pair of small, almond-shaped organs in the female reproductive system. They are present in the female pelvis on the right and left of the uterus. They are responsible for releasing an egg on a monthly basis during a woman’s reproductive years. The egg can be subsequently fertilized by the sperm. One other important function of the ovaries is to produce the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormones are necessary for a woman’s menstrual cycle, pregnancy, if present, body shape, bone health and overall health.  WHAT IS A FUNCTIONAL OVARIAN CYST?  Before the egg is released from the ovary, it forms in a small fluid-filled sac called a follicle. The fluid protects the egg while it develops and is released with the egg during ovulation.  If the follicle does not break open and the fluid is not released, a follicular ovarian cyst may develop. If the follicle reseals after it bursts and the fluid re-accumulates, a corpus luteum cyst will then develop. Bleeding inside the follicle results in a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. These types of cysts are called functional cysts, as they may develop monthly during the normal function of the ovary. Functional cysts are the most common types of ovarian cysts, and they usually resolve within one to two months.  WHAT IS A BENIGN OVARIAN CYST OR TUMOR?  Ovarian cysts that are not part of a menstrual cycle are known as ovarian tumors. Some tumors can be cystic or filled with fluid, some can be solid, and some can have both cystic and solid components. Ovarian tumors usually do not resolve and require surgical removal.  The following are some of the more common ovarian cysts and tumors.   Dermoid Tumor – This tumor is also known as a Mature Cystic Teratoma and has both a cystic and solid component. It is filled with tissue from other parts of the body such as hair, teeth and fat. These tumors most commonly occur in teenage girls and young women.  Mucinous Cystadenoma – This is an ovarian cyst that contains mucous material. It is the most common benign ovarian tumor and can grow very large.  Serous Cystadenoma – This is an ovarian cyst that contains clear yellow fluid.  Endometrioma – This is also known as chocolate cyst. It is filled with endometriotic fluid, which has a thick brown consistency.  Fibroma – This is a solid ovarian tumor resembling a fibroid. It can often be mistaken for a pedunculated fibroid on the ultrasound or MRI.   WHAT IS PCOS?  Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a condition that causes the development of multiple small, benign cysts on the ovaries and is usually present due to hormonal imbalance. Other characteristics of this syndrome are irregular menstrual cycle, and elevated levels of male hormone causing excess facial and body hair.  WHAT IS A PELVIC MASS?  A pelvic mass is a general term for any growth or tumor on the ovary or in the pelvis. A pelvic mass can be cystic (cystadenoma), solid (fibroma), or both ( dermoid ). A pelvic mass can be benign or malignant.    Symptoms  WHAT ARE COMMON SYMPTOMS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE WITH AN OVARIAN CYST OR PELVIC MASS?  In most cases, ovarian cysts are small, harmless and produce no symptoms. In other cases, cysts may cause problems if they get larger, if they twist (ovarian torsion), or if they burst and cause internal bleeding. Immediate attention and treatment is then needed. If you have an ovarian cyst, you might experience any of the following symptoms:   Menstrual irregularities or abnormal bleeding  Dull ache in your lower back or thighs  Pelvic pain shortly before or after the beginning of your menstrual cycle  Pelvic pain with intercourse (dyspareunia)  Fullness or heaviness in your abdomen  Nausea, vomiting or bloating  Pressure on your bowel or pain during bowel movements  Difficulty emptying your bladder completely   It is always important to remember that some ovarian cysts may be cancerous. Although very rare in younger women during their reproductive years, the risk of ovarian cancer increases with age.    Diagnosis  HOW DO WE DIAGNOSE OVARIAN CYSTS?   Ultrasound: Examining an ovarian cyst via ultrasound will help determine proper diagnosis and management. Essentially, aspects examined include the shape (regular or irregular), the size, and the composition of the cyst. It is important to know whether a cyst is fluid-filled, solid or mixed. Fluid-filled cysts (commonly called simple cysts on an ultrasound) are not likely to be cancerous and most often require observation and close follow-up unless they are too large or causing disturbing symptoms. Those cysts that are solid or mixed (fluid-filled and solid) may require further evaluation to determine if cancer is present and most often require surgical treatment. These cysts are commonly called complex cysts on the ultrasound.  MRI: Usually reserved for solid tumors.  Blood tests: Pregnancy test, hormone levels and CA-125 may be necessary, depending on the characteristic of the cyst on the ultrasound.   WHAT DOES MY CA-125 RESULT MEAN?  CA-125 is a blood test that can be performed to rule out ovarian cancer. However, the results are often high in premenopausal women, because many other benign conditions can lead to an elevated CA-125 level. Endometriosis, fibroids, noncancerous ovarian cysts, infection, liver disease, and many other conditions can falsely elevate the value and give patients an unnecessary scare. The test is somewhat more effective in postmenopausal patients.    Treatment  In some cases, observation may be all that is necessary, especially for small, functional cysts causing no symptoms. For women who require removal of ovarian cysts or removal of the ovaries, including women seeking prophylactic oophorectomy to reduce future cancer risk, Advanced Laparoscopic Surgery offers fast solutions and nearly painless recovery.  SURGICAL TREATMENT OPTIONS  Laparoscopy is very effective for cysts or masses involving the ovaries or fallopian tubes. Benign (non-cancerous) cysts of the ovary can usually be removed, while preserving the ovary. Extremely large masses or endometriomas may require removal of the entire ovary and fallopian tube. Patients seeking cancer prevention due to increased genetic risk factors will also require complete removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes.  A decision to remove an ovary is based on the patient’s age, the likelihood of cancer, and the safety of the procedure. Every effort is made to preserve ovaries for patients who desire fertility. However, patients with suspected cancers, with family or personal history of breast or ovarian cancer, or with prior histories of ovarian pain or scarring may need complete removal of the ovary at the time of surgery.  The size and type of cyst present determine if the ovary will need to be removed. A woman’s ovaries are only removed after a full discussion of this possibility before surgery, or if there is no way to remove a mass without significant blood loss or compromising safety during the procedure.  HOW ARE OVARIAN CYSTS OR PELVIC MASSES REMOVED?  Pelvic mass surgery can be performed laparoscopically, no matter the size. This includes ovarian cystectomy (ovarian cyst removal), or oophorectomy (removal of the entire ovary and cyst). During an oopherectomy, the fallopian tube is usually also removed during the procedure since it is adherent to the ovary and may cause further complications if left in place.    OVARIAN CYST SURGERY  Typically, one or two tiny (1/4 inch) incisions and one slightly larger (3/4 inch) incision are necessary for a cystectomy or oophorectomy. The smaller incisions are located at the belly button and on the far right and left side in the bikini line. The larger incision is located just above the pubic bone. The two procedures do not differ surgically in terms of surgical time, incisions, recovery, or any other measure. The only difference is whether ovarian tissue is left in place.  Cysts are surgically removed from the ovary using a unique type of surgical equipment: the Harmonic Scalpel. This device uses sound waves to cut tissue and seal vessels at the same time. There is a risk that an ovarian cyst may rupture when performing cystectomy. In benign, or non-malignant cases, this is of no concern. Cysts or ovarian masses that are suspected of being cancerous may require complete removal of the ovary to avoid rupture. While not of immediate danger, if cancerous masses rupture, patients will require chemotherapy due to the spill of cancerous cells in the pelvis.  In order to remove the cyst or ovary from the body safely, a special bag is used to encapsulate the ovary. This allows for easy removal and prevents fluid from the mass from spilling into the pelvic cavity. Any masses suspected for malignancy are sent for frozen section analysis. In frozen section, the mass is sent to the pathologist while the patient is still asleep on the operating room table. The pathologist carefully reviews the sections of the mass to rule out cancer.  WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF LAPAROSCOPIC TREATMENT?  Since the vast majority of ovarian cysts and masses in premenopausal patients are benign, laparoscopy is a great option for many patients. Minimally invasive procedures allow patients to avoid large open incisions for the removal of their cysts, thereby decreasing hospital stays, recovery times, and pain. Postmenopausal patients with masses are also usually benign, with cancer rates ranging from five to 20 percent of all masses, depending on the study cited. Laparoscopy is of significant benefit for these patients as well, since it will prevent an open surgery, and recovery from open surgery can be increasingly difficult for older women.  Women who have laparoscopic cystectomy or oopherectomy are almost always discharged from the hospital the same day, with excellent pain control and rapid recovery. Most patients are back to work within seven days.  WHAT IF MY OVARIAN MASS IS CANCEROUS?  If cancer is identified, a staging operation is performed during the same surgery. Staging means evaluating other areas such as lymph nodes to rule out metastasis, or spread of disease, that may require chemotherapy. Frozen section and staging with identification of cancer is helpful to both the surgeon and the patient. By having the section immediately reviewed and staging in the same surgery, the patient avoids having to undergo a second surgical procedure at a later date. Not only is laparoscopic surgery easier to recover from for all patients, but we find that our oncology patients feel better and stronger if chemotherapy is required, if they are not recovering from extensive open surgery as well. Occasionally, a patient with more extensive malignancy will require open surgery for complete removal of malignant masses, as indicated.  WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY FOR OVARIAN CYSTS?  Rupture of an ovarian mass is possible with either laparoscopic or open surgical procedures. According to the medical literature, rupture rates are higher in laparoscopy than open procedures. For the reasons stated above, and that rupture poses no risk of harm in benign cases, laparoscopy should always be considered unless an ovarian cancer is confirmed prior to surgery by imaging studies, such as CT scan, or ultrasound with elevated CA-125 (hormone marker for ovarian cancer), and confirmed pelvic exam. In some cases, malignancy can be treated laparoscopically as well, but requires a complete assessment by a gynecologic oncologist.  Please note that ovarian cancer is a very rare disease, with the risk being only one in 70, or 1.4 percent in the general population. In properly selected patients, the treatment of ovarian masses with laparoscopy saves thousands of women every year the difficult recovery and increased complications associated with open surgery.  LAPAROSCOPIC MANAGEMENT OF OVARIAN CYSTS AND MASSES     Indications  All patients without confirmed evidence of ovarian cancer    Discharge Home  Same day    Recovery Time  Five to seven days    Incision Size  One to two 1/4 inch incisions with one 3/4 inch incision    Pain Tolerance  Very good to excellent    Procedure Time  Less than one hour, range 15 to 60 minutes    CA-125  A hormone marker for ovarian cancer. Can be falsely elevated in premenopausal patients.More accurate in postmenopausal patients    Frozen Section  Performed at the time of surgery to rule out cancer for suspicious masses only.If cancer is identified, staging is accomplished at the same surgical procedure, avoiding a second surgery at a later date.    Conversion to Open  Rare, usually indicated if ovarian cancer has spread outside of the ovary       Our Advantage  WHY CIGC® FOR MY OVARIAN CYST OR PELVIC MASS SURGERY?  Although ovarian cysts are fairly common and some even resolve themselves, some can be cancerous, and some may burst, causing internal bleeding.  Many women respond well to hormonal therapy, however in some cases, you may need emergency surgery. In any situation, it is important to put your health in the hands of a trusted surgeon when seeking ovarian cyst or pelvic mass treatment.  The surgeons at CIGC have a niche focus: techniques for GYN surgery that facilitate optimal care and rapid recovery. Gynecological surgery is the only medicine we practice.  Because we are so focused on GYN surgery, all of our surgeons have undergone extensive training to become board-certified and fellowship-trained in Minimally Invasive Technology or Gynecological Oncology. No one is more qualified than CIGC to treat your ovarian cysts, whether they are cancerous or not.  We use DualPortGYN® , a minimally invasive, laparoscopic technique to remove ovarian cysts. Laparoscopy is extremely effective for masses in the ovaries or fallopian tubes, and laparoscopic procedures for ovarian cysts have many benefits. They allow the patients to avoid large, open incisions for removal. Smaller incisions mean minimal scarring and a same-day discharge from the hospital. Most OB/GYNs use open procedures, which can cause a painful recovery. Recovery from large incisions is especially difficult for older women, so laparoscopic procedures are beneficial for everyone.  Why not my OB/GYN?  Many patients have a strong bond with their OB/GYNs. However the main focus of an OB/GYN is obstetrics, with GYN surgery making up a small percentage of their practice. We partner with OB/GYNs to ensure that patients have the best possible care.  It is always better for the patient to have a minimally invasive surgical procedure rather than an invasive open or robotic procedure. At CIGC, our specialists have made a commitment to minimally invasive GYN surgery. We perform a higher volume of cases, see a wider range of case types, and undergo comprehensive training sessions. Surgical expertise is only acquired through performing a high volume of procedures, and since GYN surgery is our main focus, we have developed the advanced skills needed to get patients back to themselves faster, with less pain.  As a patient, it is your decision where to get treated. As experts in the field, we urge you to visit us and find peace of mind in the form of nuanced expertise and years of experience.

They say the greatest achievement of a woman is motherhood and the functionality of her reproductive system is directly proportional to her ability to give birth. Therefore, it is important that a woman makes sure that her health is well taken care of. Two major diseases that could deter a woman’s path to motherhood are ovarian cyst and ovarian cancer. What are these two and how can they be prevented or eliminated.       Ovarian Cyst  Ovarian cysts are closed, sac like structures that form within the ovary and are filled with either a semisolid or liquid substance. It is predominantly common during childbearing years. Most women who have ovarian cyst are asymptomatic in nature. But in some cases, the most common symptom is extreme pain in the abdomen or pelvic area. The condition is confirmed and diagnosed through pelvic or abdominal ultrasound.  Common Causes   Infection  Genetic  Embryonic defect  Chronic inflammatory conditions  Tumors  Obstruction   Types of Cysts   Follicular/Functional Cyst   During ovulation, an egg grows inside a sac known as follicle. Normally, the follicle breaks open and releases the egg. However, when the follicle fails to do so the follicle grows larger than normal and form a cyst inside the ovary.   Corpus Luteum Cysts   This is a fluid filled cyst that forms when a sac doesn’t dissolve after releasing an egg, which normally does. The fluid inside accumulates and has a probability of developing more fluid causing the cyst to grow in size.   Dermoid or Benign Cystic Teratomas   This cystic growth is made up of cells similar to other parts of the body, such as skin, hair, teeth and other tissues   Cystadenomas   These are cysts made up of fluid, fat or other tissues found on the surface of the ovary.   Endometrios   This is a cyst made up of tissues that normally grows inside the uterus, but for some reason it develops outside and attaches to the ovaries.  *Note: In some cases, an ovary may have a large number of small cysts causing it to be enlarged. This condition is known as PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) and it is the most common cause of infertility among women.  Signs and Symptoms           Lower abdominal pain  Abdominal fullness or bloating  Indigestion  Early satiety      Urinary urgency  Constipation  Painful intercourse       Treatment  The treatment depends on the size and appearance of the cyst as seen on the ultrasound. Unless the cyst ruptures and causes significant bleeding, in which case surgery is required.  * Note : Ovarian cyst was discussed in the previous paragraphs, but to better understand the whole concept ovarian cancer, ovarian tumor is elaborated below. A cancerous cyst or tumor is known as malignant and non-cancerous ones are called benign.  Types of Ovarian Tumors  Tumors can form in other parts of the body and the ovaries are no exception.   Epithelial Cell Tumors – start on the epithelial or outer surface of the ovary. This type of tumor is further classified into:    Benign Epithelial Tumor – not cancerous and do not spread or lead to a detrimental disease.    Tumors of Low Malignant Potential (LMP tumors) – known as borderline epithelial ovarian cancer, this tumor grow slowly and are less life-threatening than most ovarian cancers.    Malignant Epithelial Ovarian Tumors – this is the most common tumor that causes ovarian cancer.    Germ Cell Tumors – start from the cells that produce eggs. These are uncommon and tend to affect younger-aged women. Most germ cell tumors are benign.    Stromal Tumors – originate from cells that hold the ovary together and produce the hormones: estrogen and progesterone.   Ovarian Cancer  From the word itself, this is the type of cancer that grows in the ovaries. It is often undetected until it has metastasized to the other parts of the pelvis and abdomen. The etiology is unknown, and every woman should be aware that a cyst or a tumor may or may not progress to ovarian cancer. Thus, it is very important to visit your gynecologist for annual or biannual examination, especially when you are at risk.  As what was mentioned earlier the cause of ovarian cancer is not yet identified, but there are possible Risk Factors associated with it. These are:   Increasing age  Obesity  After menopause  Family history of ovarian cancer  Family history of breast or colorectal cancer  Certain family cancer (genetic) syndromes  Breast cancer   While there are risk factors, there are also factors that lower the risk of having an ovarian cancer, these include the following:   Pregnancy  Breastfeeding  Birth control pills  The contraceptive injection DepoMedroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA or Depo-Provera)  Having your “tubes tied” (tubal ligation)  Removal of the uterus without removing the ovaries (a hysterectomy)  Low-fat diet   Signs and Symptoms           Abdominal distention due to growing tumor and/or bloating  Pelvic and abdominal pain  Back pain  Early satiety  Decreased appetite  Urinary urgency      Easy fatigability  Stomach upset  Constipation  Menstrual changes  Weight loss  Painful intercourse       Diagnosis  Unfortunately, there are no good screening tests for ovarian cancer, despite extensive ongoing research. Imaging (ultrasound, X-rays, and CT scans), and blood tests should not be used as a screen, as they are inaccurate and lead many women to surgery who do not need it. Diagnosis is often suspected based on symptoms and physical exam, and these are followed by imaging.  Main Treatments   Surgery  Chemotherapy  Targeted therapy  Radiation therapy   Bottom Line  Ovarian cysts or tumors do not necessarily mean it will progress into ovarian cancer. Many women, during their reproductive years may have had this condition. But this doesn’t mean you should take these conditions for granted. You should know your body very well, consult your physician if you manifest any unusual changes in your reproductive system, specifically your menstrual cycle. As with any type of cancer, the prognosis of being treated for is higher if it is detected earlier. Early detection is the motto for defeating or lowering the risk of cancer.

Proper triage will decrease unnecessary procedures and worry while obtaining the best survival benefit for those ultimately found to have cancer.          PD F          PDF  Download        KEY POINTS Incidentally discovered ovarian cysts are common and most are benign, but a minority can represent ovarian cancer, which is difficult to detect before it has spread and therefore often has a poor prognosis. Patients can be reassured if they are postmenopausal and have a simple cyst smaller than 1 cm or if they are premenopausal and have a simple cyst smaller than 5 cm. Reassess with yearly ultrasonography in very low-risk situations and with repeat ultrasonography in 6 to 12 weeks if the diagnosis is not clear but is likely benign. Refer to a gynecologist in cases of symptomatic cysts, cysts larger than 6 cm, and cysts that require ancillary testing. Refer to a gynecologic oncologist for findings worrisome for cancer such as thick septations, solid areas with flow, ascites, evidence of metastasis, or high cancer antigen 125 levels.

Ovarian cysts, sometimes reported as ovarian masses or adnexal masses, are frequently found incidentally in women who have no symptoms. These cysts can be physiologic (having to do with ovulation) or neoplastic—either benign, borderline (having low malignant potential), or frankly malignant. Thus, these incidental lesions pose many diagnostic challenges to the clinician. The vast majority of cysts are benign, but a few are malignant, and ovarian malignancies have a notoriously poor survival rate. The diagnosis can only be obtained surgically, as aspiration and biopsy are not definitive and may be harmful. Therefore, the clinician must try to balance the risks of surgery for what may be a benign lesion with the risk of delaying diagnosis of a malignancy. In this article we provide an approach to evaluating these cysts, with guidance on when the patient can be reassured and when referral is needed. THE DILEMMA OF OVARIAN CYSTS Ovarian cysts are common Premenopausal women can be expected to make at least a small cyst or follicle almost every month. The point prevalence for significant cysts has been reported to be almost 8% in premenopausal women. 1 Surprisingly, the prevalence in postmenopausal women is as high as 14% to 18%, with a yearly incidence of 8%. From 30% to 54% of postmenopausal ovarian cysts persist for years. 2,3 Little is known about the cause of most cysts      Little is known about the cause of most ovarian cysts. Functional or physiologic cysts are thought to be variations in the ovulatory process. They do not seem to be precursors to ovarian cancer. Most benign neoplastic cysts are also not thought to be precancerous, with the possible exception of the mucinous kind. 4 Ovarian cysts do not increase the risk of ovarian cancer later in life, 3,9 and removing benign cysts has not been shown to decrease the risk of death from ovarian cancer. 10 Most ovarian cysts and masses are benign Simple ovarian cysts are much more likely to be benign than malignant. Complex and solid ovarian masses are also more likely to be benign, regardless of menopausal status, but more malignancies are found in this group. With any kind of mass, the chances of malignancy increase with age. Children and adolescents are not discussed in this article; they should be referred to a specialist. Ovarian cancer often has a poor prognosis This “silent” cancer is most often discovered and treated when it has already spread, contributing to a reported 5-year survival rate of only 33% to 46%. 11–13 Ideally, ovarian cancer would be found and removed while still confined to the ovary, when the 5-year survival rate is greater than 90%. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a precursor lesion for most ovarian cancers, and there is no good way of finding it in the stage 1 phase, so detecting this cancer before it spreads remains an elusive goal. 11,14 Surgery is required to diagnose difficult cases      There is no perfect test for the preoperative assessment of a cystic ovarian mass. Every method has drawbacks ( Table 1 ). 15–18 Therefore, the National Institutes of Health estimates that 5% to 10% of women in the United States will undergo surgical exploration for an ovarian cyst in their lifetime. Only 13% to 21% of these cysts will be malignant. 5 ASSESSING AN INCIDENTALLY DISCOVERED OVARIAN MASS Certain factors in the history, physical examination, and blood work may suggest the cyst is either benign or malignant and may influence the subsequent assessment. However, in most cases, the best next step is to perform transvaginal ultrasonography, which we will discuss later in this paper. History Age is a major risk factor for ovarian cancer; the median age at diagnosis is 63 years. 9 In the reproductive-age group, ovarian cysts are much more likely to be functional than neoplastic. Epithelial cancers are rare before the age of 40, but other cancer types such as borderline, germ cell, and sex cord stromal tumors may occur. 19 In every age group a cyst is more likely to be benign than malignant, although, as noted above, the probability of malignancy increases with age. Symptoms. Most ovarian cysts, benign or malignant, are asymptomatic and are found only incidentally. The most commonly reported symptoms are pelvic or lower-abdominal pressure or pain. Acutely painful conditions include ovarian torsion, hemorrhage into the cyst, cyst rupture with or without intra-abdominal hemorrhage, ectopic pregnancy, and pelvic inflammatory disease with tubo-ovarian abscess. Some patients who have ovarian cancer report vague symptoms such as urinary urgency or frequency, abdominal distention or bloating, and difficulty eating or early satiety. 20 Although the positive predictive value of this symptom constellation is only about 1%, its usefulness increases if these symptoms arose recently (within the past year) and occur than 12 days a month. 21 Family history of ovarian, breast, endometrial, or colon cancer is of particular interest. The greater the number of affected relatives and the closer the degree of relation, the greater the risk; in some cases the relative risk is 40 times greater. 22 Breast-ovarian cancer syndromes, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome, and family cancer syndrome, as well as extremely high-risk pedigrees such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and Lynch syndrome, all place women at significantly higher risk. Daughters tend to develop cancer at a younger age than their affected mothers. However, only 10% of ovarian cancers occur in patients who have a family history of it, leaving 90% as sporadic occurrences. Other history. Factors protective against ovarian cancer include use of oral contraceptives at any time, tubal ligation, hysterectomy, having had children, breastfeeding, a low-fat diet, and possibly use of aspirin and acetaminophen. 23,24 Risk factors for malignancy include advanced age; nulliparity; family history of ovarian or breast cancer; personal history of breast cancer; talc use; asbestos exposure; white ethnicity; pelvic irradiation; smoking; alcohol use; possibly the previous use of fertility drugs, estrogen, or androgen; history of mumps; urban location; early menarche; and late menopause. 24      Pages 1  2  3  next ›  last »                       References  Borgfeldt C , Andolf E .

Just because you’ve had an ovarian cyst or tumor doesn’t mean you have, or will develop, ovarian cancer. Many women get ovarian cysts or benign ovarian tumors at some point during their reproductive years. Most will never develop ovarian cancer.  Your ovaries are small organs located deep within your pelvis. Eggs grow inside them, within a sac or follicle. During ovulation an egg is released from its sac into one of your fallopian tubes. After that, the sac typically dissolves, but sometimes the sac can remain and fill with air or fluid to develop into a cyst. Cysts that form in or around your ovaries often go unnoticed. They may cause only mild symptoms or no noticeable symptoms at all.  It’s relatively rare, but some ovarian cysts are malignant, or cancerous. Fortunately, most are benign, or not cancerous. Your doctor’s recommended treatment plan will depend on the type of ovarian cyst or tumor that you have, as well as your symptoms. Oftentimes they won’t require any treatment.  Types Types
of ovarian cysts  Cysts that form during your menstrual cycle are called functional cysts. There are two types of functional ovarian cysts: follicle and corpus luteum cysts. Follicle cysts form when an egg fails to break out of its sac. These types of cysts usually disappear on their own within one to three months. Corpus luteum cysts develop when a sac closes up after releasing its egg, allowing fluid to accumulate inside. These cysts usually resolve on their own in a few weeks.   Sometimes, eggs mature in their sacs but are never released. As your menstrual cycle repeats, the sacs may grow larger and develop into multiple cysts. This condition is known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  There are other types of ovarian cysts and tumors too. For example:  Ovarian endometriomas can develop if you have endometriosis, a condition that causes the endometrial tissue lining your uterus to grow in other areas of your body. If this tissue attaches to one of your ovaries, an ovarian endometrioma can form. Ovarian cystadenomas are liquid-filled cysts that develop from cells on the surface of your ovary. While most are benign, some cystadenomas are cancerous. Ovarian dermoid cysts, or teratomas, are made up of a variety of different cell types. They’re a type of ovarian germ cell tumor. Usually these tumors are benign, but occasionally they can be malignant.  It’s most common for these types of benign cysts to develop during your reproductive years or after you start menstruating. It’s less common to develop an ovarian cyst before you experience your first menstrual period or after menopause has taken place. If it does happen, your doctor may want to investigate further.  Read more: Ovarian cysts: Types, symptoms, and treatment »  Symptoms Symptoms of ovarian cysts and ovarian cancer  It’s possible to have an ovarian cyst and not realize it. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. They can include abdominal bloating and pressure, painful intercourse, and frequent urination. Some women experience menstrual irregularities, unusual hair growth, or fevers.  Like noncancerous ovarian cysts, cancerous tumors sometimes cause no or only minor symptoms at first. They’re typically hard to feel, even during a physical exam. That’s why it’s difficult to detect early-stage ovarian cancer.   Symptoms of ovarian cancer are similar to those of ovarian cysts. They can include:   abdominal swelling or bloating  abdominal pressure and pain  feeling overstuffed or having trouble eating  frequent or urgent urination  menstrual irregularities  painful intercourse   If you have symptoms associated with ovarian cysts or ovarian cancer, see your doctor as soon as possible.  Diagnosis How are ovarian
cysts and ovarian cancer diagnosed?  In some cases, you may not know that you have an ovarian cyst or tumor until your doctor detects it during a routine pelvic exam. In other cases, you might experience signs or symptoms first, which will lead to imagining studies that reveal an ovarian cyst or tumor. If you notice signs or symptoms, make an appointment with your doctor.  If your doctor suspects that you have an ovarian cyst or tumor, they will likely order imaging tests to examine your ovaries. Oftentimes imaging tests like ultrasound or MRI can determine if an ovarian cyst or tumor is benign or malignant. They may also want to test your blood for CA-125, a tumor marker, or preform a biopsy if there is any question. High levels of CA-125 may indicate the presence of ovarian cancer.  To confirm or rule out ovarian cancer, your doctor may perform a biopsy. They will collect a sample of the cyst or tumor for analysis under a microscope. This will help them determine if it’s cancerous.  Treatment Treating ovarian
cysts and ovarian cancer  In many cases, ovarian cysts resolve on their own without treatment. If you have an ovarian cyst that doesn’t go away on its own, or one that’s causing you pain, your doctor may recommend surgical removal. This can usually be accomplished without damaging your ovary or affecting fertility.  If you’re diagnosed with ovarian cancer, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following treatment options:  chemotherapy radiation surgery  There’s no known way to prevent ovarian cysts.  Outlook Outlook
for ovarian cysts and cancer  Your long-term outlook will depend on your diagnosis. Most ovarian cysts resolve within a few months, often without treatment. The outlook for ovarian cancer varies, depending on its stage and type.  It’s important to report unusual symptoms to your doctor immediately. The sooner you know what’s going on, the better. If you have ovarian cancer, your outlook will be better if it’s diagnosed and treated in its early stages.  Ovarian cancer is rare in young women. According to the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund Alliance , the median age of a diagnosis is 63. Your lifetime risk of developing it is about one in 75. Your risk could be higher if you have a strong family history of ovarian cancer or if you carry certain genetic mutations. Your lifetime risk of dying from ovarian cancer is about 1 in 100.

Ovarian cysts are sacs that form on or inside the ovary. A fluid-filled ovarian cyst is a simple cyst. A complex ovarian cyst contains solid material or blood.  Simple cysts  Simple cysts are common. They develop when your ovary fails to release an egg or when a follicle in your ovary continues to grow after an egg has been released. Because they form due to your normal menstrual cycle , they’re also called functional cysts. Functional cysts usually have no symptoms. They tend to resolve on their own within a few menstrual cycles.  Complex cysts  Complex cysts aren’t related to your normal menstrual cycle, and they’re less common. The following are three common types of complex ovarian cysts:  Dermoid cysts are made up of cells you had since before you were born. Your body uses these cells to produce dermal tissue so they may contain fat, skin, hair, or even teeth. Cystadenomas contain ovarian tissue with fluid or mucus. Endometriomas form when cells from your uterine lining grow outside of your uterus and in or on your ovaries.  It’s rare, but ovarian cysts can be malignant. Most ovarian cysts are benign , especially those that develop before menopause.  Symptoms What are the symptoms?   It’s possible to have small ovarian cysts and not have any symptoms. Some of the more common symptoms of ovarian cysts include:  bloating or pressure in your lower abdomen lower abdominal pain nausea and vomiting if the cyst is twisting an ovary frequent urination if the cyst is large enough to press on your bladder sudden, severe pain if the cyst ruptures  Seek immediate medical attention if you have a fever, vomiting, or severe abdominal pain.  If you have endometriomas, the symptoms may include:  painful periods pain during intercourse painful urination and bowel movements during your period fatigue nausea diarrhea constipation fertility problems   Causes What causes complex ovarian cysts?   It’s often not possible to determine the cause of an ovarian cyst.  Functional cysts occur due to a minor problem, usually involving hormones, in your normal menstrual cycle. Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) is a condition that causes many small, simple ovarian cysts. The exact cause is unknown, but it involves a hormone imbalance .  Read more: What you should know about PCOS and pregnancy »  Endometriomas occur due to a condition called endometriosis , which causes cells from your uterine lining to grow outside of the uterus, including on your ovaries.  Cancerous cysts develop when mutated ovarian cells begin to grow and reproduce.  Risk factors Who is at risk for ovarian cysts?   Ovarian cysts are quite common in women who ovulate. You’re less likely to develop cysts after menopause. If you do develop an ovarian cyst after menopause, it increases your risk for ovarian cancer.  About 8 percent of premenopausal women have a cyst that’s large enough to need treatment.  Diagnosis How are complex ovarian cysts diagnosed?   If you’re experiencing symptoms of a cyst, see your doctor. You’ll probably need a pelvic exam . If your doctor suspects you have a cyst, they may take a wait-and-see approach because most ovarian cysts clear up without treatment. You may also want to take a pregnancy test because pregnancy can cause similar abdominal symptoms.  Other diagnostic tests may include an ultrasound or a CT scan.  Ultrasound  An ultrasound uses sound waves to produce real-time images of your ovaries and the surrounding area. It’s fast, safe, and painless. If your doctor suspects an ovarian cyst, they’ll likely use a transvaginal ultrasound to help identify the cyst. For this type of ultrasound, you’ll lie on your back and put your feet in the stirrups. They’ll insert the transducer, which looks like a long rod, a few inches into your vagina to produce images of your ovaries and uterus. The transducer is smaller than the speculum your doctor uses for a Pap test . It only takes a few minutes. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it doesn’t usually cause pain.  Ultrasound imaging can help determine the location, size, and shape of a cyst. It may also be able to tell if the ovarian cyst is simple or complex.   Ask your doctor if you should arrive with a full or empty bladder. You may need to have one ultrasound done while you have a full bladder and then empty it before having a second one. Alternatively, they may ask you to arrive at the ultrasound appointment with your bladder already empty.  Blood tests  You might also have a blood tests for cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), which is a protein that can be high in women who have ovarian cancer. CA 125 can also be high if you have endometriosis or you’re menstruating. Other blood tests can help determine if you have hormone imbalances.  Learn more: Cysts and ovarian cancer »  Treatments How is a complex ovarian cyst treated?   Over-the-counter pain relievers may be all you need for a simple cyst. If you have a lot of pain or discomfort, your doctor may be able to prescribe something stronger.  Complex ovarian cysts may need further treatment. Five to 10 percent of women need surgery to remove an ovarian cyst. Thirteen to 21 percent of these cysts turn out to be cancerous.  You may need the cyst removed if it’s growing too large, is painful, or is causing some other problem.   Your doctor can remove some cysts using a small, lighted instrument called a laparoscope.  Your doctor can insert it into your abdomen through a tiny incision. They’ll do this while you’re under anesthesia. Your doctor can remove large or complex cysts that appear to be cancerous with traditional surgery. They can then test the cyst to see if it contains cancerous cells.  If you frequently develop ovarian cysts, your doctor may recommend hormonal birth control. This can help prevent ovulation and lower the chances of developing more cysts.  Treatment for endometriosis can include hormone therapy , pain medications, and surgery.  Complications What complications can occur?   Most simple ovarian cysts aren’t harmful.  Complex ovarian cysts, such as dermoids and cystadenomas, can grow too large. This can push your ovary out of place. It can also cause a painful condition called ovarian torsion , which means your ovary has become twisted. Cysts can also press against your bladder, causing frequent or urgent urination.  If a cyst ruptures it can cause:  severe abdominal pain a fever dizziness weakness rapid breathing vomiting bleeding  If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor.  Both endometriosis and PCOS can cause fertility problems. Most ovarian cysts aren’t cancerous, but complex ovarian cysts raise the risk of ovarian cancer.  Outlook What is the outlook?   The outlook is generally very good, especially for simple ovarian cysts. What you can expect with a complex ovarian cyst depends on the cause and treatment.  It’s unlikely that you’ll have any long-term health issues once you’ve recovered from surgical removal of a cyst.  Treatment for severe endometriosis can involve surgery and hormonal therapy. In some cases, it leaves scar tissue that can harm your internal organs. About 30 to 40 percent of women with unexplained fertility have endometriosis.  If you have ovarian cancer, your outlook depends on how far the cancer has spread. Treatment options include surgical removal of the ovary, chemotherapy , and radiation. The outlook is best when the doctor diagnoses and treats ovarian cancer in the early stages.

Build Number: 12823 Newsletter Cysts and Ovarian Cancer Medically reviewed by Monica Bien, PA-C on  November 7, 2016 — Written by Ann Pietrangelo Types Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Outlook What are ovarian cysts?   Just because you’ve had an ovarian cyst or tumor doesn’t mean you have, or will develop, ovarian cancer. Many women get ovarian cysts or benign ovarian tumors at some point during their reproductive years. Most will never develop ovarian cancer.  Your ovaries are small organs located deep within your pelvis. Eggs grow inside them, within a sac or follicle. During ovulation an egg is released from its sac into one of your fallopian tubes. After that, the sac typically dissolves, but sometimes the sac can remain and fill with air or fluid to develop into a cyst. Cysts that form in or around your ovaries often go unnoticed. They may cause only mild symptoms or no noticeable symptoms at all.  It’s relatively rare, but some ovarian cysts are malignant, or cancerous. Fortunately, most are benign, or not cancerous. Your doctor’s recommended treatment plan will depend on the type of ovarian cyst or tumor that you have, as well as your symptoms. Oftentimes they won’t require any treatment.  Types Types
of ovarian cysts  Cysts that form during your menstrual cycle are called functional cysts. There are two types of functional ovarian cysts: follicle and corpus luteum cysts. Follicle cysts form when an egg fails to break out of its sac. These types of cysts usually disappear on their own within one to three months. Corpus luteum cysts develop when a sac closes up after releasing its egg, allowing fluid to accumulate inside. These cysts usually resolve on their own in a few weeks.   Sometimes, eggs mature in their sacs but are never released. As your menstrual cycle repeats, the sacs may grow larger and develop into multiple cysts. This condition is known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  There are other types of ovarian cysts and tumors too. For example:  Ovarian endometriomas can develop if you have endometriosis, a condition that causes the endometrial tissue lining your uterus to grow in other areas of your body. If this tissue attaches to one of your ovaries, an ovarian endometrioma can form. Ovarian cystadenomas are liquid-filled cysts that develop from cells on the surface of your ovary. While most are benign, some cystadenomas are cancerous. Ovarian dermoid cysts, or teratomas, are made up of a variety of different cell types. They’re a type of ovarian germ cell tumor. Usually these tumors are benign, but occasionally they can be malignant.  It’s most common for these types of benign cysts to develop during your reproductive years or after you start menstruating. It’s less common to develop an ovarian cyst before you experience your first menstrual period or after menopause has taken place. If it does happen, your doctor may want to investigate further.  Read more: Ovarian cysts: Types, symptoms, and treatment »  Symptoms Symptoms of ovarian cysts and ovarian cancer  It’s possible to have an ovarian cyst and not realize it. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. They can include abdominal bloating and pressure, painful intercourse, and frequent urination. Some women experience menstrual irregularities, unusual hair growth, or fevers.  Like noncancerous ovarian cysts, cancerous tumors sometimes cause no or only minor symptoms at first. They’re typically hard to feel, even during a physical exam. That’s why it’s difficult to detect early-stage ovarian cancer.   Symptoms of ovarian cancer are similar to those of ovarian cysts. They can include:   abdominal swelling or bloating  abdominal pressure and pain  feeling overstuffed or having trouble eating  frequent or urgent urination  menstrual irregularities  painful intercourse   If you have symptoms associated with ovarian cysts or ovarian cancer, see your doctor as soon as possible.  Diagnosis How are ovarian
cysts and ovarian cancer diagnosed?  In some cases, you may not know that you have an ovarian cyst or tumor until your doctor detects it during a routine pelvic exam. In other cases, you might experience signs or symptoms first, which will lead to imagining studies that reveal an ovarian cyst or tumor. If you notice signs or symptoms, make an appointment with your doctor.  If your doctor suspects that you have an ovarian cyst or tumor, they will likely order imaging tests to examine your ovaries. Oftentimes imaging tests like ultrasound or MRI can determine if an ovarian cyst or tumor is benign or malignant. They may also want to test your blood for CA-125, a tumor marker, or preform a biopsy if there is any question. High levels of CA-125 may indicate the presence of ovarian cancer.  To confirm or rule out ovarian cancer, your doctor may perform a biopsy. They will collect a sample of the cyst or tumor for analysis under a microscope. This will help them determine if it’s cancerous.  Treatment Treating ovarian
cysts and ovarian cancer  In many cases, ovarian cysts resolve on their own without treatment. If you have an ovarian cyst that doesn’t go away on its own, or one that’s causing you pain, your doctor may recommend surgical removal. This can usually be accomplished without damaging your ovary or affecting fertility.  If you’re diagnosed with ovarian cancer, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following treatment options:  chemotherapy radiation surgery  There’s no known way to prevent ovarian cysts.  Outlook Outlook
for ovarian cysts and cancer  Your long-term outlook will depend on your diagnosis. Most ovarian cysts resolve within a few months, often without treatment. The outlook for ovarian cancer varies, depending on its stage and type.  It’s important to report unusual symptoms to your doctor immediately. The sooner you know what’s going on, the better. If you have ovarian cancer, your outlook will be better if it’s diagnosed and treated in its early stages.  Ovarian cancer is rare in young women. According to the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund Alliance , the median age of a diagnosis is 63. Your lifetime risk of developing it is about one in 75. Your risk could be higher if you have a strong family history of ovarian cancer or if you carry certain genetic mutations. Your lifetime risk of dying from ovarian cancer is about 1 in 100.

In fact, according to the American Cancer Society, only about 20 percent of cases are diagnosed at an early stage. Typically, this is because ovarian cancer symptoms either aren’t apparent in the early stages of the disease or they mimic common stomach and digestive issues that are often mistaken for minor ailments. Women are more likely to experience symptoms once the disease has spread beyond the ovaries.  Many people mistakenly believe that a Pap smear test can detect ovarian cancer. In fact, there is no reliable routine screening test for ovarian cancer, so women with a family history of the disease or other risk factors should talk to their doctor about genetic testing and other steps to monitor or help reduce their risk. Routine gynecologic care and annual pelvic exams are recommended to follow up on symptoms of ovarian cancer.

Oftentimes imaging tests like ultrasound or MRI can determine if an ovarian cyst or tumor is benign or malignant. They may also want to test your blood for CA-125, a tumor marker, or preform a biopsy if there is any question. High levels of CA-125 may indicate the presence of ovarian cancer.  To confirm or rule out ovarian cancer, your doctor may perform a biopsy. They will collect a sample of the cyst or tumor for analysis under a microscope. This will help them determine if it’s cancerous.  Treatment Treating ovarian
cysts and ovarian cancer  In many cases, ovarian cysts resolve on their own without treatment. If you have an ovarian cyst that doesn’t go away on its own, or one that’s causing you pain, your doctor may recommend surgical removal. This can usually be accomplished without damaging your ovary or affecting fertility.  If you’re diagnosed with ovarian cancer, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following treatment options:  chemotherapy radiation surgery  There’s no known way to prevent ovarian cysts.  Outlook Outlook
for ovarian cysts and cancer  Your long-term outlook will depend on your diagnosis. Most ovarian cysts resolve within a few months, often without treatment. The outlook for ovarian cancer varies, depending on its stage and type.  It’s important to report unusual symptoms to your doctor immediately. The sooner you know what’s going on, the better. If you have ovarian cancer, your outlook will be better if it’s diagnosed and treated in its early stages.  Ovarian cancer is rare in young women. According to the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund Alliance , the median age of a diagnosis is 63. Your lifetime risk of developing it is about one in 75. Your risk could be higher if you have a strong family history of ovarian cancer or if you carry certain genetic mutations. Your lifetime risk of dying from ovarian cancer is about 1 in 100.

Build Number: 12823 Newsletter Cysts and Ovarian Cancer Medically reviewed by Monica Bien, PA-C on  November 7, 2016 — Written by Ann Pietrangelo Types Symptoms Diagnosis Treatment Outlook What are ovarian cysts?   Just because you’ve had an ovarian cyst or tumor doesn’t mean you have, or will develop, ovarian cancer. Many women get ovarian cysts or benign ovarian tumors at some point during their reproductive years. Most will never develop ovarian cancer.  Your ovaries are small organs located deep within your pelvis. Eggs grow inside them, within a sac or follicle. During ovulation an egg is released from its sac into one of your fallopian tubes. After that, the sac typically dissolves, but sometimes the sac can remain and fill with air or fluid to develop into a cyst. Cysts that form in or around your ovaries often go unnoticed. They may cause only mild symptoms or no noticeable symptoms at all.  It’s relatively rare, but some ovarian cysts are malignant, or cancerous. Fortunately, most are benign, or not cancerous. Your doctor’s recommended treatment plan will depend on the type of ovarian cyst or tumor that you have, as well as your symptoms. Oftentimes they won’t require any treatment.  Types Types
of ovarian cysts  Cysts that form during your menstrual cycle are called functional cysts. There are two types of functional ovarian cysts: follicle and corpus luteum cysts. Follicle cysts form when an egg fails to break out of its sac. These types of cysts usually disappear on their own within one to three months. Corpus luteum cysts develop when a sac closes up after releasing its egg, allowing fluid to accumulate inside. These cysts usually resolve on their own in a few weeks.   Sometimes, eggs mature in their sacs but are never released. As your menstrual cycle repeats, the sacs may grow larger and develop into multiple cysts. This condition is known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  There are other types of ovarian cysts and tumors too. For example:  Ovarian endometriomas can develop if you have endometriosis, a condition that causes the endometrial tissue lining your uterus to grow in other areas of your body. If this tissue attaches to one of your ovaries, an ovarian endometrioma can form. Ovarian cystadenomas are liquid-filled cysts that develop from cells on the surface of your ovary. While most are benign, some cystadenomas are cancerous. Ovarian dermoid cysts, or teratomas, are made up of a variety of different cell types. They’re a type of ovarian germ cell tumor. Usually these tumors are benign, but occasionally they can be malignant.  It’s most common for these types of benign cysts to develop during your reproductive years or after you start menstruating. It’s less common to develop an ovarian cyst before you experience your first menstrual period or after menopause has taken place. If it does happen, your doctor may want to investigate further.  Read more: Ovarian cysts: Types, symptoms, and treatment »  Symptoms Symptoms of ovarian cysts and ovarian cancer  It’s possible to have an ovarian cyst and not realize it. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. They can include abdominal bloating and pressure, painful intercourse, and frequent urination. Some women experience menstrual irregularities, unusual hair growth, or fevers.  Like noncancerous ovarian cysts, cancerous tumors sometimes cause no or only minor symptoms at first. They’re typically hard to feel, even during a physical exam. That’s why it’s difficult to detect early-stage ovarian cancer.   Symptoms of ovarian cancer are similar to those of ovarian cysts.

CTCA,  April 30, 2014                                                                       While pain is a common symptom of a woman’s period, it might seem uncommon if you’re having persistent pelvic pain. It might come every month for a few months, then stop. Or you might feel it randomly throughout the month, with no association with your period at all.  In this age of self-diagnosis, pelvic pain is just a Google search away from a cancer diagnosis. In fact, many young women who experience pain in their lower abdomen may simply have a benign ovarian cyst. Ovarian cancer is rare during a woman’s childbearing years (most women with ovarian cancer are between ages 55 to 64). But ovarian cysts are quite common and the symptoms can be similar to those of ovarian cancer: pelvic pain, bloating, back pain and nausea or vomiting.  So how can you know the difference? It’s important to know about various types of ovarian cysts and understand the symptoms of ovarian cancer.  Most women with an ovarian cyst have what’s called a functional cyst and is associated with their menstrual cycle. These types of cysts develop during or after ovulation, which is when an egg may be released for conception.   Follicular cysts form before the egg is released. They usually take one to three months to go away on their own.  Corpus luteum cysts form after the egg is released. These cysts usually go away on their own in a few weeks.   Other types of cysts include:   Endometriomas: Women with endometriosis can develop this type of cyst. With endometriosis, tissue that looks and acts like the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. Cysts can develop when the tissue attaches to the ovary.  Cystadenomas: These cysts can be filled with fluid and can become large, causing pain.  Dermoid cysts: These cysts can be filled with seemingly odd materials such as hair, teeth and other tissues. They also can become large and cause pain.  Polycystic ovaries: Many cysts form when follicles do not release their eggs on a cyclical basis.   A pelvic exam is the first step toward diagnosing ovarian cysts or ovarian cancer. During the exam, your doctor may be able to feel the cyst manually. Either way, your doctor may order an ultrasound to determine the cysts’ size, shape, location and composition before deciding next steps, either watchful waiting or surgery.  The symptoms of ovarian cancer, though vague, can be more extensive than those of ovarian cysts. Along with the symptoms shared with ovarian cysts, possible signs of ovarian cancer include: difficulty eating or feeling full quickly; a feeling of heaviness in the lower abdomen or pelvis; constipation and increased gas; lack of appetite; and urinating more frequently.  Any symptoms associated with ovarian cancer should not be ignored. But if you are younger, they should be kept in perspective. If you have experienced any of the above symptoms, pay particular attention to bloating or a swollen belly, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, and pelvic pain or pelvic heaviness. See your gynecologist if these occur every day for more than few weeks.  Learn about ovarian cancer risk factors.

In fact, according to the American Cancer Society, only about 20 percent of cases are diagnosed at an early stage. Typically, this is because ovarian cancer symptoms either aren’t apparent in the early stages of the disease or they mimic common stomach and digestive issues that are often mistaken for minor ailments. Women are more likely to experience symptoms once the disease has spread beyond the ovaries.  Many people mistakenly believe that a Pap smear test can detect ovarian cancer. In fact, there is no reliable routine screening test for ovarian cancer, so women with a family history of the disease or other risk factors should talk to their doctor about genetic testing and other steps to monitor or help reduce their risk. Routine gynecologic care and annual pelvic exams are recommended to follow up on symptoms of ovarian cancer.

Ovarian Cancer  About Ovarian Cancer             What Is Ovarian Cancer?   Cancer starts when cells in the body begin to grow out of control. Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer, and can spread to other areas of the body. To learn more about how cancers start and spread, see What Is Cancer?  Ovarian cancer begins in the ovaries. Ovaries are reproductive glands found only in females (women). The ovaries produce eggs (ova) for reproduction. The eggs travel through the fallopian tubes into the uterus where the fertilized egg implants and develops into a fetus. The ovaries are also the main source of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. One ovary is on each side of the uterus in the pelvis.             The ovaries are made up of 3 main kinds of cells. Each type of cell can develop into a different type of tumor:   Epithelial tumors start from the cells that cover the outer surface of the ovary. Most ovarian tumors are epithelial cell tumors.  Germ cell tumors start from the cells that produce the eggs (ova).  Stromal tumors start from structural tissue cells that hold the ovary together and produce the female hormones estrogen and progesterone.   Most of these tumors are benign (non-cancerous) and never spread beyond the ovary. Benign tumors can be treated by removing either the ovary or the part of the ovary that contains the tumor.  Malignant (cancerous) or low malignant potential ovarian tumors can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body and can be fatal. Their treatment is discussed later in this document.  Epithelial ovarian tumors  Benign epithelial ovarian tumors  Most epithelial ovarian tumors are benign, don’t spread, and usually don’t lead to serious illness. There are several types of benign epithelial tumors including serous cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenomas, and Brenner tumors.  Tumors of low malignant potential  When looked at under the microscope, some ovarian epithelial tumors don’t clearly appear to be cancerous. These are called tumors of low malignant potential (LMP tumors). They are also known as borderline epithelial ovarian cancer . These are different from typical ovarian cancers because they don’t grow into the supporting tissue of the ovary (called the ovarian stroma ). Likewise, if they spread outside the ovary, for example, into the abdominal cavity (belly), they might grow on the lining of the abdomen but often don’t grow into it.  LMP tumors tend to affect younger women than the typical ovarian cancers. These tumors grow slowly and are less life-threatening than most ovarian cancers. LMP tumors can be fatal, but this isn’t common.  Malignant epithelial ovarian tumors  Cancerous epithelial tumors are called carcinomas . About 85% to 90% of ovarian cancers are epithelial ovarian carcinomas. When someone says that they had ovarian cancer, they usually mean that they had this type of cancer. These tumor cells have several features (when viewed under a microscope) that can be used to classify epithelial ovarian carcinomas into different types. The serous type is by far the most common, but there are other types like mucinous , endometrioid , and clear cell .  If the cells don't look like any of these 4 subtypes, the tumor is called undifferentiated . Undifferentiated epithelial ovarian carcinomas tend to grow and spread more quickly than the other types. Epithelial ovarian carcinomas are classified by these subtypes, but they are also given a grade and a stage .  The grade classifies the tumor based on how much it looks like normal tissue on a scale of 1, 2, or 3. Grade 1 epithelial ovarian carcinomas look more like normal tissue and tend to have a better prognosis (outlook). Grade 3 epithelial ovarian carcinomas look less like normal tissue and usually have a worse outlook. Grade 2 tumors look and act in between grades 1 and 3.  The tumor stage describes how far the tumor has spread from where it started in the ovary. Epithelial ovarian cancers tend to spread to the lining and organs of the pelvis and abdomen (belly) first. This may lead to the build-up of fluid in the abdominal cavity (called ascites ). As it becomes more advanced, it may spread to the lung and liver, or, rarely, to the brain, bones, or skin. Staging is explained in detail in a later section .  Other cancers that are similar to epithelial ovarian cancer  Primary peritoneal carcinoma  Primary peritoneal carcinoma (PPC) is a rare cancer closely related to epithelial ovarian cancer. At surgery, it looks the same as an epithelial ovarian cancer that has spread through the abdomen. Under a microscope, PPC also looks just like epithelial ovarian cancer. Other names for this cancer include extra-ovarian (meaning outside the ovary) primary peritoneal carcinoma (EOPPC) and serous surface papillary carcinoma .  PPC seems to develop from cells in the lining of the pelvis and abdomen. This lining is called the peritoneum . These cells are very similar to the cells on the surface of the ovaries. Some experts believe that PPC may start in the cells lining the fallopian tubes.  Like ovarian cancer, PPC tends to spread along the surfaces of the pelvis and abdomen, so it is often difficult to tell exactly where the cancer first started. This type of cancer can occur in women who still have their ovaries, but it is of more concern for women who have had their ovaries removed to prevent ovarian cancer. This cancer does rarely occur in men.  Symptoms of PPC are similar to those of ovarian cancer, including abdominal pain or bloating, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, and a change in bowel habits. Also, like ovarian cancer, PPC may elevate the blood level of a tumor marker called CA-125.  Women with PPC usually get the same treatment as those with widespread ovarian cancer. This could include surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible (a process called debulking that is discussed in the section about surgery ), followed by chemotherapy like that given for ovarian cancer. Its outlook is likely to be similar to widespread ovarian cancer.  Fallopian tube cancer  This is another rare cancer that is similar to epithelial ovarian cancer. It begins in the tube that carries an egg from the ovary to the uterus (the fallopian tube). Like PPC, fallopian tube cancer and ovarian cancer have similar symptoms. The treatment for fallopian tube cancer is much like that for ovarian cancer, but the outlook (prognosis) is slightly better.  Ovarian germ cell tumors  Germ cells usually form the ova or eggs in females and the sperm in males. Most ovarian germ cell tumors are benign, but some are cancerous and may be life threatening. Less than 2% of ovarian cancers are germ cell tumors. Overall, they have a good outlook, with more than 9 out of 10 patients surviving at least 5 years after diagnosis. There are several subtypes of germ cell tumors. The most common germ cell tumors are teratomas , dysgerminomas , endodermal sinus tumors , and choriocarcinomas . Germ cell tumors can also be a mix of more than a single subtype.  Teratoma  Teratomas are germ cell tumors with areas that, when seen under the microscope, look like each of the 3 layers of a developing embryo: the endoderm (innermost layer), mesoderm (middle layer), and ectoderm (outer layer). This germ cell tumor has a benign form called mature teratoma and a cancerous form called immature teratoma.  The mature teratoma is by far the most common ovarian germ cell tumor. It is a benign tumor that usually affects women of reproductive age (teens through forties). It is often called a dermoid cyst because its lining is made up of tissue similar to skin (dermis). These tumors or cysts can contain different kinds of benign tissues including, bone, hair, and teeth. The patient is cured by surgical removal of the cyst, but sometimes a new cyst develops later in the other ovary.  Immature teratomas are a type of cancer. They occur in girls and young women, usually younger than 18. These are rare cancers that contain cells that look like those from embryonic or fetal tissues such as connective tissue, respiratory passages, and brain. Tumors that are relatively more mature (called grade 1 immature teratoma ) and haven’t spread beyond the ovary are treated by surgical removal of the ovary. When they have spread beyond the ovary and/or much of the tumor has a very immature appearance (grade 2 or 3 immature teratomas), chemotherapy is recommended in addition to surgery.  Dysgerminoma  This type of cancer is rare, but it is the most common ovarian germ cell cancer . It usually affects women in their teens and twenties. Dysgerminomas are considered malignant (cancerous), but most don’t grow or spread very rapidly. When they are limited to the ovary, more than 75% of patients are cured by surgically removing the ovary, without any further treatment. Even when the tumor has spread further (or if it comes back later), surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy are effective in controlling or curing the disease in about 90% of patients.  Endodermal sinus tumor (yolk sac tumor) and choriocarcinoma  These very rare tumors typically affect girls and young women. They tend to grow and spread rapidly but are usually very sensitive to chemotherapy. Choriocarcinoma that starts in the placenta (during pregnancy) is more common than the kind that starts in the ovary. Placental choriocarcinomas usually respond better to chemotherapy than ovarian choriocarcinomas do.  Ovarian stromal tumors  About 1% of ovarian cancers are ovarian stromal cell tumors. More than half of stromal tumors are found in women older than 50, but about 5% of stromal tumors occur in young girls.  The most common symptom of these tumors is abnormal vaginal bleeding. This happens because many of these tumors produce female hormones (estrogen). These hormones can cause vaginal bleeding (like a period) to start again after menopause. In young girls, these tumors can also cause menstrual periods and breast development to occur before puberty.  Less often, stromal tumors make male hormones (like testosterone). If male hormones are produced, the tumors can cause normal menstrual periods to stop. They can also make facial and body hair grow. If the stromal tumor starts to bleed, it can cause sudden, severe abdominal pain.  Types of malignant (cancerous) stromal tumors include granulosa cell tumors (the most common type), granulosa-theca tumors, and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, which are usually considered low-grade cancers. Thecomas and fibromas are benign stromal tumors. Cancerous stromal tumors are often found at an early stage and have a good outlook, with more than 75% of patients surviving long-term.  Ovarian cysts  An ovarian cyst is a collection of fluid inside an ovary. Most ovarian cysts occur as a normal part of the process of ovulation (egg release) -- these are called functional cysts . These cysts usually go away within a few months without any treatment. If you develop a cyst, your doctor may want to check it again after your next cycle (period) to see if it has gotten smaller.  An ovarian cyst can be more concerning in a female who isn't ovulating (like a woman after menopause or a girl who hasn't started her periods), and the doctor may want to do more tests. The doctor may also order other tests if the cyst is large or if it does not go away in a few months. Even though most of these cysts are benign (not cancer), a small number of them could be cancer. Sometimes the only way to know for sure if the cyst is cancer is to take it out with surgery. Cysts that appear to be benign (based on how they look on imaging tests ) can be observed (with repeated physical exams and imaging tests), or removed with surgery.

The ovaries are a pair of small, almond-shaped organs in the female reproductive system. They are present in the female pelvis on the right and left of the uterus. They are responsible for releasing an egg on a monthly basis during a woman’s reproductive years. The egg can be subsequently fertilized by the sperm. One other important function of the ovaries is to produce the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormones are necessary for a woman’s menstrual cycle, pregnancy, if present, body shape, bone health and overall health.  WHAT IS A FUNCTIONAL OVARIAN CYST?  Before the egg is released from the ovary, it forms in a small fluid-filled sac called a follicle. The fluid protects the egg while it develops and is released with the egg during ovulation.  If the follicle does not break open and the fluid is not released, a follicular ovarian cyst may develop. If the follicle reseals after it bursts and the fluid re-accumulates, a corpus luteum cyst will then develop. Bleeding inside the follicle results in a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. These types of cysts are called functional cysts, as they may develop monthly during the normal function of the ovary. Functional cysts are the most common types of ovarian cysts, and they usually resolve within one to two months.  WHAT IS A BENIGN OVARIAN CYST OR TUMOR?  Ovarian cysts that are not part of a menstrual cycle are known as ovarian tumors. Some tumors can be cystic or filled with fluid, some can be solid, and some can have both cystic and solid components. Ovarian tumors usually do not resolve and require surgical removal.  The following are some of the more common ovarian cysts and tumors.   Dermoid Tumor – This tumor is also known as a Mature Cystic Teratoma and has both a cystic and solid component. It is filled with tissue from other parts of the body such as hair, teeth and fat. These tumors most commonly occur in teenage girls and young women.  Mucinous Cystadenoma – This is an ovarian cyst that contains mucous material. It is the most common benign ovarian tumor and can grow very large.  Serous Cystadenoma – This is an ovarian cyst that contains clear yellow fluid.  Endometrioma – This is also known as chocolate cyst. It is filled with endometriotic fluid, which has a thick brown consistency.  Fibroma – This is a solid ovarian tumor resembling a fibroid. It can often be mistaken for a pedunculated fibroid on the ultrasound or MRI.   WHAT IS PCOS?  Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a condition that causes the development of multiple small, benign cysts on the ovaries and is usually present due to hormonal imbalance. Other characteristics of this syndrome are irregular menstrual cycle, and elevated levels of male hormone causing excess facial and body hair.  WHAT IS A PELVIC MASS?  A pelvic mass is a general term for any growth or tumor on the ovary or in the pelvis. A pelvic mass can be cystic (cystadenoma), solid (fibroma), or both ( dermoid ). A pelvic mass can be benign or malignant.    Symptoms  WHAT ARE COMMON SYMPTOMS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE WITH AN OVARIAN CYST OR PELVIC MASS?  In most cases, ovarian cysts are small, harmless and produce no symptoms. In other cases, cysts may cause problems if they get larger, if they twist (ovarian torsion), or if they burst and cause internal bleeding. Immediate attention and treatment is then needed. If you have an ovarian cyst, you might experience any of the following symptoms:   Menstrual irregularities or abnormal bleeding  Dull ache in your lower back or thighs  Pelvic pain shortly before or after the beginning of your menstrual cycle  Pelvic pain with intercourse (dyspareunia)  Fullness or heaviness in your abdomen  Nausea, vomiting or bloating  Pressure on your bowel or pain during bowel movements  Difficulty emptying your bladder completely   It is always important to remember that some ovarian cysts may be cancerous. Although very rare in younger women during their reproductive years, the risk of ovarian cancer increases with age.    Diagnosis  HOW DO WE DIAGNOSE OVARIAN CYSTS?   Ultrasound: Examining an ovarian cyst via ultrasound will help determine proper diagnosis and management. Essentially, aspects examined include the shape (regular or irregular), the size, and the composition of the cyst. It is important to know whether a cyst is fluid-filled, solid or mixed. Fluid-filled cysts (commonly called simple cysts on an ultrasound) are not likely to be cancerous and most often require observation and close follow-up unless they are too large or causing disturbing symptoms. Those cysts that are solid or mixed (fluid-filled and solid) may require further evaluation to determine if cancer is present and most often require surgical treatment. These cysts are commonly called complex cysts on the ultrasound.  MRI: Usually reserved for solid tumors.  Blood tests: Pregnancy test, hormone levels and CA-125 may be necessary, depending on the characteristic of the cyst on the ultrasound.   WHAT DOES MY CA-125 RESULT MEAN?  CA-125 is a blood test that can be performed to rule out ovarian cancer. However, the results are often high in premenopausal women, because many other benign conditions can lead to an elevated CA-125 level. Endometriosis, fibroids, noncancerous ovarian cysts, infection, liver disease, and many other conditions can falsely elevate the value and give patients an unnecessary scare. The test is somewhat more effective in postmenopausal patients.    Treatment  In some cases, observation may be all that is necessary, especially for small, functional cysts causing no symptoms. For women who require removal of ovarian cysts or removal of the ovaries, including women seeking prophylactic oophorectomy to reduce future cancer risk, Advanced Laparoscopic Surgery offers fast solutions and nearly painless recovery.  SURGICAL TREATMENT OPTIONS  Laparoscopy is very effective for cysts or masses involving the ovaries or fallopian tubes. Benign (non-cancerous) cysts of the ovary can usually be removed, while preserving the ovary. Extremely large masses or endometriomas may require removal of the entire ovary and fallopian tube. Patients seeking cancer prevention due to increased genetic risk factors will also require complete removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes.  A decision to remove an ovary is based on the patient’s age, the likelihood of cancer, and the safety of the procedure. Every effort is made to preserve ovaries for patients who desire fertility. However, patients with suspected cancers, with family or personal history of breast or ovarian cancer, or with prior histories of ovarian pain or scarring may need complete removal of the ovary at the time of surgery.  The size and type of cyst present determine if the ovary will need to be removed. A woman’s ovaries are only removed after a full discussion of this possibility before surgery, or if there is no way to remove a mass without significant blood loss or compromising safety during the procedure.  HOW ARE OVARIAN CYSTS OR PELVIC MASSES REMOVED?  Pelvic mass surgery can be performed laparoscopically, no matter the size. This includes ovarian cystectomy (ovarian cyst removal), or oophorectomy (removal of the entire ovary and cyst). During an oopherectomy, the fallopian tube is usually also removed during the procedure since it is adherent to the ovary and may cause further complications if left in place.    OVARIAN CYST SURGERY  Typically, one or two tiny (1/4 inch) incisions and one slightly larger (3/4 inch) incision are necessary for a cystectomy or oophorectomy. The smaller incisions are located at the belly button and on the far right and left side in the bikini line. The larger incision is located just above the pubic bone. The two procedures do not differ surgically in terms of surgical time, incisions, recovery, or any other measure. The only difference is whether ovarian tissue is left in place.  Cysts are surgically removed from the ovary using a unique type of surgical equipment: the Harmonic Scalpel. This device uses sound waves to cut tissue and seal vessels at the same time. There is a risk that an ovarian cyst may rupture when performing cystectomy. In benign, or non-malignant cases, this is of no concern. Cysts or ovarian masses that are suspected of being cancerous may require complete removal of the ovary to avoid rupture. While not of immediate danger, if cancerous masses rupture, patients will require chemotherapy due to the spill of cancerous cells in the pelvis.  In order to remove the cyst or ovary from the body safely, a special bag is used to encapsulate the ovary. This allows for easy removal and prevents fluid from the mass from spilling into the pelvic cavity. Any masses suspected for malignancy are sent for frozen section analysis. In frozen section, the mass is sent to the pathologist while the patient is still asleep on the operating room table. The pathologist carefully reviews the sections of the mass to rule out cancer.  WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF LAPAROSCOPIC TREATMENT?  Since the vast majority of ovarian cysts and masses in premenopausal patients are benign, laparoscopy is a great option for many patients. Minimally invasive procedures allow patients to avoid large open incisions for the removal of their cysts, thereby decreasing hospital stays, recovery times, and pain. Postmenopausal patients with masses are also usually benign, with cancer rates ranging from five to 20 percent of all masses, depending on the study cited. Laparoscopy is of significant benefit for these patients as well, since it will prevent an open surgery, and recovery from open surgery can be increasingly difficult for older women.  Women who have laparoscopic cystectomy or oopherectomy are almost always discharged from the hospital the same day, with excellent pain control and rapid recovery. Most patients are back to work within seven days.  WHAT IF MY OVARIAN MASS IS CANCEROUS?  If cancer is identified, a staging operation is performed during the same surgery. Staging means evaluating other areas such as lymph nodes to rule out metastasis, or spread of disease, that may require chemotherapy. Frozen section and staging with identification of cancer is helpful to both the surgeon and the patient. By having the section immediately reviewed and staging in the same surgery, the patient avoids having to undergo a second surgical procedure at a later date. Not only is laparoscopic surgery easier to recover from for all patients, but we find that our oncology patients feel better and stronger if chemotherapy is required, if they are not recovering from extensive open surgery as well. Occasionally, a patient with more extensive malignancy will require open surgery for complete removal of malignant masses, as indicated.  WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY FOR OVARIAN CYSTS?  Rupture of an ovarian mass is possible with either laparoscopic or open surgical procedures. According to the medical literature, rupture rates are higher in laparoscopy than open procedures. For the reasons stated above, and that rupture poses no risk of harm in benign cases, laparoscopy should always be considered unless an ovarian cancer is confirmed prior to surgery by imaging studies, such as CT scan, or ultrasound with elevated CA-125 (hormone marker for ovarian cancer), and confirmed pelvic exam. In some cases, malignancy can be treated laparoscopically as well, but requires a complete assessment by a gynecologic oncologist.  Please note that ovarian cancer is a very rare disease, with the risk being only one in 70, or 1.4 percent in the general population. In properly selected patients, the treatment of ovarian masses with laparoscopy saves thousands of women every year the difficult recovery and increased complications associated with open surgery.  LAPAROSCOPIC MANAGEMENT OF OVARIAN CYSTS AND MASSES     Indications  All patients without confirmed evidence of ovarian cancer    Discharge Home  Same day    Recovery Time  Five to seven days    Incision Size  One to two 1/4 inch incisions with one 3/4 inch incision    Pain Tolerance  Very good to excellent    Procedure Time  Less than one hour, range 15 to 60 minutes    CA-125  A hormone marker for ovarian cancer. Can be falsely elevated in premenopausal patients.More accurate in postmenopausal patients    Frozen Section  Performed at the time of surgery to rule out cancer for suspicious masses only.If cancer is identified, staging is accomplished at the same surgical procedure, avoiding a second surgery at a later date.    Conversion to Open  Rare, usually indicated if ovarian cancer has spread outside of the ovary       Our Advantage  WHY CIGC® FOR MY OVARIAN CYST OR PELVIC MASS SURGERY?  Although ovarian cysts are fairly common and some even resolve themselves, some can be cancerous, and some may burst, causing internal bleeding.  Many women respond well to hormonal therapy, however in some cases, you may need emergency surgery. In any situation, it is important to put your health in the hands of a trusted surgeon when seeking ovarian cyst or pelvic mass treatment.  The surgeons at CIGC have a niche focus: techniques for GYN surgery that facilitate optimal care and rapid recovery. Gynecological surgery is the only medicine we practice.  Because we are so focused on GYN surgery, all of our surgeons have undergone extensive training to become board-certified and fellowship-trained in Minimally Invasive Technology or Gynecological Oncology. No one is more qualified than CIGC to treat your ovarian cysts, whether they are cancerous or not.  We use DualPortGYN® , a minimally invasive, laparoscopic technique to remove ovarian cysts. Laparoscopy is extremely effective for masses in the ovaries or fallopian tubes, and laparoscopic procedures for ovarian cysts have many benefits. They allow the patients to avoid large, open incisions for removal. Smaller incisions mean minimal scarring and a same-day discharge from the hospital. Most OB/GYNs use open procedures, which can cause a painful recovery. Recovery from large incisions is especially difficult for older women, so laparoscopic procedures are beneficial for everyone.  Why not my OB/GYN?  Many patients have a strong bond with their OB/GYNs. However the main focus of an OB/GYN is obstetrics, with GYN surgery making up a small percentage of their practice. We partner with OB/GYNs to ensure that patients have the best possible care.  It is always better for the patient to have a minimally invasive surgical procedure rather than an invasive open or robotic procedure. At CIGC, our specialists have made a commitment to minimally invasive GYN surgery. We perform a higher volume of cases, see a wider range of case types, and undergo comprehensive training sessions. Surgical expertise is only acquired through performing a high volume of procedures, and since GYN surgery is our main focus, we have developed the advanced skills needed to get patients back to themselves faster, with less pain.  As a patient, it is your decision where to get treated. As experts in the field, we urge you to visit us and find peace of mind in the form of nuanced expertise and years of experience. If you want to know more about the practices and techniques we employ to treat your ovarian cysts or pelvic mass, please give us a call at (888) 787-4379.

They say the greatest achievement of a woman is motherhood and the functionality of her reproductive system is directly proportional to her ability to give birth. Therefore, it is important that a woman makes sure that her health is well taken care of. Two major diseases that could deter a woman’s path to motherhood are ovarian cyst and ovarian cancer. What are these two and how can they be prevented or eliminated.       Ovarian Cyst  Ovarian cysts are closed, sac like structures that form within the ovary and are filled with either a semisolid or liquid substance. It is predominantly common during childbearing years. Most women who have ovarian cyst are asymptomatic in nature. But in some cases, the most common symptom is extreme pain in the abdomen or pelvic area. The condition is confirmed and diagnosed through pelvic or abdominal ultrasound.  Common Causes   Infection  Genetic  Embryonic defect  Chronic inflammatory conditions  Tumors  Obstruction   Types of Cysts   Follicular/Functional Cyst   During ovulation, an egg grows inside a sac known as follicle. Normally, the follicle breaks open and releases the egg. However, when the follicle fails to do so the follicle grows larger than normal and form a cyst inside the ovary.   Corpus Luteum Cysts   This is a fluid filled cyst that forms when a sac doesn’t dissolve after releasing an egg, which normally does. The fluid inside accumulates and has a probability of developing more fluid causing the cyst to grow in size.   Dermoid or Benign Cystic Teratomas   This cystic growth is made up of cells similar to other parts of the body, such as skin, hair, teeth and other tissues   Cystadenomas   These are cysts made up of fluid, fat or other tissues found on the surface of the ovary.   Endometrios   This is a cyst made up of tissues that normally grows inside the uterus, but for some reason it develops outside and attaches to the ovaries.  *Note: In some cases, an ovary may have a large number of small cysts causing it to be enlarged. This condition is known as PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) and it is the most common cause of infertility among women.  Signs and Symptoms           Lower abdominal pain  Abdominal fullness or bloating  Indigestion  Early satiety      Urinary urgency  Constipation  Painful intercourse       Treatment  The treatment depends on the size and appearance of the cyst as seen on the ultrasound. Unless the cyst ruptures and causes significant bleeding, in which case surgery is required.  * Note : Ovarian cyst was discussed in the previous paragraphs, but to better understand the whole concept ovarian cancer, ovarian tumor is elaborated below. A cancerous cyst or tumor is known as malignant and non-cancerous ones are called benign.  Types of Ovarian Tumors  Tumors can form in other parts of the body and the ovaries are no exception.   Epithelial Cell Tumors – start on the epithelial or outer surface of the ovary. This type of tumor is further classified into:    Benign Epithelial Tumor – not cancerous and do not spread or lead to a detrimental disease.    Tumors of Low Malignant Potential (LMP tumors) – known as borderline epithelial ovarian cancer, this tumor grow slowly and are less life-threatening than most ovarian cancers.    Malignant Epithelial Ovarian Tumors – this is the most common tumor that causes ovarian cancer.    Germ Cell Tumors – start from the cells that produce eggs. These are uncommon and tend to affect younger-aged women. Most germ cell tumors are benign.    Stromal Tumors – originate from cells that hold the ovary together and produce the hormones: estrogen and progesterone.   Ovarian Cancer  From the word itself, this is the type of cancer that grows in the ovaries. It is often undetected until it has metastasized to the other parts of the pelvis and abdomen. The etiology is unknown, and every woman should be aware that a cyst or a tumor may or may not progress to ovarian cancer. Thus, it is very important to visit your gynecologist for annual or biannual examination, especially when you are at risk.  As what was mentioned earlier the cause of ovarian cancer is not yet identified, but there are possible Risk Factors associated with it. These are:   Increasing age  Obesity  After menopause  Family history of ovarian cancer  Family history of breast or colorectal cancer  Certain family cancer (genetic) syndromes  Breast cancer   While there are risk factors, there are also factors that lower the risk of having an ovarian cancer, these include the following:   Pregnancy  Breastfeeding  Birth control pills  The contraceptive injection DepoMedroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA or Depo-Provera)  Having your “tubes tied” (tubal ligation)  Removal of the uterus without removing the ovaries (a hysterectomy)  Low-fat diet   Signs and Symptoms           Abdominal distention due to growing tumor and/or bloating  Pelvic and abdominal pain  Back pain  Early satiety  Decreased appetite  Urinary urgency      Easy fatigability  Stomach upset  Constipation  Menstrual changes  Weight loss  Painful intercourse       Diagnosis  Unfortunately, there are no good screening tests for ovarian cancer, despite extensive ongoing research. Imaging (ultrasound, X-rays, and CT scans), and blood tests should not be used as a screen, as they are inaccurate and lead many women to surgery who do not need it. Diagnosis is often suspected based on symptoms and physical exam, and these are followed by imaging.  Main Treatments   Surgery  Chemotherapy  Targeted therapy  Radiation therapy   Bottom Line  Ovarian cysts or tumors do not necessarily mean it will progress into ovarian cancer. Many women, during their reproductive years may have had this condition. But this doesn’t mean you should take these conditions for granted. You should know your body very well, consult your physician if you manifest any unusual changes in your reproductive system, specifically your menstrual cycle. As with any type of cancer, the prognosis of being treated for is higher if it is detected earlier. Early detection is the motto for defeating or lowering the risk of cancer.

Proper triage will decrease unnecessary procedures and worry while obtaining the best survival benefit for those ultimately found to have cancer.          PD F          PDF  Download        KEY POINTS Incidentally discovered ovarian cysts are common and most are benign, but a minority can represent ovarian cancer, which is difficult to detect before it has spread and therefore often has a poor prognosis. Patients can be reassured if they are postmenopausal and have a simple cyst smaller than 1 cm or if they are premenopausal and have a simple cyst smaller than 5 cm. Reassess with yearly ultrasonography in very low-risk situations and with repeat ultrasonography in 6 to 12 weeks if the diagnosis is not clear but is likely benign. Refer to a gynecologist in cases of symptomatic cysts, cysts larger than 6 cm, and cysts that require ancillary testing. Refer to a gynecologic oncologist for findings worrisome for cancer such as thick septations, solid areas with flow, ascites, evidence of metastasis, or high cancer antigen 125 levels.

Ovarian cysts, sometimes reported as ovarian masses or adnexal masses, are frequently found incidentally in women who have no symptoms. These cysts can be physiologic (having to do with ovulation) or neoplastic—either benign, borderline (having low malignant potential), or frankly malignant. Thus, these incidental lesions pose many diagnostic challenges to the clinician. The vast majority of cysts are benign, but a few are malignant, and ovarian malignancies have a notoriously poor survival rate. The diagnosis can only be obtained surgically, as aspiration and biopsy are not definitive and may be harmful. Therefore, the clinician must try to balance the risks of surgery for what may be a benign lesion with the risk of delaying diagnosis of a malignancy. In this article we provide an approach to evaluating these cysts, with guidance on when the patient can be reassured and when referral is needed. THE DILEMMA OF OVARIAN CYSTS Ovarian cysts are common Premenopausal women can be expected to make at least a small cyst or follicle almost every month. The point prevalence for significant cysts has been reported to be almost 8% in premenopausal women. 1 Surprisingly, the prevalence in postmenopausal women is as high as 14% to 18%, with a yearly incidence of 8%. From 30% to 54% of postmenopausal ovarian cysts persist for years. 2,3 Little is known about the cause of most cysts      Little is known about the cause of most ovarian cysts. Functional or physiologic cysts are thought to be variations in the ovulatory process. They do not seem to be precursors to ovarian cancer. Most benign neoplastic cysts are also not thought to be precancerous, with the possible exception of the mucinous kind. 4 Ovarian cysts do not increase the risk of ovarian cancer later in life, 3,9 and removing benign cysts has not been shown to decrease the risk of death from ovarian cancer. 10 Most ovarian cysts and masses are benign Simple ovarian cysts are much more likely to be benign than malignant. Complex and solid ovarian masses are also more likely to be benign, regardless of menopausal status, but more malignancies are found in this group. With any kind of mass, the chances of malignancy increase with age. Children and adolescents are not discussed in this article; they should be referred to a specialist. Ovarian cancer often has a poor prognosis This “silent” cancer is most often discovered and treated when it has already spread, contributing to a reported 5-year survival rate of only 33% to 46%. 11–13 Ideally, ovarian cancer would be found and removed while still confined to the ovary, when the 5-year survival rate is greater than 90%. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a precursor lesion for most ovarian cancers, and there is no good way of finding it in the stage 1 phase, so detecting this cancer before it spreads remains an elusive goal. 11,14 Surgery is required to diagnose difficult cases      There is no perfect test for the preoperative assessment of a cystic ovarian mass. Every method has drawbacks ( Table 1 ). 15–18 Therefore, the National Institutes of Health estimates that 5% to 10% of women in the United States will undergo surgical exploration for an ovarian cyst in their lifetime. Only 13% to 21% of these cysts will be malignant. 5 ASSESSING AN INCIDENTALLY DISCOVERED OVARIAN MASS Certain factors in the history, physical examination, and blood work may suggest the cyst is either benign or malignant and may influence the subsequent assessment. However, in most cases, the best next step is to perform transvaginal ultrasonography, which we will discuss later in this paper. History Age is a major risk factor for ovarian cancer; the median age at diagnosis is 63 years. 9 In the reproductive-age group, ovarian cysts are much more likely to be functional than neoplastic. Epithelial cancers are rare before the age of 40, but other cancer types such as borderline, germ cell, and sex cord stromal tumors may occur. 19 In every age group a cyst is more likely to be benign than malignant, although, as noted above, the probability of malignancy increases with age. Symptoms. Most ovarian cysts, benign or malignant, are asymptomatic and are found only incidentally. The most commonly reported symptoms are pelvic or lower-abdominal pressure or pain. Acutely painful conditions include ovarian torsion, hemorrhage into the cyst, cyst rupture with or without intra-abdominal hemorrhage, ectopic pregnancy, and pelvic inflammatory disease with tubo-ovarian abscess. Some patients who have ovarian cancer report vague symptoms such as urinary urgency or frequency, abdominal distention or bloating, and difficulty eating or early satiety. 20 Although the positive predictive value of this symptom constellation is only about 1%, its usefulness increases if these symptoms arose recently (within the past year) and occur than 12 days a month. 21 Family history of ovarian, breast, endometrial, or colon cancer is of particular interest. The greater the number of affected relatives and the closer the degree of relation, the greater the risk; in some cases the relative risk is 40 times greater. 22 Breast-ovarian cancer syndromes, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome, and family cancer syndrome, as well as extremely high-risk pedigrees such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and Lynch syndrome, all place women at significantly higher risk. Daughters tend to develop cancer at a younger age than their affected mothers. However, only 10% of ovarian cancers occur in patients who have a family history of it, leaving 90% as sporadic occurrences. Other history. Factors protective against ovarian cancer include use of oral contraceptives at any time, tubal ligation, hysterectomy, having had children, breastfeeding, a low-fat diet, and possibly use of aspirin and acetaminophen. 23,24 Risk factors for malignancy include advanced age; nulliparity; family history of ovarian or breast cancer; personal history of breast cancer; talc use; asbestos exposure; white ethnicity; pelvic irradiation; smoking; alcohol use; possibly the previous use of fertility drugs, estrogen, or androgen; history of mumps; urban location; early menarche; and late menopause. 24      Pages 1  2  3  next ›  last »                       References  Borgfeldt C , Andolf E .
