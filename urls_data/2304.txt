everyone. We need to be more precise about how likely something (an
outcome) is to happen. The probability of an outcome can have any
value between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain). It may be a fraction,
decimal or percentage. When different outcomes of
an event are equally likely (for example, getting a head
when you toss a coin), you can
use a formula to calculate the probability of outcomes. When you throw a fair dice there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2,

Probability  Probabilities of 6-Sided Dice  It's sometimes handy to know the probabilities of an action succeeding
in TFT. Since TFT uses 6-sided dice exclusively (as does GURPS),
these tables do not include any other possibilities. The first table
gives the probability of rolling a specific number; the second table
gives the probability of rolling less than or equal to a specific number.  This table gives the probability of rolling a particular number on a set
of so many 6-sided dice.

It can also be used
to find the probability of rolling a particular number or more .
Since the probability of rolling N or more is the same as the
probability of not rolling N-1 or less, simply look up the
N-1 value on this table, and subtract it from 1 or 100%. For example,
to find the probability of rolling 8 or more on 3 dice, look up
the probability of rolling 7 or less, which is 35/216 or 16.204%.
Subtract that from 1, giving 181/216 (216 - 35 = 181) or 83.796%.

When a die is thrown the outcome can be any of the numbers from 1 to 6. If two dice are thrown the set of outcomes that ensure the sum is 9 is {(3, 6), (6,3), (4, 5), (5, 4)}. The total number of possible outcomes is 6*6 = 36  This gives the required probability as 4/36 = 1/9  The probability of getting 9 as the sum when 2 dice are thrown is 1/9.  Problem 2.  A standard deck of cards has 52 cards with 4 aces and 4 queens. The total number of outcomes when two cards are randomly picked is 52*51 = 2652. There are 4 ways in which the first card picked can be an ace. And there are 4 ways in which the second card can be a queen. It is important to notice that the order of picking an ace and a queen is not important here. As a result, we also have to consider the possibility of picking a queen followed by an ace. This gives the total number of ways in which an ace and a queen can be picked as 4*4 + 4*4 = 32. The required probability is 32/2652 = 8/663  When 2 cards are randomly picked from a standard deck of cards the probability of picking a queen and an ace is 8/663 .      list Cite  link Link              Student Comments      rachellopez | Student    1. In order to get a sum of 9 with two dice, you would have to roll the pairs 4 & 5, 5 & 4, 3 & 6, or 6 & 3. Since you have two dice there are 36 different combinations (6 faces*6 faces) you could roll, but only 4 of them would give you a sum of 9. That makes the probability 4/36 or 1/9 .  2. There are 52 cards in a deck. If you draw two at random you'd have 52 to choose from for your first draw and only 51 for your second. That gives you 2,652 combinations of cards total. Out of the 52 cards in the deck, 4 are aces and 4 are queens. This means you can choose an ace and then a queen (4*4) or a queen and then an ace (4*4). You'll have 32 combinations of an ace and a queen total, giving you a probability of 32/2,652 or 8/663 .                         Access hundreds of thousands of answers with a free trial.

The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 OR probability:  If Events A and B are independent, the probability that Event A OR Event B occurs is equal to the probability that Event A occurs plus the probability that Event B occurs minus the probability that both Events A and B occur: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \ and \ B)\). This is basically the same as 2 overlapping sets formula: {total # of items in groups A or B} = {# of items in group A} + {# of items  in group B} - {# of items in A and B} . Note that if event are mutually exclusive then \(P(A \ and \ B)=0\) and the formula simplifies to: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B)\). Also note that when we say "A or B occurs" we include three possibilities: A occurs and B does not occur; B occurs and A does not occur; Both A and B occur. AND probability: When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events: \(P(A \ and \ B) = P(A)*P(B)\). This is basically the same as Principle of Multiplication : if one event can occur in \(m\) ways and a second can occur independently of the first in \(n\) ways, then the two events can occur in \(mn\) ways. BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION: Two dice are tossed once. The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 1. The probability of getting an even number at the first die is 1/2 (as the probability of even = the probability of odd = 1/2); 2. The probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/6^2, as there are 5 different favorable scenarios: (2,6), (6,2), (3,5), (5,3) and (4,4); 3. The probability of getting an even number at the first die AND a total of 8 is 3/6^2 (from above case); Hence, The probability of getting an even number at the first die OR a total of 8 is 1/2+5/36-3/36=20/36.

Remember that the "OR formula" is: P(A) OR P(B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) In this case, A and B can take place together, so the value of P(A and B) is greater than 0. _________________   "Life’s battle doesn’t always go to stronger or faster men; but sooner or later the man who wins is the one who thinks he can."

Why don't we make a difference between 4 on dice 1 and four on dice ? I mean why the combination 4'4'' is the same as 4''4' (apostrophe symbolizes the dice: ' = dice number one, '' = dice number two). I have encountered many probability problems, where events that are identical are differentiated. For example: Quote: A 5 meter long wire is cut into two pieces. The longer piece is then used to form a perimeter of a square. What is the probability that the area of the square will be more than 1 if the original wire is cut at an arbitrary point? 1/6 1/5 3/10 1/3 2/5 OA: [Reveal] Spoiler: (E) In the example above the probability is 2/5. Could you please explain the difference?

We can get combination of (2, 6) in two ways: 2 on die A and 6 on die B  OR  2 on die B and 6 on die A ; Whereas (4, 4) has only one combination: 4 on on die A and 4 on die B , it has no second combination, since 4 on die B and 4 on die A is exact same combination. nonameee wrote: I have encountered many probability problems, where events that are identical are differentiated.

Could you please explain the difference? This is completely different problem. In order the area of a square to be more than 1 the side of it must be more than 1, or the perimeter more than 4. So the longer piece must be more than 4. Look at the diagram. - --- - If the wire will be cut anywhere at the red region then the rest of the wire (longer piece) will be more than 4 meter long. The probability of that is 2/5 (2 red pieces out of 5). Answer: E.

Quote: why the probability of getting 'four' on both dices is 1/36 and not 1/18? Why don't we make a difference between 4 on die1 and four on die? This is because we fix dices one and two. Quote: A 5 meter long wire is cut into two pieces. The longer piece is then used to form a perimeter of a square. What is the probability that the area of the square will be more than 1 if the original wire is cut at an arbitrary point? This is because we can cut the wire from both ends. When we fix the ends, we can cut 1 m from the left, or we can cut 1 m from the right end. Both options are different since we have fixed the ends. Quote: When calculating probability, how should we know when to count the same instances and when not? We don't count twice the same instances of the fixed "property" (don't know how to call that). But if two fixed properties (e.g., two dices: die_1 = property_one, die_2 = property_two) yield the same result by taking various values, we need to count those options (as in the above example with dices producing the sum of 8).

The probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/6^2, as there are 5 different favorable scenarios: (2,6), (6,2), (3,5), (5,3) and (4,4); Dear Bunuel, my question pertains to the quoted text. My reasoning to get sum 8 is: Select any 5 numbers from first dice ie. probability: 5/6 To make the sum 8, only a unique number is to be chosen from 2nd dice. Hence the probability of selecting 1 number in second dice is : 1/6 Probability for sum 8 is 5/6^2. However I multiplied this number by 2 since you can perform the same task by selecting the second dice first and choosing a corresponding unique value in 1st dice. Net probability is 5*2/6^2, but i believe this is wrong. Please let me know under what situations do we employ my understanding. Sorry if it is a silly question. Thank you for your time.                          jlgdr      Current Student        Joined: 06 Sep 2013   Posts: 1921   Concentration: Finance   Schools:  HBS '17 (WA) , Wharton '17 (A)                        Re: Two dice are tossed once.

The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 When we roll two dice, there are 6 x 6 = 36 equally likely outcomes. From these 36 outcomes, we can get a total of 8 in the following ways: 6,2 2,6 4,4 5,3 3,5 The probability of each of these outcomes is 1/36, so the probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/36. The probability of getting an even number on the first die is 1/2. Recall that the probability of A or B is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Let’s concentrate on P(A and B), which includes outcomes that have an even first roll AND a total of 8. The probability that the first die is even and the total of the two dice is 8 is 3/36 since (6,2), (2,6), and (4,4) are 3 of the 36 outcomes in which the first die is even and the total is 8. Thus, the total probability of getting an even number on the first die OR a total of 8 is: 5/36 + 1/2 - 3/36 = 5/36 + 18/36 - 3/36 = 20/36 Answer: D _________________     Scott Woodbury-Stewart  Founder and CEO            GMAT Quant Self-Study Course  500+ lessons 3000+ practice problems 800+ HD solutions    TRY FOR $1                                  mtk10      Manager        B     Joined: 02 Jan 2017   Posts: 81   Location: Pakistan   Concentration: Finance, Technology   GMAT 1 : 650 Q47 V34     GPA: 3.41   WE: Business Development (Accounting)                       Re: Two dice are tossed once.

The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 OR probability:  If Events A and B are independent, the probability that Event A OR Event B occurs is equal to the probability that Event A occurs plus the probability that Event B occurs minus the probability that both Events A and B occur: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \ and \ B)\). This is basically the same as 2 overlapping sets formula: {total # of items in groups A or B} = {# of items in group A} + {# of items  in group B} - {# of items in A and B} . Note that if event are mutually exclusive then \(P(A \ and \ B)=0\) and the formula simplifies to: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B)\). Also note that when we say "A or B occurs" we include three possibilities: A occurs and B does not occur; B occurs and A does not occur; Both A and B occur. AND probability: When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events: \(P(A \ and \ B) = P(A)*P(B)\). This is basically the same as Principle of Multiplication : if one event can occur in \(m\) ways and a second can occur independently of the first in \(n\) ways, then the two events can occur in \(mn\) ways. BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION: Two dice are tossed once. The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 1. The probability of getting an even number at the first die is 1/2 (as the probability of even = the probability of odd = 1/2); 2. The probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/6^2, as there are 5 different favorable scenarios: (2,6), (6,2), (3,5), (5,3) and (4,4); 3. The probability of getting an even number at the first die AND a total of 8 is 3/6^2 (from above case); Hence, The probability of getting an even number at the first die OR a total of 8 is 1/2+5/36-3/36=20/36. Answer: D. As you have mentioned above When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events: \(P(A \ and \ B) = P(A)*P(B)\). Could you explain why can we not get probability of ( even number & total of 8)= by multiplying the two probabilities  ? Like this = 1/2 * 5/36? Or am i missing something quite simple here ( I feel like i am)                        Eulerelements      Intern        B     Joined: 08 Dec 2017   Posts: 17                      Re: Two dice are tossed once.

A. 35/36 B. 7/8 C. 1/8 D. 1/36 E. 1/216 We want P(select at least 1 even number) When it comes to probability questions involving " at least ," it's usually best to try using the complement . That is, P(Event A happening) = 1 - P(Event A not happening) So, here we get: P(getting at least 1 even number) = 1 - P( not getting at least 1 even number) What does it mean to not get at least 1 even number? It means getting zero even numbers. So, we can write: P(getting at least 1 even number) = 1 - P(getting zero even numbers) P(getting zero even numbers) = P(1st coin is odd AND 2nd coin is odd AND 3rd coin is odd ) = P(1st coin is odd) x P(2nd coin is odd) x P(3rd coin is odd ) = 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8 So, P(getting at least 1 even number) = 1 - 1/8 = 7/8 Answer: B _________________   Brent Hanneson – Founder of gmatprepnow.com                                  ScottTargetTestPrep      Target Test Prep Representative     G     Status: Founder & CEO   Affiliations: Target Test Prep   Joined: 14 Oct 2015   Posts: 2385   Location: United States (CA)                      Re: What is the probability of rolling three fair dice and having at least [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     03 Feb 2017, 12:47        1  This post received KUDOS       Expert's post            1  This post was BOOKMARKED        Bunuel wrote: What is the probability of rolling three fair dice and having at least one of the three dice show an even number? A. 35/36 B. 7/8 C. 1/8 D. 1/36 E. 1/216 We can look at this problem in terms of only 2 possible events. Either at least one die shows an even number or no dice show an even number. This means: P(at least one die showing an even number) + P(no dice showing an even number) = 1 P(at least one die showing an even number) = 1 - P(no dice showing an even number) Thus, if we can determine the probability of no dice showing an even number, we’ll quickly be able to calculate the probability that at least one die shows an even number. There are 3 even and 3 odd numbers on each die. Thus, the probability of not showing an even number on all three dice is 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8. Thus, the probability of showing an even number on at least one die is 1 = 1/8 = 7/8.

There is 1/8+1/8 of a chance or 1/4 chance that an odd or an even WILL NOT be rolled. (Which is the opposite of what the question is asking). 1 is a 100% chance that something will happen so 1 - the certainty that it will NOT happen = the probability that at least one even and one odd will be rolled...make sense?                        bigfernhead      Retired Moderator        Joined: 18 Jul 2008   Posts: 912                       Re: Probability: Another 'die' question [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     16 Sep 2008, 07:27      Got it!

Hence, probability = 6/8 = 3/4. --== Message from GMAT Club Team ==-- This is not a quality discussion. It has been retired.

Are you aware of any thread where we such approaches are discussed? Similar solution can be applied to problem like no. of cases A occurs before B in a sequence, no. of cases where A & B are together In both cases half of the total no. of cases would be the answer. Since, either A comes after B or before B, either A & B are together or separated.

I understand to arrange we need to do 4!, but can you break the 2!2! part here? I intutively understand its because of the pair of O and E, but can you explain it further? THEORY: Permutations of \(n\) things of which \(P_1\) are alike of one kind, \(P_2\) are alike of second kind, \(P_3\) are alike of third kind ... \(P_r\) are alike of \(r_{th}\) kind such that: \(P_1+P_2+P_3+..+P_r=n\) is: \(\frac{n!}{P_1!*P_2!*P_3!*...*P_r!}\). For example number of permutation of the letters of the word "gmatclub" is 8! as there are 8 DISTINCT letters in this word. Number of permutation of the letters of the word "google" is \(\frac{6!}{2!2!}\), as there are 6 letters out of which "g" and "o" are represented twice. Number of permutation of 9 balls out of which 4 are red, 3 green and 2 blue, would be \(\frac{9!}{4!3!2!}\). So, the number of arrangements of four letters EEOO is 4!/(2!2!). Hope it's clear. _________________   New to the Math Forum? Please read this: Ultimate GMAT Quantitative Megathread | All You Need for Quant | PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW:  12 Rules for Posting!!!

You say that the probability will be 1/2 because the sum will either be even or be odd. 1/2 means that each of these events are equally likely. While solving Combinations problems, I have seen a similar approach from you in some questions. My question is, how can one infer whether the cases possible are equally likely?

It is called principle of deferred decisions. It goes like this. Condition on the parity of the first die throw. It is either 0 or 1. Now, the parity determines uniquely what the parity of the second die throw must be to have the resultant sum have parity 0. Thus,  \begin{align}
P(\text{even sum}) &= P(\text{even sum, first was even} + P(\text{even sum, first was odd}) \\
&= P(\text{even|first was even})P(\text{first was even}) + P(\text{even|first was odd})P(\text{first was odd})
\end{align}  Now, note that $P(\text{even|first was even}) = P(\text{second is even}) = 1/2$. Similarly, $P(\text{even|first  was odd}) = P(\text{second is odd}) = 1/2$. Thus, we have $P(\text{even sum}) = 1/2\left(P(\text{first was even}) + P(\text{first was odd})\right) = 1/2\left(1\right) = 1/2$.  ADDENDUM: The principle of deferred decisions helps solve much harder similar problems. Consider this problem - you throw a die 10 times. What is the probability that the sum is a multiple of 6?  \begin{align}
P(\text{sum $\equiv 0 \mod 6$}) &= \sum_{i=0}^5 P(\text{sum $\equiv 0 \mod 6$}|\text{previous sum was $\equiv i \mod 6$}) \cdot P(\text{previous sum was $\equiv i \mod 6$})
\end{align}  Note that $P(\text{sum $\equiv 0 \mod 6$}|\text{previous sum was $\equiv i \mod 6$}) = 1/6$ because there is only one particular die value that will give us $(6-i) \mod 6$. Thus, $P(\text{sum $\equiv 0 \mod 6$}) = 1/6\left(\sum_{i=0}^5 P(\text{previous sum was $\equiv i \mod 6$})\right) = 1/6\left(1\right) = 1/6.$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 22 '17 at 13:01             answered Oct 22 '17 at 12:56       Abhiram Natarajan   1,079 1 14                  Thank you very much :-) Solved the Problem for me – hukachaka  Oct 22 '17 at 13:14            I still have one question. For the next task i need to do it for 3 dice rolls and if the sum is divisible by 3.You answer with 10 times should be helping me solving this. But i dont understand the "5" above the sigma. doesnt this have to be 10 since you said you throw the dice 10 times? – hukachaka  Oct 22 '17 at 13:29            @AlVed it can be done more simple: every set $\{n+1,\dots,n+6\}$ contains exactly $2$ elements that are divible by $3$. – drhab  Oct 22 '17 at 13:35            @drhab, yes but aren't there different compositions possible. Like first 2,2,2 ? Doesnt the probability change then? – hukachaka  Oct 22 '17 at 13:52        2      The fact that we are rolling 10 times is encapsulated in "previous sum was ...". The point is we do not care about the probabilities of the previous sum because in our calculation we are summing over all probabilities, which by definition is 1. Let me know if this needs more explanation. – Abhiram Natarajan  Oct 22 '17 at 13:57         |  show 4 more comments            up vote  4  down vote      The sum of two dice rolls is even if both dice display even numbers or both display odd numbers.  Hence, the probability that the sum of the two dice rolls is even is 
$$P(\text{sum is even}) = P(\text{second is even} \mid \text{first is even})P(\text{first is even}) + P(\text{second is odd} \mid \text{first is odd})P(\text{first is odd}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$$  For the case of three dice rolls, we obtain an even sum if the outcome of the roll is even given that the sum of the first two rolls is even or if the outcome of the third roll is odd given that the sum of the first two rolls is odd.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 22 '17 at 12:56       N.

New question (as introduction for an easyer way of working):  Let it be that $n$ is some integer. Now throw a die and let $D$ denote the outcome.   What is the probability that $n+D$ is even?   Well, for every integer $n$ there are exactly $3$ even numbers in the set of possible outcomes: $\{n+1,n+2,n+3,n+4,n+5,n+6\}$ and all outcomes are equiprobable.  So the answer is $\frac36=0.5$.  For $n$ you can take anything you like.  Also a random $n$ will do, like the sum of one, two (or more) dice.   Let $X$ be a random variable with $\mathsf P(X\in\mathbb Z)=1$, let $D$ be the outcome by throwing one die and let $X$ and $D$ be independent.  Then:  $$\begin{aligned}\mathsf{P}\left(X+D\text{ is even}\right) &  =\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}\mathsf{P}(X+D\text{ is even}\mid X=n)\mathsf{P}(X=n)\\
 & =\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}\mathsf{P}(n+D\text{ is even})\mathsf{P}(X=n)\\
 & =\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}0.5\cdot\mathsf{P}(X=n)\\
 & =0.5\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}\mathsf{P}(X=n)\\
 & =0.5
\end{aligned}

F. Taussig  Oct 22 '17 at 14:52            thanks, I think op understood what I was trying to say – James  Oct 23 '17 at 14:11        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      An easy way to answer the OP's question is by drawing a picture and counting.  Make a $6 \times 6$ square showing every possible combination of numbers, like this:  $$\begin{matrix} 1,1 & 1,2 & \cdots & 1,6 \\
2,1 & 2,2 & \cdots & 2,6 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
6,1 & 6,2 & \dots & 6,6 \end{matrix}$$  It should be obvious that the odd and even sums form a checkerboard pattern, with three odd and three even in each row (and each column).  So there are the same number of odd and even sums - i.e. the probabilities of getting an odd or an even sum are both $1/2$.  There are two out of the six sums in each row (and column) that are divisible by $3$, so the probability of getting a sum divisible by $3$ is $1/3$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 23 '17 at 1:38       alephzero   621 3 7              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

1) We know that in normal dice the probability of getting an even number is 50%, but in this case the probability will be 75%, but how can I explain it better?
2) We know that in a normal dice, the probability would have been 4/6, but we have a cheted dice, so the probability of the number 2 and 4 will be twice than a normal dice, so we will have 6/6, but this make no sense.

'Snake-eyes' is a double-1, but that does not make sense the way I read your question. Anyway make a $6 \times  6$ array of the 36 possible pairs of
numbers, and write the appropriate probability in each cell (1/81, 2/81, or 4/81). Mark the relevant cells and add the marked probabilities. (If you mean 'total $\le 5$,' I agree with @DrXorile.)  Note: In practice, because of the way the numbers 1 through 6 are positioned
on a cubical die, it would be almost impossible to weight a die in the way you suggest. But on a crooked Internet gambling site, any assignment of probabilities is possible.  Here are results of a simulation of many rolls of such biased dice:  d1 = sample(1:6, 10^6, rep=T, prob=c(1,2,1,2,1,2))
mean(d1 <= 4) # aprx answ (1)
## 0.666425
mean(d1==2 | d1==4 | d1==6)
## 0.666845   # aprx answ (2)
d2 = sample(1:6, 10^6, rep=T, prob=c(1,2,1,2,1,2))
s = d1+d2     # totals on two dice
mean(s <= 5)
## 0.23438    # aprx answ (3)
19/81
## 0.2345679  # exact answ (3)  Below is a histogram of the simulated sums when two such biased dice are rolled.

It needs to be double that of the odd numbers, and the total must be 1.   What is the probability that the thrown number is at most 4?   Assuming a 6 sided dice that has 1-6 on its faces. Each odd number is 1/9, and each even is 2/9. Rolling $\leq 4$ has probability of 6/9 = 2/3.   With two dice of this kind what is the probability that the combined number of eyes shown is a most 5?   For this, you need to look at the various combinations. The answer is 19/81. I'll leave it as an exercise, but just write out all the different combinations of 2 dice that add up to less than or equal to 5, and add up their probabilities. The combined probability for each combination is the product of the two probabilities.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 23 '16 at 23:15       Dr Xorile   1,327 5 10                  Thank you very much.

of three even numbers is $\frac 18$, 
I'll look instead at this part of the question:   Why order of elements is so important? The problem doesn't say anything about the order of the even numbers!   The problem specifies that you have three numbers each resulting from a roll
of a fair die. Indeed it says nothing about the sequence of those numbers,
and if it is convenient for you to ignore the order of the numbers then
you may do so ... provided you also avoid the pitfalls described below.  The three dice will come up with certain combinations of numbers
with fixed frequencies regardless of who is asking what question about
those numbers. For example, 
there is a probability $\frac{1}{216}$
that all three dice will show the number $2$,
and the probability to get one of each of the
even numbers (one $2$, one $4$, and one $6$) in any order is $\frac{1}{36}$,
six times greater than the probability to get all $2$s.  But if you only count combinations of numbers selected
from $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$, you will effectively assign zero probability
to the even that all three dice show $2$.
Even if you decide to consider the order of the dice and count permutations,
you will not count all the events correctly.
And if you come up with some other counting scheme in which 
"all $2$s" is one event and "one each of $2$, $4$, and $6$" is another event,
you must multiply each event by its probability of occurring, 
not just count the events.
The formula "number of successes / total number of events" is valid only
when all events are equally likely.  In summary, it is not necessary to consider the order in which the numbers
are rolled when computing your probability, but it makes it much easier to compute the correct answer.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 27 '16 at 19:25       David K   44.4k 3 35 95              add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      Using combinations means you are choosing a certain number from a set, where order does not matter. As for this problem, order does matter. $(2,4,6)$ and $(4,2,6)$ are different possibilities, therefore you should use permutations.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 27 '16 at 19:03       Valeria   151 2                  It's not enough to count permutations unless you count permutations with repetition. – David K  Jun 27 '16 at 19:31        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Toss 2 coins .

Your die throws are independent events (the value on the second or third throw doesn't depend on the first).  The probability of getting an even number is $1/2$ on each throw.  So getting an even number on all three throws is $1/2^3 = 1/8$.  What matters in your solution is that you counted the possibilities correctly.  There are indeed $3^3$ ways to get three even numbers, and $3^6$ total possibilities.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 27 '16 at 18:51       John   20.8k 3 22 43              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

For the purpose of this question, 0 is even.   I tried doing this problem with induction, but I have problem with induction so I was wondering if my solution was correct:   The base case: For $n=0$, our formula gives us $\frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^0] =1$. This is true, because if we throw the die zero times, we always get zero sixes.  Suppose it's true for $n=k$. Then the odds of an even number of sixes is $\frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n]$, and thus the odds of an odd number of sixes is $1 - \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n]$.   For $n=k+1$, there are two ways the number of sixes are even:  a. The number of sixes for $n=k$ was even, and we do not throw a six for $n=k+1$: $ \frac{5}{6} \cdot  \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n]$  b. The number of sixes for $n=k$ was odd, and we throw a six for $n=k+1$: $\frac{1}{6}(1 - \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n])$  So the probability $p$ for an even number of sixes at $n=k+1$ is $ \frac{5}{6} \cdot  \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n] + \frac{1}{6}(1 - \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n])$  I have two questions   How do I get from $ \frac{5}{6} \cdot  \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n] + \frac{1}{6}(1 - \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n])$ to $\frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n]$? I seem to have done something wrong, I can't get the algebra correct, I get $p = \frac{1}{3}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n] + \dfrac{1}{6}$  Other than that, is my use of induction correct? Is it rigorous enough to prove the formula?     probability  induction     share | cite | improve this question     asked Feb 10 '16 at 4:06       Yakub   43 2                  As a side note: " For the purposes of this question, zero is even " is a redundant statement.

\frac{1}{6}\left(1- \frac{1}{2}\left[1+\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{k}\right]\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left[1+\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{k+1}\right]$$  [Also, two footnotes: odds isn't the same as probability, so the words shouldn't really be used interchangeably.

Let $X_i = 1$ if roll $i$ is a $6$, otherwise $X_i = 0$.  Clearly, $$\Pr[E_n] + \Pr[O_n] = 1$$ for all $n$.  Now, observe that $$\begin{align*} \Pr[E_n] &= \Pr[E_{n-1} \cap X_n = 0] + \Pr[O_{n-1} \cap X_n = 1] \\ &= \frac{5\Pr[E_{n-1}] + \Pr[O_{n-1}]}{6} \\ &= \frac{4 \Pr[E_{n-1}] + 1}{6}.\end{align*}$$  This establishes a recursion relationship with $a_n = \Pr[E_n]$, namely $$a_n = \frac{2}{3} a_{n-1} + \frac{1}{6}, \quad a_1 = \frac{5}{6},$$ since in $n = 1$ roll, the chance of an even number of sixes is equal to the chance that no six is rolled.  Now consider a constant $c$ so that $$a_n - c = \frac{2}{3}(a_{n-1} - c).$$  If this equation is to be equivalent to the desired recursion, we must have $$c - \frac{2}{3}c = \frac{1}{6},$$ or $c = 1/2$.  Therefore, letting $b_n = a_n - 1/2$, we obtain the auxiliary recursion $$b_n = \frac{2}{3} b_{n-1}, \quad b_1 = \frac{1}{3},$$ which has the obvious geometric sequence solution $$b_n = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n-1} b_1 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n-1} \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2^{n-1}}{3^n}.$$  Consequently, $$\Pr[E_n] = a_n = b_n + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2^{n-1}}{3^n} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n\right),$$ as claimed.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 10 '16 at 4:26       heropup   57.2k 6 55 91              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

His assertion is that the correct probability is:  18/36 + 10/36 - 6/36 = 22/36  Instead of,  18/36 + 10/36 - 4/36 = 24/36  His point seems correct, since the last term for intersection should be 6/36 buts its showing as 4/36 as the correct option.    probability  dice     share | cite | improve this question     asked Jun 19 '17 at 9:23       Shiv_90   9 5                  Are you sure your title correctly reflects the question?

The probability of throwing an 8 has an event space of (2,6),(3,5),(4,4),(5,3),(6,2) ; so the probability of throwing an 8 is 5/36. (The number of things in the event space divided by the size of the sample space.)  The probability of (even first die) or (8) is the sum of the probabilities less the number of items in the intersection.  Thus the probability is 1/2+5/36-3/36=20/36=5/9  (2) The probability of the first card being an ace is 4/52 or 1/13. The probability of the second card being an ace (assuming the first is an ace) is 3/51 or 1/17. (There are 3 aces left, and 51 cards to choose from.) So the probability that there are two aces is 1/13*1/17=1/221  The probability that the first card is black is 1/2. The probability that the second card is black (assuming the first card is black) is 25/51. So the probability that both cards are black is 1/2*25/51=25/102.  The probability of (2 aces) or (2 black cards) is the sum of the probabilities minus the intersection. Thus the probability is 1/221+25/102-1/1326. (There are 12 ways to pull two aces, 2 of which are all black. Thus the probability that you have selected 2 black aces is 2/2652=1/1326; there are a total of 52*51=2652 different 2 card selections.)  So the probability is 1/221+25/102-1/1326=55/221      list Cite  link Link                         Access hundreds of thousands of answers with a free trial.

Probability    Learning Objective(s)  ·  Define event, outcome, trial, simple event, sample space and calculate the probability that an event will occur.  ·  Calculate the probability of events for more complex outcomes.  ·  Solve applications involving probabilities.     Introduction     Probability provides a measure of how likely it is that something will occur. It is a number between and including the numbers 0 and 1. It can be written as a fraction, a decimal, or a percent.       Picking numbers randomly means that there is no specific order in which they are chosen.  Many games use dice or spinners to generate numbers randomly. If you understand how to calculate probabilities, you can make thoughtful decisions about how to play these games by knowing the likelihood of various outcomes.     Definitions     First you need to know some terms related to probability. When working with probability, a random action or series of actions is called a trial . An outcome is the result of a trial, and an event is a particular collection of outcomes. Events are usually described using a common characteristic of the outcomes.    Let's apply this language to see how the terms work in practice. Some games require rolling a die with six sides, numbered from 1 to 6. (Dice is the plural of die.) The chart below illustrates the use of trial, outcome, and event for such a game:        Trial    Outcomes    Examples of Events      Rolling a die    There are 6 possible outcomes:  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}    Rolling an even number: {2, 4, 6}  Rolling a 3: {3}  Rolling a 1 or a 3: {1, 3}  Rolling a 1 and a 3: { } (Only one number can be rolled, so this outcome is impossible. The event has no outcomes in it.)        Notice that a collection of outcomes is put in braces and separated by commas.    A simple event is an event with only one outcome. Rolling a 1 would be a simple event, because there is only one outcome that works—1! Rolling more than a 5 would also be a simple event, because the event includes only 6 as a valid outcome. A compound event is an event with more than one outcome. For example, in rolling one six-sided die, rolling an even number could occur with one of three outcomes: 2, 4, and 6.    When you roll a six-sided die many times, you should not expect any outcome to happen more often than another (assuming that it is a fair die). The outcomes in a situation like this are said to be equally likely . It’s very important to recognize when outcomes are equally likely when calculating probability. Since each outcome in the die-rolling trial is equally likely, you would expect to get each outcome of the rolls. That is, you'd expect of the rolls to be 1, of the rolls to be 2, of the rolls to be 3, and so on.         A spinner is divided into four equal parts, each colored with a different color as shown below. When this spinner is spun, the arrow points to one of the colors. Are the outcomes equally likely?       A) Yes, they are equally likely.  B) No, they are not equally likely.    Show/Hide Answer  All the outcomes are equally likely. Each color provides a different outcome, and each color takes up of the circle. You would expect the arrow to point to each color of the time.    Probability of Events   The probability of an event is how often it is expected to occur. It is the ratio of the size of the event space to the size of the sample space .  First, you need to determine the size of the sample space. The size of the sample space is the total number of possible outcomes. For example, when you roll 1 die, the sample space is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So the size of the sample space is 6.  Then you need to determine the size of the event space. The event space is the number of outcomes in the event you are interested in. The event space for rolling a number less than three is 1 or 2. So the size of the event space is 2.  For equally likely outcomes, the probability of an event E can be written P(E).               Example      Problem    A game requires rolling a six-sided die numbered from 1 to 6. What is the probability of rolling an even number?            Sample space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}    Event space = {2, 4, 6}    First, find the sample space and the event space. The sample space is all the possible outcomes, and the event space is the outcomes in the event. In this case, the event is “rolling an even number.”                 Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.      Answer    P (even number) =            It is a common practice with probabilities, as with fractions in general, to simplify a probability into lowest terms since that makes it easier for most people to get a sense of how great it is. Unless there is reason not to do so, express all final probabilities in lowest terms.      A spinner is divided into equal parts, each colored with a different color as shown below. Find the probability of spinning blue or green on this spinner:         A)    B)    C) 2    D) 6    Show/Hide Answer  A)  Incorrect. There are 6 equally likely outcomes, so the probability of each outcome is . However, the event has two outcomes in it, {blue, green}. The probability is . The correct answer is .    B)  Correct. There are 6 equally likely outcomes, and the event has two outcomes in it, {blue, green}. The probability is .    C) 2  Incorrect. The highest number that a probability value can be is 1! There are 2 outcomes in the event space, but the probability of the event is the ratio of outcomes in the event space to the total number of equally likely outcomes. There are 6 equally likely outcomes, so the probability is .    D) 6  Incorrect. The highest number that a probability value can be is 1! There are 6 equally likely outcomes in the sample space, but the probability of the event is the ratio of outcomes in the event space to the total number of equally likely outcomes. The probability is .    Counting Methods to find Sample Spaces   The most difficult thing for calculating a probability can be finding the size of the sample space, especially if there are two or more trials. There are several counting methods that can help.  The first one to look at is making a chart. In the example below, Tori is flipping two coins. So you need to determine the sample space carefully. A chart such as the one shown in the example that follows is a good approach.       Example      Problem    Tori is flipping a pair of coins and noting how many flips of “heads” she gets. What is the probability that she flips 2 heads? What is the probability that she flips only 1 head?                        Outcomes:       First coin    Second coin    outcome      H    H    HH      H    T    HT      T    H    TH      T    T    TT       sample space: {HH, HT, TH, TT}    event space for 2 heads: {HH}  event space for 1 head: {HT, TH}      Create a chart to record the results of flipping the first coin, followed by the result of flipping the second coin.                 Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.      Answer              In the example below, the sample space for Tori is simple as only one die is being rolled. However, since James is rolling two die, a chart helps to organize the information.       Example      Problem    Tori rolled a six-sided die and wanted to get a result of either 1 or 4. James rolled two six-sided dice, one blue and one red, and wanted to get a result of both a 1 and a 3, at the same time. Which event has a greater probability?          Tori's sample space: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}    Tori's event space: {1, 4}        Tori:        First, find the sample space and the event space for the two trials. For Tori's trial, this is straightforward.    Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.                         Red die              1    2    3    4    5    6      Blue die    1    1, 1    1, 2    1, 3    1, 4    1, 5    1, 6      2    2, 1    2, 2    2, 3    2, 4    2, 5    2, 6      3    3, 1    3, 2    3, 3    3, 4    3, 5    3, 6      4    4, 1    4, 2    4, 3    4, 4    4, 5    4, 6      5    5, 1    5, 2    5, 3    5, 4    5, 5    5, 6      6    6, 1    6, 2    6, 3    6, 4    6, 5    6, 6       James' sample space has 36 outcomes.  James' event space has 2 outcomes.    It's not so obvious for James’ trial, since he is rolling two dice. Use a chart to find the possibilities.    There are 36 outcomes. Of these, there are 2 that have both 1 and 3.            James:    Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.      Answer    Tori's event has a greater probability.          You can also use a tree diagram to determine the sample space. A tree diagram has a branch for every possible outcome for each event.  Suppose a closet has three pairs of pants (black, white, and green), four shirts (green, white, purple, and yellow), and two pairs of shoes (black and white). How many different outfits can be made? There are 3 choices for pants, 4 choices for shirts, and 2 choices for shoes. For our tree diagram, let's use B for black, W for white, G for green, P for purple, and Y for yellow.    You can see from the tree diagram that there are 24 possible outfits (some perhaps not great choices) in the sample space.  Now you could fairly easily solve some probability problems. For example, what is the probability that if you close your eyes and choose randomly you would choose pants and shoes with the same color? You can see that there are 8 outfits where the pants and the shoes match.   As you've seen, when a trial involves more than one random element, such as flipping more than one coin or rolling more than one die, you don't always need to identify every outcome in the sample space to calculate a probability. You only need the number of outcomes.  The Fundamental Counting Principle is a way to find the number of outcomes without listing and counting every one of them.     The Fundamental Counting Principle    If one event has p possible outcomes, and another event has m possible outcomes, then there are a total of p  •  m possible outcomes for the two events.    Examples  ·  Rolling two six-sided dice: Each die has 6 equally likely outcomes, so the sample space is 6 • 6 or 36 equally likely outcomes.  ·  Flipping three coins: Each coin has 2 equally likely outcomes, so the sample space is 2 • 2 • 2 or 8 equally likely outcomes.  ·  Rolling a six-sided die and flipping a coin: The sample space is 6 • 2 or 12 equally likely outcomes.     So you could use the Fundamental Counting Principle to find out how many outfits there are in the previous example. There are 3 choices for pants, 4 choices for shirts, and 2 choices for shoes. Using The Fundamental Counting Principle, you have 4 • 3 • 2 = 24 different outfits.       Example      Problem    Barry volunteers at a charity walk to make lunches for all the other volunteers. In each bag he puts:  ·  one of two sandwiches (peanut butter and jelly, or turkey and cheese),  ·  one of three chips (regular potato chips, baked potato chips, or corn chips),  ·  one piece of fruit (an apple or an orange).  He forgot to mark what was in the bags. Assuming that each choice is equally likely, what is the probability that the bag Therese gets holds a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and an apple?            Size of sample space:    (number of sandwich choices) • (number of chip choices) • (number of fruit choices) = 2 • 3 • 2 = 12        First, use the Fundamental Counting Principle to find the size of the sample space.          Size of event space:    (number of sandwich choices in event) • (number of chip choices in event) • (number of fruit choices in event) = 1 • 3 • 1 = 3    For the event space, follow the same principle. In this case, there is only one sandwich and one piece of fruit of interest, but any of the three types of chips are acceptable.      Answer       Use the ratio to find the probability.          Carrie flips four coins and counts the number of tails. There are four ways to get exactly one tail: HHHT, HHTH, HTHH, and THHH. What is the probability that Carrie gets exactly one tail?      A)    B)     C)    D)    Show/Hide Answer  A)  Incorrect. Since there are two outcomes for each coin, there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). However, there are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    B)  Incorrect. Since there are two outcomes for each coin, there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). There are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    C)  Correct. Since there are two outcomes for each coin, there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). There are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    D)  Incorrect. There are two outcomes for each coin, but there are 4 coins. That means there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). There are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    Summary   Probability helps you understand random, unpredictable situations where multiple outcomes are possible. It is a measure of the likelihood of an event, and it depends on the ratio of event and possible outcomes, if all those outcomes are equally likely.   The Fundamental Counting Principle is a shortcut to finding the size of the sample space when there are many trials and outcomes:  If one event has p possible outcomes, and another event has m possible outcomes, then there are a total of p  • m possible outcomes for the two events.

everyone. We need to be more precise about how likely something (an
outcome) is to happen. The probability of an outcome can have any
value between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain). It may be a fraction,
decimal or percentage. When different outcomes of
an event are equally likely (for example, getting a head
when you toss a coin), you can
use a formula to calculate the probability of outcomes. When you throw a fair dice there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 or 6. There are three ways of getting an odd number (1, 3
or 5). So the probability of getting an odd number = the number of ways of getting an odd number ÷ total number of possible outcomes = 3 / 6 = 1 / 2 or 0.5, or 50%.

Probability  Probabilities of 6-Sided Dice  It's sometimes handy to know the probabilities of an action succeeding
in TFT. Since TFT uses 6-sided dice exclusively (as does GURPS),
these tables do not include any other possibilities. The first table
gives the probability of rolling a specific number; the second table

It can also be used
to find the probability of rolling a particular number or more .
Since the probability of rolling N or more is the same as the
probability of not rolling N-1 or less, simply look up the
N-1 value on this table, and subtract it from 1 or 100%. For example,
to find the probability of rolling 8 or more on 3 dice, look up
the probability of rolling 7 or less, which is 35/216 or 16.204%.
Subtract that from 1, giving 181/216 (216 - 35 = 181) or 83.796%.

When a die is thrown the outcome can be any of the numbers from 1 to 6. If two dice are thrown the set of outcomes that ensure the sum is 9 is {(3, 6), (6,3), (4, 5), (5, 4)}. The total number of possible outcomes is 6*6 = 36  This gives the required probability as 4/36 = 1/9  The probability of getting 9 as the sum when 2 dice are thrown is 1/9.  Problem 2.  A standard deck of cards has 52 cards with 4 aces and 4 queens. The total number of outcomes when two cards are randomly picked is 52*51 = 2652. There are 4 ways in which the first card picked can be an ace. And there are 4 ways in which the second card can be a queen. It is important to notice that the order of picking an ace and a queen is not important here. As a result, we also have to consider the possibility of picking a queen followed by an ace. This gives the total number of ways in which an ace and a queen can be picked as 4*4 + 4*4 = 32. The required probability is 32/2652 = 8/663  When 2 cards are randomly picked from a standard deck of cards the probability of picking a queen and an ace is 8/663 .      list Cite  link Link              Student Comments      rachellopez | Student    1. In order to get a sum of 9 with two dice, you would have to roll the pairs 4 & 5, 5 & 4, 3 & 6, or 6 & 3. Since you have two dice there are 36 different combinations (6 faces*6 faces) you could roll, but only 4 of them would give you a sum of 9. That makes the probability 4/36 or 1/9 .  2. There are 52 cards in a deck. If you draw two at random you'd have 52 to choose from for your first draw and only 51 for your second. That gives you 2,652 combinations of cards total. Out of the 52 cards in the deck, 4 are aces and 4 are queens. This means you can choose an ace and then a queen (4*4) or a queen and then an ace (4*4). You'll have 32 combinations of an ace and a queen total, giving you a probability of 32/2,652 or 8/663 .                         Access hundreds of thousands of answers with a free trial.

everyone. We need to be more precise about how likely something (an
outcome) is to happen. The probability of an outcome can have any
value between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain). It may be a fraction,
decimal or percentage. When different outcomes of
an event are equally likely (for example, getting a head
when you toss a coin), you can
use a formula to calculate the probability of outcomes. When you throw a fair dice there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 or 6. There are three ways of getting an odd number (1, 3
or 5). So the probability of getting an odd number = the number of ways of getting an odd number ÷ total number of possible outcomes = 3 / 6 = 1 / 2 or 0.5, or 50%. Activity Click to play the probability activity Play Events and probabilities The table below gives some examples of events and how their probability can be calculated.

The key is to work systematically - do not just list all the outcomes randomly. Here is an example: Question Imagine that you had to find all the different orders in which three people (Anita, Benita and Carol) could finish
in a race. The first step (to save you writing too much) is to label the people A, B and C - but make sure you mention this. Jot down the
different orders in which Anita, Benita and Carol could
finish. Answer ABC, ACB, BCA, BAC, CAB, CBA Make sure you can 'see' the pattern in the order of choices.

The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 OR probability:  If Events A and B are independent, the probability that Event A OR Event B occurs is equal to the probability that Event A occurs plus the probability that Event B occurs minus the probability that both Events A and B occur: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \ and \ B)\). This is basically the same as 2 overlapping sets formula: {total # of items in groups A or B} = {# of items in group A} + {# of items  in group B} - {# of items in A and B} . Note that if event are mutually exclusive then \(P(A \ and \ B)=0\) and the formula simplifies to: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B)\). Also note that when we say "A or B occurs" we include three possibilities: A occurs and B does not occur; B occurs and A does not occur; Both A and B occur. AND probability: When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events: \(P(A \ and \ B) = P(A)*P(B)\). This is basically the same as Principle of Multiplication : if one event can occur in \(m\) ways and a second can occur independently of the first in \(n\) ways, then the two events can occur in \(mn\) ways. BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION: Two dice are tossed once. The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 1. The probability of getting an even number at the first die is 1/2 (as the probability of even = the probability of odd = 1/2); 2. The probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/6^2, as there are 5 different favorable scenarios: (2,6), (6,2), (3,5), (5,3) and (4,4); 3. The probability of getting an even number at the first die AND a total of 8 is 3/6^2 (from above case); Hence, The probability of getting an even number at the first die OR a total of 8 is 1/2+5/36-3/36=20/36.

Remember that the "OR formula" is: P(A) OR P(B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) In this case, A and B can take place together, so the value of P(A and B) is greater than 0. _________________   "Life’s battle doesn’t always go to stronger or faster men; but sooner or later the man who wins is the one who thinks he can."

Why don't we make a difference between 4 on dice 1 and four on dice ? I mean why the combination 4'4'' is the same as 4''4' (apostrophe symbolizes the dice: ' = dice number one, '' = dice number two). I have encountered many probability problems, where events that are identical are differentiated. For example: Quote: A 5 meter long wire is cut into two pieces. The longer piece is then used to form a perimeter of a square. What is the probability that the area of the square will be more than 1 if the original wire is cut at an arbitrary point? 1/6 1/5 3/10 1/3 2/5 OA: [Reveal] Spoiler: (E) In the example above the probability is 2/5.

Could you please explain the difference? This is completely different problem. In order the area of a square to be more than 1 the side of it must be more than 1, or the perimeter more than 4. So the longer piece must be more than 4. Look at the diagram. - --- - If the wire will be cut anywhere at the red region then the rest of the wire (longer piece) will be more than 4 meter long. The probability of that is 2/5 (2 red pieces out of 5). Answer: E.

Quote: why the probability of getting 'four' on both dices is 1/36 and not 1/18? Why don't we make a difference between 4 on die1 and four on die? This is because we fix dices one and two. Quote: A 5 meter long wire is cut into two pieces. The longer piece is then used to form a perimeter of a square. What is the probability that the area of the square will be more than 1 if the original wire is cut at an arbitrary point? This is because we can cut the wire from both ends. When we fix the ends, we can cut 1 m from the left, or we can cut 1 m from the right end. Both options are different since we have fixed the ends. Quote: When calculating probability, how should we know when to count the same instances and when not? We don't count twice the same instances of the fixed "property" (don't know how to call that). But if two fixed properties (e.g., two dices: die_1 = property_one, die_2 = property_two) yield the same result by taking various values, we need to count those options (as in the above example with dices producing the sum of 8).

The probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/6^2, as there are 5 different favorable scenarios: (2,6), (6,2), (3,5), (5,3) and (4,4); Dear Bunuel, my question pertains to the quoted text. My reasoning to get sum 8 is: Select any 5 numbers from first dice ie. probability: 5/6 To make the sum 8, only a unique number is to be chosen from 2nd dice. Hence the probability of selecting 1 number in second dice is : 1/6 Probability for sum 8 is 5/6^2. However I multiplied this number by 2 since you can perform the same task by selecting the second dice first and choosing a corresponding unique value in 1st dice. Net probability is 5*2/6^2, but i believe this is wrong. Please let me know under what situations do we employ my understanding. Sorry if it is a silly question.

The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 When we roll two dice, there are 6 x 6 = 36 equally likely outcomes. From these 36 outcomes, we can get a total of 8 in the following ways: 6,2 2,6 4,4 5,3 3,5 The probability of each of these outcomes is 1/36, so the probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/36. The probability of getting an even number on the first die is 1/2. Recall that the probability of A or B is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Let’s concentrate on P(A and B), which includes outcomes that have an even first roll AND a total of 8. The probability that the first die is even and the total of the two dice is 8 is 3/36 since (6,2), (2,6), and (4,4) are 3 of the 36 outcomes in which the first die is even and the total is 8. Thus, the total probability of getting an even number on the first die OR a total of 8 is: 5/36 + 1/2 - 3/36 = 5/36 + 18/36 - 3/36 = 20/36 Answer: D _________________     Scott Woodbury-Stewart  Founder and CEO            GMAT Quant Self-Study Course  500+ lessons 3000+ practice problems 800+ HD solutions    TRY FOR $1                                  mtk10      Manager        B     Joined: 02 Jan 2017   Posts: 81   Location: Pakistan   Concentration: Finance, Technology   GMAT 1 : 650 Q47 V34     GPA: 3.41   WE: Business Development (Accounting)                       Re: Two dice are tossed once.

The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 OR probability:  If Events A and B are independent, the probability that Event A OR Event B occurs is equal to the probability that Event A occurs plus the probability that Event B occurs minus the probability that both Events A and B occur: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \ and \ B)\). This is basically the same as 2 overlapping sets formula: {total # of items in groups A or B} = {# of items in group A} + {# of items  in group B} - {# of items in A and B} . Note that if event are mutually exclusive then \(P(A \ and \ B)=0\) and the formula simplifies to: \(P(A \ or \ B) = P(A) + P(B)\). Also note that when we say "A or B occurs" we include three possibilities: A occurs and B does not occur; B occurs and A does not occur; Both A and B occur. AND probability: When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events: \(P(A \ and \ B) = P(A)*P(B)\). This is basically the same as Principle of Multiplication : if one event can occur in \(m\) ways and a second can occur independently of the first in \(n\) ways, then the two events can occur in \(mn\) ways. BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION: Two dice are tossed once. The probability of getting an even number at the first die or a total of 8 is A. 1/36 B. 3/36 C. 11/36 D. 20/36 E. 23/36 1. The probability of getting an even number at the first die is 1/2 (as the probability of even = the probability of odd = 1/2); 2. The probability of getting a total of 8 is 5/6^2, as there are 5 different favorable scenarios: (2,6), (6,2), (3,5), (5,3) and (4,4); 3. The probability of getting an even number at the first die AND a total of 8 is 3/6^2 (from above case); Hence, The probability of getting an even number at the first die OR a total of 8 is 1/2+5/36-3/36=20/36. Answer: D. As you have mentioned above When two events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the probabilities of the individual events: \(P(A \ and \ B) = P(A)*P(B)\). Could you explain why can we not get probability of ( even number & total of 8)= by multiplying the two probabilities  ? Like this = 1/2 * 5/36? Or am i missing something quite simple here ( I feel like i am)                        Eulerelements      Intern        B     Joined: 08 Dec 2017   Posts: 17                      Re: Two dice are tossed once.

We have a probability of 1/2 to have an even number (2,4,6) => Prob(NEN) = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8 => Prob(at least one even number) = 1- Prob(NEN) = 1-1/8 = 7/8                              GMATPrepNow      SVP        P     Joined: 12 Sep 2015   Posts: 2203   Location: Canada                      Re: What is the probability of rolling three fair dice and having at least [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     03 Feb 2017, 08:33       Expert's post      Top Contributor            2  This post was BOOKMARKED        Bunuel wrote: What is the probability of rolling three fair dice and having at least one of the three dice show an even number? A. 35/36 B. 7/8 C. 1/8 D. 1/36 E. 1/216 We want P(select at least 1 even number) When it comes to probability questions involving " at least ," it's usually best to try using the complement . That is, P(Event A happening) = 1 - P(Event A not happening) So, here we get: P(getting at least 1 even number) = 1 - P( not getting at least 1 even number) What does it mean to not get at least 1 even number? It means getting zero even numbers. So, we can write: P(getting at least 1 even number) = 1 - P(getting zero even numbers) P(getting zero even numbers) = P(1st coin is odd AND 2nd coin is odd AND 3rd coin is odd ) = P(1st coin is odd) x P(2nd coin is odd) x P(3rd coin is odd ) = 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8 So, P(getting at least 1 even number) = 1 - 1/8 = 7/8 Answer: B _________________   Brent Hanneson – Founder of gmatprepnow.com                                  ScottTargetTestPrep      Target Test Prep Representative     G     Status: Founder & CEO   Affiliations: Target Test Prep   Joined: 14 Oct 2015   Posts: 2385   Location: United States (CA)                      Re: What is the probability of rolling three fair dice and having at least [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     03 Feb 2017, 12:47        1  This post received KUDOS       Expert's post            1  This post was BOOKMARKED        Bunuel wrote: What is the probability of rolling three fair dice and having at least one of the three dice show an even number? A. 35/36 B. 7/8 C. 1/8 D. 1/36 E. 1/216 We can look at this problem in terms of only 2 possible events. Either at least one die shows an even number or no dice show an even number. This means: P(at least one die showing an even number) + P(no dice showing an even number) = 1 P(at least one die showing an even number) = 1 - P(no dice showing an even number) Thus, if we can determine the probability of no dice showing an even number, we’ll quickly be able to calculate the probability that at least one die shows an even number. There are 3 even and 3 odd numbers on each die. Thus, the probability of not showing an even number on all three dice is 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/8. Thus, the probability of showing an even number on at least one die is 1 = 1/8 = 7/8.

There is 1/8+1/8 of a chance or 1/4 chance that an odd or an even WILL NOT be rolled. (Which is the opposite of what the question is asking). 1 is a 100% chance that something will happen so 1 - the certainty that it will NOT happen = the probability that at least one even and one odd will be rolled...make sense?                        bigfernhead      Retired Moderator        Joined: 18 Jul 2008   Posts: 912                       Re: Probability: Another 'die' question [ #permalink ]     Show Tags     16 Sep 2008, 07:27      Got it!

Hence, probability = 6/8 = 3/4. --== Message from GMAT Club Team ==-- This is not a quality discussion. It has been retired.

I understand to arrange we need to do 4!, but can you break the 2!2! part here? I intutively understand its because of the pair of O and E, but can you explain it further? THEORY: Permutations of \(n\) things of which \(P_1\) are alike of one kind, \(P_2\) are alike of second kind, \(P_3\) are alike of third kind ... \(P_r\) are alike of \(r_{th}\) kind such that: \(P_1+P_2+P_3+..+P_r=n\) is: \(\frac{n!}{P_1!*P_2!*P_3!*...*P_r!}\). For example number of permutation of the letters of the word "gmatclub" is 8! as there are 8 DISTINCT letters in this word. Number of permutation of the letters of the word "google" is \(\frac{6!}{2!2!}\), as there are 6 letters out of which "g" and "o" are represented twice. Number of permutation of 9 balls out of which 4 are red, 3 green and 2 blue, would be \(\frac{9!}{4!3!2!}\). So, the number of arrangements of four letters EEOO is 4!/(2!2!).

You say that the probability will be 1/2 because the sum will either be even or be odd. 1/2 means that each of these events are equally likely. While solving Combinations problems, I have seen a similar approach from you in some questions. My question is, how can one infer whether the cases possible are equally likely? This will help save valuable time in exam once understood.

It is called principle of deferred decisions. It goes like this. Condition on the parity of the first die throw. It is either 0 or 1. Now, the parity determines uniquely what the parity of the second die throw must be to have the resultant sum have parity 0. Thus,  \begin{align}
P(\text{even sum}) &= P(\text{even sum, first was even} + P(\text{even sum, first was odd}) \\
&= P(\text{even|first was even})P(\text{first was even}) + P(\text{even|first was odd})P(\text{first was odd})
\end{align}  Now, note that $P(\text{even|first was even}) = P(\text{second is even}) = 1/2$. Similarly, $P(\text{even|first  was odd}) = P(\text{second is odd}) = 1/2$. Thus, we have $P(\text{even sum}) = 1/2\left(P(\text{first was even}) + P(\text{first was odd})\right) = 1/2\left(1\right) = 1/2$.  ADDENDUM: The principle of deferred decisions helps solve much harder similar problems. Consider this problem - you throw a die 10 times. What is the probability that the sum is a multiple of 6?  \begin{align}
P(\text{sum $\equiv 0 \mod 6$}) &= \sum_{i=0}^5 P(\text{sum $\equiv 0 \mod 6$}|\text{previous sum was $\equiv i \mod 6$}) \cdot P(\text{previous sum was $\equiv i \mod 6$})
\end{align}  Note that $P(\text{sum $\equiv 0 \mod 6$}|\text{previous sum was $\equiv i \mod 6$}) = 1/6$ because there is only one particular die value that will give us $(6-i) \mod 6$. Thus, $P(\text{sum $\equiv 0 \mod 6$}) = 1/6\left(\sum_{i=0}^5 P(\text{previous sum was $\equiv i \mod 6$})\right) = 1/6\left(1\right) = 1/6.$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 22 '17 at 13:01             answered Oct 22 '17 at 12:56       Abhiram Natarajan   1,079 1 14                  Thank you very much :-) Solved the Problem for me – hukachaka  Oct 22 '17 at 13:14            I still have one question. For the next task i need to do it for 3 dice rolls and if the sum is divisible by 3.You answer with 10 times should be helping me solving this. But i dont understand the "5" above the sigma. doesnt this have to be 10 since you said you throw the dice 10 times? – hukachaka  Oct 22 '17 at 13:29            @AlVed it can be done more simple: every set $\{n+1,\dots,n+6\}$ contains exactly $2$ elements that are divible by $3$. – drhab  Oct 22 '17 at 13:35            @drhab, yes but aren't there different compositions possible. Like first 2,2,2 ? Doesnt the probability change then? – hukachaka  Oct 22 '17 at 13:52        2      The fact that we are rolling 10 times is encapsulated in "previous sum was ...". The point is we do not care about the probabilities of the previous sum because in our calculation we are summing over all probabilities, which by definition is 1. Let me know if this needs more explanation. – Abhiram Natarajan  Oct 22 '17 at 13:57         |  show 4 more comments            up vote  4  down vote      The sum of two dice rolls is even if both dice display even numbers or both display odd numbers.  Hence, the probability that the sum of the two dice rolls is even is 
$$P(\text{sum is even}) = P(\text{second is even} \mid \text{first is even})P(\text{first is even}) + P(\text{second is odd} \mid \text{first is odd})P(\text{first is odd}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$$  For the case of three dice rolls, we obtain an even sum if the outcome of the roll is even given that the sum of the first two rolls is even or if the outcome of the third roll is odd given that the sum of the first two rolls is odd.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 22 '17 at 12:56       N.

New question (as introduction for an easyer way of working):  Let it be that $n$ is some integer. Now throw a die and let $D$ denote the outcome.   What is the probability that $n+D$ is even?   Well, for every integer $n$ there are exactly $3$ even numbers in the set of possible outcomes: $\{n+1,n+2,n+3,n+4,n+5,n+6\}$ and all outcomes are equiprobable.  So the answer is $\frac36=0.5$.  For $n$ you can take anything you like.  Also a random $n$ will do, like the sum of one, two (or more) dice.   Let $X$ be a random variable with $\mathsf P(X\in\mathbb Z)=1$, let $D$ be the outcome by throwing one die and let $X$ and $D$ be independent.  Then:  $$\begin{aligned}\mathsf{P}\left(X+D\text{ is even}\right) &  =\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}\mathsf{P}(X+D\text{ is even}\mid X=n)\mathsf{P}(X=n)\\
 & =\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}\mathsf{P}(n+D\text{ is even})\mathsf{P}(X=n)\\
 & =\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}0.5\cdot\mathsf{P}(X=n)\\
 & =0.5\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z}\mathsf{P}(X=n)\\
 & =0.5
\end{aligned}

F. Taussig  Oct 22 '17 at 14:52            thanks, I think op understood what I was trying to say – James  Oct 23 '17 at 14:11        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      An easy way to answer the OP's question is by drawing a picture and counting.  Make a $6 \times 6$ square showing every possible combination of numbers, like this:  $$\begin{matrix} 1,1 & 1,2 & \cdots & 1,6 \\
2,1 & 2,2 & \cdots & 2,6 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
6,1 & 6,2 & \dots & 6,6 \end{matrix}$$  It should be obvious that the odd and even sums form a checkerboard pattern, with three odd and three even in each row (and each column).  So there are the same number of odd and even sums - i.e. the probabilities of getting an odd or an even sum are both $1/2$.  There are two out of the six sums in each row (and column) that are divisible by $3$, so the probability of getting a sum divisible by $3$ is $1/3$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 23 '17 at 1:38       alephzero   621 3 7              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

2) What is the probability that the thrown number is at most 4?

1) We know that in normal dice the probability of getting an even number is 50%, but in this case the probability will be 75%, but how can I explain it better?
2) We know that in a normal dice, the probability would have been 4/6, but we have a cheted dice, so the probability of the number 2 and 4 will be twice than a normal dice, so we will have 6/6, but this make no sense.

'Snake-eyes' is a double-1, but that does not make sense the way I read your question. Anyway make a $6 \times  6$ array of the 36 possible pairs of
numbers, and write the appropriate probability in each cell (1/81, 2/81, or 4/81). Mark the relevant cells and add the marked probabilities. (If you mean 'total $\le 5$,' I agree with @DrXorile.)  Note: In practice, because of the way the numbers 1 through 6 are positioned
on a cubical die, it would be almost impossible to weight a die in the way you suggest. But on a crooked Internet gambling site, any assignment of probabilities is possible.  Here are results of a simulation of many rolls of such biased dice:  d1 = sample(1:6, 10^6, rep=T, prob=c(1,2,1,2,1,2))
mean(d1 <= 4) # aprx answ (1)
## 0.666425
mean(d1==2 | d1==4 | d1==6)
## 0.666845   # aprx answ (2)
d2 = sample(1:6, 10^6, rep=T, prob=c(1,2,1,2,1,2))
s = d1+d2     # totals on two dice
mean(s <= 5)
## 0.23438    # aprx answ (3)
19/81
## 0.2345679  # exact answ (3)  Below is a histogram of the simulated sums when two such biased dice are rolled.

It needs to be double that of the odd numbers, and the total must be 1.   What is the probability that the thrown number is at most 4?   Assuming a 6 sided dice that has 1-6 on its faces. Each odd number is 1/9, and each even is 2/9. Rolling $\leq 4$ has probability of 6/9 = 2/3.   With two dice of this kind what is the probability that the combined number of eyes shown is a most 5?   For this, you need to look at the various combinations. The answer is 19/81. I'll leave it as an exercise, but just write out all the different combinations of 2 dice that add up to less than or equal to 5, and add up their probabilities. The combined probability for each combination is the product of the two probabilities.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 23 '16 at 23:15       Dr Xorile   1,327 5 10                  Thank you very much.

What is the probability of obtaining three
even numbers ?  I've solved this problem calculating the number of total results:  $$u=D'_{6,3}=6^3$$  and the number of favorable results:  $$f=D'_{3,3}=3^3$$  I've got:  $$p=\dfrac{f}{u}=\dfrac{3^3}{6^3}=\dfrac{1}{8}$$  This result is correct.  If i try to calculate $u$ and $f$ as combination with repetition, i get an error  Is it not possible to solve this problem with $u=C'_{6,3}$ and $f=C'_{3,3}$ ?

of three even numbers is $\frac 18$, 
I'll look instead at this part of the question:   Why order of elements is so important? The problem doesn't say anything about the order of the even numbers!   The problem specifies that you have three numbers each resulting from a roll
of a fair die. Indeed it says nothing about the sequence of those numbers,
and if it is convenient for you to ignore the order of the numbers then
you may do so ... provided you also avoid the pitfalls described below.  The three dice will come up with certain combinations of numbers
with fixed frequencies regardless of who is asking what question about
those numbers. For example, 
there is a probability $\frac{1}{216}$
that all three dice will show the number $2$,
and the probability to get one of each of the
even numbers (one $2$, one $4$, and one $6$) in any order is $\frac{1}{36}$,
six times greater than the probability to get all $2$s.  But if you only count combinations of numbers selected
from $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$, you will effectively assign zero probability
to the even that all three dice show $2$.
Even if you decide to consider the order of the dice and count permutations,
you will not count all the events correctly.
And if you come up with some other counting scheme in which 
"all $2$s" is one event and "one each of $2$, $4$, and $6$" is another event,
you must multiply each event by its probability of occurring, 
not just count the events.
The formula "number of successes / total number of events" is valid only
when all events are equally likely.  In summary, it is not necessary to consider the order in which the numbers
are rolled when computing your probability, but it makes it much easier to compute the correct answer.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 27 '16 at 19:25       David K   44.4k 3 35 95              add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      Using combinations means you are choosing a certain number from a set, where order does not matter. As for this problem, order does matter. $(2,4,6)$ and $(4,2,6)$ are different possibilities, therefore you should use permutations.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 27 '16 at 19:03       Valeria   151 2                  It's not enough to count permutations unless you count permutations with repetition. – David K  Jun 27 '16 at 19:31        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Toss 2 coins .

Your die throws are independent events (the value on the second or third throw doesn't depend on the first).  The probability of getting an even number is $1/2$ on each throw.  So getting an even number on all three throws is $1/2^3 = 1/8$.  What matters in your solution is that you counted the possibilities correctly.  There are indeed $3^3$ ways to get three even numbers, and $3^6$ total possibilities.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 27 '16 at 18:51       John   20.8k 3 22 43              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

For the purpose of this question, 0 is even.   I tried doing this problem with induction, but I have problem with induction so I was wondering if my solution was correct:   The base case: For $n=0$, our formula gives us $\frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^0] =1$. This is true, because if we throw the die zero times, we always get zero sixes.  Suppose it's true for $n=k$. Then the odds of an even number of sixes is $\frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n]$, and thus the odds of an odd number of sixes is $1 - \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n]$.   For $n=k+1$, there are two ways the number of sixes are even:  a. The number of sixes for $n=k$ was even, and we do not throw a six for $n=k+1$: $ \frac{5}{6} \cdot  \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n]$  b. The number of sixes for $n=k$ was odd, and we throw a six for $n=k+1$: $\frac{1}{6}(1 - \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n])$  So the probability $p$ for an even number of sixes at $n=k+1$ is $ \frac{5}{6} \cdot  \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n] + \frac{1}{6}(1 - \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n])$  I have two questions   How do I get from $ \frac{5}{6} \cdot  \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n] + \frac{1}{6}(1 - \frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n])$ to $\frac{1}{2}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n]$? I seem to have done something wrong, I can't get the algebra correct, I get $p = \frac{1}{3}[1+(\frac{2}{3})^n] + \dfrac{1}{6}$  Other than that, is my use of induction correct? Is it rigorous enough to prove the formula?     probability  induction     share | cite | improve this question     asked Feb 10 '16 at 4:06       Yakub   43 2                  As a side note: " For the purposes of this question, zero is even " is a redundant statement.

Let $X_i = 1$ if roll $i$ is a $6$, otherwise $X_i = 0$.  Clearly, $$\Pr[E_n] + \Pr[O_n] = 1$$ for all $n$.  Now, observe that $$\begin{align*} \Pr[E_n] &= \Pr[E_{n-1} \cap X_n = 0] + \Pr[O_{n-1} \cap X_n = 1] \\ &= \frac{5\Pr[E_{n-1}] + \Pr[O_{n-1}]}{6} \\ &= \frac{4 \Pr[E_{n-1}] + 1}{6}.\end{align*}$$  This establishes a recursion relationship with $a_n = \Pr[E_n]$, namely $$a_n = \frac{2}{3} a_{n-1} + \frac{1}{6}, \quad a_1 = \frac{5}{6},$$ since in $n = 1$ roll, the chance of an even number of sixes is equal to the chance that no six is rolled.  Now consider a constant $c$ so that $$a_n - c = \frac{2}{3}(a_{n-1} - c).$$  If this equation is to be equivalent to the desired recursion, we must have $$c - \frac{2}{3}c = \frac{1}{6},$$ or $c = 1/2$.  Therefore, letting $b_n = a_n - 1/2$, we obtain the auxiliary recursion $$b_n = \frac{2}{3} b_{n-1}, \quad b_1 = \frac{1}{3},$$ which has the obvious geometric sequence solution $$b_n = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n-1} b_1 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{n-1} \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2^{n-1}}{3^n}.$$  Consequently, $$\Pr[E_n] = a_n = b_n + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2^{n-1}}{3^n} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n\right),$$ as claimed.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 10 '16 at 4:26       heropup   57.2k 6 55 91              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

As juod's answer points out, the event $A\cap B$ has only $4$ outcomes in it, not $6$ as the student contends and the OP concurs.  Are they possibly thinking of the set
$A\cap B$ as being

The probability of throwing an 8 has an event space of (2,6),(3,5),(4,4),(5,3),(6,2) ; so the probability of throwing an 8 is 5/36. (The number of things in the event space divided by the size of the sample space.)  The probability of (even first die) or (8) is the sum of the probabilities less the number of items in the intersection.  Thus the probability is 1/2+5/36-3/36=20/36=5/9  (2) The probability of the first card being an ace is 4/52 or 1/13. The probability of the second card being an ace (assuming the first is an ace) is 3/51 or 1/17. (There are 3 aces left, and 51 cards to choose from.) So the probability that there are two aces is 1/13*1/17=1/221  The probability that the first card is black is 1/2. The probability that the second card is black (assuming the first card is black) is 25/51. So the probability that both cards are black is 1/2*25/51=25/102.  The probability of (2 aces) or (2 black cards) is the sum of the probabilities minus the intersection. Thus the probability is 1/221+25/102-1/1326. (There are 12 ways to pull two aces, 2 of which are all black. Thus the probability that you have selected 2 black aces is 2/2652=1/1326; there are a total of 52*51=2652 different 2 card selections.)  So the probability is 1/221+25/102-1/1326=55/221      list Cite  link Link                         Access hundreds of thousands of answers with a free trial.

Probability    Learning Objective(s)  ·  Define event, outcome, trial, simple event, sample space and calculate the probability that an event will occur.  ·  Calculate the probability of events for more complex outcomes.  ·  Solve applications involving probabilities.     Introduction     Probability provides a measure of how likely it is that something will occur. It is a number between and including the numbers 0 and 1. It can be written as a fraction, a decimal, or a percent.       Picking numbers randomly means that there is no specific order in which they are chosen.  Many games use dice or spinners to generate numbers randomly. If you understand how to calculate probabilities, you can make thoughtful decisions about how to play these games by knowing the likelihood of various outcomes.     Definitions     First you need to know some terms related to probability. When working with probability, a random action or series of actions is called a trial . An outcome is the result of a trial, and an event is a particular collection of outcomes. Events are usually described using a common characteristic of the outcomes.    Let's apply this language to see how the terms work in practice. Some games require rolling a die with six sides, numbered from 1 to 6. (Dice is the plural of die.) The chart below illustrates the use of trial, outcome, and event for such a game:        Trial    Outcomes    Examples of Events      Rolling a die    There are 6 possible outcomes:  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}    Rolling an even number: {2, 4, 6}  Rolling a 3: {3}  Rolling a 1 or a 3: {1, 3}  Rolling a 1 and a 3: { } (Only one number can be rolled, so this outcome is impossible. The event has no outcomes in it.)        Notice that a collection of outcomes is put in braces and separated by commas.    A simple event is an event with only one outcome. Rolling a 1 would be a simple event, because there is only one outcome that works—1! Rolling more than a 5 would also be a simple event, because the event includes only 6 as a valid outcome. A compound event is an event with more than one outcome. For example, in rolling one six-sided die, rolling an even number could occur with one of three outcomes: 2, 4, and 6.    When you roll a six-sided die many times, you should not expect any outcome to happen more often than another (assuming that it is a fair die). The outcomes in a situation like this are said to be equally likely . It’s very important to recognize when outcomes are equally likely when calculating probability. Since each outcome in the die-rolling trial is equally likely, you would expect to get each outcome of the rolls. That is, you'd expect of the rolls to be 1, of the rolls to be 2, of the rolls to be 3, and so on.         A spinner is divided into four equal parts, each colored with a different color as shown below. When this spinner is spun, the arrow points to one of the colors. Are the outcomes equally likely?       A) Yes, they are equally likely.  B) No, they are not equally likely.    Show/Hide Answer  All the outcomes are equally likely. Each color provides a different outcome, and each color takes up of the circle. You would expect the arrow to point to each color of the time.    Probability of Events   The probability of an event is how often it is expected to occur. It is the ratio of the size of the event space to the size of the sample space .  First, you need to determine the size of the sample space. The size of the sample space is the total number of possible outcomes. For example, when you roll 1 die, the sample space is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So the size of the sample space is 6.  Then you need to determine the size of the event space. The event space is the number of outcomes in the event you are interested in. The event space for rolling a number less than three is 1 or 2. So the size of the event space is 2.  For equally likely outcomes, the probability of an event E can be written P(E).               Example      Problem    A game requires rolling a six-sided die numbered from 1 to 6. What is the probability of rolling an even number?            Sample space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}    Event space = {2, 4, 6}    First, find the sample space and the event space. The sample space is all the possible outcomes, and the event space is the outcomes in the event. In this case, the event is “rolling an even number.”                 Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.      Answer    P (even number) =            It is a common practice with probabilities, as with fractions in general, to simplify a probability into lowest terms since that makes it easier for most people to get a sense of how great it is. Unless there is reason not to do so, express all final probabilities in lowest terms.      A spinner is divided into equal parts, each colored with a different color as shown below. Find the probability of spinning blue or green on this spinner:         A)    B)    C) 2    D) 6    Show/Hide Answer  A)  Incorrect. There are 6 equally likely outcomes, so the probability of each outcome is . However, the event has two outcomes in it, {blue, green}. The probability is . The correct answer is .    B)  Correct. There are 6 equally likely outcomes, and the event has two outcomes in it, {blue, green}. The probability is .    C) 2  Incorrect. The highest number that a probability value can be is 1! There are 2 outcomes in the event space, but the probability of the event is the ratio of outcomes in the event space to the total number of equally likely outcomes. There are 6 equally likely outcomes, so the probability is .    D) 6  Incorrect. The highest number that a probability value can be is 1! There are 6 equally likely outcomes in the sample space, but the probability of the event is the ratio of outcomes in the event space to the total number of equally likely outcomes. The probability is .    Counting Methods to find Sample Spaces   The most difficult thing for calculating a probability can be finding the size of the sample space, especially if there are two or more trials. There are several counting methods that can help.  The first one to look at is making a chart. In the example below, Tori is flipping two coins. So you need to determine the sample space carefully. A chart such as the one shown in the example that follows is a good approach.       Example      Problem    Tori is flipping a pair of coins and noting how many flips of “heads” she gets. What is the probability that she flips 2 heads? What is the probability that she flips only 1 head?                        Outcomes:       First coin    Second coin    outcome      H    H    HH      H    T    HT      T    H    TH      T    T    TT       sample space: {HH, HT, TH, TT}    event space for 2 heads: {HH}  event space for 1 head: {HT, TH}      Create a chart to record the results of flipping the first coin, followed by the result of flipping the second coin.                 Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.      Answer              In the example below, the sample space for Tori is simple as only one die is being rolled. However, since James is rolling two die, a chart helps to organize the information.       Example      Problem    Tori rolled a six-sided die and wanted to get a result of either 1 or 4. James rolled two six-sided dice, one blue and one red, and wanted to get a result of both a 1 and a 3, at the same time. Which event has a greater probability?          Tori's sample space: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}    Tori's event space: {1, 4}        Tori:        First, find the sample space and the event space for the two trials. For Tori's trial, this is straightforward.    Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.                         Red die              1    2    3    4    5    6      Blue die    1    1, 1    1, 2    1, 3    1, 4    1, 5    1, 6      2    2, 1    2, 2    2, 3    2, 4    2, 5    2, 6      3    3, 1    3, 2    3, 3    3, 4    3, 5    3, 6      4    4, 1    4, 2    4, 3    4, 4    4, 5    4, 6      5    5, 1    5, 2    5, 3    5, 4    5, 5    5, 6      6    6, 1    6, 2    6, 3    6, 4    6, 5    6, 6       James' sample space has 36 outcomes.  James' event space has 2 outcomes.    It's not so obvious for James’ trial, since he is rolling two dice. Use a chart to find the possibilities.    There are 36 outcomes. Of these, there are 2 that have both 1 and 3.            James:    Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.      Answer    Tori's event has a greater probability.          You can also use a tree diagram to determine the sample space. A tree diagram has a branch for every possible outcome for each event.  Suppose a closet has three pairs of pants (black, white, and green), four shirts (green, white, purple, and yellow), and two pairs of shoes (black and white). How many different outfits can be made? There are 3 choices for pants, 4 choices for shirts, and 2 choices for shoes. For our tree diagram, let's use B for black, W for white, G for green, P for purple, and Y for yellow.    You can see from the tree diagram that there are 24 possible outfits (some perhaps not great choices) in the sample space.  Now you could fairly easily solve some probability problems. For example, what is the probability that if you close your eyes and choose randomly you would choose pants and shoes with the same color? You can see that there are 8 outfits where the pants and the shoes match.   As you've seen, when a trial involves more than one random element, such as flipping more than one coin or rolling more than one die, you don't always need to identify every outcome in the sample space to calculate a probability. You only need the number of outcomes.  The Fundamental Counting Principle is a way to find the number of outcomes without listing and counting every one of them.     The Fundamental Counting Principle    If one event has p possible outcomes, and another event has m possible outcomes, then there are a total of p  •  m possible outcomes for the two events.    Examples  ·  Rolling two six-sided dice: Each die has 6 equally likely outcomes, so the sample space is 6 • 6 or 36 equally likely outcomes.  ·  Flipping three coins: Each coin has 2 equally likely outcomes, so the sample space is 2 • 2 • 2 or 8 equally likely outcomes.  ·  Rolling a six-sided die and flipping a coin: The sample space is 6 • 2 or 12 equally likely outcomes.     So you could use the Fundamental Counting Principle to find out how many outfits there are in the previous example. There are 3 choices for pants, 4 choices for shirts, and 2 choices for shoes. Using The Fundamental Counting Principle, you have 4 • 3 • 2 = 24 different outfits.       Example      Problem    Barry volunteers at a charity walk to make lunches for all the other volunteers. In each bag he puts:  ·  one of two sandwiches (peanut butter and jelly, or turkey and cheese),  ·  one of three chips (regular potato chips, baked potato chips, or corn chips),  ·  one piece of fruit (an apple or an orange).  He forgot to mark what was in the bags. Assuming that each choice is equally likely, what is the probability that the bag Therese gets holds a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and an apple?            Size of sample space:    (number of sandwich choices) • (number of chip choices) • (number of fruit choices) = 2 • 3 • 2 = 12        First, use the Fundamental Counting Principle to find the size of the sample space.          Size of event space:    (number of sandwich choices in event) • (number of chip choices in event) • (number of fruit choices in event) = 1 • 3 • 1 = 3    For the event space, follow the same principle. In this case, there is only one sandwich and one piece of fruit of interest, but any of the three types of chips are acceptable.      Answer       Use the ratio to find the probability.          Carrie flips four coins and counts the number of tails. There are four ways to get exactly one tail: HHHT, HHTH, HTHH, and THHH. What is the probability that Carrie gets exactly one tail?      A)    B)     C)    D)    Show/Hide Answer  A)  Incorrect. Since there are two outcomes for each coin, there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). However, there are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    B)  Incorrect. Since there are two outcomes for each coin, there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). There are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    C)  Correct. Since there are two outcomes for each coin, there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). There are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    D)  Incorrect. There are two outcomes for each coin, but there are 4 coins. That means there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). There are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    Summary   Probability helps you understand random, unpredictable situations where multiple outcomes are possible. It is a measure of the likelihood of an event, and it depends on the ratio of event and possible outcomes, if all those outcomes are equally likely.   The Fundamental Counting Principle is a shortcut to finding the size of the sample space when there are many trials and outcomes:  If one event has p possible outcomes, and another event has m possible outcomes, then there are a total of p  • m possible outcomes for the two events.
