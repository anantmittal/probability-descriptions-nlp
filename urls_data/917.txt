The Patriots are 7.5-point favorites in the NFL playoffs , down one from the opener. The line had moved as high as 9.5 before concerns over QB Tom Brady's hand send it diving. Brady returned to practice Friday, but may wear a glove on his throwing hand against the Jaguars. The Over-Under, or total number of points Vegas thinks will be scored, is 46, down from an open of 47. Before you lock in any picks for Jaguars-Patriots, you need to see what Galin Dragiev has to say. Last week, Dragiev told SportsLine readers to back New England -13.5 over Tennessee, saying that the game would "get ugly quickly." Sure enough, the Patriots built a 21-7 halftime lead en route to a 21-point demolition. Strikingly, that improved Dragiev to 16-4 in his past 20 NFL picks , a stunning 80 percent cash rate. Anyone who has followed his advice is up big.    Part of his success: Dragiev, a daily fantasy sports specialist, learned early on to predict the outcome of the game before determining how success trickles down to individual players, so he spent more time studying team outcomes than projecting individual players. When it comes to predictions, he trusts numbers above all else. Now, he has examined every angle, every matchup and every trend in Jaguars vs. Patriots and locked in his pick. You can only see it over at SportsLine. Dragiev knows Brady's injured hand has thrown a wrinkle into the Patriots-Jaguars betting line. It required multiple stitches and the 13-time Pro Bowler missed practiced on Thursday before returning on Friday. He's officially listed as questionable and could wear a glove on his throwing hand to protect the stitches, which he's not used to doing. On Saturday, Jeff Howe of the Boston Herald Tweeted that Brady's outlook was trending up: "After thorough treatment for a few days, Tom Brady's hand is expected to be just fine tomorrow against the Jaguars, according to those around him."    And CBS Sports' Jason La Canfora added, "Tom Brady is still Tom Brady. Believe that. He's good to go. We'll all see as much tomorrow." Dragiev also knows the Jaguars rely on defense and running the ball, both of which could help them stay within the spread. The Jags were tops in the league in rushing yards at 141.4 per game, seven more than the closest team. In the postseason, their 159.5 rushing average is over 25 more than anyone else. Jaguars RB Leonard Fournette , despite missing a portion of last week's game with an ankle injury, piled up 109 yards rushing and three touchdowns against the Steelers . He's topped 100 yards from scrimmage three of the last five weeks and scored five times during that span.    SportsLine's advanced projection model says that Fournette will once again top 100 yards rushing on Sunday against New England and find the end zone. Defensively, the Jaguars were second in scoring defense (16.8 points per game) and No. 1 against the pass (169.9 yards per game). But just because the Jaguars can run the ball and play tough defense doesn't mean they'll keep it close against Brady's Pats in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Even if the Patriots are stymied through the air due to Jacksonville's defense or Brady's ailment, they've been able to run effectively. Dion Lewis had 141 yards from scrimmage against the Titans , 133 against the Jets in Week 17, and 153 against the Bills in Week 16. He had 20 catches over that span.    The Patriots will also get running back Rex Burkhead (knee) back from injury. Burkhead has six touchdowns in his past four games and gives New England another versatile player out of the backfield in the AFC title game. He has been sidelined since Dec. 17 and practiced on a limited basis all week. It's no surprise that Dragiev is leaning Under, but he knows there's a critical x-factor that determines which side of Jaguars-Patriots you need to be all over. He's only sharing his strong pick over at SportsLine. So what side of Jaguars vs. Patriots do you need to jump on in the AFC Championship Game? Visit SportsLine now to see what critical x-factor determines which side of the Jaguars-Patriots spread prevails, all from an expert on a 16-4 run in NFL picks , and find out.

The New England Patriots and Jacksonville Jaguars will vie for a spot in the Super Bowl after successfully navigating through the Divisional Round this weekend. This game has the potential to be a truly epic one, pitting a battle-tested, veteran-laden New England squad against an upstart Jacksonville club that hadn’t made the postseason in a decade but is coming off back-to-back wins in the 2018 NFL Playoffs.  Oddsmakers are expecting the Patriots—competing in their record seventh-straight AFC Championship Game—to advance to the Super Bowl for the third time in four years, opening betting with them as an 8.5-point favorite (update: the line is now NE -9). It’s not a surprise considering New England’s mastery over this opponent throughout history and its convincing victory over the Tennessee Titans on Saturday. Here’s a closer look at the upcoming contest, including the schedule, start time, opening odds, TV info and more:  2018 NFL Championship Game Odds and Viewing Guide    Odds updated 1/19 at 11 a.m. ET      Time (ET)  Matchup (TV)  Seeding  Odds  Total    Sunday, Jan. 21    3:05 p.m.  Jacksonville Jaguars at New England Patriots (CBS)  AFC No. 3 at AFC No. 1  NE -7  46    6:40 p.m.  Minnesota Vikings at Philadelphia Eagles (FOX)  NFC No. 2 at NFC No. 1  MIN -3  39.5      NFL Odds via BetDSI.eu Sportsbook  Jacksonville has overcome longer odds this season and had no problem taking care of business on Sunday when it upset the Pittsburgh Steelers as a seven-point underdog. The Jags had a unique advantage going into that matchup, having already beaten the Steelers at Heinz Field back in October. ESPN Stats & Info noted that Jacksonville is now 5-1 in Pittsburgh since 2004 :    The Jaguars are now 5-1 at Heinz Field since the Steelers drafted Ben Roethlisberger in 2004, including the postseason. pic.twitter.com/ify48t8aJx  — ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) January 14, 2018   The Jaguars have not had nearly as much success against the Patriots, winning just one of 11 total games against them since coming into the league as an expansion franchise in 1995. Jacksonville’s only win against New England came all the way back in a 1999 AFC Wild Card, which was prior to Bill Belichick and Tom Brady’s arrival. Since those two began a dynasty in 2001, the Jags have lost all seven games against this opponent, a stretch that includes two postseason showdowns and an embarrassing 51-17 blowout in their last outing in 2015.    The Jaguars will again find it tough to eliminate a determined, well-coached New England team that features 41 players that participated in a combined 317 playoff games prior to this postseason, which is 30 more players and 275 more games than Jacksonville’s roster could claim. The Jaguars haven’t let that lack of playoff experience slow them down yet, however, and are now amongst the final four organizations left competing for a Super Bowl LII title.  Will the Patriots live up to expectation as chalk in the AFC Championship, or will the Jags pull off another upset on the way to an improbable Super Bowl appearance? Betting expert Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com has an early take on the matter, but first check out some of the early Twitter reactions to this improbable matchup:    2018 AFC Championship Game Twitter Reactions:  Todd Furhman pointed out the preseason odds to win the conference for each AFC Championship:   Before the season started here's a look at odds to win the AFC via @LVSuperBook  @Patriots 5-4 @Jaguars 50-1  — Todd Fuhrman (@ToddFuhrman) January 14, 2018   ESPN Stats & Info noted that the Jags scored as many points against the Steelers in the Divisional Round than as any opponent has in Pittsburgh’s storied postseason history:   The 45 points scored by the Jaguars are tied for the most allowed by the Steelers in a single postseason game.  They allowed 45 to the Dolphins in the 1984 AFC Championship Game.  — ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) January 14, 2018   Elliot Harrison joked about the Patriots postseason opponents this year:   We all knew the Patriots road to the Super Bowl would go through the Titans and Jaguars.  — Elliot Harrison (@HarrisonNFL) January 14, 2018   Ben Volin said that Jacksonville has come a long way since holding joint practices with the Pats a few months ago:   Amazing to think that the Jaguars team that looked out-manned and out-classed in joint practices with the Patriots in August is the same dominant team we’re watching today.  — Ben Volin (@BenVolin) January 14, 2018   Chuck Garfien believes that the entire country will be rooting for the Jags if they make the Super Bowl:   If Jaguars can beat Steelers in Pittsburgh, then Patriots in New England, taking down Roethlisberger and Brady they’ll hold a parade for them in every American city—but Pittsburgh and Boston.  — Chuck Garfien (@ChuckGarfien) January 14, 2018   Early Expert Prediction    Price's Pick: “It’s incredible that the Jaguars have made it all the way to the 2018 AFC Championship after missing out on the playoffs for 10 straight years. Counting the postseason, Jacksonville has now won 12 games this season, which is more than they won in the previous three seasons combined (11). They’ll now face their toughest test of the year in a Patriots team that won 13 regular season games and absolutely dismantled the Titans on Saturday night.  After a slow start, New England got into a rhythm and looked absolutely unstoppable. Brady led the offense to 35 points and silenced detractors claiming his decline had begun after an inconsistent December. The future Hall of Famer set the all-time record for most three-plus touchdown postseason games, but the only accolade Brady is seeking is to extend his record-setting Super Bowl wins number to six. It’s not going to be easy, especially against a world-class Jaguars defense that can get pressure practically every time he drops back.  Jacksonville allowed the Steelers to score 35 points—over 18 more points than they conceded on average this season—but forced a fumble that was returned for a key touchdown and also came up with a big interception. The pass-rushers officially only recorded two sacks, but hit Big Ben a number of times and regularly forced him into getting rid of the ball earlier than he would have liked, punishing him when he didn’t hurry his release. As teams like the New York Giants and Denver Broncos have proven, this is basically the only way to beat New England this time of year.    The Jags are built to win against teams like New England in the postseason, getting after the quarterback and chewing up clock with an efficient running game spearheaded by star rookie Leonard Fournette. I think their postseason inexperience will come back to bite them against a team they haven’t had the opportunity to face before in 2017. A big reason the Jags were so successful on Sunday was they had the confidence and knowledge that they could beat the Steelers at Heinz Field because they already accomplished it in Week 5. New England will throw plenty of looks at Jacksonville that it hasn’t seen before and the cold weather and crowd in Foxborough has rattled more experienced opponents than this.  I think this one will be close, giving Pats fans a scare and cashing tickets for Jags backers who took the points, but this isn’t the year that Jacksonville is ready to make the Super Bowl. The team still has a lot to improve on and should be a regularly fixture in the postseason as long as Tom Coughlin and Doug Marrone are running the show for the organization, but their magical run comes to an end in New England next week.

Maddie Meyer/Getty Images      The 2018 NFL Playoffs continue on Sunday with the New England Patriots hosting the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game. This has all the potential in the world to be a great battle, pitting a dynasty against an upstart team. The offensive powerhouse Patriots are led by a future Hall of Famer under center and have been the league's most successful organization for the better part of two decades, while the Jaguars unexpected success is a product of a world-class defense and running game.  It’s New England’s seventh consecutive foray into the AFC Championship—and no one is surprised the team is back this year—while Jacksonville is competing in its third conference title game in franchise history and the first since 1999. Not many expected the Jags to make it anywhere close to as far as they have this year, as their preseason expectations for total wins was set at 6.5 and their odds to make the postseason were longer than 3-to-1.  The Jags have been a great story, but oddsmakers aren’t giving them much of a chance to continue it in Super Bowl LII. They opened as an eight-point underdog after shocking the Pittsburgh Steelers, 45-42, last week and haven’t strayed from that number thanks to major public support for the Pats. New England is tough to bet against, especially after a thorough beating like the 35-14 one it put on the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round.    Will the Pats continue steamrolling their way to a third Super Bowl appearance in four years, or will a feisty Jaguars team that has toppled a number of elite foes in 2017 finally stop them? Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com has been analyzing this matchup all week long and has a lean on the game that you won’t want to miss.

Jacksonville Jaguars    One of the biggest stories leading up to this game is an injury to New England quarterback Tom Brady. The 40-year-old reportedly jammed his throwing hand during practice on Wednesday according to Karen Guregian :   Tom Brady jammed his throwing hand at practice after accidentally being run into, according to a source. X-rays showed no structural damage.  — Karen Guregian (@kguregian) January 17, 2018   [Update: Brady is active and will start in the 2018 AFC Championship Game]  Brady has never missed a single start during his 15 postseason trips and it’s near impossible that this will keep him from playing against the Jags. The future Hall of Famer spent time with the organization’s medical staff instead of meeting with reporters earlier in the week, but this doesn’t seem to be anyway concerning for the club. Ian Rapoport found two sources close to the situation that claimed Brady would be good to go on Sunday:   #Patriots QB Tom Brady’s right hand “should be OK,” per someone close to him. Another source said simply, “He will play” after his hand was on the injury report.  — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 18, 2018         Page 1 / 4  Continue           Share to email      Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin      Share to google           Print    Website Feedback    News Tip    Report Corrections    Reprints & Permissions                    NBA NFL World Football CBB NHL MLB CFB MMA WWE NASCAR Golf Tennis Boxing More Trending Mag Tickets Get The App WWE Sign Up Login NFL Playoffs Jacksonville Jaguars vs. New England Patriots: Odds, Analysis, NFL Betting Pick OddsShark.com @ @OddsShark Featured Columnist January 16, 2018  Comments Brett Carlsen/Getty Images The Jacksonville Jaguars hope to pull off a second straight road upset this postseason and get to their first-ever Super Bowl when they visit the New England Patriots in Sunday's AFC Championship Game  as big road underdogs at online betting sites . The Super Bowl champion Patriots are playing in their seventh consecutive conference title game and hosting their third in four years, going 3-3 in their previous six appearances dating back to the 2011 season.  NFL point spread: The Patriots opened as 9.5-point favorites; the total was 46 early in the week, according to sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark. ( Line updates and matchup report ) NFL betting pick, via OddsShark computer: 29.9-16.2 Patriots ( NFL picks on every game ) Check out the OddsShark podcast on iTunes or at OddsShark.libsyn.com for more odds info, picks and a breakdown of this week's top sports betting news.  Why the Jaguars can cover the spread Jacksonville may not have the postseason experience or quarterback play of New England, but this team has just about everything else needed to get to the Super Bowl. The Jaguars have arguably more defensive talent than any of the four teams left in the playoff field, including the Minnesota Vikings and Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC. They also have a strong running back in rookie Leonard Fournette, who rolled over the Pittsburgh Steelers with 290 rushing yards on 53 carries and five touchdowns in two wins this season, including last week's 45-42 victory in the divisional round.  Why the Patriots can cover the spread The Patriots have won each of the past seven meetings with Jacksonville straight up, going 5-2 against the spread in those games. They are also a remarkable 10-1 ATS on the NFL point spreads in their last 11 games overall and riding a seven-game home winning streak in the postseason. If those betting trends were not enough, they will have future Hall of Famer Tom Brady under center in one of the biggest positional mismatches in conference championship game history opposite Blake Bortles of the Jaguars. It is almost unthinkable to imagine Bortles possibly getting the best of Brady at Gillette Stadium with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line.  Smart pick Jacksonville matched up extremely well with Pittsburgh, which is why the team won both meetings fairly easily. That will not be the case with a New England squad led by two of the all-time greats in Brady and head coach Bill Belichick . The Patriots are easily the best team remaining of the four playing for two spots in the Super Bowl. The Jaguars have been a fun story, but they will be overmatched in this spot, so look for Brady and the Patriots to flex their muscles en route to another double-digit playoff win.  NFL betting trends The Jaguars are 0-7 SU and 2-5 ATS in their last seven games against the Patriots. The total has gone under in three of the Jaguars' last four games against the Patriots. The Patriots are 10-1 ATS in their last 11 games.  All NFL odds and betting trends courtesy of Bleacher Report's official odds partner, OddsShark.

Tom Brady and Bill Belichick have reached the final round of the AFC playoff bracket for the seventh consecutive season. Meanwhile, the Jaguars reached the postseason this year for the first time since 2007, and are in the AFC Championship Game for the first time since quarterback Mark Brunell led them to the game following the 1999 season. In terms of experience, there's no question who has the edge in this game. From a matchup perspective, however, this one could be closer than many fans expect. Here's a quick look at the TV info and betting odds, followed by a breakdown and prediction for the game.  Jacksonville Jaguars at New England Patriots Date and Time: Sunday, January 21, at 3:05 p.m. ET TV: CBS Odds: NE (-7.5), O/U 46.5 Betting info from Oddsshark.com  Can New England Stop Leonard Fournette? Phelan M. Ebenhack/Associated Press The ability to stop the running game in the NFL has become almost irrelevant in recent years, so much so that six of the eight teams allowing the highest rushing yards per attempt this season made the playoffs, including New England. However, the ability to stop the run can still be relevant in certain matchups. The Jaguars are one of the teams that still requires a good rushing defense against to defeat, mostly because stopping the run means forcing quarterback Blake Bortles to throw. Jacksonville is 1-4 when held to under 100 yards rushing and, including the postseason, is 11-2 when going over the century mark. Another way of looking at this stat is by breaking down Bortles' pass attempts. When Bortles is forced to throw 30 or more times, the Jaguars are just 5-6. When they're able to keep his attempts under 30, however, the Jags are 7-0, including wins in both postseason games this year. During the regular season, only the Chargers allowed more rushing yards per attempt than the Patriots defense. So if the Jaguars want to control this game on the ground and limit Bortles' impact, this is an ideal defense for them to be facing in the AFC Championship Game. Of course, if Jacksonville falls behind early this may not make a difference, but if the score is close, it's an area where the Jags hold a clear edge.  Can Jacksonville contain Rob Gronkowski ? Steven Senne/Associated Press As good as the Jaguars defense has been this season, expecting them to completely shut down Brady is unrealistic. The Patriots will find ways to move the ball, so the Jaguars have to settle for making it more difficult for them to do so. To accomplish this, the Jaguars should follow a classic Bill Belichick strategy by attempting to take away the Patriots' most dangerous weapon: Rob Gronkowski. Brady has plenty of targets to choose from, but there's no question his favorite is Gronk, and in clutch situations that's usually where Brady is trying to go with the football. Brady's performance in third-and-long situations proves that. If we define "long" as seven or more yards to go, Gronkowski accounted for 14 of the Patriots' 41 receptions in this situation (34.1 percent). No other Patriot receiver had more than six receptions in those situations. The Jaguars have, predictably, given no indication as to how they plan to stop Gronk. However, their talented secondary gives defensive coordinator Todd Walsh plenty of options from which to choose. Taking away Gronkowski won't guarantee the Jaguars a victory, but it is an important step toward making Brady more uncomfortable which will increase the odds of Jacksonville forcing him into mistakes.  Prediction It's hard to pick against Belichick and Brady on their home turf, but it's also hard to think of a more difficult matchup for them. The Jaguars have the defensive talent to take away what the Patriots do best on offense, and they have the power running game to attack the Patriots' biggest weakness on defense. Even though the Patriots are a more complete team, the Jaguars match up perfectly and have no reason to be intimidated.

Stew Milne/Associated Press The New England Patriots are trying to win their second consecutive Super Bowl and their third in the last four seasons. Head coach Bill Belichick 's team is going to have to beat the upstart Jacksonville Jaguars if they are going to make that happen. The Jaguars are coming off a huge upset of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Few expected them to get close to the Steelers, let alone win the game. However, they jumped out to a 28-7 lead, and they made enough plays down the stretch to emerge with a shock 45-42 victory. Jacksonville is a huge underdog as it prepares to go to Gillette Stadium at 3:05 p.m. ET Sunday to knock out the champions. The Patriots are listed as 9.5-point favorites, with the total listed at 46.5 points, according to OddsShark . The primary matchup in this game would appear to be New England's explosive offense versus Jacksonville's aggressive defense. Tom Brady has had another memorable season with 32 touchdown passes and eight interceptions. It's not just the Brady show, though, as Dion Lewis led the Patriots with 896 rushing yards and an average of 5.0 yards per carry and seven touchdowns. The running back also contributed 32 receptions. Tight end Rob Gronkowski is often a game-changing weapon, because he is so difficult for defenders to cover. He is too strong for defensive backs and too quick and athletic for linebackers. He caught 69 passes for 1,084 yards with eight touchdowns. Wide receiver Brandin Cooks is New England's best deep threat, while Danny Amendola can catch difficult passes over the middle. Chris Hogan is the do-it-all type who has battled injuries for much of the season, but he is healthy once again. While the Patriots have the No. 2 offensive team in the league, the Jaguars have the second-ranked defense in the league. The key to that defense is their ability to rush the passer, as Calais Campbell registered 14.5 sacks and Yannick Ngakoue registered 12.0 sacks. Calais Campbell has excelled at getting to the quarterback. Keith Srakocic/Associated Press Additionally, the duo of Jalen Ramsey and A.J. Bouye are two of the best cover cornerbacks in the league. They have combined for 10 interceptions and 35 passes defensed. Blake Bortles is a much-improved quarterback this year, but is he up to a high-level performance against New England? He threw for 3,687 yards with 21 TDs and 13 interceptions, and that's impressive, but he will have to play at an even higher level against the Patriots. The Patriots' defense is underrated and improved, as that unit has given up 17 points or less in 11 of their last 13 games. If Bortles is going to be successful here, he is going to need plenty of support from rookie running back Leonard Fournette, who ran for 1,040 yards and nine touchdowns during the regular season. He is coming off a three-TD performance against the Steelers. Fournette suffered a sprained ankle against Pittsburgh, and he was involved in a minor auto accident Tuesday, according to the Associated Press (h/t the Boston Globe ).  Predictions The Jaguars handled the underdog role against the Steelers, and they get another opportunity to do the same thing against the Patriots. However, they have to control Brady and exploit New England's defense. This is likely to be a high-scoring game, with both sides scoring at least three touchdowns. Look for the Patriots to easily exceed that and score five times. New England covers the spread, and both teams combine to go over the total.

Here are our picks and predictions for the AFC championship game.                   David Steele      @david_c_steele          Published on Jan. 21, 2018    Jan. 21, 2018           Watch NFL NFL with fuboTV    LIVE: Jaguars vs. Patriots score, updates  By now, what doesn't everybody know about the gulf between the Patriots’ postseason history and that of the Jaguars, their AFC championship game opponent? The answer, of course, is, nothing … but it can't be repeated enough.   If the Patriots move on to the eighth Super Bowl of the Bill Belichick-Tom Brady era (and their 10th ever), it would be a fully-expected validation of their dominance. If they don’t, it would assure that the magnitude of the Jaguars' achievement can never be diminished.  MORE: Stream Jags-Pats live and on-demand with fuboTV (7-day free trial)  That gulf is overwhelming, even compared to the one between the Jaguars and the team they buried to get here, the Steelers. Just limiting the Patriots' figures to the 18 years Belichick and Brady have been together while using the Jaguars' entire NFL existence, here’s the tally — Super Bowl wins: Patriots, 5-0. Super Bowl appearances: Patriots, 7-0. AFC title games: Patriots, 12-2 (including the last seven). Quarterback postseason starts: Brady 35, Blake Bortles 2. Coaching postseason games: Belichick 35, Doug Marrone 2.  On the other hand, the last time it was universally believed that the Patriots had no chance to win a playoff game was Super Bowl 36, at the beginning of the dynasty, against the Rams. The last time for the Jaguars was last week, when the Steelers looked past them like few teams in the history of any sport looked past the team in front of them.  MORE: Jaguars face a Patriots team that will be ready to punch back  That’s not the sole reason the Jaguars ran them off their home field, however, and the Patriots won't take them for granted in any form or fashion. The Jaguars are a physically and mentally tough bunch of players who are not intimidated by anyone. That part of their story will decide this game and determine who moves on to Minneapolis.  NFL playoff picks: Jaguars at Patriots (-9)    Date, time: Sunday, 3:05 p.m. ET   Location: Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Mass.   TV: CBS   Live streaming: FuboTV (7-day free trial)   Odds: Patriots -9; total: 48     David Steele : The Patriots are defending champs, but even in light of the speed in which rosters turn over year-to-year, there are some jarring differences in personnel since last season's run.  Yes, Brady, of course, but they’ve had Rob Gronkowski for all but one week this time, where they did not for the playoffs last year. No Julian Edelman, either, with Brandin Cooks added as a target, and the running back mix is different (again). Defensive coordinator Matt Patricia also has a different blend of players to juggle, too, with no Dont’a Hightower since November.  The Jaguars' defense deserves every accolade it has earned and every boast Jalen Ramsey exudes. But the Jaguars also let the Steelers’ weapons break off big plays to climb back into and stay in their game last week, so assuming that whatever they do to slow Gronkowski will work is premature at best.  MORE: Why Jaguars match up so well with Patriots  All of that said, however … the "secret" to beating Brady when he's been beaten has been the pass rush, and handling the Jaguars' front seven will be a mighty task. The Jaguars are second-best in the NFL in total defense, scoring defense, sacks and interceptions, and first in pass completion percentage and passer rating allowed.  A case can be made for the Jaguars to pull this off, if everything goes perfectly.  A better case can be made that the Patriots will never let that happen.   Pick : Patriots 26, Jaguars 19  NFC CHAMPIONSHIP: Vikings-Eagles picks, odds    Vinnie Iyer : The Jaguars are big underdogs, but they are more than capable of giving the Patriots a massive headache. This game is in Foxborough, but it has a similar feel to the 2015 AFC championship game two years ago in Denver.  The Patriots were stifled just enough against a loaded Broncos defense that could smash New England in the mouth by simply lining up elite talent at every position. Von Miller led the domination there. For the Jaguars, Calais Campbell is the main man.  The Jaguars have struggled only against mobile quarterbacks, and outside of Antonio Brown, no wide receiver has had success against shutdown corners Ramsey and A.J. Bouye flanking the ferocious, four-man pass rush.  MORE: 10 fast facts for Jaguars-Patriots  Jacksonville won't try to outsmart New England — it will simply rely on its talent to be faster and physical in all the matchups. Offensively, it comes to another clean game from Bortles, buoyed by more big-time running from Leonard Fournette.  The Jaguars are constructed in the image of the Tom Coughlin teams that got the better of Brady and Belichick twice in Super Bowls. Bortles is much maligned, but he's better than what Peyton Manning was for that Broncos team, and he's on par with how Eli Manning played for Coughlin's Giants.

Bill Bender       It takes immense defensive talent, a nasty rushing attack, fearlessness and an attitude to take down the Patriots at Gillette Stadium. These Jaguars are young and don't know any better to think the moment is too big for them. They'll get in Brady's face, thwart a less explosive overall offense than that of the Steelers and keep shocking everyone on their way to Super Bowl LII.

The Patriots are 7.5-point favorites in the NFL playoffs , down one from the opener. The line had moved as high as 9.5 before concerns over QB Tom Brady's hand send it diving. Brady returned to practice Friday, but may wear a glove on his throwing hand against the Jaguars. The Over-Under, or total number of points Vegas thinks will be scored, is 46, down from an open of 47. Before you lock in any picks for Jaguars-Patriots, you need to see what Galin Dragiev has to say. Last week, Dragiev told SportsLine readers to back New England -13.5 over Tennessee, saying that the game would "get ugly quickly." Sure enough, the Patriots built a 21-7 halftime lead en route to a 21-point demolition. Strikingly, that improved Dragiev to 16-4 in his past 20 NFL picks , a stunning 80 percent cash rate. Anyone who has followed his advice is up big.    Part of his success: Dragiev, a daily fantasy sports specialist, learned early on to predict the outcome of the game before determining how success trickles down to individual players, so he spent more time studying team outcomes than projecting individual players. When it comes to predictions, he trusts numbers above all else. Now, he has examined every angle, every matchup and every trend in Jaguars vs. Patriots and locked in his pick. You can only see it over at SportsLine. Dragiev knows Brady's injured hand has thrown a wrinkle into the Patriots-Jaguars betting line. It required multiple stitches and the 13-time Pro Bowler missed practiced on Thursday before returning on Friday. He's officially listed as questionable and could wear a glove on his throwing hand to protect the stitches, which he's not used to doing. On Saturday, Jeff Howe of the Boston Herald Tweeted that Brady's outlook was trending up: "After thorough treatment for a few days, Tom Brady's hand is expected to be just fine tomorrow against the Jaguars, according to those around him."    And CBS Sports' Jason La Canfora added, "Tom Brady is still Tom Brady. Believe that. He's good to go. We'll all see as much tomorrow." Dragiev also knows the Jaguars rely on defense and running the ball, both of which could help them stay within the spread. The Jags were tops in the league in rushing yards at 141.4 per game, seven more than the closest team. In the postseason, their 159.5 rushing average is over 25 more than anyone else. Jaguars RB Leonard Fournette , despite missing a portion of last week's game with an ankle injury, piled up 109 yards rushing and three touchdowns against the Steelers . He's topped 100 yards from scrimmage three of the last five weeks and scored five times during that span.    SportsLine's advanced projection model says that Fournette will once again top 100 yards rushing on Sunday against New England and find the end zone. Defensively, the Jaguars were second in scoring defense (16.8 points per game) and No. 1 against the pass (169.9 yards per game). But just because the Jaguars can run the ball and play tough defense doesn't mean they'll keep it close against Brady's Pats in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Even if the Patriots are stymied through the air due to Jacksonville's defense or Brady's ailment, they've been able to run effectively. Dion Lewis had 141 yards from scrimmage against the Titans , 133 against the Jets in Week 17, and 153 against the Bills in Week 16. He had 20 catches over that span.    The Patriots will also get running back Rex Burkhead (knee) back from injury. Burkhead has six touchdowns in his past four games and gives New England another versatile player out of the backfield in the AFC title game. He has been sidelined since Dec. 17 and practiced on a limited basis all week. It's no surprise that Dragiev is leaning Under, but he knows there's a critical x-factor that determines which side of Jaguars-Patriots you need to be all over. He's only sharing his strong pick over at SportsLine. So what side of Jaguars vs. Patriots do you need to jump on in the AFC Championship Game? Visit SportsLine now to see what critical x-factor determines which side of the Jaguars-Patriots spread prevails, all from an expert on a 16-4 run in NFL picks , and find out.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.                    Jim Rogash/Getty Images)      The 2018 AFC Championship Game matchup is finally set. The New England Patriots and Jacksonville Jaguars will vie for a spot in the Super Bowl after successfully navigating through the Divisional Round this weekend. This game has the potential to be a truly epic one, pitting a battle-tested, veteran-laden New England squad against an upstart Jacksonville club that hadn’t made the postseason in a decade but is coming off back-to-back wins in the 2018 NFL Playoffs.  Oddsmakers are expecting the Patriots—competing in their record seventh-straight AFC Championship Game—to advance to the Super Bowl for the third time in four years, opening betting with them as an 8.5-point favorite (update: the line is now NE -9). It’s not a surprise considering New England’s mastery over this opponent throughout history and its convincing victory over the Tennessee Titans on Saturday. Here’s a closer look at the upcoming contest, including the schedule, start time, opening odds, TV info and more:  2018 NFL Championship Game Odds and Viewing Guide    Odds updated 1/19 at 11 a.m. ET      Time (ET)  Matchup (TV)  Seeding  Odds  Total    Sunday, Jan. 21    3:05 p.m.  Jacksonville Jaguars at New England Patriots (CBS)  AFC No. 3 at AFC No. 1  NE -7  46    6:40 p.m.  Minnesota Vikings at Philadelphia Eagles (FOX)  NFC No. 2 at NFC No. 1  MIN -3  39.5      NFL Odds via BetDSI.eu Sportsbook  Jacksonville has overcome longer odds this season and had no problem taking care of business on Sunday when it upset the Pittsburgh Steelers as a seven-point underdog. The Jags had a unique advantage going into that matchup, having already beaten the Steelers at Heinz Field back in October. ESPN Stats & Info noted that Jacksonville is now 5-1 in Pittsburgh since 2004 :    The Jaguars are now 5-1 at Heinz Field since the Steelers drafted Ben Roethlisberger in 2004, including the postseason. pic.twitter.com/ify48t8aJx  — ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) January 14, 2018   The Jaguars have not had nearly as much success against the Patriots, winning just one of 11 total games against them since coming into the league as an expansion franchise in 1995. Jacksonville’s only win against New England came all the way back in a 1999 AFC Wild Card, which was prior to Bill Belichick and Tom Brady’s arrival. Since those two began a dynasty in 2001, the Jags have lost all seven games against this opponent, a stretch that includes two postseason showdowns and an embarrassing 51-17 blowout in their last outing in 2015.    The Jaguars will again find it tough to eliminate a determined, well-coached New England team that features 41 players that participated in a combined 317 playoff games prior to this postseason, which is 30 more players and 275 more games than Jacksonville’s roster could claim. The Jaguars haven’t let that lack of playoff experience slow them down yet, however, and are now amongst the final four organizations left competing for a Super Bowl LII title.  Will the Patriots live up to expectation as chalk in the AFC Championship, or will the Jags pull off another upset on the way to an improbable Super Bowl appearance? Betting expert Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com has an early take on the matter, but first check out some of the early Twitter reactions to this improbable matchup:        Page 1 / 3  Continue           Share to email      Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin      Share to google           Print    Website Feedback    News Tip    Report Corrections    Reprints & Permissions                                                share        Trending         SportsMoney  #GameDay            SportsMoney  #GameDay   Jan 20, 2018 @ 08:00 AM           2018 NFL Playoff Odds: New England Patriots Vs.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.                    Maddie Meyer/Getty Images      The 2018 NFL Playoffs continue on Sunday with the New England Patriots hosting the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game. This has all the potential in the world to be a great battle, pitting a dynasty against an upstart team. The offensive powerhouse Patriots are led by a future Hall of Famer under center and have been the league's most successful organization for the better part of two decades, while the Jaguars unexpected success is a product of a world-class defense and running game.  It’s New England’s seventh consecutive foray into the AFC Championship—and no one is surprised the team is back this year—while Jacksonville is competing in its third conference title game in franchise history and the first since 1999. Not many expected the Jags to make it anywhere close to as far as they have this year, as their preseason expectations for total wins was set at 6.5 and their odds to make the postseason were longer than 3-to-1.  The Jags have been a great story, but oddsmakers aren’t giving them much of a chance to continue it in Super Bowl LII. They opened as an eight-point underdog after shocking the Pittsburgh Steelers, 45-42, last week and haven’t strayed from that number thanks to major public support for the Pats. New England is tough to bet against, especially after a thorough beating like the 35-14 one it put on the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round.    Will the Pats continue steamrolling their way to a third Super Bowl appearance in four years, or will a feisty Jaguars team that has toppled a number of elite foes in 2017 finally stop them? Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com has been analyzing this matchup all week long and has a lean on the game that you won’t want to miss. Before checking out the Las Vegas pro’s prediction for the 2018 AFC Championship Game, take a look at the complete schedule, start times, TV info, updated odds and more for both conference championships in the 2018 NFL Playoffs:  2018 NFL Championship Game Odds and Viewing Guide   Odds updated 1/21 at 2 p.m. ET      Time (ET)  Matchup (TV)  Seeding  Odds  Total    Sunday, Jan. 21    3:05 p.m.  Jacksonville Jaguars at New England Patriots (CBS)  AFC No. 3 at AFC No. 1  NE -7.5  46    6:40 p.m.  Minnesota Vikings at Philadelphia Eagles (FOX)  NFC No. 2 at NFC No. 1  MIN -3  39      Super Bowl LII Odds      Team  Title Odds    New England Patriots  +100 (1-1)    Minnesota Vikings  +200 (2-1)    Philadelphia Eagles  +800 (8-1)    Jacksonville Jaguars  +900 (9-1)      NFL Odds via BetDSI.eu Sportsbook  2018 AFC Championship Preview: New England Patriots Vs. Jacksonville Jaguars    One of the biggest stories leading up to this game is an injury to New England quarterback Tom Brady. The 40-year-old reportedly jammed his throwing hand during practice on Wednesday according to Karen Guregian :   Tom Brady jammed his throwing hand at practice after accidentally being run into, according to a source. X-rays showed no structural damage.  — Karen Guregian (@kguregian) January 17, 2018   [Update: Brady is active and will start in the 2018 AFC Championship Game]  Brady has never missed a single start during his 15 postseason trips and it’s near impossible that this will keep him from playing against the Jags. The future Hall of Famer spent time with the organization’s medical staff instead of meeting with reporters earlier in the week, but this doesn’t seem to be anyway concerning for the club. Ian Rapoport found two sources close to the situation that claimed Brady would be good to go on Sunday:   #Patriots QB Tom Brady’s right hand “should be OK,” per someone close to him. Another source said simply, “He will play” after his hand was on the injury report.  — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 18, 2018         Page 1 / 4  Continue           Share to email      Share to facebook      Share to twitter      Share to linkedin      Share to google           Print    Website Feedback    News Tip    Report Corrections    Reprints & Permissions                    NBA NFL World Football CBB NHL MLB CFB MMA WWE NASCAR Golf Tennis Boxing More Trending Mag Tickets Get The App WWE Sign Up Login NFL Playoffs Jacksonville Jaguars vs. New England Patriots: Odds, Analysis, NFL Betting Pick OddsShark.com @ @OddsShark Featured Columnist January 16, 2018  Comments Brett Carlsen/Getty Images The Jacksonville Jaguars hope to pull off a second straight road upset this postseason and get to their first-ever Super Bowl when they visit the New England Patriots in Sunday's AFC Championship Game  as big road underdogs at online betting sites . The Super Bowl champion Patriots are playing in their seventh consecutive conference title game and hosting their third in four years, going 3-3 in their previous six appearances dating back to the 2011 season.  NFL point spread: The Patriots opened as 9.5-point favorites; the total was 46 early in the week, according to sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark. ( Line updates and matchup report ) NFL betting pick, via OddsShark computer: 29.9-16.2 Patriots ( NFL picks on every game ) Check out the OddsShark podcast on iTunes or at OddsShark.libsyn.com for more odds info, picks and a breakdown of this week's top sports betting news.  Why the Jaguars can cover the spread Jacksonville may not have the postseason experience or quarterback play of New England, but this team has just about everything else needed to get to the Super Bowl. The Jaguars have arguably more defensive talent than any of the four teams left in the playoff field, including the Minnesota Vikings and Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC. They also have a strong running back in rookie Leonard Fournette, who rolled over the Pittsburgh Steelers with 290 rushing yards on 53 carries and five touchdowns in two wins this season, including last week's 45-42 victory in the divisional round.  Why the Patriots can cover the spread The Patriots have won each of the past seven meetings with Jacksonville straight up, going 5-2 against the spread in those games. They are also a remarkable 10-1 ATS on the NFL point spreads in their last 11 games overall and riding a seven-game home winning streak in the postseason. If those betting trends were not enough, they will have future Hall of Famer Tom Brady under center in one of the biggest positional mismatches in conference championship game history opposite Blake Bortles of the Jaguars. It is almost unthinkable to imagine Bortles possibly getting the best of Brady at Gillette Stadium with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line.  Smart pick Jacksonville matched up extremely well with Pittsburgh, which is why the team won both meetings fairly easily. That will not be the case with a New England squad led by two of the all-time greats in Brady and head coach Bill Belichick . The Patriots are easily the best team remaining of the four playing for two spots in the Super Bowl. The Jaguars have been a fun story, but they will be overmatched in this spot, so look for Brady and the Patriots to flex their muscles en route to another double-digit playoff win.  NFL betting trends The Jaguars are 0-7 SU and 2-5 ATS in their last seven games against the Patriots. The total has gone under in three of the Jaguars' last four games against the Patriots. The Patriots are 10-1 ATS in their last 11 games.  All NFL odds and betting trends courtesy of Bleacher Report's official odds partner, OddsShark.

Tom Brady and Bill Belichick have reached the final round of the AFC playoff bracket for the seventh consecutive season. Meanwhile, the Jaguars reached the postseason this year for the first time since 2007, and are in the AFC Championship Game for the first time since quarterback Mark Brunell led them to the game following the 1999 season. In terms of experience, there's no question who has the edge in this game. From a matchup perspective, however, this one could be closer than many fans expect. Here's a quick look at the TV info and betting odds, followed by a breakdown and prediction for the game.  Jacksonville Jaguars at New England Patriots Date and Time: Sunday, January 21, at 3:05 p.m. ET TV: CBS Odds: NE (-7.5), O/U 46.5 Betting info from Oddsshark.com  Can New England Stop Leonard Fournette? Phelan M. Ebenhack/Associated Press The ability to stop the running game in the NFL has become almost irrelevant in recent years, so much so that six of the eight teams allowing the highest rushing yards per attempt this season made the playoffs, including New England. However, the ability to stop the run can still be relevant in certain matchups. The Jaguars are one of the teams that still requires a good rushing defense against to defeat, mostly because stopping the run means forcing quarterback Blake Bortles to throw. Jacksonville is 1-4 when held to under 100 yards rushing and, including the postseason, is 11-2 when going over the century mark. Another way of looking at this stat is by breaking down Bortles' pass attempts. When Bortles is forced to throw 30 or more times, the Jaguars are just 5-6. When they're able to keep his attempts under 30, however, the Jags are 7-0, including wins in both postseason games this year. During the regular season, only the Chargers allowed more rushing yards per attempt than the Patriots defense. So if the Jaguars want to control this game on the ground and limit Bortles' impact, this is an ideal defense for them to be facing in the AFC Championship Game. Of course, if Jacksonville falls behind early this may not make a difference, but if the score is close, it's an area where the Jags hold a clear edge.  Can Jacksonville contain Rob Gronkowski ? Steven Senne/Associated Press As good as the Jaguars defense has been this season, expecting them to completely shut down Brady is unrealistic. The Patriots will find ways to move the ball, so the Jaguars have to settle for making it more difficult for them to do so. To accomplish this, the Jaguars should follow a classic Bill Belichick strategy by attempting to take away the Patriots' most dangerous weapon: Rob Gronkowski. Brady has plenty of targets to choose from, but there's no question his favorite is Gronk, and in clutch situations that's usually where Brady is trying to go with the football. Brady's performance in third-and-long situations proves that. If we define "long" as seven or more yards to go, Gronkowski accounted for 14 of the Patriots' 41 receptions in this situation (34.1 percent). No other Patriot receiver had more than six receptions in those situations. The Jaguars have, predictably, given no indication as to how they plan to stop Gronk. However, their talented secondary gives defensive coordinator Todd Walsh plenty of options from which to choose. Taking away Gronkowski won't guarantee the Jaguars a victory, but it is an important step toward making Brady more uncomfortable which will increase the odds of Jacksonville forcing him into mistakes.  Prediction It's hard to pick against Belichick and Brady on their home turf, but it's also hard to think of a more difficult matchup for them. The Jaguars have the defensive talent to take away what the Patriots do best on offense, and they have the power running game to attack the Patriots' biggest weakness on defense. Even though the Patriots are a more complete team, the Jaguars match up perfectly and have no reason to be intimidated.

Stew Milne/Associated Press The New England Patriots are trying to win their second consecutive Super Bowl and their third in the last four seasons. Head coach Bill Belichick 's team is going to have to beat the upstart Jacksonville Jaguars if they are going to make that happen. The Jaguars are coming off a huge upset of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Few expected them to get close to the Steelers, let alone win the game. However, they jumped out to a 28-7 lead, and they made enough plays down the stretch to emerge with a shock 45-42 victory. Jacksonville is a huge underdog as it prepares to go to Gillette Stadium at 3:05 p.m. ET Sunday to knock out the champions. The Patriots are listed as 9.5-point favorites, with the total listed at 46.5 points, according to OddsShark . The primary matchup in this game would appear to be New England's explosive offense versus Jacksonville's aggressive defense. Tom Brady has had another memorable season with 32 touchdown passes and eight interceptions. It's not just the Brady show, though, as Dion Lewis led the Patriots with 896 rushing yards and an average of 5.0 yards per carry and seven touchdowns. The running back also contributed 32 receptions. Tight end Rob Gronkowski is often a game-changing weapon, because he is so difficult for defenders to cover. He is too strong for defensive backs and too quick and athletic for linebackers. He caught 69 passes for 1,084 yards with eight touchdowns. Wide receiver Brandin Cooks is New England's best deep threat, while Danny Amendola can catch difficult passes over the middle. Chris Hogan is the do-it-all type who has battled injuries for much of the season, but he is healthy once again. While the Patriots have the No. 2 offensive team in the league, the Jaguars have the second-ranked defense in the league. The key to that defense is their ability to rush the passer, as Calais Campbell registered 14.5 sacks and Yannick Ngakoue registered 12.0 sacks. Calais Campbell has excelled at getting to the quarterback. Keith Srakocic/Associated Press Additionally, the duo of Jalen Ramsey and A.J. Bouye are two of the best cover cornerbacks in the league. They have combined for 10 interceptions and 35 passes defensed. Blake Bortles is a much-improved quarterback this year, but is he up to a high-level performance against New England? He threw for 3,687 yards with 21 TDs and 13 interceptions, and that's impressive, but he will have to play at an even higher level against the Patriots. The Patriots' defense is underrated and improved, as that unit has given up 17 points or less in 11 of their last 13 games. If Bortles is going to be successful here, he is going to need plenty of support from rookie running back Leonard Fournette, who ran for 1,040 yards and nine touchdowns during the regular season. He is coming off a three-TD performance against the Steelers. Fournette suffered a sprained ankle against Pittsburgh, and he was involved in a minor auto accident Tuesday, according to the Associated Press (h/t the Boston Globe ).  Predictions The Jaguars handled the underdog role against the Steelers, and they get another opportunity to do the same thing against the Patriots. However, they have to control Brady and exploit New England's defense. This is likely to be a high-scoring game, with both sides scoring at least three touchdowns. Look for the Patriots to easily exceed that and score five times. New England covers the spread, and both teams combine to go over the total.

Here are our picks and predictions for the AFC championship game.                   David Steele      @david_c_steele          Published on Jan. 21, 2018    Jan. 21, 2018           Watch NFL NFL with fuboTV    LIVE: Jaguars vs. Patriots score, updates  By now, what doesn't everybody know about the gulf between the Patriots’ postseason history and that of the Jaguars, their AFC championship game opponent? The answer, of course, is, nothing … but it can't be repeated enough.   If the Patriots move on to the eighth Super Bowl of the Bill Belichick-Tom Brady era (and their 10th ever), it would be a fully-expected validation of their dominance. If they don’t, it would assure that the magnitude of the Jaguars' achievement can never be diminished.  MORE: Stream Jags-Pats live and on-demand with fuboTV (7-day free trial)  That gulf is overwhelming, even compared to the one between the Jaguars and the team they buried to get here, the Steelers. Just limiting the Patriots' figures to the 18 years Belichick and Brady have been together while using the Jaguars' entire NFL existence, here’s the tally — Super Bowl wins: Patriots, 5-0. Super Bowl appearances: Patriots, 7-0. AFC title games: Patriots, 12-2 (including the last seven). Quarterback postseason starts: Brady 35, Blake Bortles 2. Coaching postseason games: Belichick 35, Doug Marrone 2.  On the other hand, the last time it was universally believed that the Patriots had no chance to win a playoff game was Super Bowl 36, at the beginning of the dynasty, against the Rams. The last time for the Jaguars was last week, when the Steelers looked past them like few teams in the history of any sport looked past the team in front of them.  MORE: Jaguars face a Patriots team that will be ready to punch back  That’s not the sole reason the Jaguars ran them off their home field, however, and the Patriots won't take them for granted in any form or fashion. The Jaguars are a physically and mentally tough bunch of players who are not intimidated by anyone. That part of their story will decide this game and determine who moves on to Minneapolis.  NFL playoff picks: Jaguars at Patriots (-9)    Date, time: Sunday, 3:05 p.m. ET   Location: Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Mass.   TV: CBS   Live streaming: FuboTV (7-day free trial)   Odds: Patriots -9; total: 48     David Steele : The Patriots are defending champs, but even in light of the speed in which rosters turn over year-to-year, there are some jarring differences in personnel since last season's run.  Yes, Brady, of course, but they’ve had Rob Gronkowski for all but one week this time, where they did not for the playoffs last year. No Julian Edelman, either, with Brandin Cooks added as a target, and the running back mix is different (again). Defensive coordinator Matt Patricia also has a different blend of players to juggle, too, with no Dont’a Hightower since November.  The Jaguars' defense deserves every accolade it has earned and every boast Jalen Ramsey exudes. But the Jaguars also let the Steelers’ weapons break off big plays to climb back into and stay in their game last week, so assuming that whatever they do to slow Gronkowski will work is premature at best.  MORE: Why Jaguars match up so well with Patriots  All of that said, however … the "secret" to beating Brady when he's been beaten has been the pass rush, and handling the Jaguars' front seven will be a mighty task. The Jaguars are second-best in the NFL in total defense, scoring defense, sacks and interceptions, and first in pass completion percentage and passer rating allowed.  A case can be made for the Jaguars to pull this off, if everything goes perfectly.  A better case can be made that the Patriots will never let that happen.   Pick : Patriots 26, Jaguars 19  NFC CHAMPIONSHIP: Vikings-Eagles picks, odds    Vinnie Iyer : The Jaguars are big underdogs, but they are more than capable of giving the Patriots a massive headache. This game is in Foxborough, but it has a similar feel to the 2015 AFC championship game two years ago in Denver.  The Patriots were stifled just enough against a loaded Broncos defense that could smash New England in the mouth by simply lining up elite talent at every position. Von Miller led the domination there. For the Jaguars, Calais Campbell is the main man.  The Jaguars have struggled only against mobile quarterbacks, and outside of Antonio Brown, no wide receiver has had success against shutdown corners Ramsey and A.J. Bouye flanking the ferocious, four-man pass rush.  MORE: 10 fast facts for Jaguars-Patriots  Jacksonville won't try to outsmart New England — it will simply rely on its talent to be faster and physical in all the matchups. Offensively, it comes to another clean game from Bortles, buoyed by more big-time running from Leonard Fournette.  The Jaguars are constructed in the image of the Tom Coughlin teams that got the better of Brady and Belichick twice in Super Bowls. Bortles is much maligned, but he's better than what Peyton Manning was for that Broncos team, and he's on par with how Eli Manning played for Coughlin's Giants.

Bill Bender       It takes immense defensive talent, a nasty rushing attack, fearlessness and an attitude to take down the Patriots at Gillette Stadium. These Jaguars are young and don't know any better to think the moment is too big for them. They'll get in Brady's face, thwart a less explosive overall offense than that of the Steelers and keep shocking everyone on their way to Super Bowl LII.
