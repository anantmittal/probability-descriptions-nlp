First study of blacks and whites reveals much higher risk over lifetime        January 24, 2012
					
						 | By Marla Paul         CHICAGO --- Will you have a heart attack or a stroke in your lifetime? Your odds may be worse than you think.  Men and women may have a false sense of security about their chances of having a heart attack or stroke based on the current practice of calculating a patient’s risk 10 years into the future. New Northwestern Medicine research shows a young or middle-aged adult who is at low risk in the short term may be at very high risk in the long term -- if he or she has just one or two risk factors such as higher than optimal cholesterol or blood pressure levels.  This is the first study to examine the lifetime risk of heart disease in white and black men and women. Previous studies have been in whites and predominantly males. It’s also the first study to look at the entire adult age spectrum. The research also looked at the risk across multiple birth cohorts and found the effect of the risk factors remained consistent regardless of the decade in which a person was born.  The study is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Part of the Cardiovascular Lifetime Risk Pooling Project, the research tracks more than 250,000 participants from 18 different groups of people living in the community over a period of more than 50 years. The patients’ risk factors for cardiovascular disease -- blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status and diabetes status -- were measured at ages 45, 55, 65 and 75 years for each participant.  “We are giving incomplete and misleading risk information if we only focus on the next 10 years of someone’s life,” said principal investigator Donald Lloyd-Jones, MD, chair and associate professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. “With even just one risk factor, the likelihood is very large that someone will develop a major cardiovascular event that will kill them or substantially diminish their quality of life or health.”  The risk-factor profile was considered optimal when a participant had a total cholesterol level of less than 180 milligrams per deciliter and untreated blood pressure of less than 120 over less than 80, was a nonsmoker and did not have diabetes.  The new research on long-term risk may be important in estimating the future burden of cardiovascular disease in the general population, Lloyd-Jones noted.  Some key findings of the study:  Men who are 45 years old and have all risk factors at optimal levels have a 1.4 percent risk of having a heart attack or stroke or other form of death from heart disease while having two or more risk factors hike the risk to 49.5 percent.  For 45-year-old women with all risk factors being optimal, the chance of having a heart attack or stroke in their lifetimes is 4.1 percent while having two or more risk factors boost it to 30.7 percent.  “Just even one small increase in risk, from all optimal risk factors to one that isn’t optimal, like slightly elevated cholesterol or blood pressure, significantly bumps up a person’s lifetime risk,” Lloyd-Jones said. (Non-optimal means a person doesn’t have diabetes and doesn’t smoke but either cholesterol is 180 to 199 or blood pressure is 120 to 130 on top or 80 to 89 on the bottom. These numbers aren’t at levels that need to be treated with medication, but they are still higher than desired.)  Women have a higher risk than men for a stroke over their lifetimes but a lower risk for a heart attack.  African-Americans have higher risk factors such as more hypertension and diabetes than whites, but because they also tend to die at younger ages, their lifetime risk of having a heart attack or stroke ends up being the same as whites.  “This study underscores the importance of lifestyle -- particularly diet, exercise and smoking cessation -- all the lifestyle patterns that are important in reducing the development of the risk factors in the first place,” said Jarett Berry, MD, who worked on the study when he was at Northwestern’s Feinberg School and is now assistant professor of medicine at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.  “We need to do a much better job of making sure these risk factors don’t develop in the first place, getting kids and young adults off to better starts so they don’t gain weight and are following healthier lifestyles throughout their lives,” Lloyd-Jones said.  Lloyd-Jones pointed out that maintaining the full package of optimal risk factors through middle age had a dramatic effect on the remainder of a person’s life. “It appears that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts,” he said.  The research was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

Lead writer: Chris Woolston  February 29, 2016       Each year heart attacks kill more than 150,000 Americans, nearly half of them women. If such a grim statistic can have a bright side, it's this: Most heart attacks today aren't fatal.  About 75% of men and 60% of women live at least one year after an attack. Who is most at risk? While most heart attack victims are middle-aged or olderthe average age for a first attack is 66 for men and 70 for womenpeople in their 20s and 30s suffer attacks too. The risk of a heart attack climbs for men after age 45 and for women after age 55. When do heart attacks strike? Heart attacks occur roughly every 35 seconds in the United States, and most occur in the morning, a time when the platelets in the blood are especially "sticky" and prone to form clots. Early Warning Signs Heart attack symptoms can be subtle Watch video More on heart attack "I Stopped My Diabetes Meds and Had a Heart Attack" 10 Risk Factors for Heart Disease      At least one study, however, has found that morning isn't a prime time for heart attacks among people who regularly take aspirin, which helps keep platelets from sticking together. Beating the odds Survival odds for people who have had a heart attack keep getting better thanks to advances in diagnosis, medication, and lifesaving technology. It's worth noting that survival rates for heart attack patients are better on weekdays compared to weekends, because medical personnel are more likely to use invasive procedures (including angioplasty and bypass surgery) during the week. Nonetheless, cardiologists are optimistic about the rate of improvement in cardiac care. When Sharonne Hayes, MD, director of the Mayo Clinic's Women's Heart Clinic, started practicing in the mid-1980s, doctors couldn't do much for people having heart attacks. "Now we can stop a heart attack in its tracks," she says. "Patients have a much better chance at recovery."

Extensive research has identified factors that increase a person’s risk of coronary heart disease in general and heart attack in particular. The more risk factors you have, and the greater the level of each risk factor, the higher your chance of developing coronary heart disease — a common term for the buildup of plaque in the heart’s arteries that could lead to heart attack. Major risk factors  Research has shown that these unchangeable factors significantly increase the risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Modifiable risk factors Some major risk factors can be modified, treated or controlled through medications or lifestyle change. Contributing risk factors These factors are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but their significance and prevalence haven't yet been determined. The American Heart Association recommends beginning heart disease prevention early in life, starting by assessing your risk factors and working to keep them low. The sooner you know and manage your risk factors, the better your chances of leading a heart-healthy life. Learn more about common risk factors and access information about how you can manage modifiable risk factors below.             Risk Factors and Coronary Heart Disease     Major risk factors that can't be changed    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed. The more of these risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease . Since you can't do anything about these risk factors, it's even more important for you to manage the risk factors that can be changed. Increasing Age The majority of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 or older. At older ages, women who have heart attacks are more likely than men are to die from them within a few weeks. Male Sex (Gender) Men have a greater risk of heart attack than women do, and they have attacks earlier in life. Even after menopause, when women's death rate from heart disease increases, it's not as great as men's. Heredity (Including Race) Children of parents with heart disease are more likely to develop it themselves. African Americans have more severe high blood pressure than Caucasians and a higher risk of heart disease. Heart disease risk is also higher among Mexican Americans, American Indians, native Hawaiians and some Asian Americans. This is partly due to higher rates of obesity and diabetes. Most people with a strong family history of heart disease have one or more other risk factors. Just as you can't control your age, sex and race, you can't control your family history. Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed. The more of these risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease .

Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    Major risk factors you can modify, treat or control    Tobacco smoke Smokers' risk of developing coronary heart disease is much higher than that of nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking is a powerful independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease. Cigarette smoking also acts with other risk factors to greatly increase the risk for coronary heart disease. Exposure to other people's smoke increases the risk of heart disease even for nonsmokers. Learn about smoking and cardiovascular disease High blood cholesterol As blood cholesterol rises, so does risk of coronary heart disease. When other risk factors (such as high blood pressure and tobacco smoke) are present, this risk increases even more. A person's cholesterol level is also affected by age, sex, heredity and diet. Here's the lowdown on: Total Cholesterol: Your total cholesterol score is calculated using the following equation: HDL + LDL + 20 percent of your triglyceride level. Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol = "bad" cholesterol A low LDL cholesterol level is considered good for your heart health. However, your LDL number should no longer be the main factor in guiding treatment to prevent heart attack and stroke, according to the latest guidelines from the American Heart Association. For patients taking statins, the guidelines say they no longer need to get LDL cholesterol levels down to a specific target number. Lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in saturated and trans fats can raise LDL cholesterol. High-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol = "good" cholesterol With HDL (good) cholesterol, higher levels are typically better. Low HDL cholesterol puts you at higher risk for heart disease. People with high blood triglycerides usually also have lower HDL cholesterol. Genetic factors, type 2 diabetes, smoking, being overweight and being sedentary can all result in lower HDL cholesterol. Triglycerides Triglyceride is the most common type of fat in the body. Normal triglyceride levels vary by age and sex. A high triglyceride level combined with low HDL cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol is associated with atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits in artery walls that increases the risk for heart attack and stroke. Learn more about managing your cholesterol High blood pressure High blood pressure increases the heart's workload, causing the heart muscle to thicken and become stiffer. This stiffening of the heart muscle is not normal, and causes the heart not to work properly. It also increases your risk of stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and congestive heart failure. When high blood pressure exists with obesity, smoking, high blood cholesterol levels or diabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke increases even more. Learn more about managing your blood pressure Physical inactivity An inactive lifestyle is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Regular, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity helps reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Even moderate-intensity activities help if done regularly and long term. Physical activity can help control blood cholesterol, diabetes and obesity, as well as help lower blood pressure in some people. Learn more about getting active Obesity and overweight People who have excess body fat — especially if a lot of it is at the waist — are more likely to develop heart disease and stroke even if they have no other risk factors. Overweight and obese adults with risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high blood sugar can make lifestyle changes to lose weight and produce clinically meaningful reductions in triglycerides, blood glucose, HbA1c, and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Many people may have difficulty losing weight. But a sustained weight loss of 3 to 5% body weight may lead to clinically meaningful reductions in some risk factors, larger weight losses can benefit blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose. Learn more about managing your weight Diabetes mellitus Diabetes seriously increases your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Even when glucose levels are under control, diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, but the risks are even greater if blood sugar is not well controlled. At least 68% of people >65 years of age with diabetes die of some form of heart disease and 16% die of stroke. If you have diabetes, it's extremely important to work with your healthcare provider to manage it and control any other risk factors you can. Persons with diabetes who are obese or overweight should make lifestyle changes (e.g., eat better, get regular physical activity, lose weight ) to help manage blood sugar. Learn more about managing your diabetes    Other factors that contribute to heart disease risk    Stress Individual response to stress may be a contributing factor. Some scientists have noted a relationship between coronary heart disease risk and stress in a person's life, their health behaviors and socioeconomic status. These factors may affect established risk factors. For example, people under stress may overeat, start smoking or smoke more than they otherwise would. Get stress management tips and tools Alcohol Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure, increase risk of cardiomyopathy and stroke, cancer and other diseases. It can contribute to high triglycerides, and produce irregular heartbeats. Excessive alcohol consumption contributes to obesity, alcoholism, suicide and accidents. However, there is a cardioprotective effect of moderate alcohol consumption. If you drink, limit your alcohol consumption to no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one drink as 1-1/2 fluid ounces (fl oz) of 80-proof spirits (such as bourbon, Scotch, vodka, gin, etc.), 5 fl oz of wine or 12 fl oz of regular beer. It's not recommended that nondrinkers start using alcohol or that drinkers increase the amount they drink. Read our recommendation on alcohol, wine and cardiovascular disease Diet and Nutrition A healthy diet is one of the best weapons you have to fight cardiovascular disease. The food you eat (and the amount) can affect other controllable risk factors: cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes and overweight. Choose nutrient-rich foods — which have vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients but are lower in calories — over nutrient-poor foods. Choose a diet that emphasizes intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, nontropical vegetable oils, and nuts; and limits intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meats. And to maintain a healthy weight, coordinate your diet with your physical activity level so you're using up as many calories as you take in.

If you are over 40, or if you have multiple risk factors, work especially closely with your doctor to address your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Heart attack prevention should begin early in life. Start with an assessment of your risk factors and a plan you can follow to keep your heart attack risk low. Prevention is critical, because many first-ever heart attacks are fatal or disabling. Learn Heart-Health Basics Reducing your risk starts with smart choices. If you smoke, stop. The American Heart Association has tools to help you quit . Work with your physician to manage your risk factors. These might include high blood pressure , high cholesterol and diabetes .

Fatty deposits build up over time, forming plaques in your heart's arteries. If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form and block your arteries, causing a heart attack. During a heart attack, tissue in your heart muscle dies due to lack of blood flow through your heart's arteries.     A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked, most often by a build-up of fat, cholesterol and other substances, which form a plaque in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary arteries). The interrupted blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle.  A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, can be fatal, but treatment has improved dramatically over the years. It's crucial to call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack.      Symptoms Common heart attack signs and symptoms include:   Pressure, tightness, pain, or a squeezing or aching sensation in your chest or arms that may spread to your neck, jaw or back  Nausea, indigestion, heartburn or abdominal pain  Shortness of breath  Cold sweat  Fatigue  Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness   Heart attack symptoms vary  Not all people who have heart attacks have the same symptoms or have the same severity of symptoms. Some people have mild pain; others have more severe pain. Some people have no symptoms, while for others, the first sign may be sudden cardiac arrest. However, the more signs and symptoms you have, the greater the likelihood you're having a heart attack.  Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance. The earliest warning may be recurrent chest pain (angina) that's triggered by exertion and relieved by rest. Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart.  A heart attack differs from a condition in which your heart suddenly stops (sudden cardiac arrest, which occurs when an electrical disturbance disrupts your heart's pumping action and causes blood to stop flowing to the rest of your body). A heart attack can cause cardiac arrest, but it's not the only cause.  When to see a doctor  Act immediately. Some people wait too long because they don't recognize the important signs and symptoms. Take these steps:    Call for emergency medical help . If you suspect you're having a heart attack, don't hesitate. Immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital.  Drive yourself only if there are no other options. Because your condition can worsen, driving yourself puts you and others at risk.   Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed to you by a doctor . Take it as instructed while awaiting emergency help.   Take aspirin, if recommended . Taking aspirin during a heart attack could reduce heart damage by helping to keep your blood from clotting.  Aspirin can interact with other medications, however, so don't take an aspirin unless your doctor or emergency medical personnel recommend it. Don't delay calling 911 to take an aspirin. Call for emergency help first.    What to do if you see someone having a heart attack  If you encounter someone who is unconscious, first call for emergency medical help. Then begin CPR to keep blood flowing. Push hard and fast on the person's chest in a fairly rapid rhythm — about 100 to 120 compressions a minute. It's not necessary to check the person's airway or deliver rescue breaths unless you've been trained in CPR.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes A heart attack occurs when one or more of your coronary arteries become blocked. Over time, a coronary artery can narrow from the buildup of various substances, including cholesterol (atherosclerosis). This condition, known as coronary artery disease, causes most heart attacks.  During a heart attack, one of these plaques can rupture and spill cholesterol and other substances into the bloodstream. A blood clot forms at the site of the rupture. If large enough, the clot can completely block the flow of blood through the coronary artery.  Another cause of a heart attack is a spasm of a coronary artery that shuts down blood flow to part of the heart muscle. Use of tobacco and of illicit drugs, such as cocaine, can cause a life-threatening spasm. A heart attack can also occur due to a tear in the heart artery (spontaneous coronary artery dissection).  Risk factors Certain factors contribute to the unwanted buildup of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) that narrows arteries throughout your body. You can improve or eliminate many of these risk factors to reduce your chances of having a first or subsequent heart attack.  Heart attack risk factors include:   Age . Men age 45 or older and women age 55 or older are more likely to have a heart attack than are younger men and women.  Tobacco . Smoking and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke increase the risk of a heart attack.  High blood pressure . Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries that feed your heart by accelerating atherosclerosis. High blood pressure that occurs with obesity, smoking, high cholesterol or diabetes increases your risk even more.  High blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels . A high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the "bad" cholesterol) is most likely to narrow arteries. A high level of triglycerides, a type of blood fat related to your diet, also ups your risk of heart attack. However, a high level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol) lowers your risk of heart attack.  Diabetes . Insulin, a hormone secreted by your pancreas, allows your body to use glucose, a form of sugar. Having diabetes — not producing enough insulin or not responding to insulin properly — causes your body's blood sugar levels to rise. Diabetes, especially uncontrolled, increases your risk of a heart attack.  Family history of heart attack . If your siblings, parents or grandparents have had early heart attacks (by age 55 for male relatives and by age 65 for female relatives), you may be at increased risk.  Lack of physical activity . An inactive lifestyle contributes to high blood cholesterol levels and obesity. People who get regular aerobic exercise have better cardiovascular fitness, which decreases their overall risk of heart attack. Exercise is also beneficial in lowering high blood pressure.  Obesity . Obesity is associated with high blood cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. Losing just 10 percent of your body weight can lower this risk, however.  Stress . You may respond to stress in ways that can increase your risk of a heart attack.  Illegal drug use . Using stimulant drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, can trigger a spasm of your coronary arteries that can cause a heart attack.  A history of preeclampsia . This condition causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and increases the lifetime risk of heart disease.  A history of an autoimmune condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus . Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other autoimmune conditions can increase your risk of having a heart attack.   Complications Complications are often related to the damage done to your heart during an attack. Damage can lead to:   Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) . Electrical "short circuits" can develop, resulting in abnormal heart rhythms, some of which can be serious, even fatal.  Heart failure . An attack may damage so much heart tissue that the remaining heart muscle can't adequately pump blood out of your heart. Heart failure may be temporary, or it can be a chronic condition resulting from extensive and permanent damage to your heart.  Heart rupture . Areas of heart muscle weakened by a heart attack can rupture, leaving a hole in part of the heart. This rupture is often fatal.  Valve problems . Heart valves damaged during a heart attack may develop severe leakage problems.   Prevention It's never too late to take steps to prevent a heart attack — even if you've already had one. Here are ways to prevent a heart attack.   Medications. Taking medications can reduce your risk of a subsequent heart attack and help your damaged heart function better. Continue to take what your doctor prescribes, and ask your doctor how often you need to be monitored.  Lifestyle factors . You know the drill: Maintain a healthy weight with a heart-healthy diet, don't smoke, exercise regularly, manage stress and control conditions that can lead to heart attack, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.

It’s important for everyone to know the facts about heart disease [PDF-243K] .   Heart Disease in the United States   About 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year–that’s 1 in every 4 deaths . 1   Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. More than half of the deaths due to heart disease in 2009 were in men. 1    Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 people annually. 1   Every year about 735,000 Americans have a heart attack . Of these, 525,000 are a first heart attack and 210,000 happen in people who have already had a heart attack. 2    Heart Disease Deaths Vary by Race and Ethnicity  Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people of most ethnicities in the United States, including African Americans, Hispanics, and whites. For American Indians or Alaska Natives and Asians or Pacific Islanders, heart disease is second only to cancer. Below are the percentages of all deaths caused by heart disease in 2008, listed by ethnicity. 4    Race of Ethnic Group  % of Deaths     American Indians or Alaska Natives  18.4    Asians or Pacific Islanders  22.2    Non-Hispanic Blacks  23.8    Non-Hispanic Whites  23.8    All  23.5      Top of Page    Early Action is Important for Heart Attack  Know the warning signs and symptoms of a heart attack so that you can act fast if you or someone you know might be having a heart attack. The chances of survival are greater when emergency treatment begins quickly.   In a 2005 survey, most respondents—92%—recognized chest pain as a symptom of a heart attack. Only 27% were aware of all major symptoms and knew to call 9-1-1 when someone was having a heart attack. 5    About 47% of sudden cardiac deaths occur outside a hospital. This suggests that many people with heart disease don’t act on early warning signs. 6    Heart attacks have several major warning signs and symptoms:   Chest pain or discomfort.  Upper body pain or discomfort in the arms, back, neck, jaw, or upper stomach.  Shortness of breath.  Nausea, lightheadedness, or cold sweats.    Top of Page    Americans at Risk for Heart Disease  High blood pressure , high cholesterol , and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. About half of Americans (47%) have at least one of these three risk factors. 7  Several other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also put people at a higher risk for heart disease, including:   Diabetes  Overweight and obesity  Poor diet  Physical inactivity  Excessive alcohol use    Top of Page    CDC Fact Sheets Related to Heart Disease   Heart Disease Fact Sheet  Men and Heart Disease  Women and Heart Disease  Atrial Fibrillation  Cardiomyopathy  Heart Failure  Signs and Symptoms of a Heart Attack  Aortic Aneurysm  Cholesterol  High Blood Pressure  Pulmonary Hypertension Fact Sheet    Top of Page    References   CDC, NCHS.

Identify your risk factors and take corrective action.  14-16 - High risk (15-19 percent) - You stand a good chance of having a first heart attack before you are 55, if male, and 65, if female.  If you have already had a heart attack, you are at high risk for a repeat performance.  Over 16 - Extreme risk (greater than 20 percent) - Unless you have a death wish, you have work to do. It will take time and effort to move to the lower risk categories.  Don’t bite off too much at one time. The process of change should be slow, committed, persistent, and permanent.

Extensive research has identified factors that increase a person’s risk of coronary heart disease in general and heart attack in particular. The more risk factors you have, and the greater the level of each risk factor, the higher your chance of developing coronary heart disease — a common term for the buildup of plaque in the heart’s arteries that could lead to heart attack. Major risk factors  Research has shown that these unchangeable factors significantly increase the risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Modifiable risk factors Some major risk factors can be modified, treated or controlled through medications or lifestyle change. Contributing risk factors These factors are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but their significance and prevalence haven't yet been determined. The American Heart Association recommends beginning heart disease prevention early in life, starting by assessing your risk factors and working to keep them low. The sooner you know and manage your risk factors, the better your chances of leading a heart-healthy life. Learn more about common risk factors and access information about how you can manage modifiable risk factors below.             Risk Factors and Coronary Heart Disease     Major risk factors that can't be changed    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed. The more of these risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease . Since you can't do anything about these risk factors, it's even more important for you to manage the risk factors that can be changed. Increasing Age The majority of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 or older. At older ages, women who have heart attacks are more likely than men are to die from them within a few weeks. Male Sex (Gender) Men have a greater risk of heart attack than women do, and they have attacks earlier in life. Even after menopause, when women's death rate from heart disease increases, it's not as great as men's. Heredity (Including Race) Children of parents with heart disease are more likely to develop it themselves. African Americans have more severe high blood pressure than Caucasians and a higher risk of heart disease. Heart disease risk is also higher among Mexican Americans, American Indians, native Hawaiians and some Asian Americans. This is partly due to higher rates of obesity and diabetes. Most people with a strong family history of heart disease have one or more other risk factors. Just as you can't control your age, sex and race, you can't control your family history. Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed.

Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    Major risk factors you can modify, treat or control    Tobacco smoke Smokers' risk of developing coronary heart disease is much higher than that of nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking is a powerful independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease. Cigarette smoking also acts with other risk factors to greatly increase the risk for coronary heart disease. Exposure to other people's smoke increases the risk of heart disease even for nonsmokers. Learn about smoking and cardiovascular disease High blood cholesterol As blood cholesterol rises, so does risk of coronary heart disease. When other risk factors (such as high blood pressure and tobacco smoke) are present, this risk increases even more. A person's cholesterol level is also affected by age, sex, heredity and diet. Here's the lowdown on: Total Cholesterol: Your total cholesterol score is calculated using the following equation: HDL + LDL + 20 percent of your triglyceride level. Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol = "bad" cholesterol A low LDL cholesterol level is considered good for your heart health. However, your LDL number should no longer be the main factor in guiding treatment to prevent heart attack and stroke, according to the latest guidelines from the American Heart Association. For patients taking statins, the guidelines say they no longer need to get LDL cholesterol levels down to a specific target number. Lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in saturated and trans fats can raise LDL cholesterol. High-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol = "good" cholesterol With HDL (good) cholesterol, higher levels are typically better. Low HDL cholesterol puts you at higher risk for heart disease. People with high blood triglycerides usually also have lower HDL cholesterol. Genetic factors, type 2 diabetes, smoking, being overweight and being sedentary can all result in lower HDL cholesterol. Triglycerides Triglyceride is the most common type of fat in the body. Normal triglyceride levels vary by age and sex. A high triglyceride level combined with low HDL cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol is associated with atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits in artery walls that increases the risk for heart attack and stroke. Learn more about managing your cholesterol High blood pressure High blood pressure increases the heart's workload, causing the heart muscle to thicken and become stiffer. This stiffening of the heart muscle is not normal, and causes the heart not to work properly. It also increases your risk of stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and congestive heart failure. When high blood pressure exists with obesity, smoking, high blood cholesterol levels or diabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke increases even more. Learn more about managing your blood pressure Physical inactivity An inactive lifestyle is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Regular, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity helps reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Even moderate-intensity activities help if done regularly and long term. Physical activity can help control blood cholesterol, diabetes and obesity, as well as help lower blood pressure in some people. Learn more about getting active Obesity and overweight People who have excess body fat — especially if a lot of it is at the waist — are more likely to develop heart disease and stroke even if they have no other risk factors. Overweight and obese adults with risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high blood sugar can make lifestyle changes to lose weight and produce clinically meaningful reductions in triglycerides, blood glucose, HbA1c, and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Many people may have difficulty losing weight. But a sustained weight loss of 3 to 5% body weight may lead to clinically meaningful reductions in some risk factors, larger weight losses can benefit blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose. Learn more about managing your weight Diabetes mellitus Diabetes seriously increases your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Even when glucose levels are under control, diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, but the risks are even greater if blood sugar is not well controlled. At least 68% of people >65 years of age with diabetes die of some form of heart disease and 16% die of stroke. If you have diabetes, it's extremely important to work with your healthcare provider to manage it and control any other risk factors you can. Persons with diabetes who are obese or overweight should make lifestyle changes (e.g., eat better, get regular physical activity, lose weight ) to help manage blood sugar. Learn more about managing your diabetes    Other factors that contribute to heart disease risk    Stress Individual response to stress may be a contributing factor. Some scientists have noted a relationship between coronary heart disease risk and stress in a person's life, their health behaviors and socioeconomic status. These factors may affect established risk factors. For example, people under stress may overeat, start smoking or smoke more than they otherwise would. Get stress management tips and tools Alcohol Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure, increase risk of cardiomyopathy and stroke, cancer and other diseases. It can contribute to high triglycerides, and produce irregular heartbeats. Excessive alcohol consumption contributes to obesity, alcoholism, suicide and accidents. However, there is a cardioprotective effect of moderate alcohol consumption. If you drink, limit your alcohol consumption to no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one drink as 1-1/2 fluid ounces (fl oz) of 80-proof spirits (such as bourbon, Scotch, vodka, gin, etc.), 5 fl oz of wine or 12 fl oz of regular beer. It's not recommended that nondrinkers start using alcohol or that drinkers increase the amount they drink. Read our recommendation on alcohol, wine and cardiovascular disease Diet and Nutrition A healthy diet is one of the best weapons you have to fight cardiovascular disease. The food you eat (and the amount) can affect other controllable risk factors: cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes and overweight. Choose nutrient-rich foods — which have vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients but are lower in calories — over nutrient-poor foods. Choose a diet that emphasizes intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, nontropical vegetable oils, and nuts; and limits intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meats. And to maintain a healthy weight, coordinate your diet with your physical activity level so you're using up as many calories as you take in.

Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.  The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.  Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.      Symptoms Heart disease symptoms depend on what type of heart disease you have.  Symptoms of heart disease in your blood vessels (atherosclerotic disease) Cardiovascular disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain; women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.  Symptoms can include:   Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)  Shortness of breath  Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed  Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back   You might not be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for cardiovascular symptoms and discuss concerns with your doctor. Cardiovascular disease can sometimes be found early with regular evaluations.  Heart disease symptoms caused by abnormal heartbeats (heart arrhythmias) A heart arrhythmia is an abnormal heartbeat. Your heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia symptoms can include:   Fluttering in your chest  Racing heartbeat (tachycardia)  Slow heartbeat (bradycardia)  Chest pain or discomfort  Shortness of breath  Lightheadedness  Dizziness  Fainting (syncope) or near fainting   Heart disease symptoms caused by heart defects Serious congenital heart defects — defects you're born with — usually become evident soon after birth. Heart defect symptoms in children could include:   Pale gray or blue skin color (cyanosis)  Swelling in the legs, abdomen or areas around the eyes  In an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain   Less serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood. Signs and symptoms of congenital heart defects that usually aren't immediately life-threatening include:   Easily getting short of breath during exercise or activity  Easily tiring during exercise or activity  Swelling in the hands, ankles or feet   Heart disease symptoms caused by weak heart muscle (dilated cardiomyopathy) In early stages of cardiomyopathy, you may have no symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include:   Breathlessness with exertion or at rest  Swelling of the legs, ankles and feet  Fatigue  Irregular heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering  Dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting   Heart disease symptoms caused by heart infections Endocarditis is an infection that affects the inner membrane that separates the chambers and valves of the heart (endocardium). Heart infection symptoms can include:   Fever  Shortness of breath  Weakness or fatigue  Swelling in your legs or abdomen  Changes in your heart rhythm  Dry or persistent cough  Skin rashes or unusual spots   Heart disease symptoms caused by valvular heart disease The heart has four valves — the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid valves — that open and close to direct blood flow through your heart. Valves may be damaged by a variety of conditions leading to narrowing (stenosis), leaking (regurgitation or insufficiency) or improper closing (prolapse).  Depending on which valve isn't working properly, valvular heart disease symptoms generally include:   Fatigue  Shortness of breath  Irregular heartbeat  Swollen feet or ankles  Chest pain  Fainting (syncope)   When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical care if you have these heart disease symptoms:   Chest pain  Shortness of breath  Fainting   Heart disease is easier to treat when detected early, so talk to your doctor about your concerns regarding your heart health. If you're concerned about developing heart disease, talk to your doctor about steps you can take to reduce your heart disease risk. This is especially important if you have a family history of heart disease.  If you think you may have heart disease, based on new signs or symptoms you're having, make an appointment to see your doctor.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes How the heart works    Chambers and valves of the heart Chambers and valves of the heart A normal heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of your heart. The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.     Your heart is a pump. It's a muscular organ about the size of your fist, situated slightly left of center in your chest. Your heart is divided into the right and the left side. The division prevents oxygen-rich blood from mixing with oxygen-poor blood. Oxygen-poor blood returns to the heart after circulating through your body.   The right side of the heart, comprising the right atrium and ventricle, collects and pumps blood to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries.  The lungs refresh the blood with a new supply of oxygen. The lungs also breathe out carbon dioxide, a waste product.  Oxygen-rich blood then enters the left side of the heart, comprising the left atrium and ventricle.  The left side of the heart pumps blood through the aorta to supply tissues throughout the body with oxygen and nutrients.   Heart valves Four valves within your heart keep your blood moving the right way by opening only one way and only when they need to. To function properly, the valve must be formed properly, must open all the way and must close tightly so there's no leakage. The four valves are:   Tricuspid  Mitral  Pulmonary  Aortic   Heartbeats    The blueprints to your heart  Click here for an infographic to learn more   A beating heart contracts and relaxes in a continuous cycle.   During contraction (systole), your ventricles contract, forcing blood into the vessels to your lungs and body.  During relaxation (diastole), the ventricles are filled with blood coming from the upper chambers (left and right atria).   Electrical system Your heart's electrical wiring keeps it beating, which controls the continuous exchange of oxygen-rich blood with oxygen-poor blood. This exchange keeps you alive.   Electrical impulses begin high in the right atrium and travel through specialized pathways to the ventricles, delivering the signal for the heart to pump.  The conduction system keeps your heart beating in a coordinated and normal rhythm, which keeps blood circulating.   Various heart disease causes The causes of heart disease vary by type of heart disease.  Causes of cardiovascular disease    Development of atherosclerosis Development of atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis is a process in which blood, fats such as cholesterol and other substances build up on your artery walls. Eventually, deposits called plaques may form. The deposits may narrow — or block — your arteries. These plaques can also rupture, causing a blood clot.     While cardiovascular disease can refer to different heart or blood vessel problems, the term is often used to mean damage to your heart or blood vessels by atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis), a buildup of fatty plaques in your arteries. Plaque buildup thickens and stiffens artery walls, which can inhibit blood flow through your arteries to your organs and tissues.  Atherosclerosis is also the most common cause of cardiovascular disease. It can be caused by correctable problems, such as an unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, being overweight and smoking.  Causes of heart arrhythmia Common causes of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) or conditions that can lead to arrhythmias include:   Heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects)  Coronary artery disease  High blood pressure  Diabetes  Smoking  Excessive use of alcohol or caffeine  Drug abuse  Stress  Some over-the-counter medications, prescription medications, dietary supplements and herbal remedies  Valvular heart disease   In a healthy person with a normal, healthy heart, it's unlikely for a fatal arrhythmia to develop without some outside trigger, such as an electrical shock or the use of illegal drugs. That's primarily because a healthy person's heart is free from any abnormal conditions that cause an arrhythmia, such as an area of scarred tissue.  However, in a heart that's diseased or deformed, the heart's electrical impulses may not properly start or travel through the heart, making arrhythmias more likely to develop.  Causes of congenital heart defects Congenital heart defects usually develop while a baby is in the womb. Heart defects can develop as the heart develops, about a month after conception, changing the flow of blood in the heart. Some medical conditions, medications and genes may play a role in causing heart defects.  Heart defects can also develop in adults. As you age, your heart's structure can change, causing a heart defect.  Causes of cardiomyopathy The cause of cardiomyopathy, a thickening or enlarging of the heart muscle, may depend on the type:   Dilated cardiomyopathy. The cause of this most common type of cardiomyopathy often is unknown. It may be caused by reduced blood flow to the heart (ischemic heart disease) resulting from damage after a heart attack, infections, toxins and certain drugs. It may also be inherited from a parent. It usually enlarges (dilates) the left ventricle.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This type, in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, usually is inherited. It can also develop over time because of high blood pressure or aging.  Restrictive cardiomyopathy. This least common type of cardiomyopathy, which causes the heart muscle to become rigid and less elastic, can occur for no known reason. Or it may be caused by diseases, such as connective tissue disorders, excessive iron buildup in your body (hemochromatosis), the buildup of abnormal proteins (amyloidosis) or by some cancer treatments.   Causes of heart infection A heart infection, such as endocarditis, is caused when an irritant, such as a bacterium, virus or chemical, reaches your heart muscle. The most common causes of heart infection include:   Bacteria  Viruses  Parasites   Causes of valvular heart disease There are many causes of diseases of your heart valves. You may be born with valvular disease, or the valves may be damaged by conditions such as:   Rheumatic fever  Infections (infectious endocarditis)  Connective tissue disorders   Risk factors Risk factors for developing heart disease include:   Age. Aging increases your risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and weakened or thickened heart muscle.  Sex. Men are generally at greater risk of heart disease. However, women's risk increases after menopause.  Family history. A family history of heart disease increases your risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a parent developed it at an early age (before age 55 for a male relative, such as your brother or father, and 65 for a female relative, such as your mother or sister).  Smoking. Nicotine constricts your blood vessels, and carbon monoxide can damage their inner lining, making them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Heart attacks are more common in smokers than in nonsmokers.  Certain chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy for cancer. Some chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapies may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.  Poor diet. A diet that's high in fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol can contribute to the development of heart disease.  High blood pressure. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can result in hardening and thickening of your arteries, narrowing the vessels through which blood flows.  High blood cholesterol levels. High levels of cholesterol in your blood can increase the risk of formation of plaques and atherosclerosis.  Diabetes. Diabetes increases your risk of heart disease. Both conditions share similar risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure.  Obesity. Excess weight typically worsens other risk factors.  Physical inactivity. Lack of exercise also is associated with many forms of heart disease and some of its other risk factors, as well.  Stress. Unrelieved stress may damage your arteries and worsen other risk factors for heart disease.  Poor hygiene. Not regularly washing your hands and not establishing other habits that can help prevent viral or bacterial infections can put you at risk of heart infections, especially if you already have an underlying heart condition. Poor dental health also may contribute to heart disease.   Complications Complications of heart disease include:   Heart failure. One of the most common complications of heart disease, heart failure occurs when your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. Heart failure can result from many forms of heart disease, including heart defects, cardiovascular disease, valvular heart disease, heart infections or cardiomyopathy.  Heart attack. A blood clot blocking the blood flow through a blood vessel that feeds the heart causes a heart attack, possibly damaging or destroying a part of the heart muscle. Atherosclerosis can cause a heart attack.  Stroke. The risk factors that lead to cardiovascular disease also can lead to an ischemic stroke, which happens when the arteries to your brain are narrowed or blocked so that too little blood reaches your brain. A stroke is a medical emergency — brain tissue begins to die within just a few minutes of a stroke.  Aneurysm. A serious complication that can occur anywhere in your body, an aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of your artery. If an aneurysm bursts, you may face life-threatening internal bleeding.  Peripheral artery disease. Atherosclerosis also can lead to peripheral artery disease. When you develop peripheral artery disease, your extremities — usually your legs — don't receive enough blood flow. This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain when walking (claudication).  Sudden cardiac arrest. Sudden cardiac arrest is the sudden, unexpected loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness, often caused by an arrhythmia. Sudden cardiac arrest is a medical emergency. If not treated immediately, it is fatal, resulting in sudden cardiac death.   Prevention Certain types of heart disease, such as heart defects, can't be prevented. However, you can help prevent many other types of heart disease by making the same lifestyle changes that can improve your heart disease, such as:   Quit smoking  Control other health conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes  Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week  Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat  Maintain a healthy weight  Reduce and manage stress  Practice good hygiene   By Mayo Clinic Staff    Heart disease care at Mayo Clinic   Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Diagnosis & treatment  March 22, 2018    Share on: Facebook Twitter    References  What is cardiovascular disease?

No matter what type of heart disease you have, your doctor will likely perform a physical exam and ask about your personal and family medical history before doing any tests. Besides blood tests and a chest X-ray, tests to diagnose heart disease can include:   Electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG records these electrical signals and can help your doctor detect irregularities in your heart's rhythm and structure. You may have an ECG while you're at rest or while exercising (stress electrocardiogram).  Holter monitoring. A Holter monitor is a portable device you wear to record a continuous ECG, usually for 24 to 72 hours. Holter monitoring is used to detect heart rhythm irregularities that aren't found during a regular ECG exam.  Echocardiogram. This noninvasive exam, which includes an ultrasound of your chest, shows detailed images of your heart's structure and function.  Stress test. This type of test involves raising your heart rate with exercise or medicine while performing heart tests and imaging to check how your heart responds.  Cardiac catheterization. In this test, a short tube (sheath) is inserted into a vein or artery in your leg (groin) or arm. A hollow, flexible and longer tube (guide catheter) is then inserted into the sheath. Aided by X-ray images on a monitor, your doctor threads the guide catheter through that artery until it reaches your heart.  The pressures in your heart chambers can be measured, and dye can be injected. The dye can be seen on an X-ray, which helps your doctor see the blood flow through your heart, blood vessels and valves to check for abnormalities.   Cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scan. This test is often used to check for heart problems. In a cardiac CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. An X-ray tube inside the machine rotates around your body and collects images of your heart and chest.  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For this test, you lie on a table inside a long tube-like machine that produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field produces pictures to help your doctor evaluate your heart.   Treatment Heart disease treatments vary by condition. For instance, if you have a heart infection, you'll likely be given antibiotics. In general, treatment for heart disease usually includes:   Lifestyle changes. These include eating a low-fat and low-sodium diet, getting at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days of the week, quitting smoking, and limiting alcohol intake.  Medications. If lifestyle changes alone aren't enough, your doctor may prescribe medications to control your heart disease. The type of medication will depend on the type of heart disease.  Medical procedures or surgery. If medications aren't enough, it's possible your doctor will recommend specific procedures or surgery. The type of procedure will depend on the type of heart disease and the extent of the damage to your heart.   Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Clinical trials   Explore Mayo Clinic studies testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease.  Lifestyle and home remedies Heart disease can be improved — or even prevented — by making certain lifestyle changes. The following changes can help anyone who wants to improve heart health:   Stop smoking. Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease, especially atherosclerosis. Quitting is the best way to reduce your risk of heart disease and its complications.  Control your blood pressure. Ask your doctor for a blood pressure measurement at least every two years. He or she may recommend more frequent measurements if your blood pressure is higher than normal or you have a history of heart disease. Optimal blood pressure is less than 120 systolic and 80 diastolic, as measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).  Check your cholesterol. Ask your doctor for a baseline cholesterol test when you're in your 20s and then at least every five years. You may need to start testing earlier if high cholesterol is in your family. If your test results aren't within desirable ranges, your doctor may recommend more frequent measurements.  Most people should aim for an LDL level below 130 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 3.4 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). If you have other risk factors for heart disease, you should aim for an LDL below 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). If you're at very high risk of heart disease — if you've already had a heart attack or have diabetes, for example — aim for an even lower LDL level — below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L).   Keep diabetes under control. If you have diabetes, tight blood sugar control can help reduce the risk of heart disease.  Move. Exercise helps you achieve and maintain a healthy weight and control diabetes, elevated cholesterol and high blood pressure — all risk factors for heart disease. If you have a heart arrhythmia or heart defect, there may be some restrictions on the activities you can do, so talk to your doctor.  With your doctor's OK, aim for 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity most days of the week.   Eat healthy foods. A heart-healthy diet based on fruits, vegetables and whole grains — and low in saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium and added sugar — can help you control your weight, blood pressure and cholesterol.  Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight increases your risk of heart disease. A BMI of less than 25 and a waist circumference of 35 inches (88.9 centimeters) or less is the goal for preventing and treating heart disease.  Manage stress. Reduce stress as much as possible. Practice techniques for managing stress, such as muscle relaxation and deep breathing.  Deal with depression. Being depressed can increase your risk of heart disease significantly. Talk to your doctor if you feel hopeless or uninterested in your life.  Practice good hygiene. Stay away from people with infectious diseases such as colds, get vaccinated against the flu, regularly wash your hands, and brush and floss your teeth regularly to keep yourself well.   Also, get regular medical checkups. Early detection and treatment can set the stage for a lifetime of better heart health.  Coping and support You may feel frustrated, upset or overwhelmed upon learning you or your loved one has heart disease. Fortunately, there are ways to help cope with heart disease or improve your condition. These include:   Cardiac rehabilitation. For people who have cardiovascular disease that's caused a heart attack or has required surgery to correct, cardiac rehabilitation is often recommended as a way to improve treatment and speed recovery. Cardiac rehabilitation involves levels of monitored exercise, nutritional counseling, emotional support, and support and education about lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of heart problems.  Support groups. Turning to friends and family for support is essential, but if you need more help, talk to your doctor about joining a support group. You may find that talking about your concerns with others with similar difficulties can help.  Continued medical checkups. If you have a recurring or chronic heart condition, regularly check in with your doctor to make sure you're properly managing your heart condition.   Preparing for your appointment Some types of heart disease will be discovered without an appointment — for example, if a child is born with a serious heart defect, it will be detected soon after birth. In other cases, your heart disease may be diagnosed in an emergency situation, such as a heart attack.  If you think you have heart disease or are worried about your heart disease risk because of your family history, see your family doctor. You may be referred to a heart specialist (cardiologist).  Here's some information to help you prepare for your appointment.  What you can do  Be aware of pre-appointment restrictions. When you make the appointment, ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as restrict your diet. You may need to fast before a cholesterol test, for example.  Write down symptoms you're experiencing, including any that seem unrelated to heart disease.  Write down key personal information — including a family history of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure or diabetes — and major stresses or recent life changes.  Make a list of medications, vitamins or supplements you're taking.  Take someone along, if possible. Someone who accompanies you can help you remember information you're given.  Be prepared to discuss your diet and your smoking and exercise habits. If you don't already follow a diet or exercise routine, talk to your doctor about getting started.  Write down questions to ask your doctor.   For heart disease, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:   What is likely causing my symptoms or condition?  What are other possible causes for my symptoms or condition?  What tests will I need?  What's the best treatment?  What foods should I eat or avoid?  What's an appropriate level of physical activity?  How often should I be screened for heart disease? For example, how often do I need a cholesterol test?  What are alternatives to the primary approach you're suggesting?  I have other health conditions. How do I manage them together?  Are there restrictions that I need to follow?  Should I see a specialist?  Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?  Are there brochures or other materials that I can have? What websites do you recommend?   Don't hesitate to ask other questions.  What to expect from your doctor Your doctor is likely to ask you questions, such as:   When did your symptoms begin?  Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?  How severe are your symptoms?  What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?  What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?  Do you have a family history of heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure or other serious illness?   What you can do in the meantime It's never too early to make healthy lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, eating healthy foods and becoming more physically active. These are primary lines of defense against heart disease and its complications.

Las enfermedades clasificadas como enfermedades cardíacas comprenden enfermedades de los vasos sanguíneos, como enfermedad de las arterias coronarias, problemas con el ritmo cardíaco (arritmias) y defectos cardíacos con los que has nacido (defectos cardíacos congénitos), entre otros.  El término «enfermedad cardíaca» se usa a menudo de manera indistinta al término «enfermedad cardiovascular». «Enfermedad cardiovascular» a menudo hace referencia a enfermedades que implican un estrechamiento o bloqueo de los vasos sanguíneos que puede provocar un ataque cardíaco, dolor en el pecho (angina de pecho) o accidente cerebrovascular. Otras enfermedades cardíacas, como aquellas que afectan los músculos, las válvulas o el ritmo cardíacos, también se consideran formas de enfermedad cardíaca.  Muchas formas de enfermedad cardíaca pueden prevenirse o tratarse con elecciones de un estilo de vida saludable.  Atención de la enfermedad cardíaca en Mayo Clinic      Síntomas Los síntomas de la enfermedad cardíaca dependen del tipo de enfermedad cardíaca que tengas.  Síntomas de la enfermedad cardíaca en los vasos sanguíneos (enfermedad aterosclerótica)  Los síntomas de la enfermedad cardiovascular suelen ser diferentes en hombres y en mujeres. Por ejemplo, los hombres son más propensos a tener dolor en el pecho; en cambio, las mujeres son más propensas a tener otros síntomas además de las molestias en el pecho, como dificultad para respirar, náuseas y fatiga extrema.  Los síntomas comprenden los siguientes:   Dolor, opresión, presión y molestias en el pecho (angina de pecho)  Dificultad para respirar  Dolor, entumecimiento, debilidad o frío en las piernas o los brazos si los vasos sanguíneos en esas partes del cuerpo están estrechados  Dolor en el cuello, la mandíbula, la garganta, la parte superior del abdomen o la espalda   Es posible que no te diagnostiquen enfermedad cardiovascular hasta que tengas un ataque cardíaco, angina de pecho, un accidente cerebrovascular o insuficiencia cardíaca. Es importante prestar atención a los síntomas cardiovasculares y hablar con el médico sobre las dudas que tengas. A veces, las enfermedades cardiovasculares pueden detectarse de forma temprana con evaluaciones periódicas.  Síntomas de la enfermedad cardíaca provocados por latidos del corazón anormales (arritmias cardíacas)  Una arritmia cardíaca es un latido del corazón anormal. El corazón puede latir muy rápido, muy despacio o de manera irregular. Los síntomas de arritmia cardíaca comprenden los siguientes:   Agitación en el pecho  Aceleraciones en los latidos del corazón (taquicardia)  Latidos del corazón lentos (bradicardia)  Dolor o molestia en el pecho  Dificultad para respirar  Aturdimiento  Mareos  Desmayo (síncope) o desvanecimiento   Síntomas de la enfermedad cardíaca provocados por defectos cardíacos  Los defectos cardíacos congénitos graves (defectos con los que naces) suelen manifestarse poco después del nacimiento. Los síntomas de defectos cardíacos en los niños comprenden los siguientes:   Color gris pálido o azul en la piel (cianosis)  Hinchazón en las piernas, el abdomen y la zona alrededor de los ojos  En el bebé, dificultad para respirar durante la alimentación, lo que hace que aumente poco de peso   Los defectos cardíacos menos graves a menudo no se diagnostican hasta más adelante en la infancia o durante la adultez. Los signos y síntomas de los defectos cardíacos congénitos que no suelen poner en riesgo la vida de manera inmediata comprenden los siguientes:   Tendencia a respirar con dificultad al hacer ejercicio o actividad  Tendencia a cansarse al hacer ejercicio o actividad  Hinchazón en las manos, los tobillos o los pies   Síntomas de la enfermedad cardíaca provocados por el debilitamiento del músculo cardíaco (cardiomiopatía dilatada)  En la fase temprana de la cardiomiopatía, es posible que no tengas síntomas. A medida que la enfermedad empeora, los síntomas pueden comprender los siguientes:   Dificultad para respirar al hacer esfuerzo físico o en reposo  Hinchazón de las piernas, los tobillos y los pies  Fatiga  Latidos del corazón irregulares que se sienten rápidos, agitados o con palpitaciones  Mareos, aturdimiento o desmayos   Síntomas de la enfermedad cardíaca provocados por infecciones cardíacas  La endocarditis es una infección que afecta la membrana interna que separa las cavidades y las válvulas del corazón (endocardio). Los síntomas de la infección cardíaca pueden ser los siguientes:   Fiebre  Dificultad para respirar  Debilidad o fatiga  Hinchazón en las piernas o en el abdomen  Cambios en el ritmo cardíaco  Tos persistente o seca  Erupciones cutáneas o manchas poco frecuentes   Síntomas de la enfermedad cardíaca provocados por enfermedad cardíaca valvular  El corazón tiene cuatro válvulas: la aórtica, la mitral, la pulmonar y la tricúspide, que se abren y se cierran para dirigir el flujo sanguíneo a través del corazón. Varios factores pueden dañar las válvulas y provocar un estrechamiento (estenosis), una pérdida (insuficiencia) o un cierre incorrecto (prolapso).  Según cuál sea la válvula que no funciona correctamente, los síntomas de la enfermedad de las válvulas cardíacas comprenden los siguientes:   Fatiga  Dificultad para respirar  Latidos del corazón irregulares  Pies o tobillos hinchados  Dolor en el pecho  Desmayo (síncope)   Cuándo consultar al médico  Busca atención médica de urgencia si tienes los siguientes síntomas de enfermedad cardíaca:   Dolor en el pecho  Dificultad para respirar  Desmayo   Las enfermedades cardíacas son más fáciles de tratar cuando se detectan temprano, así que habla con el médico acerca de tus dudas sobre la salud del corazón. Si te preocupa la enfermedad cardíaca, consulta con el médico acerca de las medidas que puedes tomar para reducir el riesgo de padecer esta enfermedad del corazón. Esto es especialmente importante si tienes antecedentes familiares de enfermedad cardíaca.  Si crees que puedes tener una enfermedad cardíaca (porque tienes nuevos signos o síntomas), pide una consulta con el médico.  Solicite una Consulta en Mayo Clinic  Causas    Cámaras y válvulas del corazón Cámaras y válvulas del corazón Un corazón normal tiene dos cámaras superiores y dos cámaras inferiores. Las cámaras superiores, la aurícula derecha e izquierda, reciben la sangre. Las cámaras inferiores, los ventrículos derecho e izquierdo más musculares, bombean la sangre del corazón. Las válvulas cardíacas, que mantienen el flujo sanguíneo en la dirección adecuada, son puertas en las aperturas de las cámaras.     Cómo funciona el corazón  El corazón es una bomba. Se trata de un órgano muscular del tamaño aproximado de un puño, que se ubica levemente hacia la izquierda del centro del pecho. El corazón está dividido en un lado izquierdo y en un lado derecho. La división evita que la sangre rica en oxígeno se mezcle con la sangre con poco oxígeno. La sangre con poco oxígeno regresa al corazón después de haber circulado por el cuerpo.   El lado derecho del corazón, que se compone de la aurícula y el ventrículo derechos, recolecta e impulsa la sangre hacia los pulmones por medio de las arterias pulmonares.  Los pulmones renuevan la sangre con una nueva carga de oxígeno. Además, los pulmones exhalan el dióxido de carbono de desecho.  La sangre rica en oxígeno ingresa en el lado izquierdo del corazón, que se compone de la aurícula y el ventrículo izquierdos.  El lado izquierdo del corazón bombea la sangre a través de la aorta para suministrar oxígeno y nutrientes a los tejidos del cuerpo.   Válvulas cardíacas  Existen cuatro válvulas cardíacas que aseguran que la sangre circule en la dirección correcta, al abrirse solo en un sentido y únicamente cuando es necesario. Para funcionar como corresponde, la válvula debe estar formada adecuadamente, debe abrirse por completo y debe cerrarse con firmeza para que no se produzcan pérdidas. Las cuatro válvulas son las siguientes:   Tricúspide  Mitral  Pulmonar  Aórtica   Los latidos del corazón  El corazón se contrae y se relaja en un ciclo continuo.   Durante la contracción (sístole), los ventrículos se contraen e impulsan la sangre hacia los vasos que llegan a los pulmones y al resto del cuerpo.  Durante la relajación (diástole), los ventrículos se llenan de la sangre proveniente de las cavidades superiores (aurículas izquierda y derecha).   Sistema eléctrico  El sistema eléctrico del corazón es lo que lo hace latir y controla el intercambio continuo de la sangre rica en oxígeno con la sangre con poco oxígeno. Este intercambio es lo que te mantiene con vida.   Los impulsos eléctricos comienzan arriba en la aurícula derecha y se desplazan por medio de canales específicos hacia los ventrículos, dándole al corazón la señal de bombear.  El sistema de conducción mantiene el corazón latiendo a un ritmo normal y coordinado, que es lo que hace circular la sangre.   Distintas causas de enfermedades cardíacas  Las causas de las enfermedades cardíacas pueden variar según el tipo de enfermedad cardíaca.  Causas de la enfermedad cardiovascular  Si bien la expresión «enfermedad cardiovascular» puede referirse a distintos problemas cardíacos o vasculares, con frecuencia, el término se utiliza para indicar el daño al corazón o a los vasos sanguíneos provocado por la ateroesclerosis, que es la acumulación de placas de grasa en las arterias. La acumulación de placas engrosa y endurece las paredes de las arterias, lo que puede impedir el flujo de sangre de las arterias hacia los órganos y tejidos.  La ateroesclerosis es la causa más frecuente de enfermedad cardiovascular. Puede originarse en problemas que pueden corregirse, como una dieta no saludable, la falta de ejercicio, el sobrepeso y el tabaquismo.     Desarrollo de aterosclerosis Desarrollo de aterosclerosis La ateroesclerosis es un proceso en el cual la sangre, las grasas, como el colesterol, y otras sustancias se acumulan en las paredes de las arterias. Con el tiempo, se forman depósitos denominados «placas». Los depósitos pueden estrechar o bloquear las arterias. Estas placas también se pueden romper y provocar coágulos sanguíneos.     Causas de las arritmias cardíacas  Las causas más frecuentes del ritmo cardíaco anormal (arritmia) o de las enfermedades que pueden producir arritmia son las siguientes:   Defectos cardíacos de nacimiento (defectos cardíacos congénitos)  Enfermedad de las arterias coronarias  Presión arterial alta  Diabetes  Tabaquismo  Consumo excesivo de alcohol o de cafeína  Abuso de drogas  Estrés  Ciertos medicamentos recetados y de venta libre, suplementos dietéticos y remedios a base de hierbas  Enfermedad de las válvulas cardíacas   En personas sanas con un corazón normal y sano, no es frecuente que se produzca una arritmia mortal sin que exista un desencadenante externo, como un choque eléctrico o el consumo de drogas ilegales. Esto ocurre, principalmente, porque el corazón de una persona sana no presenta anomalías que puedan provocar una arritmia, como puede ser una zona de tejido cicatrizado.  Sin embargo, en un corazón enfermo o con malformaciones, los impulsos eléctricos del corazón pueden no empezar o no desplazarse adecuadamente a través del corazón, lo que aumenta las probabilidades de que se produzca una arritmia.  Causas de los defectos cardíacos congénitos  Por lo general, los defectos cardíacos congénitos se forman cuando el bebé está en el útero. Los defectos cardíacos se desarrollan cuando se desarrolla el corazón, esto es, aproximadamente, un mes después de la concepción, y alteran el flujo de sangre en el corazón. Ciertas enfermedades, algunos medicamentos y los genes pueden incidir sobre el desarrollo de defectos cardíacos.  Los defectos cardíacos también pueden presentarse en adultos. A medida que envejeces, la estructura del corazón puede modificarse y provocar un defecto cardíaco.  Causas de cardiomiopatía  Las causas de la cardiomiopatía, que es un engrosamiento o alargamiento del músculo cardíaco, pueden variar según el tipo:   Cardiomiopatía dilatada. La causa de este tipo de cardiomiopatía, que es el más frecuente, por lo general, no puede identificarse. Puede originarse debido a la reducción del flujo sanguíneo al corazón (enfermedad cardíaca isquémica), provocado por el daño que se produce después de un ataque cardíaco y de infecciones, así como por la acción de toxinas y de ciertos medicamentos. También puede heredarse de un padre. Por lo general, produce el agrandamiento (dilatación) del ventrículo izquierdo.  Cardiomiopatía hipertrófica. Este tipo, en el que el músculo del corazón se torna más grueso de lo normal, por lo general, es hereditario. Además, puede manifestarse con el tiempo a causa de la presión arterial alta o de la edad.  Cardiomiopatía restrictiva. Este tipo menos frecuente de cardiomiopatía, que hace que el músculo cardíaco se torne rígido y menos elástico, puede aparecer sin motivos conocidos. También puede producirse a causa de otras enfermedades, como los trastornos del tejido conjuntivo, la acumulación excesiva de hierro en el organismo (hemocromatosis), la acumulación de proteínas anormales (amiloidosis) o algunos tratamientos oncológicos.   Causas de infecciones cardíacas  Una infección cardíaca, como la endocarditis, se produce cuando un irritante, como las bacterias, los virus o las sustancias químicas, llega al músculo cardíaco. Las causas de infecciones cardíacas más frecuentes son las siguientes:   Bacterias  Virus  Parásitos   Causas de la enfermedad de las válvulas cardíacas  Existen distintas causas que provocan la enfermedad de las válvulas cardíacas. La enfermedad valvular puede ser congénita o bien ser consecuencia del daño producido por enfermedades como las siguientes:   Fiebre reumática  Infección (endocarditis infecciosa)  Trastornos del tejido conjuntivo   Factores de riesgo Los factores de riesgo para desarrollar una enfermedad cardíaca comprenden los siguientes:   Edad. El envejecimiento aumenta el riesgo de que las arterias se dañen y se estrechen, y de que el músculo cardíaco se debilite o engrose.  Sexo. En general, los hombres corren mayor riesgo de padecer enfermedades cardíacas. Sin embargo, el riesgo para las mujeres aumenta después de la menopausia.  Antecedentes familiares. Los antecedentes familiares de enfermedades cardíacas aumentan tu riesgo de padecer enfermedad de las arterias coronarias, especialmente, si uno de tus padres la desarrolló a temprana edad (antes de los 55 años para un familiar hombre, como tu hermano o tu padre, y antes de los 65 años para una familiar mujer, como tu madre o hermana).  Fumar. La nicotina contrae los vasos sanguíneos, y el monóxido de carbono puede dañar su revestimiento interno, lo que los vuelve más propensos a la ateroesclerosis. Los ataques cardíacos son más frecuentes en fumadores que en no fumadores.  Mala alimentación. Una dieta con alto contenido de grasas, azúcar y colesterol puede contribuir al desarrollo de la enfermedad cardíaca.  Presión arterial alta. La presión arterial alta no controlada puede producir el endurecimiento y el engrosamiento de las arterias, lo que estrecha los vasos por los que circula la sangre.  Niveles altos de colesterol en sangre. Los niveles altos de colesterol en sangre pueden aumentar el riesgo de que se formen placas y de ateroesclerosis.  Diabetes. La diabetes aumenta el riesgo de enfermedades cardíacas. Ambos trastornos comparten factores de riesgo similares, como obesidad y presión arterial alta. Obesidad. El exceso de peso normalmente empeora otros factores de riesgo.  Falta de actividad física. La falta de ejercicio también está asociada con muchas formas de enfermedad cardíaca y con algunos de sus otros factores de riesgo.  Estrés. El estrés sin tratar puede dañar las arterias y empeorar otros factores de riesgo de enfermedades cardíacas.  Higiene deficiente. No lavarte las manos de forma regular y no generar otros hábitos que pueden ayudarte a prevenir las infecciones víricas o bacterianas puede ponerte en riesgo de contraer infecciones cardíacas, especialmente, si ya tienes una enfermedad cardíaca no diagnosticada. La higiene dental deficiente también puede contribuir a las enfermedades cardíacas.   Complicaciones Las complicaciones de la enfermedad cardíaca comprenden las siguientes:   Insuficiencia cardíaca. La insuficiencia cardíaca, una de las complicaciones más frecuentes de la enfermedad cardíaca, se produce cuando el corazón no puede bombear sangre suficiente para satisfacer las necesidades del organismo. La insuficiencia cardíaca puede deberse a muchas formas de enfermedades cardíacas, entre ellas, defectos cardíacos, enfermedad cardiovascular, enfermedad cardíaca valvular, infecciones cardíacas o cardiomiopatía.  Ataque cardíaco. Un coágulo sanguíneo que bloquea el flujo de sangre a través de un vaso sanguíneo que irriga al corazón provoca un ataque cardíaco, lo que posiblemente daña o destruye una parte del músculo cardíaco. La ateroesclerosis puede provocar un ataque cardíaco.  Accidente cerebrovascular. Los factores de riesgo que provocan la enfermedad cardiovascular también pueden provocar un accidente cerebrovascular isquémico, que sucede cuando las arterias que se dirigen al cerebro están estrechadas u obstruidas, por lo que es muy poca la sangre que llega al cerebro. Un accidente cerebrovascular es una urgencia médica: a los pocos minutos el tejido cerebral comienza a morir.  Aneurisma. Un aneurisma (complicación grave que puede ocurrir en cualquier parte del cuerpo) es una protuberancia en la pared de la arteria. Si se rompe un aneurisma, es posible que haya sangrado interno que ponga en riesgo la vida.  Enfermedad arterial periférica. La ateroesclerosis también puede provocar enfermedad arterial periférica. Cuando padeces enfermedad arterial periférica, las extremidades (generalmente las piernas) no reciben un flujo sanguíneo suficiente. Esto provoca síntomas, especialmente dolor en la pierna al caminar (claudicación).  Paro cardíaco repentino. El paro cardíaco repentino es la pérdida súbita e inesperada de la función cardíaca, la respiración y el conocimiento, a menudo a causa de una arritmia. Un paro cardíaco repentino es una emergencia médica. Si no se trata de inmediato, es mortal; provoca la muerte súbita por ataque cardíaco.   Prevención Ciertas enfermedades del corazón, como los defectos cardíacos, no pueden prevenirse. Sin embargo, puedes ayudar a prevenir muchas otras enfermedades cardíacas haciendo los mismos cambios de estilo de vida que pueden mejorar la enfermedad cardíaca que tienes, tales como:   Dejar de fumar  Controlar otras enfermedades, como la presión arterial alta o el colesterol alto y la diabetes  Hacer ejercicio por lo menos 30 minutos diarios la mayoría de los días de la semana  Seguir una dieta baja en sal y grasas saturadas  Mantener un peso saludable  Reducir y controlar el estrés  Practicar buenos hábitos de higiene   by Escrito por personal de Mayo Clinic    Enfermedad cardíaca care at Mayo Clinic   Solicite una Consulta en Mayo Clinic  Diagnóstico y tratamiento  Feb. 23, 2018    Comparte en:    References  What is cardiovascular disease?

First study of blacks and whites reveals much higher risk over lifetime        January 24, 2012
					
						 | By Marla Paul         CHICAGO --- Will you have a heart attack or a stroke in your lifetime? Your odds may be worse than you think.  Men and women may have a false sense of security about their chances of having a heart attack or stroke based on the current practice of calculating a patient’s risk 10 years into the future. New Northwestern Medicine research shows a young or middle-aged adult who is at low risk in the short term may be at very high risk in the long term -- if he or she has just one or two risk factors such as higher than optimal cholesterol or blood pressure levels.  This is the first study to examine the lifetime risk of heart disease in white and black men and women. Previous studies have been in whites and predominantly males. It’s also the first study to look at the entire adult age spectrum. The research also looked at the risk across multiple birth cohorts and found the effect of the risk factors remained consistent regardless of the decade in which a person was born.  The study is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Part of the Cardiovascular Lifetime Risk Pooling Project, the research tracks more than 250,000 participants from 18 different groups of people living in the community over a period of more than 50 years. The patients’ risk factors for cardiovascular disease -- blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status and diabetes status -- were measured at ages 45, 55, 65 and 75 years for each participant.  “We are giving incomplete and misleading risk information if we only focus on the next 10 years of someone’s life,” said principal investigator Donald Lloyd-Jones, MD, chair and associate professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. “With even just one risk factor, the likelihood is very large that someone will develop a major cardiovascular event that will kill them or substantially diminish their quality of life or health.”  The risk-factor profile was considered optimal when a participant had a total cholesterol level of less than 180 milligrams per deciliter and untreated blood pressure of less than 120 over less than 80, was a nonsmoker and did not have diabetes.  The new research on long-term risk may be important in estimating the future burden of cardiovascular disease in the general population, Lloyd-Jones noted.  Some key findings of the study:  Men who are 45 years old and have all risk factors at optimal levels have a 1.4 percent risk of having a heart attack or stroke or other form of death from heart disease while having two or more risk factors hike the risk to 49.5 percent.  For 45-year-old women with all risk factors being optimal, the chance of having a heart attack or stroke in their lifetimes is 4.1 percent while having two or more risk factors boost it to 30.7 percent.  “Just even one small increase in risk, from all optimal risk factors to one that isn’t optimal, like slightly elevated cholesterol or blood pressure, significantly bumps up a person’s lifetime risk,” Lloyd-Jones said. (Non-optimal means a person doesn’t have diabetes and doesn’t smoke but either cholesterol is 180 to 199 or blood pressure is 120 to 130 on top or 80 to 89 on the bottom. These numbers aren’t at levels that need to be treated with medication, but they are still higher than desired.)  Women have a higher risk than men for a stroke over their lifetimes but a lower risk for a heart attack.  African-Americans have higher risk factors such as more hypertension and diabetes than whites, but because they also tend to die at younger ages, their lifetime risk of having a heart attack or stroke ends up being the same as whites.  “This study underscores the importance of lifestyle -- particularly diet, exercise and smoking cessation -- all the lifestyle patterns that are important in reducing the development of the risk factors in the first place,” said Jarett Berry, MD, who worked on the study when he was at Northwestern’s Feinberg School and is now assistant professor of medicine at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.  “We need to do a much better job of making sure these risk factors don’t develop in the first place, getting kids and young adults off to better starts so they don’t gain weight and are following healthier lifestyles throughout their lives,” Lloyd-Jones said.  Lloyd-Jones pointed out that maintaining the full package of optimal risk factors through middle age had a dramatic effect on the remainder of a person’s life. “It appears that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts,” he said.  The research was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

Lead writer: Chris Woolston  February 29, 2016       Each year heart attacks kill more than 150,000 Americans, nearly half of them women. If such a grim statistic can have a bright side, it's this: Most heart attacks today aren't fatal.  About 75% of men and 60% of women live at least one year after an attack. Who is most at risk? While most heart attack victims are middle-aged or olderthe average age for a first attack is 66 for men and 70 for womenpeople in their 20s and 30s suffer attacks too. The risk of a heart attack climbs for men after age 45 and for women after age 55. When do heart attacks strike? Heart attacks occur roughly every 35 seconds in the United States, and most occur in the morning, a time when the platelets in the blood are especially "sticky" and prone to form clots. Early Warning Signs Heart attack symptoms can be subtle Watch video More on heart attack "I Stopped My Diabetes Meds and Had a Heart Attack" 10 Risk Factors for Heart Disease      At least one study, however, has found that morning isn't a prime time for heart attacks among people who regularly take aspirin, which helps keep platelets from sticking together. Beating the odds Survival odds for people who have had a heart attack keep getting better thanks to advances in diagnosis, medication, and lifesaving technology. It's worth noting that survival rates for heart attack patients are better on weekdays compared to weekends, because medical personnel are more likely to use invasive procedures (including angioplasty and bypass surgery) during the week. Nonetheless, cardiologists are optimistic about the rate of improvement in cardiac care. When Sharonne Hayes, MD, director of the Mayo Clinic's Women's Heart Clinic, started practicing in the mid-1980s, doctors couldn't do much for people having heart attacks. "Now we can stop a heart attack in its tracks," she says. "Patients have a much better chance at recovery."

  having a heart attack or stroke promises a 'wake-up call' to shock Britons 
  into changing lifestyles            A man holds his chest as he suffers from a heart attack (posed by model)  Photo: Alamy                  By Laura Donnelly , Health Editor   10:00PM GMT 08 Mar 2015   Follow        The NHS has launched a controversial calculator which predicts when you will have a heart attack or stroke - and compares a person’s “heart age” with their biological age. Health experts said the online tool would give individuals “a wake-up call” - pushing those at risk of heart disease into making lifestyle changes to protect themselves from the UK’s biggest killer. But some critics raised concerns about the accuracy of a “blunt tool” which tells every Briton they will have a heart attack or stroke one day, when many will not, and raised fears that the tool could be used to push millions more people into taking medication. They also expressed concern that individuals would be frightened by being given a prediction, much of which is based on factors beyond their control, such as their family history of disease. Last month a study found that some of the most widely-used risk calculators in use in the United States were exaggerating the risks of heart disease, by more than double. GPs will be asked to promote the new NHS calculator, in a bid to encourage patients to take steps to improve their health - such as losing weight, or giving up smoking – or to start taking medication to lower cholesterol and statins. The tool, which has launched online, asks individuals to provide basic facts – such as age height, weight, smoking – plus some details of their medical history, and whether relatives have suffered from heart disease before the age of 60.  Click here to take the test on a mobile   Experts behind the tool say it is most accurate if individuals can also provide readings of cholesterol and blood pressure levels. The calculator then provides an estimate of a person’s “heart age” – and most controversially, predicts when they will suffer a heart attack or stroke. It also provides the percentage chance of a heart attack or stroke within a decade. It means a woman of 41, with an unhealthy lifestyle, medical problems such as diabetes, and a family history of heart disease could be warned that she is likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke around the age of 51. Another woman the same age, with a different lifestyle and family history could be told she is likely to get to the age of 83 before being consigned to such a fate. A man of 50 who smokes, suffers a number of medical problems and a family history of heart disease, could be he told he is likely to have a heart attack or stroke at 56. A healthier man of the same age, with a different family history could expect to live to 79 without a heart attack or stroke, according to the calculator, which provides estimates to anyone over the age of 30. The calculator is a collaboration between NHS Choices, Public Health England and the British Heart Foundation (BHF). Professor John Deanfield, an NHS cardiologist who helped develop the tool, said: “Understanding your heart age can be a real wake up call for people who might be at risk. It can be that all important nudge to take action and make lifestyle changes to improve your heart health.” Dr Aseem Malhotra, Honorary consultant cardiologist, at Frimley Park Hospital, was far more cautious. He said: “It is important to help identify those at risk of heart disease, but I really hope this has been properly evaluated; we don’t want to make the same mistakes we have seen in the US, where calculators enormously exaggerated the risks.” He also raised concerns about whether the information would be used to scare millions more people into taking statins, amid heated arguments about the benefits and risks of the drugs. Last July, health watchdogs recommended that statins should be offered to around 17 million people – anyone estimated to have a 10 per cent chance of developing heart disease within a decade.   The tool provides the percentage chance of a heart attack or stroke within a decade (Getty)  Some doctors criticised the plans, fearing that the “mass medicalisation” of the public would put too many at risk of side-effects. Dr Malhotra said he was concerned that the new NHS tool does not take account of basic lifestyle factors – such as the type of diet people ate, and how much exercise they took. “It is a pretty crude evaluation to only use weight as a proxy for lifestyle,” he said. Coronary heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the UK and in 2013, more than 18,000 people died prematurely this way. Most deaths from coronary heart disease are caused by heart attacks with an average of 90,000 attacks in England per year. Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, said: “Too many people are dying prematurely from preventable conditions and there is clear evidence that factors like smoking and high blood pressure play a major role in this.” He said the heart age tool helped people to see the “direct impact” that lifestyle changes could make on their heart’s health. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: “Knowing your risk of developing heart and circulatory disease is crucial to taking control of your health. Armed with this knowledge you can start to make lifestyle changes to help protect yourself against heart attacks and strokes.” The NHS is also developing a similar system of dementia screening , which aims to give middle-aged people their “brain age” and an estimate of how likely they are to develop conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.        telegraph.co.uk     Follow @telegraph                          Top news galleries       Woody Allen's 30 best one-liners          Comedy    Martin Chilton selects 30 great one-liners from the comedian and film

Save Everyday Health   Heart Health   Heart Health  The Single Best Predictor of a Heart Attack Previous Next   Each year close to 1.4 million Americans experience a heart attack , and more than 500,000 die from it. Strikingly, according to the Society for Heart Attack Prevention and Eradication, 50 to 70 percent of those who suffered fatal heart attacks were not even aware of their risk. Despite recent scientific advances in heart disease prevention, many high-risk patients are overlooked when conventional risk assessment methods such as cholesterol and blood pressure screenings are used alone. Here’s what you need to know about the No. 1 predictor of a heart attack, the calcium score, plus eight other risk factors to consider.   The Calcium Score A calcium score , obtained from a noninvasive computed tomography (CT) scan of your heart, is the measure of the amount of calcium in your coronary arteries. This number reflects the total amount of atherosclerotic plaque. It’s an indication of how all of your risk factors interact with each other to cause heart disease. The higher your calcium score for your age, the greater your risk of a heart attack or stroke. Many preventive cardiologists are recommending that asymptomatic men over age 40 and most postmenopausal women over age 50 have a heart scan to determine their calcium score, unless they have been determined by a doctor to be at very low risk. A calcium score of zero means you have no calcium deposits and a low risk of heart attack in the next five years. A score of 400 or more puts you at high risk of a heart attack within 10 years; a score of 1,000-plus means you have up to a 25 percent chance of having a heart attack within a year without medical treatment. The significance of a given score also depends on your age. For instance, if you’re 40 and have a score of 50, it indicates you are at high risk. If an 80-year-old has a score of 50, it indicates low risk because the atherosclerotic process has proceeded very slowly. If your score is high for your age, then your doctor may advise adopting a heart-healthy diet, such as the South Beach Diet, along with other lifestyle changes, and often medications, to improve your risk profile. It may be a statin to lower cholesterol and/or a medication to lower your blood pressure. You can get a CT scan for coronary calcium at most major medical centers, with the cost ranging from $99 to $399. The test takes about 10 minutes and radiation is minimal, about the same as a mammogram. Check with your insurance carrier to see if this test is covered.   Family History of Heart Disease If one or both of your parents died prematurely of a heart attack, it puts you at greater risk. Still, there are other factors to consider when it comes to family history . If your father smoked, rarely exercised, and ate a diet high in bad carbs and bad fats, his death could have been hastened by any or all of those factors. You may have been dealt a bad set of genes, but there’s a great deal you can do when it comes to lifestyle to reduce and even eliminate the familial risk. Often, medications are also needed to overcome the effect of bad genes. While, many people know the cardiovascular health of their parents influences their level of risk, they are unaware that the health of their siblings matters, too. If you have a brother or sister with cardiovascular disease, your own risk is increased by as much as 100 percent. In fact, if you grew up in the same household as your sibling, your sibling’s medical history is likely to be even more informative than your parents’. You and your brothers and sisters not only have similar genes, but you also ate similar food and grew up in the same environment.   Smoking and Heart Disease Risk At any age, smoking at least doubles your risk of heart disease. In fact, smoking can trigger a heart attack even if your arteries are nearly perfect. Once you light up, smoking narrows your arteries, raises your blood pressure, increases your risk of irregular heartbeat, and makes your blood sticky and more likely to clot. Smoking also lowers your HDL (“good”) cholesterol and increases arterial inflammation. This is the perfect recipe for a heart attack. If you smoke, and particularly if you have other risk factors for heart disease, each time you light a cigarette, you’re playing Russian roulette with your heart. A smoker who has high blood pressure and high LDL (“bad”) cholesterol has 14 times the normal risk of having cardiovascular disease. A woman who takes birth control pills (which increase the risk of blood clots) and who also smokes has a much greater risk of heart disease than does a woman who takes birth control pills but does not smoke. In young people with heart attacks, smoking is often the biggest culprit.   Diagnosis of Diabetes or Prediabetes If you are an American age 40 to 70, the odds are about 40 percent that you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes or prediabetes (also known as metabolic syndrome and typically characterized by increased waist circumference, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low good HDL cholesterol, and a mildly elevated blood sugar). Diabetes is such a strong risk factor for heart disease that medical professionals define it as a “coronary heart disease risk equivalent.” This means that a person with diabetes has the same high risk of a heart attack as someone who has already had one. Up to 70 percent of people in coronary care units have prediabetes or diabetes. Women, take note: If you have diabetes and have suffered a heart attack, you have an even greater risk of having another heart attack or heart failure than a man who has diabetes and has suffered a heart attack.   Waist Circumference and Your Heart The circumference of your waist is an indicator of your odds of having a heart attack or stroke. If you have an apple-shaped body and carry much of your weight around your middle, you are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease than if you have a pear-shaped body and store fat mainly in your buttocks and thighs, or evenly over your entire body. Studies have found that waist circumference is an excellent predictor of who will develop diabetes and heart disease. A waist circumference of more than 35 inches if you’re a women (and 40 inches if you’re a man) puts you at risk. Get rid of that extra belly fat through diet and exercise.   High Blood Pressure About one in three American adults has high blood pressure , also called hypertension. High blood pressure is currently defined as a reading of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, but guidelines regarding what constitutes “high” versus “normal” keep changing. Right now, blood pressure anywhere between 120/80 (normal) and 139/89 are labeled prehypertension. The American Heart Association estimates that 65 million Americans are in this category. It also estimates that people with prehypertension may be three times as likely to have a heart attack as those with normal blood pressure. Although blood pressure can vary from minute to minute with exercise, stress, sleep, and even changes in posture when at rest and relaxed, it should normally be less than 120/80 mm Hg for both men and women age 20 and older.   Cholesterol and Your Heart Total cholesterol, when considered alone, is a poor predictor of heart disease and heart attack. Studies show that total cholesterol levels among people who’ve had heart attacks are almost the same as those of people who haven’t, and that roughly half of heart attacks occur in people without high cholesterol . If you have other risk factors for heart disease, particularly a family history, having your HDL and LDL particle size measured with an advanced blood test will give you a far clearer picture of your heart risk than the conventional lipid panel. Having a lot of large particles cuts your risk for a heart attack, while having a lot of small ones raises it. You do not want more than 15 percent of your particles to be the small, dense type.   Triglycerides and Your Heart Triglycerides are the form in which fat is stored in your body’s fat cells. Your triglyceride level is almost always strongly influenced by lifestyle. If you have high triglycerides (over 150 mg/dL is borderline high) and low HDL (less than 40 mg/dL if you’re a man and less than 50 mg/dL if you’re a woman), your risk of heart disease is compounded. To find out if you have this added risk, divide your triglyceride count by your HDL count. Ideally, the resulting number will be 2 or lower. For example, if your triglyceride level is 200 and your HDL is 40, divide 200 by 40 and you get 5. This is much higher than the desirable ratio, and it tells you that you have a heightened risk of a heart attack that will need to be addressed. Your triglyceride level can also offer insight into your LDL particle size. In general, the higher your triglycerides and the lower your HDL, the smaller and denser your LDL and the greater your risk of heart disease. If your triglycerides are higher than 200 and your HDL is lower than 45, it is likely that you have too many small, dense LDL particles.   A Sedentary Lifestyle and Your Heart A life with little to no physical activity leads to a number of undesirable body changes. Your blood pressure goes up, your triglycerides increase, your level of good HDL falls (this is why triglycerides and HDL are often called the “lifestyle” numbers), and you are more likely to gain weight, especially around your midsection. This is a picture of a heart attack in the making. No wonder the AARP recently called sitting the new smoking. The sad news is that two-thirds of American adults report that they are physically inactive — that is, they are sedentary most of the time. It’s time to get up and get moving .   What You Can Do to Improve Your Heart Disease Risk Factors Beyond understanding your risk factors, getting the correct tests, and taking medications as prescribed, the most important step you can take to minimize your risk of heart attack and sudden death is to engage in a healthy lifestyle. That means shedding any extra pounds by adopting a heart-healthy diet, like the South Beach Diet, that focuses on nutrient-dense, fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, in addition to good fats and lean protein. It means making time for at least 20 minutes of aerobic or core-strengthening exercise most days of the week . And it means getting plenty of restorative sleep. Not only will these three steps help you lose weight and keep it off (yes, lack of sleep promotes weight gain), they will also help lower your blood pressure, improve insulin resistance in those with prediabetes and diabetes, and counter most of the other risk factors you’ve just read about. It’s an encouraging fact: The earlier you start making these healthy lifestyle changes, the better your chances of avoiding a heart attack down the road.

First study of blacks and whites reveals much higher risk over lifetime        January 24, 2012
					
						 | By Marla Paul         CHICAGO --- Will you have a heart attack or a stroke in your lifetime? Your odds may be worse than you think.  Men and women may have a false sense of security about their chances of having a heart attack or stroke based on the current practice of calculating a patient’s risk 10 years into the future. New Northwestern Medicine research shows a young or middle-aged adult who is at low risk in the short term may be at very high risk in the long term -- if he or she has just one or two risk factors such as higher than optimal cholesterol or blood pressure levels.  This is the first study to examine the lifetime risk of heart disease in white and black men and women. Previous studies have been in whites and predominantly males. It’s also the first study to look at the entire adult age spectrum. The research also looked at the risk across multiple birth cohorts and found the effect of the risk factors remained consistent regardless of the decade in which a person was born.  The study is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Part of the Cardiovascular Lifetime Risk Pooling Project, the research tracks more than 250,000 participants from 18 different groups of people living in the community over a period of more than 50 years. The patients’ risk factors for cardiovascular disease -- blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status and diabetes status -- were measured at ages 45, 55, 65 and 75 years for each participant.  “We are giving incomplete and misleading risk information if we only focus on the next 10 years of someone’s life,” said principal investigator Donald Lloyd-Jones, MD, chair and associate professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. “With even just one risk factor, the likelihood is very large that someone will develop a major cardiovascular event that will kill them or substantially diminish their quality of life or health.”  The risk-factor profile was considered optimal when a participant had a total cholesterol level of less than 180 milligrams per deciliter and untreated blood pressure of less than 120 over less than 80, was a nonsmoker and did not have diabetes.  The new research on long-term risk may be important in estimating the future burden of cardiovascular disease in the general population, Lloyd-Jones noted.  Some key findings of the study:  Men who are 45 years old and have all risk factors at optimal levels have a 1.4 percent risk of having a heart attack or stroke or other form of death from heart disease while having two or more risk factors hike the risk to 49.5 percent.  For 45-year-old women with all risk factors being optimal, the chance of having a heart attack or stroke in their lifetimes is 4.1 percent while having two or more risk factors boost it to 30.7 percent.  “Just even one small increase in risk, from all optimal risk factors to one that isn’t optimal, like slightly elevated cholesterol or blood pressure, significantly bumps up a person’s lifetime risk,” Lloyd-Jones said. (Non-optimal means a person doesn’t have diabetes and doesn’t smoke but either cholesterol is 180 to 199 or blood pressure is 120 to 130 on top or 80 to 89 on the bottom. These numbers aren’t at levels that need to be treated with medication, but they are still higher than desired.)  Women have a higher risk than men for a stroke over their lifetimes but a lower risk for a heart attack.  African-Americans have higher risk factors such as more hypertension and diabetes than whites, but because they also tend to die at younger ages, their lifetime risk of having a heart attack or stroke ends up being the same as whites.  “This study underscores the importance of lifestyle -- particularly diet, exercise and smoking cessation -- all the lifestyle patterns that are important in reducing the development of the risk factors in the first place,” said Jarett Berry, MD, who worked on the study when he was at Northwestern’s Feinberg School and is now assistant professor of medicine at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.  “We need to do a much better job of making sure these risk factors don’t develop in the first place, getting kids and young adults off to better starts so they don’t gain weight and are following healthier lifestyles throughout their lives,” Lloyd-Jones said.  Lloyd-Jones pointed out that maintaining the full package of optimal risk factors through middle age had a dramatic effect on the remainder of a person’s life. “It appears that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts,” he said.  The research was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

Lead writer: Chris Woolston  February 29, 2016       Each year heart attacks kill more than 150,000 Americans, nearly half of them women. If such a grim statistic can have a bright side, it's this: Most heart attacks today aren't fatal.  About 75% of men and 60% of women live at least one year after an attack. Who is most at risk? While most heart attack victims are middle-aged or olderthe average age for a first attack is 66 for men and 70 for womenpeople in their 20s and 30s suffer attacks too. The risk of a heart attack climbs for men after age 45 and for women after age 55. When do heart attacks strike? Heart attacks occur roughly every 35 seconds in the United States, and most occur in the morning, a time when the platelets in the blood are especially "sticky" and prone to form clots. Early Warning Signs Heart attack symptoms can be subtle Watch video More on heart attack "I Stopped My Diabetes Meds and Had a Heart Attack" 10 Risk Factors for Heart Disease      At least one study, however, has found that morning isn't a prime time for heart attacks among people who regularly take aspirin, which helps keep platelets from sticking together. Beating the odds Survival odds for people who have had a heart attack keep getting better thanks to advances in diagnosis, medication, and lifesaving technology. It's worth noting that survival rates for heart attack patients are better on weekdays compared to weekends, because medical personnel are more likely to use invasive procedures (including angioplasty and bypass surgery) during the week. Nonetheless, cardiologists are optimistic about the rate of improvement in cardiac care. When Sharonne Hayes, MD, director of the Mayo Clinic's Women's Heart Clinic, started practicing in the mid-1980s, doctors couldn't do much for people having heart attacks. "Now we can stop a heart attack in its tracks," she says. "Patients have a much better chance at recovery."

Extensive research has identified factors that increase a person’s risk of coronary heart disease in general and heart attack in particular. The more risk factors you have, and the greater the level of each risk factor, the higher your chance of developing coronary heart disease — a common term for the buildup of plaque in the heart’s arteries that could lead to heart attack. Major risk factors  Research has shown that these unchangeable factors significantly increase the risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Modifiable risk factors Some major risk factors can be modified, treated or controlled through medications or lifestyle change. Contributing risk factors These factors are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but their significance and prevalence haven't yet been determined. The American Heart Association recommends beginning heart disease prevention early in life, starting by assessing your risk factors and working to keep them low. The sooner you know and manage your risk factors, the better your chances of leading a heart-healthy life. Learn more about common risk factors and access information about how you can manage modifiable risk factors below.             Risk Factors and Coronary Heart Disease     Major risk factors that can't be changed    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed. The more of these risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease . Since you can't do anything about these risk factors, it's even more important for you to manage the risk factors that can be changed. Increasing Age The majority of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 or older. At older ages, women who have heart attacks are more likely than men are to die from them within a few weeks. Male Sex (Gender) Men have a greater risk of heart attack than women do, and they have attacks earlier in life. Even after menopause, when women's death rate from heart disease increases, it's not as great as men's. Heredity (Including Race) Children of parents with heart disease are more likely to develop it themselves. African Americans have more severe high blood pressure than Caucasians and a higher risk of heart disease. Heart disease risk is also higher among Mexican Americans, American Indians, native Hawaiians and some Asian Americans. This is partly due to higher rates of obesity and diabetes. Most people with a strong family history of heart disease have one or more other risk factors. Just as you can't control your age, sex and race, you can't control your family history. Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed. The more of these risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease .

Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    Major risk factors you can modify, treat or control    Tobacco smoke Smokers' risk of developing coronary heart disease is much higher than that of nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking is a powerful independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease. Cigarette smoking also acts with other risk factors to greatly increase the risk for coronary heart disease. Exposure to other people's smoke increases the risk of heart disease even for nonsmokers. Learn about smoking and cardiovascular disease High blood cholesterol As blood cholesterol rises, so does risk of coronary heart disease. When other risk factors (such as high blood pressure and tobacco smoke) are present, this risk increases even more. A person's cholesterol level is also affected by age, sex, heredity and diet. Here's the lowdown on: Total Cholesterol: Your total cholesterol score is calculated using the following equation: HDL + LDL + 20 percent of your triglyceride level. Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol = "bad" cholesterol A low LDL cholesterol level is considered good for your heart health. However, your LDL number should no longer be the main factor in guiding treatment to prevent heart attack and stroke, according to the latest guidelines from the American Heart Association. For patients taking statins, the guidelines say they no longer need to get LDL cholesterol levels down to a specific target number. Lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in saturated and trans fats can raise LDL cholesterol. High-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol = "good" cholesterol With HDL (good) cholesterol, higher levels are typically better. Low HDL cholesterol puts you at higher risk for heart disease. People with high blood triglycerides usually also have lower HDL cholesterol. Genetic factors, type 2 diabetes, smoking, being overweight and being sedentary can all result in lower HDL cholesterol. Triglycerides Triglyceride is the most common type of fat in the body. Normal triglyceride levels vary by age and sex. A high triglyceride level combined with low HDL cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol is associated with atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits in artery walls that increases the risk for heart attack and stroke. Learn more about managing your cholesterol High blood pressure High blood pressure increases the heart's workload, causing the heart muscle to thicken and become stiffer. This stiffening of the heart muscle is not normal, and causes the heart not to work properly. It also increases your risk of stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and congestive heart failure. When high blood pressure exists with obesity, smoking, high blood cholesterol levels or diabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke increases even more. Learn more about managing your blood pressure Physical inactivity An inactive lifestyle is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Regular, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity helps reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Even moderate-intensity activities help if done regularly and long term. Physical activity can help control blood cholesterol, diabetes and obesity, as well as help lower blood pressure in some people. Learn more about getting active Obesity and overweight People who have excess body fat — especially if a lot of it is at the waist — are more likely to develop heart disease and stroke even if they have no other risk factors. Overweight and obese adults with risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high blood sugar can make lifestyle changes to lose weight and produce clinically meaningful reductions in triglycerides, blood glucose, HbA1c, and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Many people may have difficulty losing weight. But a sustained weight loss of 3 to 5% body weight may lead to clinically meaningful reductions in some risk factors, larger weight losses can benefit blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose. Learn more about managing your weight Diabetes mellitus Diabetes seriously increases your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Even when glucose levels are under control, diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, but the risks are even greater if blood sugar is not well controlled. At least 68% of people >65 years of age with diabetes die of some form of heart disease and 16% die of stroke. If you have diabetes, it's extremely important to work with your healthcare provider to manage it and control any other risk factors you can. Persons with diabetes who are obese or overweight should make lifestyle changes (e.g., eat better, get regular physical activity, lose weight ) to help manage blood sugar. Learn more about managing your diabetes    Other factors that contribute to heart disease risk    Stress Individual response to stress may be a contributing factor. Some scientists have noted a relationship between coronary heart disease risk and stress in a person's life, their health behaviors and socioeconomic status. These factors may affect established risk factors. For example, people under stress may overeat, start smoking or smoke more than they otherwise would. Get stress management tips and tools Alcohol Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure, increase risk of cardiomyopathy and stroke, cancer and other diseases. It can contribute to high triglycerides, and produce irregular heartbeats. Excessive alcohol consumption contributes to obesity, alcoholism, suicide and accidents. However, there is a cardioprotective effect of moderate alcohol consumption. If you drink, limit your alcohol consumption to no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one drink as 1-1/2 fluid ounces (fl oz) of 80-proof spirits (such as bourbon, Scotch, vodka, gin, etc.), 5 fl oz of wine or 12 fl oz of regular beer. It's not recommended that nondrinkers start using alcohol or that drinkers increase the amount they drink. Read our recommendation on alcohol, wine and cardiovascular disease Diet and Nutrition A healthy diet is one of the best weapons you have to fight cardiovascular disease. The food you eat (and the amount) can affect other controllable risk factors: cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes and overweight. Choose nutrient-rich foods — which have vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients but are lower in calories — over nutrient-poor foods. Choose a diet that emphasizes intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, nontropical vegetable oils, and nuts; and limits intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meats. And to maintain a healthy weight, coordinate your diet with your physical activity level so you're using up as many calories as you take in.

If you are over 40, or if you have multiple risk factors, work especially closely with your doctor to address your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Heart attack prevention should begin early in life. Start with an assessment of your risk factors and a plan you can follow to keep your heart attack risk low.

Fatty deposits build up over time, forming plaques in your heart's arteries. If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form and block your arteries, causing a heart attack. During a heart attack, tissue in your heart muscle dies due to lack of blood flow through your heart's arteries.     A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked, most often by a build-up of fat, cholesterol and other substances, which form a plaque in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary arteries). The interrupted blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle.  A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction, can be fatal, but treatment has improved dramatically over the years. It's crucial to call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack.      Symptoms Common heart attack signs and symptoms include:   Pressure, tightness, pain, or a squeezing or aching sensation in your chest or arms that may spread to your neck, jaw or back  Nausea, indigestion, heartburn or abdominal pain  Shortness of breath  Cold sweat  Fatigue  Lightheadedness or sudden dizziness   Heart attack symptoms vary  Not all people who have heart attacks have the same symptoms or have the same severity of symptoms. Some people have mild pain; others have more severe pain. Some people have no symptoms, while for others, the first sign may be sudden cardiac arrest. However, the more signs and symptoms you have, the greater the likelihood you're having a heart attack.  Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance. The earliest warning may be recurrent chest pain (angina) that's triggered by exertion and relieved by rest. Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart.  A heart attack differs from a condition in which your heart suddenly stops (sudden cardiac arrest, which occurs when an electrical disturbance disrupts your heart's pumping action and causes blood to stop flowing to the rest of your body). A heart attack can cause cardiac arrest, but it's not the only cause.  When to see a doctor  Act immediately. Some people wait too long because they don't recognize the important signs and symptoms. Take these steps:    Call for emergency medical help . If you suspect you're having a heart attack, don't hesitate. Immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital.  Drive yourself only if there are no other options. Because your condition can worsen, driving yourself puts you and others at risk.   Take nitroglycerin, if prescribed to you by a doctor . Take it as instructed while awaiting emergency help.   Take aspirin, if recommended . Taking aspirin during a heart attack could reduce heart damage by helping to keep your blood from clotting.  Aspirin can interact with other medications, however, so don't take an aspirin unless your doctor or emergency medical personnel recommend it. Don't delay calling 911 to take an aspirin. Call for emergency help first.    What to do if you see someone having a heart attack  If you encounter someone who is unconscious, first call for emergency medical help. Then begin CPR to keep blood flowing. Push hard and fast on the person's chest in a fairly rapid rhythm — about 100 to 120 compressions a minute. It's not necessary to check the person's airway or deliver rescue breaths unless you've been trained in CPR.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes A heart attack occurs when one or more of your coronary arteries become blocked. Over time, a coronary artery can narrow from the buildup of various substances, including cholesterol (atherosclerosis). This condition, known as coronary artery disease, causes most heart attacks.  During a heart attack, one of these plaques can rupture and spill cholesterol and other substances into the bloodstream. A blood clot forms at the site of the rupture. If large enough, the clot can completely block the flow of blood through the coronary artery.  Another cause of a heart attack is a spasm of a coronary artery that shuts down blood flow to part of the heart muscle. Use of tobacco and of illicit drugs, such as cocaine, can cause a life-threatening spasm. A heart attack can also occur due to a tear in the heart artery (spontaneous coronary artery dissection).  Risk factors Certain factors contribute to the unwanted buildup of fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) that narrows arteries throughout your body. You can improve or eliminate many of these risk factors to reduce your chances of having a first or subsequent heart attack.  Heart attack risk factors include:   Age . Men age 45 or older and women age 55 or older are more likely to have a heart attack than are younger men and women.  Tobacco . Smoking and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke increase the risk of a heart attack.  High blood pressure . Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries that feed your heart by accelerating atherosclerosis. High blood pressure that occurs with obesity, smoking, high cholesterol or diabetes increases your risk even more.  High blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels . A high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the "bad" cholesterol) is most likely to narrow arteries. A high level of triglycerides, a type of blood fat related to your diet, also ups your risk of heart attack. However, a high level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol) lowers your risk of heart attack.  Diabetes . Insulin, a hormone secreted by your pancreas, allows your body to use glucose, a form of sugar. Having diabetes — not producing enough insulin or not responding to insulin properly — causes your body's blood sugar levels to rise. Diabetes, especially uncontrolled, increases your risk of a heart attack.  Family history of heart attack . If your siblings, parents or grandparents have had early heart attacks (by age 55 for male relatives and by age 65 for female relatives), you may be at increased risk.  Lack of physical activity . An inactive lifestyle contributes to high blood cholesterol levels and obesity. People who get regular aerobic exercise have better cardiovascular fitness, which decreases their overall risk of heart attack. Exercise is also beneficial in lowering high blood pressure.  Obesity . Obesity is associated with high blood cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. Losing just 10 percent of your body weight can lower this risk, however.  Stress . You may respond to stress in ways that can increase your risk of a heart attack.  Illegal drug use . Using stimulant drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, can trigger a spasm of your coronary arteries that can cause a heart attack.  A history of preeclampsia . This condition causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and increases the lifetime risk of heart disease.  A history of an autoimmune condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus . Conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other autoimmune conditions can increase your risk of having a heart attack.   Complications Complications are often related to the damage done to your heart during an attack. Damage can lead to:   Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) . Electrical "short circuits" can develop, resulting in abnormal heart rhythms, some of which can be serious, even fatal.  Heart failure . An attack may damage so much heart tissue that the remaining heart muscle can't adequately pump blood out of your heart. Heart failure may be temporary, or it can be a chronic condition resulting from extensive and permanent damage to your heart.  Heart rupture . Areas of heart muscle weakened by a heart attack can rupture, leaving a hole in part of the heart. This rupture is often fatal.  Valve problems . Heart valves damaged during a heart attack may develop severe leakage problems.   Prevention It's never too late to take steps to prevent a heart attack — even if you've already had one. Here are ways to prevent a heart attack.   Medications. Taking medications can reduce your risk of a subsequent heart attack and help your damaged heart function better. Continue to take what your doctor prescribes, and ask your doctor how often you need to be monitored.  Lifestyle factors . You know the drill: Maintain a healthy weight with a heart-healthy diet, don't smoke, exercise regularly, manage stress and control conditions that can lead to heart attack, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.

It’s important for everyone to know the facts about heart disease [PDF-243K] .   Heart Disease in the United States   About 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year–that’s 1 in every 4 deaths . 1   Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. More than half of the deaths due to heart disease in 2009 were in men. 1    Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 people annually. 1   Every year about 735,000 Americans have a heart attack . Of these, 525,000 are a first heart attack and 210,000 happen in people who have already had a heart attack. 2    Heart Disease Deaths Vary by Race and Ethnicity  Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people of most ethnicities in the United States, including African Americans, Hispanics, and whites. For American Indians or Alaska Natives and Asians or Pacific Islanders, heart disease is second only to cancer. Below are the percentages of all deaths caused by heart disease in 2008, listed by ethnicity. 4    Race of Ethnic Group  % of Deaths     American Indians or Alaska Natives  18.4    Asians or Pacific Islanders  22.2    Non-Hispanic Blacks  23.8    Non-Hispanic Whites  23.8    All  23.5      Top of Page    Early Action is Important for Heart Attack  Know the warning signs and symptoms of a heart attack so that you can act fast if you or someone you know might be having a heart attack. The chances of survival are greater when emergency treatment begins quickly.   In a 2005 survey, most respondents—92%—recognized chest pain as a symptom of a heart attack. Only 27% were aware of all major symptoms and knew to call 9-1-1 when someone was having a heart attack. 5    About 47% of sudden cardiac deaths occur outside a hospital. This suggests that many people with heart disease don’t act on early warning signs. 6    Heart attacks have several major warning signs and symptoms:   Chest pain or discomfort.  Upper body pain or discomfort in the arms, back, neck, jaw, or upper stomach.  Shortness of breath.  Nausea, lightheadedness, or cold sweats.    Top of Page    Americans at Risk for Heart Disease  High blood pressure , high cholesterol , and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. About half of Americans (47%) have at least one of these three risk factors. 7  Several other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also put people at a higher risk for heart disease, including:   Diabetes  Overweight and obesity  Poor diet  Physical inactivity  Excessive alcohol use    Top of Page    CDC Fact Sheets Related to Heart Disease   Heart Disease Fact Sheet  Men and Heart Disease  Women and Heart Disease  Atrial Fibrillation  Cardiomyopathy  Heart Failure  Signs and Symptoms of a Heart Attack  Aortic Aneurysm  Cholesterol  High Blood Pressure  Pulmonary Hypertension Fact Sheet    Top of Page    References   CDC, NCHS.

If you pay attention, you will live a long, healthy, active, and productive life.  10-13 - Moderate risk (9-14 percent) - You do some things right, but you have work to do. Identify your risk factors and take corrective action.  14-16 - High risk (15-19 percent) - You stand a good chance of having a first heart attack before you are 55, if male, and 65, if female.  If you have already had a heart attack, you are at high risk for a repeat performance.  Over 16 - Extreme risk (greater than 20 percent) - Unless you have a death wish, you have work to do. It will take time and effort to move to the lower risk categories.  Don’t bite off too much at one time. The process of change should be slow, committed, persistent, and permanent.

Extensive research has identified factors that increase a person’s risk of coronary heart disease in general and heart attack in particular. The more risk factors you have, and the greater the level of each risk factor, the higher your chance of developing coronary heart disease — a common term for the buildup of plaque in the heart’s arteries that could lead to heart attack. Major risk factors  Research has shown that these unchangeable factors significantly increase the risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Modifiable risk factors Some major risk factors can be modified, treated or controlled through medications or lifestyle change. Contributing risk factors These factors are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but their significance and prevalence haven't yet been determined. The American Heart Association recommends beginning heart disease prevention early in life, starting by assessing your risk factors and working to keep them low. The sooner you know and manage your risk factors, the better your chances of leading a heart-healthy life. Learn more about common risk factors and access information about how you can manage modifiable risk factors below.             Risk Factors and Coronary Heart Disease     Major risk factors that can't be changed    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed. The more of these risk factors you have, the greater your chance of developing coronary heart disease . Since you can't do anything about these risk factors, it's even more important for you to manage the risk factors that can be changed. Increasing Age The majority of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 or older. At older ages, women who have heart attacks are more likely than men are to die from them within a few weeks. Male Sex (Gender) Men have a greater risk of heart attack than women do, and they have attacks earlier in life. Even after menopause, when women's death rate from heart disease increases, it's not as great as men's. Heredity (Including Race) Children of parents with heart disease are more likely to develop it themselves. African Americans have more severe high blood pressure than Caucasians and a higher risk of heart disease. Heart disease risk is also higher among Mexican Americans, American Indians, native Hawaiians and some Asian Americans. This is partly due to higher rates of obesity and diabetes. Most people with a strong family history of heart disease have one or more other risk factors. Just as you can't control your age, sex and race, you can't control your family history. Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    The risk factors on this list are ones you're born with and cannot be changed.

Therefore, it's even more important to treat and control any other risk factors you have.    Major risk factors you can modify, treat or control    Tobacco smoke Smokers' risk of developing coronary heart disease is much higher than that of nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking is a powerful independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease. Cigarette smoking also acts with other risk factors to greatly increase the risk for coronary heart disease. Exposure to other people's smoke increases the risk of heart disease even for nonsmokers. Learn about smoking and cardiovascular disease High blood cholesterol As blood cholesterol rises, so does risk of coronary heart disease. When other risk factors (such as high blood pressure and tobacco smoke) are present, this risk increases even more. A person's cholesterol level is also affected by age, sex, heredity and diet. Here's the lowdown on: Total Cholesterol: Your total cholesterol score is calculated using the following equation: HDL + LDL + 20 percent of your triglyceride level. Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol = "bad" cholesterol A low LDL cholesterol level is considered good for your heart health. However, your LDL number should no longer be the main factor in guiding treatment to prevent heart attack and stroke, according to the latest guidelines from the American Heart Association. For patients taking statins, the guidelines say they no longer need to get LDL cholesterol levels down to a specific target number. Lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in saturated and trans fats can raise LDL cholesterol. High-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol = "good" cholesterol With HDL (good) cholesterol, higher levels are typically better. Low HDL cholesterol puts you at higher risk for heart disease. People with high blood triglycerides usually also have lower HDL cholesterol. Genetic factors, type 2 diabetes, smoking, being overweight and being sedentary can all result in lower HDL cholesterol. Triglycerides Triglyceride is the most common type of fat in the body. Normal triglyceride levels vary by age and sex. A high triglyceride level combined with low HDL cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol is associated with atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits in artery walls that increases the risk for heart attack and stroke. Learn more about managing your cholesterol High blood pressure High blood pressure increases the heart's workload, causing the heart muscle to thicken and become stiffer. This stiffening of the heart muscle is not normal, and causes the heart not to work properly. It also increases your risk of stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and congestive heart failure. When high blood pressure exists with obesity, smoking, high blood cholesterol levels or diabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke increases even more. Learn more about managing your blood pressure Physical inactivity An inactive lifestyle is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Regular, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity helps reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Even moderate-intensity activities help if done regularly and long term. Physical activity can help control blood cholesterol, diabetes and obesity, as well as help lower blood pressure in some people. Learn more about getting active Obesity and overweight People who have excess body fat — especially if a lot of it is at the waist — are more likely to develop heart disease and stroke even if they have no other risk factors. Overweight and obese adults with risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high blood sugar can make lifestyle changes to lose weight and produce clinically meaningful reductions in triglycerides, blood glucose, HbA1c, and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Many people may have difficulty losing weight. But a sustained weight loss of 3 to 5% body weight may lead to clinically meaningful reductions in some risk factors, larger weight losses can benefit blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose. Learn more about managing your weight Diabetes mellitus Diabetes seriously increases your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Even when glucose levels are under control, diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, but the risks are even greater if blood sugar is not well controlled. At least 68% of people >65 years of age with diabetes die of some form of heart disease and 16% die of stroke. If you have diabetes, it's extremely important to work with your healthcare provider to manage it and control any other risk factors you can. Persons with diabetes who are obese or overweight should make lifestyle changes (e.g., eat better, get regular physical activity, lose weight ) to help manage blood sugar. Learn more about managing your diabetes    Other factors that contribute to heart disease risk    Stress Individual response to stress may be a contributing factor. Some scientists have noted a relationship between coronary heart disease risk and stress in a person's life, their health behaviors and socioeconomic status. These factors may affect established risk factors. For example, people under stress may overeat, start smoking or smoke more than they otherwise would. Get stress management tips and tools Alcohol Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure, increase risk of cardiomyopathy and stroke, cancer and other diseases. It can contribute to high triglycerides, and produce irregular heartbeats. Excessive alcohol consumption contributes to obesity, alcoholism, suicide and accidents. However, there is a cardioprotective effect of moderate alcohol consumption. If you drink, limit your alcohol consumption to no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one drink as 1-1/2 fluid ounces (fl oz) of 80-proof spirits (such as bourbon, Scotch, vodka, gin, etc.), 5 fl oz of wine or 12 fl oz of regular beer. It's not recommended that nondrinkers start using alcohol or that drinkers increase the amount they drink. Read our recommendation on alcohol, wine and cardiovascular disease Diet and Nutrition A healthy diet is one of the best weapons you have to fight cardiovascular disease. The food you eat (and the amount) can affect other controllable risk factors: cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes and overweight. Choose nutrient-rich foods — which have vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients but are lower in calories — over nutrient-poor foods. Choose a diet that emphasizes intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, nontropical vegetable oils, and nuts; and limits intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meats. And to maintain a healthy weight, coordinate your diet with your physical activity level so you're using up as many calories as you take in.

Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.  The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.  Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.      Symptoms Heart disease symptoms depend on what type of heart disease you have.  Symptoms of heart disease in your blood vessels (atherosclerotic disease) Cardiovascular disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain; women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.  Symptoms can include:   Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)  Shortness of breath  Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed  Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back   You might not be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for cardiovascular symptoms and discuss concerns with your doctor. Cardiovascular disease can sometimes be found early with regular evaluations.  Heart disease symptoms caused by abnormal heartbeats (heart arrhythmias) A heart arrhythmia is an abnormal heartbeat. Your heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia symptoms can include:   Fluttering in your chest  Racing heartbeat (tachycardia)  Slow heartbeat (bradycardia)  Chest pain or discomfort  Shortness of breath  Lightheadedness  Dizziness  Fainting (syncope) or near fainting   Heart disease symptoms caused by heart defects Serious congenital heart defects — defects you're born with — usually become evident soon after birth. Heart defect symptoms in children could include:   Pale gray or blue skin color (cyanosis)  Swelling in the legs, abdomen or areas around the eyes  In an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain   Less serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood. Signs and symptoms of congenital heart defects that usually aren't immediately life-threatening include:   Easily getting short of breath during exercise or activity  Easily tiring during exercise or activity  Swelling in the hands, ankles or feet   Heart disease symptoms caused by weak heart muscle (dilated cardiomyopathy) In early stages of cardiomyopathy, you may have no symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include:   Breathlessness with exertion or at rest  Swelling of the legs, ankles and feet  Fatigue  Irregular heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering  Dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting   Heart disease symptoms caused by heart infections Endocarditis is an infection that affects the inner membrane that separates the chambers and valves of the heart (endocardium). Heart infection symptoms can include:   Fever  Shortness of breath  Weakness or fatigue  Swelling in your legs or abdomen  Changes in your heart rhythm  Dry or persistent cough  Skin rashes or unusual spots   Heart disease symptoms caused by valvular heart disease The heart has four valves — the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid valves — that open and close to direct blood flow through your heart. Valves may be damaged by a variety of conditions leading to narrowing (stenosis), leaking (regurgitation or insufficiency) or improper closing (prolapse).  Depending on which valve isn't working properly, valvular heart disease symptoms generally include:   Fatigue  Shortness of breath  Irregular heartbeat  Swollen feet or ankles  Chest pain  Fainting (syncope)   When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical care if you have these heart disease symptoms:   Chest pain  Shortness of breath  Fainting   Heart disease is easier to treat when detected early, so talk to your doctor about your concerns regarding your heart health. If you're concerned about developing heart disease, talk to your doctor about steps you can take to reduce your heart disease risk. This is especially important if you have a family history of heart disease.  If you think you may have heart disease, based on new signs or symptoms you're having, make an appointment to see your doctor.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes How the heart works    Chambers and valves of the heart Chambers and valves of the heart A normal heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of your heart. The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.     Your heart is a pump. It's a muscular organ about the size of your fist, situated slightly left of center in your chest. Your heart is divided into the right and the left side. The division prevents oxygen-rich blood from mixing with oxygen-poor blood. Oxygen-poor blood returns to the heart after circulating through your body.   The right side of the heart, comprising the right atrium and ventricle, collects and pumps blood to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries.  The lungs refresh the blood with a new supply of oxygen. The lungs also breathe out carbon dioxide, a waste product.  Oxygen-rich blood then enters the left side of the heart, comprising the left atrium and ventricle.  The left side of the heart pumps blood through the aorta to supply tissues throughout the body with oxygen and nutrients.   Heart valves Four valves within your heart keep your blood moving the right way by opening only one way and only when they need to. To function properly, the valve must be formed properly, must open all the way and must close tightly so there's no leakage. The four valves are:   Tricuspid  Mitral  Pulmonary  Aortic   Heartbeats    The blueprints to your heart  Click here for an infographic to learn more   A beating heart contracts and relaxes in a continuous cycle.   During contraction (systole), your ventricles contract, forcing blood into the vessels to your lungs and body.  During relaxation (diastole), the ventricles are filled with blood coming from the upper chambers (left and right atria).   Electrical system Your heart's electrical wiring keeps it beating, which controls the continuous exchange of oxygen-rich blood with oxygen-poor blood. This exchange keeps you alive.   Electrical impulses begin high in the right atrium and travel through specialized pathways to the ventricles, delivering the signal for the heart to pump.  The conduction system keeps your heart beating in a coordinated and normal rhythm, which keeps blood circulating.   Various heart disease causes The causes of heart disease vary by type of heart disease.  Causes of cardiovascular disease    Development of atherosclerosis Development of atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis is a process in which blood, fats such as cholesterol and other substances build up on your artery walls. Eventually, deposits called plaques may form. The deposits may narrow — or block — your arteries. These plaques can also rupture, causing a blood clot.     While cardiovascular disease can refer to different heart or blood vessel problems, the term is often used to mean damage to your heart or blood vessels by atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis), a buildup of fatty plaques in your arteries. Plaque buildup thickens and stiffens artery walls, which can inhibit blood flow through your arteries to your organs and tissues.  Atherosclerosis is also the most common cause of cardiovascular disease. It can be caused by correctable problems, such as an unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, being overweight and smoking.  Causes of heart arrhythmia Common causes of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) or conditions that can lead to arrhythmias include:   Heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects)  Coronary artery disease  High blood pressure  Diabetes  Smoking  Excessive use of alcohol or caffeine  Drug abuse  Stress  Some over-the-counter medications, prescription medications, dietary supplements and herbal remedies  Valvular heart disease   In a healthy person with a normal, healthy heart, it's unlikely for a fatal arrhythmia to develop without some outside trigger, such as an electrical shock or the use of illegal drugs. That's primarily because a healthy person's heart is free from any abnormal conditions that cause an arrhythmia, such as an area of scarred tissue.  However, in a heart that's diseased or deformed, the heart's electrical impulses may not properly start or travel through the heart, making arrhythmias more likely to develop.  Causes of congenital heart defects Congenital heart defects usually develop while a baby is in the womb. Heart defects can develop as the heart develops, about a month after conception, changing the flow of blood in the heart. Some medical conditions, medications and genes may play a role in causing heart defects.  Heart defects can also develop in adults. As you age, your heart's structure can change, causing a heart defect.  Causes of cardiomyopathy The cause of cardiomyopathy, a thickening or enlarging of the heart muscle, may depend on the type:   Dilated cardiomyopathy. The cause of this most common type of cardiomyopathy often is unknown. It may be caused by reduced blood flow to the heart (ischemic heart disease) resulting from damage after a heart attack, infections, toxins and certain drugs. It may also be inherited from a parent. It usually enlarges (dilates) the left ventricle.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This type, in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, usually is inherited. It can also develop over time because of high blood pressure or aging.  Restrictive cardiomyopathy. This least common type of cardiomyopathy, which causes the heart muscle to become rigid and less elastic, can occur for no known reason. Or it may be caused by diseases, such as connective tissue disorders, excessive iron buildup in your body (hemochromatosis), the buildup of abnormal proteins (amyloidosis) or by some cancer treatments.   Causes of heart infection A heart infection, such as endocarditis, is caused when an irritant, such as a bacterium, virus or chemical, reaches your heart muscle. The most common causes of heart infection include:   Bacteria  Viruses  Parasites   Causes of valvular heart disease There are many causes of diseases of your heart valves. You may be born with valvular disease, or the valves may be damaged by conditions such as:   Rheumatic fever  Infections (infectious endocarditis)  Connective tissue disorders   Risk factors Risk factors for developing heart disease include:   Age. Aging increases your risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and weakened or thickened heart muscle.  Sex. Men are generally at greater risk of heart disease. However, women's risk increases after menopause.  Family history. A family history of heart disease increases your risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a parent developed it at an early age (before age 55 for a male relative, such as your brother or father, and 65 for a female relative, such as your mother or sister).  Smoking. Nicotine constricts your blood vessels, and carbon monoxide can damage their inner lining, making them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Heart attacks are more common in smokers than in nonsmokers.  Certain chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy for cancer. Some chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapies may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.  Poor diet. A diet that's high in fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol can contribute to the development of heart disease.  High blood pressure. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can result in hardening and thickening of your arteries, narrowing the vessels through which blood flows.  High blood cholesterol levels. High levels of cholesterol in your blood can increase the risk of formation of plaques and atherosclerosis.  Diabetes. Diabetes increases your risk of heart disease. Both conditions share similar risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure.  Obesity. Excess weight typically worsens other risk factors.  Physical inactivity. Lack of exercise also is associated with many forms of heart disease and some of its other risk factors, as well.  Stress. Unrelieved stress may damage your arteries and worsen other risk factors for heart disease.  Poor hygiene. Not regularly washing your hands and not establishing other habits that can help prevent viral or bacterial infections can put you at risk of heart infections, especially if you already have an underlying heart condition. Poor dental health also may contribute to heart disease.   Complications Complications of heart disease include:   Heart failure. One of the most common complications of heart disease, heart failure occurs when your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. Heart failure can result from many forms of heart disease, including heart defects, cardiovascular disease, valvular heart disease, heart infections or cardiomyopathy.  Heart attack. A blood clot blocking the blood flow through a blood vessel that feeds the heart causes a heart attack, possibly damaging or destroying a part of the heart muscle. Atherosclerosis can cause a heart attack.  Stroke. The risk factors that lead to cardiovascular disease also can lead to an ischemic stroke, which happens when the arteries to your brain are narrowed or blocked so that too little blood reaches your brain. A stroke is a medical emergency — brain tissue begins to die within just a few minutes of a stroke.  Aneurysm. A serious complication that can occur anywhere in your body, an aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of your artery. If an aneurysm bursts, you may face life-threatening internal bleeding.  Peripheral artery disease. Atherosclerosis also can lead to peripheral artery disease. When you develop peripheral artery disease, your extremities — usually your legs — don't receive enough blood flow. This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain when walking (claudication).  Sudden cardiac arrest. Sudden cardiac arrest is the sudden, unexpected loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness, often caused by an arrhythmia. Sudden cardiac arrest is a medical emergency. If not treated immediately, it is fatal, resulting in sudden cardiac death.   Prevention Certain types of heart disease, such as heart defects, can't be prevented. However, you can help prevent many other types of heart disease by making the same lifestyle changes that can improve your heart disease, such as:   Quit smoking  Control other health conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes  Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week  Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat  Maintain a healthy weight  Reduce and manage stress  Practice good hygiene   By Mayo Clinic Staff    Heart disease care at Mayo Clinic   Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Diagnosis & treatment  March 22, 2018    Share on: Facebook Twitter    References  What is cardiovascular disease?

No matter what type of heart disease you have, your doctor will likely perform a physical exam and ask about your personal and family medical history before doing any tests. Besides blood tests and a chest X-ray, tests to diagnose heart disease can include:   Electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG records these electrical signals and can help your doctor detect irregularities in your heart's rhythm and structure. You may have an ECG while you're at rest or while exercising (stress electrocardiogram).  Holter monitoring. A Holter monitor is a portable device you wear to record a continuous ECG, usually for 24 to 72 hours. Holter monitoring is used to detect heart rhythm irregularities that aren't found during a regular ECG exam.  Echocardiogram. This noninvasive exam, which includes an ultrasound of your chest, shows detailed images of your heart's structure and function.  Stress test. This type of test involves raising your heart rate with exercise or medicine while performing heart tests and imaging to check how your heart responds.  Cardiac catheterization. In this test, a short tube (sheath) is inserted into a vein or artery in your leg (groin) or arm. A hollow, flexible and longer tube (guide catheter) is then inserted into the sheath. Aided by X-ray images on a monitor, your doctor threads the guide catheter through that artery until it reaches your heart.  The pressures in your heart chambers can be measured, and dye can be injected. The dye can be seen on an X-ray, which helps your doctor see the blood flow through your heart, blood vessels and valves to check for abnormalities.   Cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scan. This test is often used to check for heart problems. In a cardiac CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. An X-ray tube inside the machine rotates around your body and collects images of your heart and chest.  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For this test, you lie on a table inside a long tube-like machine that produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field produces pictures to help your doctor evaluate your heart.   Treatment Heart disease treatments vary by condition. For instance, if you have a heart infection, you'll likely be given antibiotics. In general, treatment for heart disease usually includes:   Lifestyle changes. These include eating a low-fat and low-sodium diet, getting at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days of the week, quitting smoking, and limiting alcohol intake.  Medications. If lifestyle changes alone aren't enough, your doctor may prescribe medications to control your heart disease. The type of medication will depend on the type of heart disease.  Medical procedures or surgery. If medications aren't enough, it's possible your doctor will recommend specific procedures or surgery. The type of procedure will depend on the type of heart disease and the extent of the damage to your heart.   Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Clinical trials   Explore Mayo Clinic studies testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease.  Lifestyle and home remedies Heart disease can be improved — or even prevented — by making certain lifestyle changes. The following changes can help anyone who wants to improve heart health:   Stop smoking. Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease, especially atherosclerosis. Quitting is the best way to reduce your risk of heart disease and its complications.  Control your blood pressure. Ask your doctor for a blood pressure measurement at least every two years. He or she may recommend more frequent measurements if your blood pressure is higher than normal or you have a history of heart disease. Optimal blood pressure is less than 120 systolic and 80 diastolic, as measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).  Check your cholesterol. Ask your doctor for a baseline cholesterol test when you're in your 20s and then at least every five years. You may need to start testing earlier if high cholesterol is in your family. If your test results aren't within desirable ranges, your doctor may recommend more frequent measurements.  Most people should aim for an LDL level below 130 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 3.4 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). If you have other risk factors for heart disease, you should aim for an LDL below 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). If you're at very high risk of heart disease — if you've already had a heart attack or have diabetes, for example — aim for an even lower LDL level — below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L).   Keep diabetes under control. If you have diabetes, tight blood sugar control can help reduce the risk of heart disease.  Move. Exercise helps you achieve and maintain a healthy weight and control diabetes, elevated cholesterol and high blood pressure — all risk factors for heart disease. If you have a heart arrhythmia or heart defect, there may be some restrictions on the activities you can do, so talk to your doctor.  With your doctor's OK, aim for 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity most days of the week.   Eat healthy foods. A heart-healthy diet based on fruits, vegetables and whole grains — and low in saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium and added sugar — can help you control your weight, blood pressure and cholesterol.  Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight increases your risk of heart disease. A BMI of less than 25 and a waist circumference of 35 inches (88.9 centimeters) or less is the goal for preventing and treating heart disease.  Manage stress. Reduce stress as much as possible. Practice techniques for managing stress, such as muscle relaxation and deep breathing.  Deal with depression. Being depressed can increase your risk of heart disease significantly. Talk to your doctor if you feel hopeless or uninterested in your life.  Practice good hygiene. Stay away from people with infectious diseases such as colds, get vaccinated against the flu, regularly wash your hands, and brush and floss your teeth regularly to keep yourself well.   Also, get regular medical checkups. Early detection and treatment can set the stage for a lifetime of better heart health.  Coping and support You may feel frustrated, upset or overwhelmed upon learning you or your loved one has heart disease. Fortunately, there are ways to help cope with heart disease or improve your condition. These include:   Cardiac rehabilitation. For people who have cardiovascular disease that's caused a heart attack or has required surgery to correct, cardiac rehabilitation is often recommended as a way to improve treatment and speed recovery. Cardiac rehabilitation involves levels of monitored exercise, nutritional counseling, emotional support, and support and education about lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of heart problems.  Support groups. Turning to friends and family for support is essential, but if you need more help, talk to your doctor about joining a support group. You may find that talking about your concerns with others with similar difficulties can help.  Continued medical checkups. If you have a recurring or chronic heart condition, regularly check in with your doctor to make sure you're properly managing your heart condition.   Preparing for your appointment Some types of heart disease will be discovered without an appointment — for example, if a child is born with a serious heart defect, it will be detected soon after birth. In other cases, your heart disease may be diagnosed in an emergency situation, such as a heart attack.  If you think you have heart disease or are worried about your heart disease risk because of your family history, see your family doctor. You may be referred to a heart specialist (cardiologist).  Here's some information to help you prepare for your appointment.  What you can do  Be aware of pre-appointment restrictions. When you make the appointment, ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as restrict your diet. You may need to fast before a cholesterol test, for example.  Write down symptoms you're experiencing, including any that seem unrelated to heart disease.  Write down key personal information — including a family history of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure or diabetes — and major stresses or recent life changes.  Make a list of medications, vitamins or supplements you're taking.  Take someone along, if possible. Someone who accompanies you can help you remember information you're given.  Be prepared to discuss your diet and your smoking and exercise habits. If you don't already follow a diet or exercise routine, talk to your doctor about getting started.  Write down questions to ask your doctor.   For heart disease, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:   What is likely causing my symptoms or condition?  What are other possible causes for my symptoms or condition?  What tests will I need?  What's the best treatment?  What foods should I eat or avoid?  What's an appropriate level of physical activity?  How often should I be screened for heart disease? For example, how often do I need a cholesterol test?  What are alternatives to the primary approach you're suggesting?  I have other health conditions. How do I manage them together?  Are there restrictions that I need to follow?  Should I see a specialist?  Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing?  Are there brochures or other materials that I can have? What websites do you recommend?   Don't hesitate to ask other questions.  What to expect from your doctor Your doctor is likely to ask you questions, such as:   When did your symptoms begin?  Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?  How severe are your symptoms?  What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?  What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?  Do you have a family history of heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure or other serious illness?   What you can do in the meantime It's never too early to make healthy lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, eating healthy foods and becoming more physically active. These are primary lines of defense against heart disease and its complications.

Las enfermedades clasificadas como enfermedades cardíacas comprenden enfermedades de los vasos sanguíneos, como enfermedad de las arterias coronarias, problemas con el ritmo cardíaco (arritmias) y defectos cardíacos con los que has nacido (defectos cardíacos congénitos), entre otros.  El término «enfermedad cardíaca» se usa a menudo de manera indistinta al término «enfermedad cardiovascular». «Enfermedad cardiovascular» a menudo hace referencia a enfermedades que implican un estrechamiento o bloqueo de los vasos sanguíneos que puede provocar un ataque cardíaco, dolor en el pecho (angina de pecho) o accidente cerebrovascular. Otras enfermedades cardíacas, como aquellas que afectan los músculos, las válvulas o el ritmo cardíacos, también se consideran formas de enfermedad cardíaca.  Muchas formas de enfermedad cardíaca pueden prevenirse o tratarse con elecciones de un estilo de vida saludable.  Atención de la enfermedad cardíaca en Mayo Clinic      Síntomas Los síntomas de la enfermedad cardíaca dependen del tipo de enfermedad cardíaca que tengas.  Síntomas de la enfermedad cardíaca en los vasos sanguíneos (enfermedad aterosclerótica)  Los síntomas de la enfermedad cardiovascular suelen ser diferentes en hombres y en mujeres. Por ejemplo, los hombres son más propensos a tener dolor en el pecho; en cambio, las mujeres son más propensas a tener otros síntomas además de las molestias en el pecho, como dificultad para respirar, náuseas y fatiga extrema.  Los síntomas comprenden los siguientes:   Dolor, opresión, presión y molestias en el pecho (angina de pecho)  Dificultad para respirar  Dolor, entumecimiento, debilidad o frío en las piernas o los brazos si los vasos sanguíneos en esas partes del cuerpo están estrechados  Dolor en el cuello, la mandíbula, la garganta, la parte superior del abdomen o la espalda   Es posible que no te diagnostiquen enfermedad cardiovascular hasta que tengas un ataque cardíaco, angina de pecho, un accidente cerebrovascular o insuficiencia cardíaca. Es importante prestar atención a los síntomas cardiovasculares y hablar con el médico sobre las dudas que tengas. A veces, las enfermedades cardiovasculares pueden detectarse de forma temprana con evaluaciones periódicas.  Síntomas de la enfermedad cardíaca provocados por latidos del corazón anormales (arritmias cardíacas)  Una arritmia cardíaca es un latido del corazón anormal. El corazón puede latir muy rápido, muy despacio o de manera irregular. Los síntomas de arritmia cardíaca comprenden los siguientes:   Agitación en el pecho  Aceleraciones en los latidos del corazón (taquicardia)  Latidos del corazón lentos (bradicardia)  Dolor o molestia en el pecho  Dificultad para respirar  Aturdimiento  Mareos  Desmayo (síncope) o desvanecimiento   Síntomas de la enfermedad cardíaca provocados por defectos cardíacos  Los defectos cardíacos congénitos graves (defectos con los que naces) suelen manifestarse poco después del nacimiento. Los síntomas de defectos cardíacos en los niños comprenden los siguientes:   Color gris pálido o azul en la piel (cianosis)  Hinchazón en las piernas, el abdomen y la zona alrededor de los ojos  En el bebé, dificultad para respirar durante la alimentación, lo que hace que aumente poco de peso   Los defectos cardíacos menos graves a menudo no se diagnostican hasta más adelante en la infancia o durante la adultez. Los signos y síntomas de los defectos cardíacos congénitos que no suelen poner en riesgo la vida de manera inmediata comprenden los siguientes:   Tendencia a respirar con dificultad al hacer ejercicio o actividad  Tendencia a cansarse al hacer ejercicio o actividad  Hinchazón en las manos, los tobillos o los pies   Síntomas de la enfermedad cardíaca provocados por el debilitamiento del músculo cardíaco (cardiomiopatía dilatada)  En la fase temprana de la cardiomiopatía, es posible que no tengas síntomas. A medida que la enfermedad empeora, los síntomas pueden comprender los siguientes:   Dificultad para respirar al hacer esfuerzo físico o en reposo  Hinchazón de las piernas, los tobillos y los pies  Fatiga  Latidos del corazón irregulares que se sienten rápidos, agitados o con palpitaciones  Mareos, aturdimiento o desmayos   Síntomas de la enfermedad cardíaca provocados por infecciones cardíacas  La endocarditis es una infección que afecta la membrana interna que separa las cavidades y las válvulas del corazón (endocardio). Los síntomas de la infección cardíaca pueden ser los siguientes:   Fiebre  Dificultad para respirar  Debilidad o fatiga  Hinchazón en las piernas o en el abdomen  Cambios en el ritmo cardíaco  Tos persistente o seca  Erupciones cutáneas o manchas poco frecuentes   Síntomas de la enfermedad cardíaca provocados por enfermedad cardíaca valvular  El corazón tiene cuatro válvulas: la aórtica, la mitral, la pulmonar y la tricúspide, que se abren y se cierran para dirigir el flujo sanguíneo a través del corazón. Varios factores pueden dañar las válvulas y provocar un estrechamiento (estenosis), una pérdida (insuficiencia) o un cierre incorrecto (prolapso).  Según cuál sea la válvula que no funciona correctamente, los síntomas de la enfermedad de las válvulas cardíacas comprenden los siguientes:   Fatiga  Dificultad para respirar  Latidos del corazón irregulares  Pies o tobillos hinchados  Dolor en el pecho  Desmayo (síncope)   Cuándo consultar al médico  Busca atención médica de urgencia si tienes los siguientes síntomas de enfermedad cardíaca:   Dolor en el pecho  Dificultad para respirar  Desmayo   Las enfermedades cardíacas son más fáciles de tratar cuando se detectan temprano, así que habla con el médico acerca de tus dudas sobre la salud del corazón. Si te preocupa la enfermedad cardíaca, consulta con el médico acerca de las medidas que puedes tomar para reducir el riesgo de padecer esta enfermedad del corazón. Esto es especialmente importante si tienes antecedentes familiares de enfermedad cardíaca.  Si crees que puedes tener una enfermedad cardíaca (porque tienes nuevos signos o síntomas), pide una consulta con el médico.  Solicite una Consulta en Mayo Clinic  Causas    Cámaras y válvulas del corazón Cámaras y válvulas del corazón Un corazón normal tiene dos cámaras superiores y dos cámaras inferiores. Las cámaras superiores, la aurícula derecha e izquierda, reciben la sangre. Las cámaras inferiores, los ventrículos derecho e izquierdo más musculares, bombean la sangre del corazón. Las válvulas cardíacas, que mantienen el flujo sanguíneo en la dirección adecuada, son puertas en las aperturas de las cámaras.     Cómo funciona el corazón  El corazón es una bomba. Se trata de un órgano muscular del tamaño aproximado de un puño, que se ubica levemente hacia la izquierda del centro del pecho. El corazón está dividido en un lado izquierdo y en un lado derecho. La división evita que la sangre rica en oxígeno se mezcle con la sangre con poco oxígeno. La sangre con poco oxígeno regresa al corazón después de haber circulado por el cuerpo.   El lado derecho del corazón, que se compone de la aurícula y el ventrículo derechos, recolecta e impulsa la sangre hacia los pulmones por medio de las arterias pulmonares.  Los pulmones renuevan la sangre con una nueva carga de oxígeno. Además, los pulmones exhalan el dióxido de carbono de desecho.  La sangre rica en oxígeno ingresa en el lado izquierdo del corazón, que se compone de la aurícula y el ventrículo izquierdos.  El lado izquierdo del corazón bombea la sangre a través de la aorta para suministrar oxígeno y nutrientes a los tejidos del cuerpo.   Válvulas cardíacas  Existen cuatro válvulas cardíacas que aseguran que la sangre circule en la dirección correcta, al abrirse solo en un sentido y únicamente cuando es necesario. Para funcionar como corresponde, la válvula debe estar formada adecuadamente, debe abrirse por completo y debe cerrarse con firmeza para que no se produzcan pérdidas. Las cuatro válvulas son las siguientes:   Tricúspide  Mitral  Pulmonar  Aórtica   Los latidos del corazón  El corazón se contrae y se relaja en un ciclo continuo.   Durante la contracción (sístole), los ventrículos se contraen e impulsan la sangre hacia los vasos que llegan a los pulmones y al resto del cuerpo.  Durante la relajación (diástole), los ventrículos se llenan de la sangre proveniente de las cavidades superiores (aurículas izquierda y derecha).   Sistema eléctrico  El sistema eléctrico del corazón es lo que lo hace latir y controla el intercambio continuo de la sangre rica en oxígeno con la sangre con poco oxígeno. Este intercambio es lo que te mantiene con vida.   Los impulsos eléctricos comienzan arriba en la aurícula derecha y se desplazan por medio de canales específicos hacia los ventrículos, dándole al corazón la señal de bombear.  El sistema de conducción mantiene el corazón latiendo a un ritmo normal y coordinado, que es lo que hace circular la sangre.   Distintas causas de enfermedades cardíacas  Las causas de las enfermedades cardíacas pueden variar según el tipo de enfermedad cardíaca.  Causas de la enfermedad cardiovascular  Si bien la expresión «enfermedad cardiovascular» puede referirse a distintos problemas cardíacos o vasculares, con frecuencia, el término se utiliza para indicar el daño al corazón o a los vasos sanguíneos provocado por la ateroesclerosis, que es la acumulación de placas de grasa en las arterias. La acumulación de placas engrosa y endurece las paredes de las arterias, lo que puede impedir el flujo de sangre de las arterias hacia los órganos y tejidos.  La ateroesclerosis es la causa más frecuente de enfermedad cardiovascular. Puede originarse en problemas que pueden corregirse, como una dieta no saludable, la falta de ejercicio, el sobrepeso y el tabaquismo.     Desarrollo de aterosclerosis Desarrollo de aterosclerosis La ateroesclerosis es un proceso en el cual la sangre, las grasas, como el colesterol, y otras sustancias se acumulan en las paredes de las arterias. Con el tiempo, se forman depósitos denominados «placas». Los depósitos pueden estrechar o bloquear las arterias. Estas placas también se pueden romper y provocar coágulos sanguíneos.     Causas de las arritmias cardíacas  Las causas más frecuentes del ritmo cardíaco anormal (arritmia) o de las enfermedades que pueden producir arritmia son las siguientes:   Defectos cardíacos de nacimiento (defectos cardíacos congénitos)  Enfermedad de las arterias coronarias  Presión arterial alta  Diabetes  Tabaquismo  Consumo excesivo de alcohol o de cafeína  Abuso de drogas  Estrés  Ciertos medicamentos recetados y de venta libre, suplementos dietéticos y remedios a base de hierbas  Enfermedad de las válvulas cardíacas   En personas sanas con un corazón normal y sano, no es frecuente que se produzca una arritmia mortal sin que exista un desencadenante externo, como un choque eléctrico o el consumo de drogas ilegales. Esto ocurre, principalmente, porque el corazón de una persona sana no presenta anomalías que puedan provocar una arritmia, como puede ser una zona de tejido cicatrizado.  Sin embargo, en un corazón enfermo o con malformaciones, los impulsos eléctricos del corazón pueden no empezar o no desplazarse adecuadamente a través del corazón, lo que aumenta las probabilidades de que se produzca una arritmia.  Causas de los defectos cardíacos congénitos  Por lo general, los defectos cardíacos congénitos se forman cuando el bebé está en el útero. Los defectos cardíacos se desarrollan cuando se desarrolla el corazón, esto es, aproximadamente, un mes después de la concepción, y alteran el flujo de sangre en el corazón. Ciertas enfermedades, algunos medicamentos y los genes pueden incidir sobre el desarrollo de defectos cardíacos.  Los defectos cardíacos también pueden presentarse en adultos. A medida que envejeces, la estructura del corazón puede modificarse y provocar un defecto cardíaco.  Causas de cardiomiopatía  Las causas de la cardiomiopatía, que es un engrosamiento o alargamiento del músculo cardíaco, pueden variar según el tipo:   Cardiomiopatía dilatada. La causa de este tipo de cardiomiopatía, que es el más frecuente, por lo general, no puede identificarse. Puede originarse debido a la reducción del flujo sanguíneo al corazón (enfermedad cardíaca isquémica), provocado por el daño que se produce después de un ataque cardíaco y de infecciones, así como por la acción de toxinas y de ciertos medicamentos. También puede heredarse de un padre. Por lo general, produce el agrandamiento (dilatación) del ventrículo izquierdo.  Cardiomiopatía hipertrófica. Este tipo, en el que el músculo del corazón se torna más grueso de lo normal, por lo general, es hereditario. Además, puede manifestarse con el tiempo a causa de la presión arterial alta o de la edad.  Cardiomiopatía restrictiva. Este tipo menos frecuente de cardiomiopatía, que hace que el músculo cardíaco se torne rígido y menos elástico, puede aparecer sin motivos conocidos. También puede producirse a causa de otras enfermedades, como los trastornos del tejido conjuntivo, la acumulación excesiva de hierro en el organismo (hemocromatosis), la acumulación de proteínas anormales (amiloidosis) o algunos tratamientos oncológicos.   Causas de infecciones cardíacas  Una infección cardíaca, como la endocarditis, se produce cuando un irritante, como las bacterias, los virus o las sustancias químicas, llega al músculo cardíaco. Las causas de infecciones cardíacas más frecuentes son las siguientes:   Bacterias  Virus  Parásitos   Causas de la enfermedad de las válvulas cardíacas  Existen distintas causas que provocan la enfermedad de las válvulas cardíacas. La enfermedad valvular puede ser congénita o bien ser consecuencia del daño producido por enfermedades como las siguientes:   Fiebre reumática  Infección (endocarditis infecciosa)  Trastornos del tejido conjuntivo   Factores de riesgo Los factores de riesgo para desarrollar una enfermedad cardíaca comprenden los siguientes:   Edad. El envejecimiento aumenta el riesgo de que las arterias se dañen y se estrechen, y de que el músculo cardíaco se debilite o engrose.  Sexo. En general, los hombres corren mayor riesgo de padecer enfermedades cardíacas. Sin embargo, el riesgo para las mujeres aumenta después de la menopausia.  Antecedentes familiares. Los antecedentes familiares de enfermedades cardíacas aumentan tu riesgo de padecer enfermedad de las arterias coronarias, especialmente, si uno de tus padres la desarrolló a temprana edad (antes de los 55 años para un familiar hombre, como tu hermano o tu padre, y antes de los 65 años para una familiar mujer, como tu madre o hermana).  Fumar. La nicotina contrae los vasos sanguíneos, y el monóxido de carbono puede dañar su revestimiento interno, lo que los vuelve más propensos a la ateroesclerosis. Los ataques cardíacos son más frecuentes en fumadores que en no fumadores.  Mala alimentación. Una dieta con alto contenido de grasas, azúcar y colesterol puede contribuir al desarrollo de la enfermedad cardíaca.  Presión arterial alta. La presión arterial alta no controlada puede producir el endurecimiento y el engrosamiento de las arterias, lo que estrecha los vasos por los que circula la sangre.  Niveles altos de colesterol en sangre. Los niveles altos de colesterol en sangre pueden aumentar el riesgo de que se formen placas y de ateroesclerosis.  Diabetes. La diabetes aumenta el riesgo de enfermedades cardíacas. Ambos trastornos comparten factores de riesgo similares, como obesidad y presión arterial alta. Obesidad. El exceso de peso normalmente empeora otros factores de riesgo.  Falta de actividad física. La falta de ejercicio también está asociada con muchas formas de enfermedad cardíaca y con algunos de sus otros factores de riesgo.  Estrés. El estrés sin tratar puede dañar las arterias y empeorar otros factores de riesgo de enfermedades cardíacas.  Higiene deficiente. No lavarte las manos de forma regular y no generar otros hábitos que pueden ayudarte a prevenir las infecciones víricas o bacterianas puede ponerte en riesgo de contraer infecciones cardíacas, especialmente, si ya tienes una enfermedad cardíaca no diagnosticada. La higiene dental deficiente también puede contribuir a las enfermedades cardíacas.   Complicaciones Las complicaciones de la enfermedad cardíaca comprenden las siguientes:   Insuficiencia cardíaca. La insuficiencia cardíaca, una de las complicaciones más frecuentes de la enfermedad cardíaca, se produce cuando el corazón no puede bombear sangre suficiente para satisfacer las necesidades del organismo. La insuficiencia cardíaca puede deberse a muchas formas de enfermedades cardíacas, entre ellas, defectos cardíacos, enfermedad cardiovascular, enfermedad cardíaca valvular, infecciones cardíacas o cardiomiopatía.  Ataque cardíaco. Un coágulo sanguíneo que bloquea el flujo de sangre a través de un vaso sanguíneo que irriga al corazón provoca un ataque cardíaco, lo que posiblemente daña o destruye una parte del músculo cardíaco. La ateroesclerosis puede provocar un ataque cardíaco.  Accidente cerebrovascular. Los factores de riesgo que provocan la enfermedad cardiovascular también pueden provocar un accidente cerebrovascular isquémico, que sucede cuando las arterias que se dirigen al cerebro están estrechadas u obstruidas, por lo que es muy poca la sangre que llega al cerebro. Un accidente cerebrovascular es una urgencia médica: a los pocos minutos el tejido cerebral comienza a morir.  Aneurisma. Un aneurisma (complicación grave que puede ocurrir en cualquier parte del cuerpo) es una protuberancia en la pared de la arteria. Si se rompe un aneurisma, es posible que haya sangrado interno que ponga en riesgo la vida.  Enfermedad arterial periférica. La ateroesclerosis también puede provocar enfermedad arterial periférica. Cuando padeces enfermedad arterial periférica, las extremidades (generalmente las piernas) no reciben un flujo sanguíneo suficiente. Esto provoca síntomas, especialmente dolor en la pierna al caminar (claudicación).  Paro cardíaco repentino. El paro cardíaco repentino es la pérdida súbita e inesperada de la función cardíaca, la respiración y el conocimiento, a menudo a causa de una arritmia. Un paro cardíaco repentino es una emergencia médica. Si no se trata de inmediato, es mortal; provoca la muerte súbita por ataque cardíaco.   Prevención Ciertas enfermedades del corazón, como los defectos cardíacos, no pueden prevenirse. Sin embargo, puedes ayudar a prevenir muchas otras enfermedades cardíacas haciendo los mismos cambios de estilo de vida que pueden mejorar la enfermedad cardíaca que tienes, tales como:   Dejar de fumar  Controlar otras enfermedades, como la presión arterial alta o el colesterol alto y la diabetes  Hacer ejercicio por lo menos 30 minutos diarios la mayoría de los días de la semana  Seguir una dieta baja en sal y grasas saturadas  Mantener un peso saludable  Reducir y controlar el estrés  Practicar buenos hábitos de higiene   by Escrito por personal de Mayo Clinic    Enfermedad cardíaca care at Mayo Clinic   Solicite una Consulta en Mayo Clinic  Diagnóstico y tratamiento  Feb. 23, 2018    Comparte en:    References  What is cardiovascular disease?

First study of blacks and whites reveals much higher risk over lifetime        January 24, 2012
					
						 | By Marla Paul         CHICAGO --- Will you have a heart attack or a stroke in your lifetime? Your odds may be worse than you think.  Men and women may have a false sense of security about their chances of having a heart attack or stroke based on the current practice of calculating a patient’s risk 10 years into the future. New Northwestern Medicine research shows a young or middle-aged adult who is at low risk in the short term may be at very high risk in the long term -- if he or she has just one or two risk factors such as higher than optimal cholesterol or blood pressure levels.  This is the first study to examine the lifetime risk of heart disease in white and black men and women. Previous studies have been in whites and predominantly males. It’s also the first study to look at the entire adult age spectrum. The research also looked at the risk across multiple birth cohorts and found the effect of the risk factors remained consistent regardless of the decade in which a person was born.  The study is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Part of the Cardiovascular Lifetime Risk Pooling Project, the research tracks more than 250,000 participants from 18 different groups of people living in the community over a period of more than 50 years. The patients’ risk factors for cardiovascular disease -- blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking status and diabetes status -- were measured at ages 45, 55, 65 and 75 years for each participant.  “We are giving incomplete and misleading risk information if we only focus on the next 10 years of someone’s life,” said principal investigator Donald Lloyd-Jones, MD, chair and associate professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. “With even just one risk factor, the likelihood is very large that someone will develop a major cardiovascular event that will kill them or substantially diminish their quality of life or health.”  The risk-factor profile was considered optimal when a participant had a total cholesterol level of less than 180 milligrams per deciliter and untreated blood pressure of less than 120 over less than 80, was a nonsmoker and did not have diabetes.  The new research on long-term risk may be important in estimating the future burden of cardiovascular disease in the general population, Lloyd-Jones noted.  Some key findings of the study:  Men who are 45 years old and have all risk factors at optimal levels have a 1.4 percent risk of having a heart attack or stroke or other form of death from heart disease while having two or more risk factors hike the risk to 49.5 percent.  For 45-year-old women with all risk factors being optimal, the chance of having a heart attack or stroke in their lifetimes is 4.1 percent while having two or more risk factors boost it to 30.7 percent.  “Just even one small increase in risk, from all optimal risk factors to one that isn’t optimal, like slightly elevated cholesterol or blood pressure, significantly bumps up a person’s lifetime risk,” Lloyd-Jones said. (Non-optimal means a person doesn’t have diabetes and doesn’t smoke but either cholesterol is 180 to 199 or blood pressure is 120 to 130 on top or 80 to 89 on the bottom. These numbers aren’t at levels that need to be treated with medication, but they are still higher than desired.)  Women have a higher risk than men for a stroke over their lifetimes but a lower risk for a heart attack.  African-Americans have higher risk factors such as more hypertension and diabetes than whites, but because they also tend to die at younger ages, their lifetime risk of having a heart attack or stroke ends up being the same as whites.  “This study underscores the importance of lifestyle -- particularly diet, exercise and smoking cessation -- all the lifestyle patterns that are important in reducing the development of the risk factors in the first place,” said Jarett Berry, MD, who worked on the study when he was at Northwestern’s Feinberg School and is now assistant professor of medicine at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.  “We need to do a much better job of making sure these risk factors don’t develop in the first place, getting kids and young adults off to better starts so they don’t gain weight and are following healthier lifestyles throughout their lives,” Lloyd-Jones said.  Lloyd-Jones pointed out that maintaining the full package of optimal risk factors through middle age had a dramatic effect on the remainder of a person’s life. “It appears that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts,” he said.  The research was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

Lead writer: Chris Woolston  February 29, 2016       Each year heart attacks kill more than 150,000 Americans, nearly half of them women. If such a grim statistic can have a bright side, it's this: Most heart attacks today aren't fatal.  About 75% of men and 60% of women live at least one year after an attack. Who is most at risk? While most heart attack victims are middle-aged or olderthe average age for a first attack is 66 for men and 70 for womenpeople in their 20s and 30s suffer attacks too. The risk of a heart attack climbs for men after age 45 and for women after age 55. When do heart attacks strike? Heart attacks occur roughly every 35 seconds in the United States, and most occur in the morning, a time when the platelets in the blood are especially "sticky" and prone to form clots. Early Warning Signs Heart attack symptoms can be subtle Watch video More on heart attack "I Stopped My Diabetes Meds and Had a Heart Attack" 10 Risk Factors for Heart Disease      At least one study, however, has found that morning isn't a prime time for heart attacks among people who regularly take aspirin, which helps keep platelets from sticking together. Beating the odds Survival odds for people who have had a heart attack keep getting better thanks to advances in diagnosis, medication, and lifesaving technology. It's worth noting that survival rates for heart attack patients are better on weekdays compared to weekends, because medical personnel are more likely to use invasive procedures (including angioplasty and bypass surgery) during the week. Nonetheless, cardiologists are optimistic about the rate of improvement in cardiac care. When Sharonne Hayes, MD, director of the Mayo Clinic's Women's Heart Clinic, started practicing in the mid-1980s, doctors couldn't do much for people having heart attacks. "Now we can stop a heart attack in its tracks," she says. "Patients have a much better chance at recovery."

  into changing lifestyles            A man holds his chest as he suffers from a heart attack (posed by model)  Photo: Alamy                  By Laura Donnelly , Health Editor   10:00PM GMT 08 Mar 2015   Follow        The NHS has launched a controversial calculator which predicts when you will have a heart attack or stroke - and compares a person’s “heart age” with their biological age. Health experts said the online tool would give individuals “a wake-up call” - pushing those at risk of heart disease into making lifestyle changes to protect themselves from the UK’s biggest killer. But some critics raised concerns about the accuracy of a “blunt tool” which tells every Briton they will have a heart attack or stroke one day, when many will not, and raised fears that the tool could be used to push millions more people into taking medication. They also expressed concern that individuals would be frightened by being given a prediction, much of which is based on factors beyond their control, such as their family history of disease. Last month a study found that some of the most widely-used risk calculators in use in the United States were exaggerating the risks of heart disease, by more than double. GPs will be asked to promote the new NHS calculator, in a bid to encourage patients to take steps to improve their health - such as losing weight, or giving up smoking – or to start taking medication to lower cholesterol and statins. The tool, which has launched online, asks individuals to provide basic facts – such as age height, weight, smoking – plus some details of their medical history, and whether relatives have suffered from heart disease before the age of 60.

The calculator then provides an estimate of a person’s “heart age” – and most controversially, predicts when they will suffer a heart attack or stroke. It also provides the percentage chance of a heart attack or stroke within a decade. It means a woman of 41, with an unhealthy lifestyle, medical problems such as diabetes, and a family history of heart disease could be warned that she is likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke around the age of 51. Another woman the same age, with a different lifestyle and family history could be told she is likely to get to the age of 83 before being consigned to such a fate. A man of 50 who smokes, suffers a number of medical problems and a family history of heart disease, could be he told he is likely to have a heart attack or stroke at 56. A healthier man of the same age, with a different family history could expect to live to 79 without a heart attack or stroke, according to the calculator, which provides estimates to anyone over the age of 30. The calculator is a collaboration between NHS Choices, Public Health England and the British Heart Foundation (BHF). Professor John Deanfield, an NHS cardiologist who helped develop the tool, said: “Understanding your heart age can be a real wake up call for people who might be at risk. It can be that all important nudge to take action and make lifestyle changes to improve your heart health.” Dr Aseem Malhotra, Honorary consultant cardiologist, at Frimley Park Hospital, was far more cautious. He said: “It is important to help identify those at risk of heart disease, but I really hope this has been properly evaluated; we don’t want to make the same mistakes we have seen in the US, where calculators enormously exaggerated the risks.” He also raised concerns about whether the information would be used to scare millions more people into taking statins, amid heated arguments about the benefits and risks of the drugs. Last July, health watchdogs recommended that statins should be offered to around 17 million people – anyone estimated to have a 10 per cent chance of developing heart disease within a decade.   The tool provides the percentage chance of a heart attack or stroke within a decade (Getty)  Some doctors criticised the plans, fearing that the “mass medicalisation” of the public would put too many at risk of side-effects. Dr Malhotra said he was concerned that the new NHS tool does not take account of basic lifestyle factors – such as the type of diet people ate, and how much exercise they took. “It is a pretty crude evaluation to only use weight as a proxy for lifestyle,” he said. Coronary heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the UK and in 2013, more than 18,000 people died prematurely this way. Most deaths from coronary heart disease are caused by heart attacks with an average of 90,000 attacks in England per year. Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, said: “Too many people are dying prematurely from preventable conditions and there is clear evidence that factors like smoking and high blood pressure play a major role in this.” He said the heart age tool helped people to see the “direct impact” that lifestyle changes could make on their heart’s health. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: “Knowing your risk of developing heart and circulatory disease is crucial to taking control of your health. Armed with this knowledge you can start to make lifestyle changes to help protect yourself against heart attacks and strokes.” The NHS is also developing a similar system of dementia screening , which aims to give middle-aged people their “brain age” and an estimate of how likely they are to develop conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.        telegraph.co.uk     Follow @telegraph                          Top news galleries       Woody Allen's 30 best one-liners          Comedy    Martin Chilton selects 30 great one-liners from the comedian and film

Save Everyday Health   Heart Health   Heart Health  The Single Best Predictor of a Heart Attack Previous Next   Each year close to 1.4 million Americans experience a heart attack , and more than 500,000 die from it. Strikingly, according to the Society for Heart Attack Prevention and Eradication, 50 to 70 percent of those who suffered fatal heart attacks were not even aware of their risk. Despite recent scientific advances in heart disease prevention, many high-risk patients are overlooked when conventional risk assessment methods such as cholesterol and blood pressure screenings are used alone. Here’s what you need to know about the No. 1 predictor of a heart attack, the calcium score, plus eight other risk factors to consider.   The Calcium Score A calcium score , obtained from a noninvasive computed tomography (CT) scan of your heart, is the measure of the amount of calcium in your coronary arteries. This number reflects the total amount of atherosclerotic plaque. It’s an indication of how all of your risk factors interact with each other to cause heart disease. The higher your calcium score for your age, the greater your risk of a heart attack or stroke. Many preventive cardiologists are recommending that asymptomatic men over age 40 and most postmenopausal women over age 50 have a heart scan to determine their calcium score, unless they have been determined by a doctor to be at very low risk. A calcium score of zero means you have no calcium deposits and a low risk of heart attack in the next five years. A score of 400 or more puts you at high risk of a heart attack within 10 years; a score of 1,000-plus means you have up to a 25 percent chance of having a heart attack within a year without medical treatment. The significance of a given score also depends on your age. For instance, if you’re 40 and have a score of 50, it indicates you are at high risk. If an 80-year-old has a score of 50, it indicates low risk because the atherosclerotic process has proceeded very slowly. If your score is high for your age, then your doctor may advise adopting a heart-healthy diet, such as the South Beach Diet, along with other lifestyle changes, and often medications, to improve your risk profile. It may be a statin to lower cholesterol and/or a medication to lower your blood pressure. You can get a CT scan for coronary calcium at most major medical centers, with the cost ranging from $99 to $399. The test takes about 10 minutes and radiation is minimal, about the same as a mammogram. Check with your insurance carrier to see if this test is covered.   Family History of Heart Disease If one or both of your parents died prematurely of a heart attack, it puts you at greater risk. Still, there are other factors to consider when it comes to family history . If your father smoked, rarely exercised, and ate a diet high in bad carbs and bad fats, his death could have been hastened by any or all of those factors. You may have been dealt a bad set of genes, but there’s a great deal you can do when it comes to lifestyle to reduce and even eliminate the familial risk. Often, medications are also needed to overcome the effect of bad genes. While, many people know the cardiovascular health of their parents influences their level of risk, they are unaware that the health of their siblings matters, too. If you have a brother or sister with cardiovascular disease, your own risk is increased by as much as 100 percent. In fact, if you grew up in the same household as your sibling, your sibling’s medical history is likely to be even more informative than your parents’. You and your brothers and sisters not only have similar genes, but you also ate similar food and grew up in the same environment.   Smoking and Heart Disease Risk At any age, smoking at least doubles your risk of heart disease. In fact, smoking can trigger a heart attack even if your arteries are nearly perfect. Once you light up, smoking narrows your arteries, raises your blood pressure, increases your risk of irregular heartbeat, and makes your blood sticky and more likely to clot. Smoking also lowers your HDL (“good”) cholesterol and increases arterial inflammation. This is the perfect recipe for a heart attack. If you smoke, and particularly if you have other risk factors for heart disease, each time you light a cigarette, you’re playing Russian roulette with your heart. A smoker who has high blood pressure and high LDL (“bad”) cholesterol has 14 times the normal risk of having cardiovascular disease. A woman who takes birth control pills (which increase the risk of blood clots) and who also smokes has a much greater risk of heart disease than does a woman who takes birth control pills but does not smoke. In young people with heart attacks, smoking is often the biggest culprit.   Diagnosis of Diabetes or Prediabetes If you are an American age 40 to 70, the odds are about 40 percent that you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes or prediabetes (also known as metabolic syndrome and typically characterized by increased waist circumference, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low good HDL cholesterol, and a mildly elevated blood sugar). Diabetes is such a strong risk factor for heart disease that medical professionals define it as a “coronary heart disease risk equivalent.” This means that a person with diabetes has the same high risk of a heart attack as someone who has already had one. Up to 70 percent of people in coronary care units have prediabetes or diabetes. Women, take note: If you have diabetes and have suffered a heart attack, you have an even greater risk of having another heart attack or heart failure than a man who has diabetes and has suffered a heart attack.   Waist Circumference and Your Heart The circumference of your waist is an indicator of your odds of having a heart attack or stroke. If you have an apple-shaped body and carry much of your weight around your middle, you are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease than if you have a pear-shaped body and store fat mainly in your buttocks and thighs, or evenly over your entire body. Studies have found that waist circumference is an excellent predictor of who will develop diabetes and heart disease. A waist circumference of more than 35 inches if you’re a women (and 40 inches if you’re a man) puts you at risk. Get rid of that extra belly fat through diet and exercise.   High Blood Pressure About one in three American adults has high blood pressure , also called hypertension. High blood pressure is currently defined as a reading of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, but guidelines regarding what constitutes “high” versus “normal” keep changing. Right now, blood pressure anywhere between 120/80 (normal) and 139/89 are labeled prehypertension. The American Heart Association estimates that 65 million Americans are in this category. It also estimates that people with prehypertension may be three times as likely to have a heart attack as those with normal blood pressure. Although blood pressure can vary from minute to minute with exercise, stress, sleep, and even changes in posture when at rest and relaxed, it should normally be less than 120/80 mm Hg for both men and women age 20 and older.   Cholesterol and Your Heart Total cholesterol, when considered alone, is a poor predictor of heart disease and heart attack. Studies show that total cholesterol levels among people who’ve had heart attacks are almost the same as those of people who haven’t, and that roughly half of heart attacks occur in people without high cholesterol . If you have other risk factors for heart disease, particularly a family history, having your HDL and LDL particle size measured with an advanced blood test will give you a far clearer picture of your heart risk than the conventional lipid panel. Having a lot of large particles cuts your risk for a heart attack, while having a lot of small ones raises it. You do not want more than 15 percent of your particles to be the small, dense type.   Triglycerides and Your Heart Triglycerides are the form in which fat is stored in your body’s fat cells. Your triglyceride level is almost always strongly influenced by lifestyle. If you have high triglycerides (over 150 mg/dL is borderline high) and low HDL (less than 40 mg/dL if you’re a man and less than 50 mg/dL if you’re a woman), your risk of heart disease is compounded. To find out if you have this added risk, divide your triglyceride count by your HDL count. Ideally, the resulting number will be 2 or lower. For example, if your triglyceride level is 200 and your HDL is 40, divide 200 by 40 and you get 5. This is much higher than the desirable ratio, and it tells you that you have a heightened risk of a heart attack that will need to be addressed. Your triglyceride level can also offer insight into your LDL particle size. In general, the higher your triglycerides and the lower your HDL, the smaller and denser your LDL and the greater your risk of heart disease. If your triglycerides are higher than 200 and your HDL is lower than 45, it is likely that you have too many small, dense LDL particles.   A Sedentary Lifestyle and Your Heart A life with little to no physical activity leads to a number of undesirable body changes. Your blood pressure goes up, your triglycerides increase, your level of good HDL falls (this is why triglycerides and HDL are often called the “lifestyle” numbers), and you are more likely to gain weight, especially around your midsection. This is a picture of a heart attack in the making. No wonder the AARP recently called sitting the new smoking. The sad news is that two-thirds of American adults report that they are physically inactive — that is, they are sedentary most of the time. It’s time to get up and get moving .   What You Can Do to Improve Your Heart Disease Risk Factors Beyond understanding your risk factors, getting the correct tests, and taking medications as prescribed, the most important step you can take to minimize your risk of heart attack and sudden death is to engage in a healthy lifestyle. That means shedding any extra pounds by adopting a heart-healthy diet, like the South Beach Diet, that focuses on nutrient-dense, fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, in addition to good fats and lean protein. It means making time for at least 20 minutes of aerobic or core-strengthening exercise most days of the week . And it means getting plenty of restorative sleep. Not only will these three steps help you lose weight and keep it off (yes, lack of sleep promotes weight gain), they will also help lower your blood pressure, improve insulin resistance in those with prediabetes and diabetes, and counter most of the other risk factors you’ve just read about. It’s an encouraging fact: The earlier you start making these healthy lifestyle changes, the better your chances of avoiding a heart attack down the road.

Heart disease is the single biggest killer of Australians, but it can mostly be prevented.  There’s no one cause for heart disease, but there are risk factors that increase your chance of developing it. The more risk factors you have, the bigger your risk is of a heart attack or stroke.  You might not know you have some of these risk factors. The best way to find out your overall risk is to see your doctor or health practitioner for a heart health check .  If you’ve already had a heart attack or stroke, read more about looking after yourself to avoid another.  Risks you can’t change  There are a few risks you can’t do much about:   Age: As you get older, your risk of heart disease increases.  Gender: Men are at higher risk of heart disease. Women’s risk grows and may be equal to men after menopause.  Ethnic background: People of some origins (e.g. from the Indian sub-continent) have higher risk. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have more risk because of lifestyle factors.  Family history: If someone in your family has had a heart attack, speak to your doctor or health practitioner about your risk.   Risks you can change  Most heart disease risk factors can be changed, and there’s plenty you can do about them.         Smoking  Being smoke free is one of the best ways to protect your heart.

Heart disease is the single biggest killer of Australians, but it can mostly be prevented.  There’s no one cause for heart disease, but there are risk factors that increase your chance of developing it. The more risk factors you have, the bigger your risk is of a heart attack or stroke.  You might not know you have some of these risk factors. The best way to find out your overall risk is to see your doctor or health practitioner for a heart health check .  If you’ve already had a heart attack or stroke, read more about looking after yourself to avoid another.  Risks you can’t change  There are a few risks you can’t do much about:   Age: As you get older, your risk of heart disease increases.  Gender: Men are at higher risk of heart disease. Women’s risk grows and may be equal to men after menopause.  Ethnic background: People of some origins (e.g. from the Indian sub-continent) have higher risk. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have more risk because of lifestyle factors.  Family history: If someone in your family has had a heart attack, speak to your doctor or health practitioner about your risk.   Risks you can change  Most heart disease risk factors can be changed, and there’s plenty you can do about them.         Smoking  Being smoke free is one of the best ways to protect your heart.
