Odds of Conceiving Twins Naturally or With Fertility Treatment    By Rachel Gurevich  | Reviewed by Anita Sadaty, MD    Updated February 25, 2018            Share       Pin       Email      Print                  Niki Mareschal / Photographer's Choice / Getty Images       More in Getting Pregnant        Trying to Conceive       Fertility Challenges     Are You Pregnant?        What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

After all, they're always the same sex, they look exactly alike, they often dress the same (or at least their mothers dress them the same when they're little), and they tend to share certain mannerisms and other features. A frequently asked questions about identical twins is, "Do they have the same DNA?" Read on the learn the answer, and why it matters.         How Identical Twins Are Formed The medical name for identical twins is monozygotic twins. Mono means one and zygote means a cell that's formed by an egg plus a sperm—so identical twins are created when a single zygote splits into two. As the two zygotes travel to the uterus, they each continue to divide and grow. Scientists don't know what causes a single zygote to separate into two individual ones. Technically it's considered a malfunction of the normal development process. The two separate beings who are created in this way share the same DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA is made up of the chromosomes that contain the genetic information that determines everything about us—from the color of our hair and eyes to our athletic ability and personality traits. Even though identical twins share the same DNA, they aren't necessarily exactly alike. Environmental factors can influence a person's physical appearance, for example, and epigenetic factors create differences as twins age.   The epigenome describes chemical changes within DNA as an organism ages. These factors explain why identical twins can be different , whether in appearance, temperament, or personality. Identical or Fraternal? The odds of having identical twins is about 3 in 1,000 and about a third of all twins are monozygotic.         The majority of twins are dizygotic , produced when two separate eggs are fertilized by two different sperm. One way to find out if a pair of twins of the same gender is identical or fraternal (different-sex twins are always fraternal), is through DNA testing. A sample of DNA is obtained by swabbing the inside of each twin's cheek, then the samples are submitted to a service that, usually for a fee, will analyze and compare the DNA from each individual. A typical DNA test performed on monozygotic twins will return results with 99.99 percent similarity. However, DNA from non-identical (fraternal or dizygotic) twins will generally be about 50 percent to 75 percent similar. For many twins or families with twins, the only way to know for sure whether they are identical or fraternal is through DNA testing. Getting Away With Murder? Because identical twins have the same DNA, it is nearly impossible to distinguish between these individuals when analyzing DNA for paternity testing or for evidence of a crime. Many literary mysteries, soap operas, and crime dramas have used this fact as a plot line. How often is it an issue in real life, however? Could identical twins pull off the perfect crime?         It has happened. In January 2009, a set of identical twins were suspected in a German jewelry heist. Three thieves entered a luxury department store by sliding down ropes strung from the skylights and escaped with jewelry worth more than $6 million. Investigators were able to extract a DNA sample from a drop of sweat found on a discarded latex glove found at the scene and identified two suspects, identical twins Hassan and Abbas O. (German law doesn't allow full names to be revealed.) Both men were arrested and charged but ultimately were released when it wasn't possible to identify which one had been involved in the crime.  At this time, the technology does not exist to analyze DNA on the level required to distinguish between samples from identical twins. However, it's hoped that DNA testing will evolve to a level where it can detect the subtle epigenetic changes that exist in twins. Not only would it be useful to forensic scientists, but it would also help identify genetic significances associated with cancer and other diseases. Interestingly, a more old-fashioned technique in crime investigation actually can be used to discriminate between twins. Fingerprint evidence can help "point the finger" at criminals, even if they are identical twins. That's because even identical twins have unique fingerprints.

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

When your twins are a boy and girl pair, the answer is easy, but people don't always realize it. Many think that being identical twins refers to how twins look and not how they form. Take a look at the biology that determines the sex combinations that are possible with identical and fraternal twins. Can Boy/Girl Twins Be Identical? The short answer is no.         They are always fraternal. The terms identical and fraternal don't describe what the twins look like, but actually how they form. Identical ( monozygotic ) twins are always of the same sex because they form from a single zygote (fertilized egg) that contains either male (XY) or female (XX) sex chromosomes. Therefore, boy/girl twins are always fraternal or ( dizygotic ); they can only form from two separate eggs that are fertilized by two separate sperm. Fraternal twins can be either two girls, two boys, or one of each. These are the possible sex combinations: Two girl twins can be either identical or fraternal (monozygotic or dizygotic). Two boy twins can be either identical or fraternal (monozygotic or dizygotic). A set of boy/girl twins can only be fraternal (dizygotic). Boy/girl twins cannot be identical (monozygotic). Identical Twins Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg that splits into two.   Before it splits, it is either male or female. After it splits, there are either two males or two females. Both parts of the fertilized egg implant in the uterus and each produces one of the twins. Identical twins have the same genetic origin. No direct cause of monozygotic twinning has been determined; it is not hereditary.         Monozygotic twins represent about one-third of all twins. They may look remarkably similar, and it may be difficult to tell them apart . Fraternal Twins Fraternal twins are two genetically unique individuals as they come from two separate eggs that are fertilized by separate sperm. The resulting egg/sperm combination can be male or female. The result is either two male twins, two female twins, or one male and one female. The genetic similarity between fraternal twins is the same as any two siblings (about 50 percent if they have the same mother and father). They may look alike, or not, just like any sisters and brothers. Fraternal twins are the most common form of twins, representing about two-thirds of all twins. Dizygotic twinning can be hereditary and run in families . Also, most twins and multiples that result from fertility enhancing treatments, such as drugs or procedures like in-vitro fertilization, are dizygotic rather than monozygotic. Exception to the Twin Sex Rule Every rule has exceptions, of course. In this case, they are extremely rare exceptions, and it's not likely that the average person would ever encounter twins in this situation. Note that there have been a few reported cases of a genetic mutation in monozygotic male twins.         For some reason, after the zygote splits, one twin loses a Y chromosome and develops as a female. The female twin would have Turner syndrome, characterized by short stature and lack of ovarian development. It's extremely rare; less than 10 cases have been confirmed. Given the odds, it's safe to assume that 99.9 percent of all boy/girl twins are fraternal. Twins That Are Genetically Dissimilar While identical twins come from the same fertilized egg and share the same DNA combination, there are more possibilities for fraternal twins. Besides being the offspring of two sperm and egg combinations, they may have different genetic donors.  Here are the different combinations: Fraternal twins could be produced when eggs from one woman are fertilized by sperm from two different men. This can happen with unassisted conception and with in-vitro fertilization. In this case, the twins would be half-siblings. A woman may carry twins conceived in-vitro with donor eggs, which could come from two different women. If they are fertilized by sperm from the same man, the twins would be half-siblings. Donor eggs from two different women could be fertilized by sperm from two different men. In this case, the twins may have no shared DNA unless the sperm and egg donors were related. They would be similar to step-siblings. A Word From Verywell You are likely to have to answer the same questions about your twins repeatedly.

Around 90% of all multiples are made up of twins; the remaining 10% is with triplets, quadruplets and very occasionally   quintuplets and more. In recent years there has been a big increase in the numbers of twins being born. This is due to advancing maternal age, assisted reproduction technology, as well as the use of fertility drugs.  Importantly, better neonatal care has meant that premature twins have a better chance of survival than ever before.  There are two types of twins – identical or monozygotic (one egg), and non-identical or dizygotic (two eggs) twins. Other names for identical twins are non-fraternal twins, and non-identical twins are sometimes called fraternal twins.  It is thought that twin pregnancies are far more common than we are aware of – perhaps as many as 5% of all pregnancies at 12 weeks involve a twin. Though not all will continue to develop as they need to in order to form two babies. Most commonly, this is thought to be due to a major interruption occurring with healthy cell maturation and division.  How do identical twins happen?  Identical twins form when one egg has been fertilised by one sperm and the zygote splits into two.  This happens at the very earliest stage of development, when the zygote is no more than a cluster of a few cells.  Dividing this early in conception means that each baby has exactly the same genetic information as the other.  Identical twins can also occur when one a woman has undergone fertility assistance and has had one fertilised egg returned to her uterus. If this egg then splits into two, an identical twin pregnancy can result.  Identical twins are not dependent on race, country or ethnicity. The odds of having identical twins are the same for every couple, in every pregnancy, wherever they live in the world.  Around one in every three sets of twins born is identical, and the remaining 2/3 is of the non-identical variety.  What increases the odds of having identical twins?   Luck needs to be on your side.  Identical twins do not run in families and can happen for any couple with any pregnancy.  Non-identical twins are influenced by genetics; women whose mothers or grandmothers had non-identical twins do have more chance of having non-identical twins themselves.  But identical twins are just random.  Some families do seem to have a higher than average number of identical twins. Though this can only be contributed to luck, coincidence and chance rather than any familial genetic tendency.   How do non-identical twins happen?  Non-identical twins are uniquely separate individuals who just happen to be gestating at the same time and place as each other. Non-identical twins form from two completely separate eggs which are fertilised by two completely separate sperm. These fraternal twins are no more alike than any other siblings in a family with the same biological mother and father.  Because identical twins share the same genes, they are always the same gender. But non-identical twins may be the same gender or the opposite because they only share 50% of the same genetic coding.  Some people still believe that the incidence of having twins skips a generation but this is not true.  What increases the odds of having non-identical twins?   Advancing maternal age.  Women who are aged in their 30’s and 40’s have significantly higher chances of conceiving with twins.  Younger women, especially those aged in their 20’s, do not have as much chance.  Having assisted reproductive technology, in particular taking medication which increases ovulation. This makes perfect sense because the more eggs which are supported towards maturity each month, and which are then released, means the more that are available to be fertilised.  The more pregnancies a woman has already had, the higher her chances of conceiving with non-identical twins.  If a woman is a fraternal-non-identical twin herself, if she has siblings who are fraternal twins or her mother/grandmother had fraternal twins, then she is more likely to as well.  Race – Black African women are more likely to have twins than women from any other ethnic descent.   What causes the fertilised egg to separate into two?  The exact reason why this happens is still a mystery. Over the years there has been a lot of research and time invested into finding out why some zygotes split into two and others don’t.  But the truth is we still do not know why.  In reality, the splitting of one fertilised egg is a malformation of the natural processes of conception.  When are identical twins actually formed?  Though all identical twins are formed very early in pregnancy, there is some variation in exactly how early the fertilised egg splits into two.  This can happen at the two cell stage on Day 2, the early blastocyst stage on Day 4, or in the late blastocyst stage on Day 6.  The stage when the egg splits into two will determine where the fertilised eggs will implant in the uterine wall.  Once the embryo gets to the 8 cells stage the foetal DNA takes over.  The stage at which the egg splits will also determine if the babies have their own amniotic membranes and placenta or if they share. Essentially, the earlier the egg splits, the more independent each twin will be by having their own amnion, chorion and placenta.  Early splitting also means that the twins are perhaps less identical than those who separate at the late blastocyst stage. Around a quarter of all identical twins are said to be mirror images of each other. This means that the left side of one twin exactly matches the right side of the other. How amazing is that!  Although identical twins share the same DNA and genetic coding, they are still unique little individuals. Small differences separate them and although at birth they can appear like little clones of each other, they are far from it. As identical twins grow, their unique qualities (particularly in relation to their personalities) become more apparent. The environment in which they are raised as well as their own personalities help to shape the adults they will become. This is exactly the same as any other baby born the world over.  How will I know if I’ve conceived with twins?  Because the splitting of the zygote occurs so early in pregnancy, mothers are not initially aware they have conceived with twins. It’s not until twins may be suspected because of the intensity of pregnancy symptoms, or if they have been diagnosed through ultrasound, that a couple may know they are expecting twins.  Is it obvious at birth that twins are identical?  Even at birth it can be difficult to be sure if twins are identical or non-identical. Identical twins can still be born with their own set of membranes and this is not a marker for them to be non-identical. It’s not always clear simply by looking or examining the twins to know if they are identical or not.  The only way to be 100% sure is to do DNA testing on each twin and see what genetic information they share. This can be done in the early neonatal period by taking a swab of tissue from inside each baby’s cheek. This is painless and non-invasive.  The other way to check is to take a blood test and do blood grouping. Identical twins will share the same genetic information so the same genetic markers can be identified. Whereas non-identical twins can be very different; much the same as any other siblings with the same parents. They share around half the same genetic information and traits with each other.  What are the risks of having identical twins?   If the identical twins share a placenta they are at a higher risk of having twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. This often results in one twin gaining more nourishment than the other, and having a higher birth weight as a result.  Umbilical cord entanglement and compression if the twins share an amniotic sac. Purely because of the crowded conditions which occur in the mother’s uterus. With identical and non-identical twins, there is an increased risk of pregnancy and birth complications. There is also an increased likelihood of prematurity and associated problems.

What caused the increase in multiples?  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby?  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

What caused the increase in multiples?  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby?  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples.

Odds of Conceiving Twins Naturally or With Fertility Treatment    By Rachel Gurevich  | Reviewed by Anita Sadaty, MD    Updated February 25, 2018            Share       Pin       Email      Print                  Niki Mareschal / Photographer's Choice / Getty Images       More in Getting Pregnant        Trying to Conceive       Fertility Challenges     Are You Pregnant?        What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

Yes, fertility drugs  No  Yes, IVF  Loading…            What is the birth rate for twins? Identical twins rates are equal to about 3.5 out of 1000 births, the birth rate for identical twins has not changed over the past few decades and is about the same nationwide. Worldwide, about 12-16 in 1000 people are naturally conceived twins. So, the chances of having twins are small. However,in 2010, births of twins in general in the U.S. were 33 in 1000 people. The birth rate for fraternal twins has risen by about 76% in the past 30 years. The obvious reason is fertility treatments but surprisingly, they are not the only reason. What factors affect the chances of having twins? The chances of a woman having identical twins are about the same for everyone, as identical twins do not tend to run in families. This is because identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting in two and this is a random, rare event. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, can be genetic. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs being fertilized by two sperm. Typically women only release one egg each cycle but women who conceive fraternal twins have released two. This is why fraternal twins can only be genetically connected through the mother, meaning the father’s genetics have nothing to do with twinning. Releasing more than one egg in a cycle is called hyper-ovulation and is controlled by certain genes. Women who conceive fraternal twins usually have high levels of these genes, which makes sense. So who is more likely to conceive fraternal twins? Your chances of having twins depend on six factors: 1. Body type Twins tend to be more common in larger women as well as woman who are tall. In one study, women with a BMI of 30 or above were nearly 1.5 times more likely to have twins than the women in the normal BMI range of 20 to 24.9. Those same women were more likely to have opposite sex twins than same sex twins as well. Researchers are still unsure why this is the case. 2. Ethnicity and location On the surface it appears that ethnicity plays a role in the chances of having twins, yet location seems to have a large part as well. The Yoruba tribe of Nigeria has the highest rate of twins at 45–50 twin sets (or 90–100 twins) per 1,000 live births, however being of Nigerian decent and living elsewhere doesn’t show the same correlation to twin births. In Central Africa there are 18–30 twin sets (or 36–60 twins) per 1,000 live births. North America and Europe (and caucasians in general) have intermediate rates of 9-16 twin sets per 1,000 live births Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (and hispanic and asian ethnicities in general) have the lowest rates of 6–9 twin sets per 1,000 live births. The difference in chances of having twins between geographic locations (more than ethnicity) begs the question of whether climate, diet, or lifestyle have more to do with the chances of having twins than anything else. 3. Diet We already know that diet does play a role. Women who eat full fat foods over non fat or low fat are more likely to conceive twins. This could be because fat is an important building block for pregnancy and those that eat more fat are better suited to carry two babies. It may also be that the difference in the amount of fat a woman eats affects hormones. Some information points to the daily consumption of yams being the reason Nigerian women have more chances of having twins. True yams contain a phytoestrogen that increases a woman’s follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and may cause hyper-ovulation. 4. Maternal Age Older woman tend to have a higher chance of fraternal twins. Women over 35 tend to produce more FSH than younger women and women with higher levels of these hormones are more likely to have twins. The increase in FSH levels also shows declining fertility, which means they are less likely to get pregnant, but more likely to have twins if they happen to conceive. 5. Number of Pregnancies The more pregnancies that a woman has had increase her chances of having twins. This could be a simple case of numbers. The more pregnancies you have the higher your chances of having twins. 6. Fertility Treatments Women who take certain types of fertility treatments have increased chances of having twins.  In vitro fertilization (IVF) increases your odds of having multiples by 20-40% depending on how many embryos are placed inside your womb. Some believe that IVF can also increase your chances of having identical twins but research doesn’t support this. Fertility drugs increase the odds of you releasing several eggs at the same time by stimulating your ovaries. These kinds of drugs increase your chances of having twins or multiples to 10% or higher, up to as much as 30%. Why twins are more common these days What has caused the rise in multiples? One possibility is that women are waiting until they are older to have babies. As we mentioned earlier, older women have higher chances of releasing more than one egg in a cycle, thus, increasing their chances of having twins. Another reason behind the rise in twins is the increased use of fertility drugs and other ways to assist a woman’s odds of conception. In the 1970’s when fertility treatment started becoming reliable, the incidence of twins almost doubled. Over the past decade, the rise in twins has steadied. This is probably due to the fact that fertility treatments have become more advanced and have lowered the risk for multiples while keeping the high possibility for conception. How will I know if I’m having twins? There are physical indicators like showing earlier than normal and higher HCG levels. Some women who have been pregnant with twins report higher than normal levels of morning sickness. However, an ultrasound is the only way to be sure. An ultrasound can usually detect twins as early as 8-14 weeks gestation. How about you? Did you dream of having twins while you were (or currently are!) pregnant?

I have your book and I LOVE IT! Thanks so much for all your work. Reply    Michele   Feb 25 at 6:06 am  Did you ever end up finding much?! I just found out we’re having twins and am having the same problem finding good information Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:23 pm  Hi my name is Theresa I see this is about fraternal twins but I have a question about the chances of having Identical twins. If you could tell me anything about it.  I know they say their not sure if it’s hereditary or not.  My sons wife is pregnant.  Her mother is an identical twin (her sister died at birth).  I have an identical twin sister.  My mother is an identical twin,  my father has identical twin sisters and my brother has identical twin girls.  Both sets of my great grand parents had twins also.  So the saying twins skip a generation are not true in our case. I have 4 boys ( no twins) I always felt that my son Zack ( the one that is expecting) would one day have identical twins.  They are just 12 weeks along so we don’t know yet if it is more than one.  I’d love to hear what you think or know about identicals thank you. Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:32 pm  Thank you I know they say identical twins are not hereditary or ran in family’s  but I think we could be a good case study because we have more then proven that they do!!! Reply    Deanne   Feb 1 at 7:04 pm  Quiz said I am unlikely to have twins–I have a set of fraternal twins! I have heard the gene for twinning is only expressed in women, but can be carried by men. My paternal grandfather was a twin, so I believe it! Reply    Briauna   Jan 1 at 9:02 pm  It said my chances of having twins were just average. I’m a 22 year old African American, 5’0 inches tall, living in California, my mother is the only fraternal twin I know about in my family and this is my first pregnancy. But surprisingly I’m having identical twin girls & I’m currently 30 weeks. Anything can happen ladies. ? Reply    HeatherM   Dec 24 at 11:41 pm  This quiz should be altered to include breastfeeding an older child when you became pregnant. http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=15924 Reply    Samantha McEwen   Nov 6 at 6:29 pm  For number 2 i answered that yes i am overweight/taller than average and i got an X for it, but even the reasoning for how to have better chances on getting twins said overweight/taller is favorable. So it shouldn’t have been an X. Reply     Genevieve    Nov 8 at 9:54 am  Sorry, it’s a little confusing with how we display that, but the math is correct. We have it set up so there’s no “right” answer, so both options display an X for that question. But we assign a much higher point value to a “yes” answer. Reply    maureen   Sep 22 at 12:05 am  Awww thank you so so much for this. I love it. And my sister would love it too she wants to have a twin today if it’s possible. Thanks.

Updated: February 19, 2016 Lea Csontos/Stocksy Wondering what your odds are that you will (or already have!) conceived twins? Find out overall rates in the U.S., plus the eight factors that can increase your odds. Wondering if you might have two or more passengers aboard your mothership? Multiple births are, in fact, multiplying at a fantastic rate these days: The number of twin births has jumped more than 75 percent in the past 30 years , with another recent study showing rates increased from 9.5 twins per 1,000 deliveries in 1975 to 16.9 per 1,000 in 2011. What’s behind this multiple-baby boom? The surge in older moms has a lot to do with it, along with an increase in fertility treatments and the rise in obesity, say experts. Yet these are only a few of the factors behind twin births. With these incredible stats in mind, it’s not such a stretch to wonder if you might conceive more babies than you bargained for. Here are the overall odds of having twins, along with factors that could increase your chances. What are the chances of having twins? Nearly 4 percent of babies in the United States are now born in sets of two, three or more, with the majority — about 95 percent — of these multiple births being twins. 8 factors that increase the odds of having twins A number of factors are at play when it comes to your chances of having fraternal twins. (Note that identical twins are rare and occur at random, so they're even more of an exciting surprise!) Your chances of seeing double (or more) go up if: You have twins in your family.  Heredity doubles your chances of conceiving twins — but only on the mom's side. Even if your partner's family tree is loaded with dynamic duos, that won't increase your own odds of conceiving twins. You've had twins before. Lightning can and does strike twice! If you've already given birth to a set of twins, look out — you're significantly more likely to do so again. You're an older mom-to-be.  As you age, your chance of conceiving twins increases . Researchers have found that women over 35 produce more follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women, which may cause more than one egg to drop at ovulation. You've been pregnant before. With each pregnancy, the odds that you'll have twins go up a little, likely because with each pregnancy you’re a little bit older (which in itself ups the chances of having twins). You're undergoing (or underwent) fertility treatments. Although fertility treatments don’t come with as high a multiple rate as they used to, having any kind of assisted reproduction (especially the kind that stimulates ovulation) multiplies the chances of a multiple pregnancy . About 20 to 25 percent of women taking ovary-stimulating drugs or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) will conceive twins or higher-order multiples. You're overweight. Women with pre-pregnancy BMIs higher than 30 are significantly more likely to have fraternal twins than women with lower BMIs. Researchers hypothesize it’s because taller women have higher levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which boosts ovulation by upping the sensitivity of the ovaries to FSH. You're tall. Twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women (in an often-cited study, women who gave birth to twins were on average more than an inch taller than the average female, or 5 feet 5 inches vs. 5 feet 3 ¾ inches). Experts say it’s likely again because taller women have higher levels of IGF. You're African-American. Black women are slightly more likely than Caucasians to have twins. If you're Asian or Hispanic, however, you're a bit less likely than Caucasians to get two-for-one. Does having multiple factors mean I’m more likely to have multiples? If you can check more than one of the above boxes, your odds do increase slightly. 3 things to read next: My Twins' Personalities Were Distinct Even Before They Were Born 7 Surprising Facts About Twins 5 Things That Surprised Me Most About My Twin Pregnancy From the What to Expect editorial team and Heidi Murkoff , author of What to Expect When You're Expecting .

Is the probability of having twins determined by genetics?    The likelihood of conceiving twins is a complex trait. It is probably affected by multiple genetic and environmental factors, depending on the type of twins. The two types of twins are classified as monozygotic and dizygotic. Monozygotic (MZ) twins, also called identical twins, occur when a single egg cell is fertilized by a single sperm cell. The resulting zygote splits into two very early in development, leading to the formation of two separate embryos. MZ twins occur in 3 to 4 per 1,000 births worldwide. Research suggests that most cases of MZ twinning are not caused by genetic factors. However, a few families with a larger-than-expected number of MZ twins have been reported, which indicates that genetics may play a role. It is possible that genes involved in sticking cells together (cell adhesion) may contribute to MZ twinning, although this hypothesis has not been confirmed. Most of the time, the cause of MZ twinning is unknown. Dizygotic (DZ) twins, also called fraternal twins, occur when two egg cells are each fertilized by a different sperm cell in the same menstrual cycle. DZ twins are about twice as common as MZ twins, and they are much more likely to run in families. Compared with the general population, women with a mother or sister who have had DZ twins are about twice as likely to have DZ twins themselves. DZ twinning is thought to be a result of hyperovulation, which is the release of more than one egg in a single menstrual cycle. To explain how DZ twinning can run in families, researchers have looked for genetic factors that increase the chance of hyperovulation. However, studies examining the contributions of specific genes have had mixed and conflicting results. Few specific genes in humans have been definitively linked with hyperovulation or an increased probability of DZ twinning. Other factors known to influence the chance of having DZ twins include the mother’s age, ethnic background, diet, body composition, and number of other children. Assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) are also associated with an increased frequency of DZ twins.

Odds of Conceiving Twins Naturally or With Fertility Treatment    By Rachel Gurevich  | Reviewed by Anita Sadaty, MD    Updated February 25, 2018            Share       Pin       Email      Print                  Niki Mareschal / Photographer's Choice / Getty Images       More in Getting Pregnant        Trying to Conceive       Fertility Challenges     Are You Pregnant?        What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

After all, they're always the same sex, they look exactly alike, they often dress the same (or at least their mothers dress them the same when they're little), and they tend to share certain mannerisms and other features. A frequently asked questions about identical twins is, "Do they have the same DNA?" Read on the learn the answer, and why it matters.         How Identical Twins Are Formed The medical name for identical twins is monozygotic twins. Mono means one and zygote means a cell that's formed by an egg plus a sperm—so identical twins are created when a single zygote splits into two. As the two zygotes travel to the uterus, they each continue to divide and grow. Scientists don't know what causes a single zygote to separate into two individual ones. Technically it's considered a malfunction of the normal development process. The two separate beings who are created in this way share the same DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA is made up of the chromosomes that contain the genetic information that determines everything about us—from the color of our hair and eyes to our athletic ability and personality traits. Even though identical twins share the same DNA, they aren't necessarily exactly alike. Environmental factors can influence a person's physical appearance, for example, and epigenetic factors create differences as twins age.   The epigenome describes chemical changes within DNA as an organism ages. These factors explain why identical twins can be different , whether in appearance, temperament, or personality. Identical or Fraternal? The odds of having identical twins is about 3 in 1,000 and about a third of all twins are monozygotic.         The majority of twins are dizygotic , produced when two separate eggs are fertilized by two different sperm. One way to find out if a pair of twins of the same gender is identical or fraternal (different-sex twins are always fraternal), is through DNA testing. A sample of DNA is obtained by swabbing the inside of each twin's cheek, then the samples are submitted to a service that, usually for a fee, will analyze and compare the DNA from each individual. A typical DNA test performed on monozygotic twins will return results with 99.99 percent similarity. However, DNA from non-identical (fraternal or dizygotic) twins will generally be about 50 percent to 75 percent similar. For many twins or families with twins, the only way to know for sure whether they are identical or fraternal is through DNA testing. Getting Away With Murder? Because identical twins have the same DNA, it is nearly impossible to distinguish between these individuals when analyzing DNA for paternity testing or for evidence of a crime. Many literary mysteries, soap operas, and crime dramas have used this fact as a plot line. How often is it an issue in real life, however? Could identical twins pull off the perfect crime?         It has happened. In January 2009, a set of identical twins were suspected in a German jewelry heist. Three thieves entered a luxury department store by sliding down ropes strung from the skylights and escaped with jewelry worth more than $6 million. Investigators were able to extract a DNA sample from a drop of sweat found on a discarded latex glove found at the scene and identified two suspects, identical twins Hassan and Abbas O. (German law doesn't allow full names to be revealed.) Both men were arrested and charged but ultimately were released when it wasn't possible to identify which one had been involved in the crime.  At this time, the technology does not exist to analyze DNA on the level required to distinguish between samples from identical twins. However, it's hoped that DNA testing will evolve to a level where it can detect the subtle epigenetic changes that exist in twins. Not only would it be useful to forensic scientists, but it would also help identify genetic significances associated with cancer and other diseases. Interestingly, a more old-fashioned technique in crime investigation actually can be used to discriminate between twins.

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

When your twins are a boy and girl pair, the answer is easy, but people don't always realize it. Many think that being identical twins refers to how twins look and not how they form. Take a look at the biology that determines the sex combinations that are possible with identical and fraternal twins. Can Boy/Girl Twins Be Identical? The short answer is no.         They are always fraternal. The terms identical and fraternal don't describe what the twins look like, but actually how they form. Identical ( monozygotic ) twins are always of the same sex because they form from a single zygote (fertilized egg) that contains either male (XY) or female (XX) sex chromosomes. Therefore, boy/girl twins are always fraternal or ( dizygotic ); they can only form from two separate eggs that are fertilized by two separate sperm. Fraternal twins can be either two girls, two boys, or one of each. These are the possible sex combinations: Two girl twins can be either identical or fraternal (monozygotic or dizygotic). Two boy twins can be either identical or fraternal (monozygotic or dizygotic). A set of boy/girl twins can only be fraternal (dizygotic). Boy/girl twins cannot be identical (monozygotic). Identical Twins Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg that splits into two.   Before it splits, it is either male or female. After it splits, there are either two males or two females. Both parts of the fertilized egg implant in the uterus and each produces one of the twins. Identical twins have the same genetic origin. No direct cause of monozygotic twinning has been determined; it is not hereditary.         Monozygotic twins represent about one-third of all twins. They may look remarkably similar, and it may be difficult to tell them apart . Fraternal Twins Fraternal twins are two genetically unique individuals as they come from two separate eggs that are fertilized by separate sperm. The resulting egg/sperm combination can be male or female. The result is either two male twins, two female twins, or one male and one female. The genetic similarity between fraternal twins is the same as any two siblings (about 50 percent if they have the same mother and father). They may look alike, or not, just like any sisters and brothers. Fraternal twins are the most common form of twins, representing about two-thirds of all twins. Dizygotic twinning can be hereditary and run in families . Also, most twins and multiples that result from fertility enhancing treatments, such as drugs or procedures like in-vitro fertilization, are dizygotic rather than monozygotic. Exception to the Twin Sex Rule Every rule has exceptions, of course. In this case, they are extremely rare exceptions, and it's not likely that the average person would ever encounter twins in this situation. Note that there have been a few reported cases of a genetic mutation in monozygotic male twins.         For some reason, after the zygote splits, one twin loses a Y chromosome and develops as a female. The female twin would have Turner syndrome, characterized by short stature and lack of ovarian development. It's extremely rare; less than 10 cases have been confirmed. Given the odds, it's safe to assume that 99.9 percent of all boy/girl twins are fraternal. Twins That Are Genetically Dissimilar While identical twins come from the same fertilized egg and share the same DNA combination, there are more possibilities for fraternal twins. Besides being the offspring of two sperm and egg combinations, they may have different genetic donors.  Here are the different combinations: Fraternal twins could be produced when eggs from one woman are fertilized by sperm from two different men. This can happen with unassisted conception and with in-vitro fertilization. In this case, the twins would be half-siblings. A woman may carry twins conceived in-vitro with donor eggs, which could come from two different women. If they are fertilized by sperm from the same man, the twins would be half-siblings. Donor eggs from two different women could be fertilized by sperm from two different men. In this case, the twins may have no shared DNA unless the sperm and egg donors were related. They would be similar to step-siblings. A Word From Verywell You are likely to have to answer the same questions about your twins repeatedly.

Around 90% of all multiples are made up of twins; the remaining 10% is with triplets, quadruplets and very occasionally   quintuplets and more. In recent years there has been a big increase in the numbers of twins being born. This is due to advancing maternal age, assisted reproduction technology, as well as the use of fertility drugs.  Importantly, better neonatal care has meant that premature twins have a better chance of survival than ever before.  There are two types of twins – identical or monozygotic (one egg), and non-identical or dizygotic (two eggs) twins. Other names for identical twins are non-fraternal twins, and non-identical twins are sometimes called fraternal twins.  It is thought that twin pregnancies are far more common than we are aware of – perhaps as many as 5% of all pregnancies at 12 weeks involve a twin. Though not all will continue to develop as they need to in order to form two babies. Most commonly, this is thought to be due to a major interruption occurring with healthy cell maturation and division.  How do identical twins happen?  Identical twins form when one egg has been fertilised by one sperm and the zygote splits into two.  This happens at the very earliest stage of development, when the zygote is no more than a cluster of a few cells.  Dividing this early in conception means that each baby has exactly the same genetic information as the other.  Identical twins can also occur when one a woman has undergone fertility assistance and has had one fertilised egg returned to her uterus. If this egg then splits into two, an identical twin pregnancy can result.  Identical twins are not dependent on race, country or ethnicity. The odds of having identical twins are the same for every couple, in every pregnancy, wherever they live in the world.  Around one in every three sets of twins born is identical, and the remaining 2/3 is of the non-identical variety.  What increases the odds of having identical twins?   Luck needs to be on your side.  Identical twins do not run in families and can happen for any couple with any pregnancy.  Non-identical twins are influenced by genetics; women whose mothers or grandmothers had non-identical twins do have more chance of having non-identical twins themselves.  But identical twins are just random.  Some families do seem to have a higher than average number of identical twins. Though this can only be contributed to luck, coincidence and chance rather than any familial genetic tendency.   How do non-identical twins happen?  Non-identical twins are uniquely separate individuals who just happen to be gestating at the same time and place as each other. Non-identical twins form from two completely separate eggs which are fertilised by two completely separate sperm. These fraternal twins are no more alike than any other siblings in a family with the same biological mother and father.  Because identical twins share the same genes, they are always the same gender. But non-identical twins may be the same gender or the opposite because they only share 50% of the same genetic coding.  Some people still believe that the incidence of having twins skips a generation but this is not true.  What increases the odds of having non-identical twins?   Advancing maternal age.  Women who are aged in their 30’s and 40’s have significantly higher chances of conceiving with twins.  Younger women, especially those aged in their 20’s, do not have as much chance.  Having assisted reproductive technology, in particular taking medication which increases ovulation. This makes perfect sense because the more eggs which are supported towards maturity each month, and which are then released, means the more that are available to be fertilised.  The more pregnancies a woman has already had, the higher her chances of conceiving with non-identical twins.  If a woman is a fraternal-non-identical twin herself, if she has siblings who are fraternal twins or her mother/grandmother had fraternal twins, then she is more likely to as well.  Race – Black African women are more likely to have twins than women from any other ethnic descent.   What causes the fertilised egg to separate into two?  The exact reason why this happens is still a mystery. Over the years there has been a lot of research and time invested into finding out why some zygotes split into two and others don’t.  But the truth is we still do not know why.  In reality, the splitting of one fertilised egg is a malformation of the natural processes of conception.  When are identical twins actually formed?  Though all identical twins are formed very early in pregnancy, there is some variation in exactly how early the fertilised egg splits into two.  This can happen at the two cell stage on Day 2, the early blastocyst stage on Day 4, or in the late blastocyst stage on Day 6.  The stage when the egg splits into two will determine where the fertilised eggs will implant in the uterine wall.  Once the embryo gets to the 8 cells stage the foetal DNA takes over.  The stage at which the egg splits will also determine if the babies have their own amniotic membranes and placenta or if they share. Essentially, the earlier the egg splits, the more independent each twin will be by having their own amnion, chorion and placenta.  Early splitting also means that the twins are perhaps less identical than those who separate at the late blastocyst stage. Around a quarter of all identical twins are said to be mirror images of each other. This means that the left side of one twin exactly matches the right side of the other. How amazing is that!  Although identical twins share the same DNA and genetic coding, they are still unique little individuals. Small differences separate them and although at birth they can appear like little clones of each other, they are far from it. As identical twins grow, their unique qualities (particularly in relation to their personalities) become more apparent. The environment in which they are raised as well as their own personalities help to shape the adults they will become. This is exactly the same as any other baby born the world over.  How will I know if I’ve conceived with twins?  Because the splitting of the zygote occurs so early in pregnancy, mothers are not initially aware they have conceived with twins. It’s not until twins may be suspected because of the intensity of pregnancy symptoms, or if they have been diagnosed through ultrasound, that a couple may know they are expecting twins.  Is it obvious at birth that twins are identical?  Even at birth it can be difficult to be sure if twins are identical or non-identical. Identical twins can still be born with their own set of membranes and this is not a marker for them to be non-identical. It’s not always clear simply by looking or examining the twins to know if they are identical or not.  The only way to be 100% sure is to do DNA testing on each twin and see what genetic information they share. This can be done in the early neonatal period by taking a swab of tissue from inside each baby’s cheek. This is painless and non-invasive.  The other way to check is to take a blood test and do blood grouping. Identical twins will share the same genetic information so the same genetic markers can be identified. Whereas non-identical twins can be very different; much the same as any other siblings with the same parents. They share around half the same genetic information and traits with each other.  What are the risks of having identical twins?   If the identical twins share a placenta they are at a higher risk of having twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. This often results in one twin gaining more nourishment than the other, and having a higher birth weight as a result.  Umbilical cord entanglement and compression if the twins share an amniotic sac. Purely because of the crowded conditions which occur in the mother’s uterus. With identical and non-identical twins, there is an increased risk of pregnancy and birth complications. There is also an increased likelihood of prematurity and associated problems.

Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

Yes, fertility drugs  No  Yes, IVF  Loading…            What is the birth rate for twins? Identical twins rates are equal to about 3.5 out of 1000 births, the birth rate for identical twins has not changed over the past few decades and is about the same nationwide. Worldwide, about 12-16 in 1000 people are naturally conceived twins. So, the chances of having twins are small. However,in 2010, births of twins in general in the U.S. were 33 in 1000 people. The birth rate for fraternal twins has risen by about 76% in the past 30 years. The obvious reason is fertility treatments but surprisingly, they are not the only reason. What factors affect the chances of having twins? The chances of a woman having identical twins are about the same for everyone, as identical twins do not tend to run in families. This is because identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting in two and this is a random, rare event. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, can be genetic. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs being fertilized by two sperm. Typically women only release one egg each cycle but women who conceive fraternal twins have released two. This is why fraternal twins can only be genetically connected through the mother, meaning the father’s genetics have nothing to do with twinning. Releasing more than one egg in a cycle is called hyper-ovulation and is controlled by certain genes. Women who conceive fraternal twins usually have high levels of these genes, which makes sense. So who is more likely to conceive fraternal twins? Your chances of having twins depend on six factors: 1. Body type Twins tend to be more common in larger women as well as woman who are tall. In one study, women with a BMI of 30 or above were nearly 1.5 times more likely to have twins than the women in the normal BMI range of 20 to 24.9. Those same women were more likely to have opposite sex twins than same sex twins as well. Researchers are still unsure why this is the case. 2. Ethnicity and location On the surface it appears that ethnicity plays a role in the chances of having twins, yet location seems to have a large part as well. The Yoruba tribe of Nigeria has the highest rate of twins at 45–50 twin sets (or 90–100 twins) per 1,000 live births, however being of Nigerian decent and living elsewhere doesn’t show the same correlation to twin births. In Central Africa there are 18–30 twin sets (or 36–60 twins) per 1,000 live births. North America and Europe (and caucasians in general) have intermediate rates of 9-16 twin sets per 1,000 live births Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (and hispanic and asian ethnicities in general) have the lowest rates of 6–9 twin sets per 1,000 live births. The difference in chances of having twins between geographic locations (more than ethnicity) begs the question of whether climate, diet, or lifestyle have more to do with the chances of having twins than anything else. 3. Diet We already know that diet does play a role. Women who eat full fat foods over non fat or low fat are more likely to conceive twins. This could be because fat is an important building block for pregnancy and those that eat more fat are better suited to carry two babies. It may also be that the difference in the amount of fat a woman eats affects hormones. Some information points to the daily consumption of yams being the reason Nigerian women have more chances of having twins. True yams contain a phytoestrogen that increases a woman’s follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and may cause hyper-ovulation. 4. Maternal Age Older woman tend to have a higher chance of fraternal twins. Women over 35 tend to produce more FSH than younger women and women with higher levels of these hormones are more likely to have twins. The increase in FSH levels also shows declining fertility, which means they are less likely to get pregnant, but more likely to have twins if they happen to conceive. 5. Number of Pregnancies The more pregnancies that a woman has had increase her chances of having twins. This could be a simple case of numbers. The more pregnancies you have the higher your chances of having twins. 6. Fertility Treatments Women who take certain types of fertility treatments have increased chances of having twins.  In vitro fertilization (IVF) increases your odds of having multiples by 20-40% depending on how many embryos are placed inside your womb. Some believe that IVF can also increase your chances of having identical twins but research doesn’t support this. Fertility drugs increase the odds of you releasing several eggs at the same time by stimulating your ovaries. These kinds of drugs increase your chances of having twins or multiples to 10% or higher, up to as much as 30%. Why twins are more common these days What has caused the rise in multiples? One possibility is that women are waiting until they are older to have babies. As we mentioned earlier, older women have higher chances of releasing more than one egg in a cycle, thus, increasing their chances of having twins. Another reason behind the rise in twins is the increased use of fertility drugs and other ways to assist a woman’s odds of conception. In the 1970’s when fertility treatment started becoming reliable, the incidence of twins almost doubled. Over the past decade, the rise in twins has steadied. This is probably due to the fact that fertility treatments have become more advanced and have lowered the risk for multiples while keeping the high possibility for conception. How will I know if I’m having twins? There are physical indicators like showing earlier than normal and higher HCG levels. Some women who have been pregnant with twins report higher than normal levels of morning sickness. However, an ultrasound is the only way to be sure. An ultrasound can usually detect twins as early as 8-14 weeks gestation. How about you? Did you dream of having twins while you were (or currently are!) pregnant?

I am told you will need to eat more but when does that start? There does not seem to be a lot of information on twins and how you deal with health and changes over a single birth! I have your book and I LOVE IT! Thanks so much for all your work. Reply    Michele   Feb 25 at 6:06 am  Did you ever end up finding much?! I just found out we’re having twins and am having the same problem finding good information Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:23 pm  Hi my name is Theresa I see this is about fraternal twins but I have a question about the chances of having Identical twins. If you could tell me anything about it.  I know they say their not sure if it’s hereditary or not.  My sons wife is pregnant.  Her mother is an identical twin (her sister died at birth).  I have an identical twin sister.  My mother is an identical twin,  my father has identical twin sisters and my brother has identical twin girls.  Both sets of my great grand parents had twins also.  So the saying twins skip a generation are not true in our case. I have 4 boys ( no twins) I always felt that my son Zack ( the one that is expecting) would one day have identical twins.  They are just 12 weeks along so we don’t know yet if it is more than one.  I’d love to hear what you think or know about identicals thank you. Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:32 pm  Thank you I know they say identical twins are not hereditary or ran in family’s  but I think we could be a good case study because we have more then proven that they do!!! Reply    Deanne   Feb 1 at 7:04 pm  Quiz said I am unlikely to have twins–I have a set of fraternal twins! I have heard the gene for twinning is only expressed in women, but can be carried by men. My paternal grandfather was a twin, so I believe it! Reply    Briauna   Jan 1 at 9:02 pm  It said my chances of having twins were just average. I’m a 22 year old African American, 5’0 inches tall, living in California, my mother is the only fraternal twin I know about in my family and this is my first pregnancy. But surprisingly I’m having identical twin girls & I’m currently 30 weeks. Anything can happen ladies. ? Reply    HeatherM   Dec 24 at 11:41 pm  This quiz should be altered to include breastfeeding an older child when you became pregnant. http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=15924 Reply    Samantha McEwen   Nov 6 at 6:29 pm  For number 2 i answered that yes i am overweight/taller than average and i got an X for it, but even the reasoning for how to have better chances on getting twins said overweight/taller is favorable. So it shouldn’t have been an X. Reply     Genevieve    Nov 8 at 9:54 am  Sorry, it’s a little confusing with how we display that, but the math is correct. We have it set up so there’s no “right” answer, so both options display an X for that question. But we assign a much higher point value to a “yes” answer. Reply    maureen   Sep 22 at 12:05 am  Awww thank you so so much for this. I love it. And my sister would love it too she wants to have a twin today if it’s possible. Thanks.

Updated: February 19, 2016 Lea Csontos/Stocksy Wondering what your odds are that you will (or already have!) conceived twins? Find out overall rates in the U.S., plus the eight factors that can increase your odds. Wondering if you might have two or more passengers aboard your mothership? Multiple births are, in fact, multiplying at a fantastic rate these days: The number of twin births has jumped more than 75 percent in the past 30 years , with another recent study showing rates increased from 9.5 twins per 1,000 deliveries in 1975 to 16.9 per 1,000 in 2011. What’s behind this multiple-baby boom? The surge in older moms has a lot to do with it, along with an increase in fertility treatments and the rise in obesity, say experts. Yet these are only a few of the factors behind twin births. With these incredible stats in mind, it’s not such a stretch to wonder if you might conceive more babies than you bargained for. Here are the overall odds of having twins, along with factors that could increase your chances. What are the chances of having twins? Nearly 4 percent of babies in the United States are now born in sets of two, three or more, with the majority — about 95 percent — of these multiple births being twins. 8 factors that increase the odds of having twins A number of factors are at play when it comes to your chances of having fraternal twins. (Note that identical twins are rare and occur at random, so they're even more of an exciting surprise!) Your chances of seeing double (or more) go up if: You have twins in your family.  Heredity doubles your chances of conceiving twins — but only on the mom's side. Even if your partner's family tree is loaded with dynamic duos, that won't increase your own odds of conceiving twins. You've had twins before. Lightning can and does strike twice! If you've already given birth to a set of twins, look out — you're significantly more likely to do so again. You're an older mom-to-be.  As you age, your chance of conceiving twins increases . Researchers have found that women over 35 produce more follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women, which may cause more than one egg to drop at ovulation. You've been pregnant before. With each pregnancy, the odds that you'll have twins go up a little, likely because with each pregnancy you’re a little bit older (which in itself ups the chances of having twins). You're undergoing (or underwent) fertility treatments. Although fertility treatments don’t come with as high a multiple rate as they used to, having any kind of assisted reproduction (especially the kind that stimulates ovulation) multiplies the chances of a multiple pregnancy . About 20 to 25 percent of women taking ovary-stimulating drugs or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) will conceive twins or higher-order multiples. You're overweight. Women with pre-pregnancy BMIs higher than 30 are significantly more likely to have fraternal twins than women with lower BMIs. Researchers hypothesize it’s because taller women have higher levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which boosts ovulation by upping the sensitivity of the ovaries to FSH. You're tall. Twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women (in an often-cited study, women who gave birth to twins were on average more than an inch taller than the average female, or 5 feet 5 inches vs. 5 feet 3 ¾ inches). Experts say it’s likely again because taller women have higher levels of IGF. You're African-American. Black women are slightly more likely than Caucasians to have twins. If you're Asian or Hispanic, however, you're a bit less likely than Caucasians to get two-for-one. Does having multiple factors mean I’m more likely to have multiples? If you can check more than one of the above boxes, your odds do increase slightly. 3 things to read next: My Twins' Personalities Were Distinct Even Before They Were Born 7 Surprising Facts About Twins 5 Things That Surprised Me Most About My Twin Pregnancy From the What to Expect editorial team and Heidi Murkoff , author of What to Expect When You're Expecting .

Is the probability of having twins determined by genetics?    The likelihood of conceiving twins is a complex trait. It is probably affected by multiple genetic and environmental factors, depending on the type of twins. The two types of twins are classified as monozygotic and dizygotic. Monozygotic (MZ) twins, also called identical twins, occur when a single egg cell is fertilized by a single sperm cell. The resulting zygote splits into two very early in development, leading to the formation of two separate embryos. MZ twins occur in 3 to 4 per 1,000 births worldwide. Research suggests that most cases of MZ twinning are not caused by genetic factors. However, a few families with a larger-than-expected number of MZ twins have been reported, which indicates that genetics may play a role. It is possible that genes involved in sticking cells together (cell adhesion) may contribute to MZ twinning, although this hypothesis has not been confirmed. Most of the time, the cause of MZ twinning is unknown. Dizygotic (DZ) twins, also called fraternal twins, occur when two egg cells are each fertilized by a different sperm cell in the same menstrual cycle. DZ twins are about twice as common as MZ twins, and they are much more likely to run in families. Compared with the general population, women with a mother or sister who have had DZ twins are about twice as likely to have DZ twins themselves. DZ twinning is thought to be a result of hyperovulation, which is the release of more than one egg in a single menstrual cycle. To explain how DZ twinning can run in families, researchers have looked for genetic factors that increase the chance of hyperovulation. However, studies examining the contributions of specific genes have had mixed and conflicting results. Few specific genes in humans have been definitively linked with hyperovulation or an increased probability of DZ twinning. Other factors known to influence the chance of having DZ twins include the mother’s age, ethnic background, diet, body composition, and number of other children. Assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) are also associated with an increased frequency of DZ twins.
