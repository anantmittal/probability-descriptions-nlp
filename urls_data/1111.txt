By Mayo Clinic Staff    You might wonder about your chances of developing cancer. News reports can make it sound as if every day something is found to dramatically raise your risk. Sorting through all the information and figuring out what's valid can be tricky.   What is risk?    When scientists talk about risk, they're referring to a probability — the chance that something may occur, but not a guarantee that it will. For example, if you flip a coin, there is one chance in two, or a 50 percent chance, that the coin will land heads up.  Risk estimates for cancer and other diseases are determined by studying large groups of people. Researchers focus on the probability that any person or category of people will develop the disease over a certain period of time. They also look to see what characteristics or behaviors are associated with increased or decreased risk.   How is risk expressed?      Absolute risk        Relative risk    Risk is generally divided into two categories: absolute risk and relative risk.  Absolute risk  Absolute risk refers to the actual numeric chance or probability of developing cancer during a specified time period — for example, within the year, within the next five years, by age 50, by age 70, or during the course of a lifetime.  One type of absolute risk is lifetime risk, which is the probability that an individual will develop cancer during the course of a lifetime. For instance, an American man's absolute risk of developing prostate cancer in his lifetime is about 12 percent. Put another way, about 12 out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer at some time in their lives. This also means that 88 out of every 100 men won't develop prostate cancer.  Lifetime risk isn't the risk that a person will develop cancer in the next year or the next five years. An individual's cancer risk has a lot to do with other factors, such as age. For instance, a woman's lifetime risk of developing colon and rectal cancer is just over 4 percent, or about 42 out of every 1,000 women. But her risk of developing colon and rectal cancer before the age of 50 is 0.3 percent, or about 3 out of every 1,000 women.  Relative risk  Relative risk gives you a comparison or ratio rather than an absolute value. It shows the strength of the relationship between a risk factor and a particular type of cancer by comparing the number of cancers in a group of people who have a particular trait with the number of cancers in a group of people who don't have that trait.  For instance, compare the relative lung cancer risk for people who smoke with the relative lung cancer risk in a similar group of people who don't smoke. You might hear relative risk being expressed like this: The risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25 times higher than the risk for people who don't smoke. So the relative risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25.  Relative risk is also given as a percentage. For example, the risk of lung cancer for smokers is 2,500 percent higher than it is for people who don't smoke.  When you hear about relative risk, there's no upper limit to the percentage increase in risk. Most people think 100 percent is the highest possible risk, but that isn't true in this case.  A relative risk of 100 percent means your risk is twice as high as that of someone without that risk factor. A 200 percent relative risk means that you are three times as likely to develop that condition.  Risk seems greater when put in these terms. A 100 percent increase in risk may seem enormous, but if the risk began as 1 in 100 people, a 100 percent increase in risk means that 2 out of 100 will be affected.

The number of deaths was 166.1 per 100,000 men and women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2010-2014 cases and deaths.  Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer : Approximately 38.5 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer of any site at some point during their lifetime, based on 2012-2014 data.  Prevalence of This Cancer : In 2014, there were an estimated 14,738,719 people living with cancer of any site in the United States.   Survival Statistics   How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Cancer of Any Site?  Relative survival statistics compare the survival of patients diagnosed with cancer with the survival of people in the general population who are the same age, race, and sex and who have not been diagnosed with cancer. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.          Percent Surviving 5 Years  67.0%      Based on data from SEER 18 2007-2013. Gray figures represent those who have died from cancer of any site. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.

Females have the highest lifetime risk of breast, lung and bowel cancers.  Males have the highest lifetime risk of prostate, lung and bowel cancers.  See more in-depth statistics on lifetime risk of being diagnosed with cancer        Preventable cancers     A person’s risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including age, genetics, and exposure to risk factors.  Around 4 in 10 UK cancer cases every year could be prevented, that’s more than 135,000 every year.  Nearly 112,000 England cases, around 13,000 Scotland cancer cases, around 7,200 Wales cancer cases, and around 3,500 Northern Ireland cancer cases every year could be prevented.  Lung cancer, bowel cancer, melanoma skin cancer, and breast cancer together account for almost two-thirds of all preventable cancer cases in the UK.  For 10 cancer types, including two of the five most common cancer types in the UK (lung cancer and melanoma skin cancer), more than 70% of UK cancer cases were attributable to known risk factors.  Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, exposure to certain substances at work, exposure to certain infections, drinking alcohol, and eating too little fibre each cause 3-4% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to ionising radiation and eating processed meat each cause 1-2% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to outdoor air pollution and doing too little physical activity each cause 1% or less of cancer cases in the UK.  See more in-depth statistics on preventable cancer cases        Tobacco statistics     Smoking is the largest cause of cancer in the UK.  Around 1 in 5 UK adults currently smoke cigarettes, around 9.4 million people.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults in the UK decreases with age.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults has decreased since the late 1940s.  In recent years the difference between men and women in cigarette smoking prevalence has narrowed.  Cigarette smoking in England is more common in people living in the most deprived areas.  Cigarette smoking prevalence varies by ethnic group but patterns are difficult to interpret.  Worldwide, 1 billion adults currently smoke cigarettes.  Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in the world, and around a third of tobacco-caused deaths are due to cancer (2015 projected).  Around 11,000 deaths per year in the UK are caused by second-hand smoke, four-fifths occurring at home and the rest from the workplace.  More than half of smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are successful.  Almost 4 in 10 smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in Scotland are successful.  See more in-depth statistics on tobacco        Childhood smoking statistics     Smoking prevalence is higher in children whose parents, siblings and/or peers smoke.  Almost 5 in 100 children under 16 in the UK smoke regularly.  Almost a fifth of children have tried smoking, and girls are much more likely than boys to smoke.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England increases with age.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England has decreased since the 1990s.  Around 40% of regular smokers in Great Britain began smoking before age 16.  Around 7 million smokers in 2012 in the UK started smoking before the age of 18.  An average of 136,500 children aged 11-15 started smoking each year between 2012 and 2014 in the UK but the number of new childhood smokers each year is falling.  See more in-depth statistics on childhood smoking        Alcohol statistics     Drinking too much alcohol causes 3% of cancer cases in the UK.  Nearly 6 in 10 adults in Great Britain drank alcohol at least once in the past week.  Under 1 in 10 children aged 11-15 in England drank alcohol at least once in the past week. Alcohol drinking prevalence in children increases with age, and rates have decreased since 2003.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain peaks in middle-age.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain has decreased since 2005, this is mainly due to declining prevalence among younger adults.  Around half of adults in Great Britain who drank alcohol at least once in the past week exceeded the recommended daily alcohol limit on their heaviest drinking day.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain is higher in employed people compared with unemployed or economically inactive people.  Alcohol drinking prevalence adults in Great Britain is more common in white people than non-white people.  Alcohol drinking causes an estimated 6% of deaths worldwide, around 1 in 8 of which are due to cancer (2012). Alcohol drinking prevalence is highest in Europe and America.  See more in-depth statistics on alcohol        Adult overweight and obesity statistics     Overweight and obesity causes more than 1 in 20 cancer cases in the UK.  More than 6 in 10 UK adults are overweight or obese (body mass index 25 or more).  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in the UK increases until late middle-age and then decreases in older adults. However, prevalence of overweight and obesity increases in Scotland in older females and in Northern Ireland.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England has increased since the early 1990s.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England is higher in lower-income households compared with higher-income households.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity varies by ethnic group in England.  Overweight and obesity prevalence is increasing particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Overweight and obesity are leading causes of death worldwide.  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for adults        Childhood overweight and obesity statistics     People who are overweight or obese in early life may remain obese in adulthood.  Around 3 in 10 children in the UK’s constituent countries are overweight or obese.  Childhood overweight and obesity prevalence in England has increased since the mid-1990s, though this includes an increase to the mid-2000s followed by a decrease.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity among children in England is higher in those from lower-income households compared with higher income households  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for children        Cancer risk publications            Preventable cancers poster (simple version) (August 2014)  Preventable cancers poster (in-depth version)  (August 2014)  Preventable cancers PowerPoint slides (September 2014)  Want to create your own lifetime risk calculations?

But shockingly, half of all adults will get a cancer diagnosis, according to a new study from the British Journal of Cancer , which predicts that one out of every two U.K. adults born in 1960 will develop the disease during their lifetime.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    Broken down by gender, the numbers slightly favor women, but only because more men smoke: Men born in 1960 have a lifetime cancer risk of 53.5 percent, while the risk is 47.5 percent for women. The study forecasts a rise in cancer rates; by contrast, only one in three U.K. residents born in 1930 were projected to get cancer. It’s scary news, but do the numbers translate across the pond here in America? They line up pretty closely, says Len Lichtenfeld, M.D., deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, with one in two men and one in three women in the U.S. expected to be diagnosed with the big C. “The numbers reflect a few things: First, people are living longer, and advancing age is a significant risk factor for cancer,” says Lichtenfeld. “Also, we’re diagnosing cancer at greater rates because of technological advances in screening, such as mammography for breast cancer and PSA tests for prostate cancer.” Speaking of better diagnostic tools, this is the reason for some good news concerning cancer: While more people are receiving a cancer diagnosis, the death rates for the disease have been steadily going down. “Since the early 1990s, cancer deaths have declined about 20 percent,” says Lichtenfeld. And keep in mind that the stats, while startling, don’t take into account an individual’s lifestyle, which plays a role. Not using tobacco, being active, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in processed food are all things that can keep your lifetime cancer risk lower than the numbers predict.

country, you know that smoking isn't exactly the best thing for your
health. Scientists have succeeded in associating the habit with
everything from countless cancers to bad-hair days, or so it seems with
some reports.  Nevertheless, during the 33rd annual Great American Smokeout this
Thursday, many of the estimated 43 million adult smokers in the United
States will choose to willfully continue smoking while grumbling about
how the reported health risks are overblown.  In some respects they are right. A public health message has been spun to imply that not only will smoking surely kill you but it will come to spit on your grave after you die. This has caused a
backlash among smokers who mock the health statistics and, persuasively
to some, attribute most of smoking's ills to bad genetics.  A reexamination of the statistics might help to clear the air.   Didn't kill grandpa   Surprisingly, fewer than 10 percent of lifelong smokers will get
lung cancer. Fewer yet will contract the long list of other cancers,
such as throat or mouth cancers. In the game of risk, you're more
likely to have a condom break than to get cancer from smoking.  That the majority of smokers beat cancer doesn't make for effective
anti-smoking campaigning. So the statistics are turned around: Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 87 percent of lung
cancer deaths; the risk of developing lung cancer is about 23 times
higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers; smoking is associated
with increased risk of at least 15 types of cancer; or that smoking
causes millions of deaths worldwide.  What does this mean? To the happy and dedicated smoker, it means
nothing. The Internet is rife with pro-smoking sites dismissing these
kinds of facts. There are billions of people, the argument goes, and
they have to die of something, even rare diseases .   The smoking gun   Rarely are simple messages heard, such as the fact that about half
of all smokers will die from smoking, and of these, about half will die
before or around age 50. These numbers come from a landmark 50-year
study of physicians in England, initiated in 1951.  Similarly, research from the ongoing Nurses' Health Study, published in May this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association ,
finds that 64 percent of nurses who smoked died from smoking-related
causes. The life expectancy for a smoker in the United States is about
64, which is 14 years shorter than the national average (which includes
smokers), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Going by these numbers it becomes clear that few pastimes, habits or
addictions are deadlier than smoking. Only Russian roulette and
scorpion juggling come to mind.   Much more than cancer   Part of the problem of the misconception of real risks is the
emphasis on smoking and lung cancer. The greater danger is from
vascular diseases leading to heart attacks and stroke, which kill more
smokers than all cancers combined. Toxins in the tobacco smoke cause
inflammation and hardening in the arteries.  Nearly as common as lung cancer among smokers is chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, which entails the narrowing of airways in the lung,
largely in the form of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Bronchitis is a
result of smoking-induced inflammation; emphysema stems from cigarette
smoking hardening the alveoli, the little sacks in the lungs where
oxygen meets blood.  If painful death as a middle-age adult doesn't move you, consider
life-quality issues. Smokers get sick more often because smoke
paralyzes tiny hair-like structures in the lungs called cilia, which
otherwise sweep dirt and bacteria out of your lungs. Smokers have less
endurance, particularly sexual endurance , because carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood.  Yet the core argument of ardent smokers remains firm: Smoking
doesn't kill everyone. About 50 percent of smokers do reach old age,
albeit with diminished taste buds, diminished endurance, diminished
eyesight, yellow teeth and bad breath.  Quitting isn't easy. But the first steps are believing the risks are real and deciding whether they are worth avoiding.   10 Easy Paths to Self Destruction  Top 10 Bad Things That Are Good For You  Video - Addiction is in Your Genes    Christopher Wanjek is the author of the books " Bad Medicine " and " Food At Work ."

Category Cancer A-Z          Cancer Basics             Lifetime Risk of Developing or Dying From Cancer      The lifetime risk of developing or dying from cancer refers to the chance a person has, over the course of his or her lifetime (from birth to death), of being diagnosed with or dying from cancer. These risk estimates, like annual incidence and mortality data, provide another measure of how widespread cancer is in the United States.  The following tables list lifetime risks of developing and dying from certain cancers for men and women. The information is from the US National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Database, and is based on incidence and mortality data for the United States from 2012 through 2014, the most current years for which data are available.  The risk is expressed both in terms of a percentage and as odds.   For example, the risk that a man will develop bladder cancer during his lifetime is 3.76%. This means he has about 1 chance in 27 of developing bladder cancer (100/3.76 = 26.6).  Put another way, 1 out of every 27 men in the United States will develop bladder cancer during his lifetime.   These numbers are average risks for the overall US population. Your risk may be higher or lower than these numbers, depending on your particular risk factors.

Unfortunately, these messages are often missing basic facts needed for people to understand their chance of cancer: the magnitude of the chance and how it compares with the chance of other diseases.  Risk charts present these basic facts by showing the chance of dying from a variety of cancer and other diseases over specific time frames. Because age, sex and race are so important in determining your chances, the charts let you account for these factors. While other factors make an important difference (like smoking or having a serious disease run in your family), the numbers from the charts will get you into the right ballpark.  Get Started  Choose from one of the four risk charts offered below.         Big Picture Charts  Ready made charts with the 10-year chance of dying from major causes.  View The Charts   Create Custom Charts  Select the causes of death and time frame for the chart.  Design A Chart   Your Chances  Display the chances of dying from the most common causes based on age, race and sex.  View Your Chances   Special Cancer Tables  Compare the risk of diagnosis and death for specific cancers.  View Comparisons         DISCLAIMER: The charts do not account for some individual characteristics that affect the chance of death, most importantly smoking. Smoking substantially increases the chance of dying from heart attacks, stroke, lung cancer, chronic lung disease, and all-causes combined. If you smoke, your chances of dying from these causes are higher than those shown in the charts - and if you never smoked, your chances of dying are lower.

By Mayo Clinic Staff    You might wonder about your chances of developing cancer. News reports can make it sound as if every day something is found to dramatically raise your risk. Sorting through all the information and figuring out what's valid can be tricky.   What is risk?    When scientists talk about risk, they're referring to a probability — the chance that something may occur, but not a guarantee that it will. For example, if you flip a coin, there is one chance in two, or a 50 percent chance, that the coin will land heads up.  Risk estimates for cancer and other diseases are determined by studying large groups of people. Researchers focus on the probability that any person or category of people will develop the disease over a certain period of time. They also look to see what characteristics or behaviors are associated with increased or decreased risk.   How is risk expressed?      Absolute risk        Relative risk    Risk is generally divided into two categories: absolute risk and relative risk.  Absolute risk  Absolute risk refers to the actual numeric chance or probability of developing cancer during a specified time period — for example, within the year, within the next five years, by age 50, by age 70, or during the course of a lifetime.  One type of absolute risk is lifetime risk, which is the probability that an individual will develop cancer during the course of a lifetime. For instance, an American man's absolute risk of developing prostate cancer in his lifetime is about 12 percent. Put another way, about 12 out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer at some time in their lives. This also means that 88 out of every 100 men won't develop prostate cancer.  Lifetime risk isn't the risk that a person will develop cancer in the next year or the next five years. An individual's cancer risk has a lot to do with other factors, such as age. For instance, a woman's lifetime risk of developing colon and rectal cancer is just over 4 percent, or about 42 out of every 1,000 women. But her risk of developing colon and rectal cancer before the age of 50 is 0.3 percent, or about 3 out of every 1,000 women.  Relative risk  Relative risk gives you a comparison or ratio rather than an absolute value. It shows the strength of the relationship between a risk factor and a particular type of cancer by comparing the number of cancers in a group of people who have a particular trait with the number of cancers in a group of people who don't have that trait.  For instance, compare the relative lung cancer risk for people who smoke with the relative lung cancer risk in a similar group of people who don't smoke. You might hear relative risk being expressed like this: The risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25 times higher than the risk for people who don't smoke. So the relative risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25.  Relative risk is also given as a percentage. For example, the risk of lung cancer for smokers is 2,500 percent higher than it is for people who don't smoke.  When you hear about relative risk, there's no upper limit to the percentage increase in risk. Most people think 100 percent is the highest possible risk, but that isn't true in this case.  A relative risk of 100 percent means your risk is twice as high as that of someone without that risk factor. A 200 percent relative risk means that you are three times as likely to develop that condition.  Risk seems greater when put in these terms. A 100 percent increase in risk may seem enormous, but if the risk began as 1 in 100 people, a 100 percent increase in risk means that 2 out of 100 will be affected.

Jordan           New Study: 1 in 2 People Will Get Cancer  Your odds are frightening—but here’s what you can do to reduce your chances              By Esther Crain for Women's Health and Thinkstock     Apr 1, 2015                                        Hearing “you have cancer” from your doctor is something no one wants to experience at any point in life. But shockingly, half of all adults will get a cancer diagnosis, according to a new study from the British Journal of Cancer , which predicts that one out of every two U.K. adults born in 1960 will develop the disease during their lifetime.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    Broken down by gender, the numbers slightly favor women, but only because more men smoke: Men born in 1960 have a lifetime cancer risk of 53.5 percent, while the risk is 47.5 percent for women. The study forecasts a rise in cancer rates; by contrast, only one in three U.K. residents born in 1930 were projected to get cancer. It’s scary news, but do the numbers translate across the pond here in America? They line up pretty closely, says Len Lichtenfeld, M.D., deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, with one in two men and one in three women in the U.S. expected to be diagnosed with the big C. “The numbers reflect a few things: First, people are living longer, and advancing age is a significant risk factor for cancer,” says Lichtenfeld. “Also, we’re diagnosing cancer at greater rates because of technological advances in screening, such as mammography for breast cancer and PSA tests for prostate cancer.” Speaking of better diagnostic tools, this is the reason for some good news concerning cancer: While more people are receiving a cancer diagnosis, the death rates for the disease have been steadily going down. “Since the early 1990s, cancer deaths have declined about 20 percent,” says Lichtenfeld. And keep in mind that the stats, while startling, don’t take into account an individual’s lifestyle, which plays a role. Not using tobacco, being active, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in processed food are all things that can keep your lifetime cancer risk lower than the numbers predict.

In the UK in 2013-2015, on average each year more than a third (36%) of new cases were in people aged 75 and over.[ 1-4 ]  Age-specific incidence rates rise steeply from around age 55-59. The highest rates are in the 85 to 89 age group for males and females.  Incidence rates are significantly lower in males than females in the younger age groups and significantly higher in males than females in the older age groups. The gap is widest at age 90+, when the age-specific incidence rate is 1.7 times higher in males than females.  All Cancers (C00-C97 Excl.

There are more people aged 50-74 than aged 75+ in the population overall, hence the number of cancer cases is higher in 50-74s, but incidence rates are higher in 75+s.

Females have the highest lifetime risk of breast, lung and bowel cancers.  Males have the highest lifetime risk of prostate, lung and bowel cancers.  See more in-depth statistics on lifetime risk of being diagnosed with cancer        Preventable cancers     A person’s risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including age, genetics, and exposure to risk factors.  Around 4 in 10 UK cancer cases every year could be prevented, that’s more than 135,000 every year.  Nearly 112,000 England cases, around 13,000 Scotland cancer cases, around 7,200 Wales cancer cases, and around 3,500 Northern Ireland cancer cases every year could be prevented.  Lung cancer, bowel cancer, melanoma skin cancer, and breast cancer together account for almost two-thirds of all preventable cancer cases in the UK.  For 10 cancer types, including two of the five most common cancer types in the UK (lung cancer and melanoma skin cancer), more than 70% of UK cancer cases were attributable to known risk factors.  Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, exposure to certain substances at work, exposure to certain infections, drinking alcohol, and eating too little fibre each cause 3-4% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to ionising radiation and eating processed meat each cause 1-2% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to outdoor air pollution and doing too little physical activity each cause 1% or less of cancer cases in the UK.  See more in-depth statistics on preventable cancer cases        Tobacco statistics     Smoking is the largest cause of cancer in the UK.  Around 1 in 5 UK adults currently smoke cigarettes, around 9.4 million people.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults in the UK decreases with age.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults has decreased since the late 1940s.  In recent years the difference between men and women in cigarette smoking prevalence has narrowed.  Cigarette smoking in England is more common in people living in the most deprived areas.  Cigarette smoking prevalence varies by ethnic group but patterns are difficult to interpret.  Worldwide, 1 billion adults currently smoke cigarettes.  Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in the world, and around a third of tobacco-caused deaths are due to cancer (2015 projected).  Around 11,000 deaths per year in the UK are caused by second-hand smoke, four-fifths occurring at home and the rest from the workplace.  More than half of smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are successful.  Almost 4 in 10 smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in Scotland are successful.  See more in-depth statistics on tobacco        Childhood smoking statistics     Smoking prevalence is higher in children whose parents, siblings and/or peers smoke.  Almost 5 in 100 children under 16 in the UK smoke regularly.  Almost a fifth of children have tried smoking, and girls are much more likely than boys to smoke.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England increases with age.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England has decreased since the 1990s.  Around 40% of regular smokers in Great Britain began smoking before age 16.  Around 7 million smokers in 2012 in the UK started smoking before the age of 18.  An average of 136,500 children aged 11-15 started smoking each year between 2012 and 2014 in the UK but the number of new childhood smokers each year is falling.  See more in-depth statistics on childhood smoking        Alcohol statistics     Drinking too much alcohol causes 3% of cancer cases in the UK.  Nearly 6 in 10 adults in Great Britain drank alcohol at least once in the past week.  Under 1 in 10 children aged 11-15 in England drank alcohol at least once in the past week. Alcohol drinking prevalence in children increases with age, and rates have decreased since 2003.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain peaks in middle-age.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain has decreased since 2005, this is mainly due to declining prevalence among younger adults.  Around half of adults in Great Britain who drank alcohol at least once in the past week exceeded the recommended daily alcohol limit on their heaviest drinking day.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain is higher in employed people compared with unemployed or economically inactive people.  Alcohol drinking prevalence adults in Great Britain is more common in white people than non-white people.  Alcohol drinking causes an estimated 6% of deaths worldwide, around 1 in 8 of which are due to cancer (2012). Alcohol drinking prevalence is highest in Europe and America.  See more in-depth statistics on alcohol        Adult overweight and obesity statistics     Overweight and obesity causes more than 1 in 20 cancer cases in the UK.  More than 6 in 10 UK adults are overweight or obese (body mass index 25 or more).  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in the UK increases until late middle-age and then decreases in older adults. However, prevalence of overweight and obesity increases in Scotland in older females and in Northern Ireland.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England has increased since the early 1990s.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England is higher in lower-income households compared with higher-income households.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity varies by ethnic group in England.  Overweight and obesity prevalence is increasing particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Overweight and obesity are leading causes of death worldwide.  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for adults        Childhood overweight and obesity statistics     People who are overweight or obese in early life may remain obese in adulthood.  Around 3 in 10 children in the UK’s constituent countries are overweight or obese.  Childhood overweight and obesity prevalence in England has increased since the mid-1990s, though this includes an increase to the mid-2000s followed by a decrease.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity among children in England is higher in those from lower-income households compared with higher income households  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for children        Cancer risk publications            Preventable cancers poster (simple version) (August 2014)  Preventable cancers poster (in-depth version)  (August 2014)  Preventable cancers PowerPoint slides (September 2014)  Want to create your own lifetime risk calculations?

What Are Your Chances of Getting Cancer?                What Are Your Chances of Getting Cancer?  2015 - 07 - 21     A few days ago a supporter wrote, “My teammate shared this image on Facebook and got slammed
    by someone calling it ‘misinformed,’’misleading’ and ‘junk science.’ I have no idea where I could find the truth, and I thought perhaps you could point
    me in the right direction.” As my late friend Dr. David Kritchevsky, former Associate Director of Wistar Institute, quipped, “If you torture the statistics
    long enough they’ll confess.”  So should we trust those statistics?  I have not found a source for lifetime cancer risk in 1900, but the later data seem to have originated from the website of Cancer Research of the United
    Kingdom (cancerresearchuk.org), which states: “In 1975 the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with cancer in the UK was one in four people; by the 1990s it had risen to one in three, and by 2010 it was four in 10.” That means that the risk of getting cancer
    is now close to one in two.  Similar data come from the SEER Cancer Statistics Review released April 23, 2015.  The Review, a report of the most recent cancer incidence, mortality,
    survival, prevalence, and lifetime risk statistics, is published annually by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The latest edition includes statistics
    from 1975 through 2012, the most recent year for which data are available. For all sites, the lifetime risk was again declared to be four in 10.  That figure is corroborated by the American Cancer Society website, which states that the risk of developing cancer for all invasive cancer sites is one
    in two for males and one in three for females.  Indeed, the odds of avoiding a cancer diagnosis do not seem very good. But read on.  Cancer Risk Factors  On the Mayo Clinic site, in an article entitled “Cancer Risk: What the Numbers Mean,” the writer explains:  “ Risk statistics can be frustrating because they can't tell you your risk of cancer. Studies may have found that men have a nearly 45
    percent chance of developing cancer in their lifetimes, but that doesn't mean your risk is 45 percent. Your individual risk is based on many different
    factors, such as age and habits (including eating habits), family history of cancer, and the environment in which you live.”  The World Health Organization (WHO), through its International Agency for Research on Cancer, classifies cancer causing agents in three main groups:   physical carcinogens (such as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation)  chemical carcinogens (such as asbestos, tobacco, pesticides and arsenic )  biological carcinogens (such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and Human Papilloma viral infections ,
        which increase the risk for liver or cervical cancer ).
        Infections account for a high proportion – about 18% -- of the global cancer burden.    Smoking , alcohol, physical inactivity, overweight or
    obesity, and unhealthy diet are the main cancer risk factors worldwide.   Tobacco use -- Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in the world; around a third of tobacco-caused deaths are due
        to cancer, according to projections from Cancer Research UK. Smoking and second-hand smoke contribute to at least 14 different cancers.  Alcohol use -- According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse website, a meta-analysis of 229 studies reporting on 115,199 cases
        confirms that high levels of alcohol consumption (more than four drinks per day) result in a substantial risk of cancer development at several
        sites. Lower levels of consumption result in a moderately increased risk for various cancers. In fact, the researchers were unable to identify
        a threshold level of alcohol consumption below which no increased risk for cancer is evident.  Lack of physical activity – A sedentary lifestyle is a risk factor for cancer. According to the NCI website, “There is convincing
        evidence that physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of cancers of the colon and breast. Several studies also have reported links
        between physical activity and a reduced risk of cancers of the prostate, lung, and lining of the uterus.”  Being overweight or obese – Seven different cancers have known links to obesity. The 2014 Cancer Progress Report from the American
        Association for Cancer Research states that overweight/obesity is responsible for nearly 25% of cancer incidence, and the American Institute for
        Cancer Research states that more than 121,000 cases of cancer each year are caused by excess body fat. A November 2014 position statement by the
        American Society of Clinical Oncology identified obesity as "quickly overtaking tobacco as the leading preventable cause of cancer."  Unhealthy diet with low fruit and vegetable intake – In an article published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, the author states that “Nutrient sparse foods such as concentrated
        sugars and refined flour products, …low fiber intake, consumption of red meat, and imbalance of omega 3 and omega 6 fats all contribute
        to excess cancer risk.”  Aging is another important factor in the development of cancer. That the incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age is most likely due to an accumulation
of risk factors combined with the tendency for cellular repair mechanisms to be less effective as a person grows older.  Nonetheless, although we
cannot change the fact that we age, we can age healthfully.   What Can We Do About Cancer Risk?  The good news is that according to the WHO’s World Cancer Report , one-third of cancer deaths could be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk
    factors, including lifestyle factors.  And in a 2008 review published in Pharmaceutical Research , scientists at MD Anderson Cancer Center
    present even stronger evidence for prevention:  “The evidence indicates that of all cancer-related deaths...25-30% are due to tobacco, ...30-35% are linked to diet, about 15-20% are due to infections,
    and the remaining percentage are due to other factors like radiation, stress ,
    physical activity, environmental pollutants, etc.” Declaring that inflammation is the link between the factors that cause cancer and those that prevent
    it, the authors provide strong evidence that “cancer is a preventable disease that requires major lifestyle changes.”  Biochemist Dr. T. Colin Campbell of Cornell goes even further: His empowering research proved to him that “diet trumps carcinogens every single time.”
    The 2007 joint report of the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund included a review of over 7000 scientific studies
    by a panel of 21 world-renowned experts.  Their conclusion: diets that are protective of cancer are mainly made up from foods of plant origin.
     A diet high in fruits and vegetables has
    been associated with a decreased risk of at least 15 different types of cancer.  According to CancerResearchUK.org, an estimated 14.1 million new cases of cancer occurred worldwide in 2012, and the World Cancer Report predicts
    that global cancer rates could increase to 15 million by 2020. What’s important is not the growth of cancer worldwide or even the statistic of your
    having a one in two lifetime risk of getting cancer.  What’s important is what you can do about it through wise lifestyle choices, and whether
    you are willing to seize that challenge.   Join the conversation. Create a topic in our forum.     References:  [1] Anand P, Kunnumakara A, Sundaram C, et al. Cancer is a preventable disease that requires major lifestyle changes. Pharm Res 2008 Sept; 25(9):2097-2116.

From the well-known triggers like smoking to new official risk factors such as eating red meat, it can feel like everything we do contains a risk. Cancer prevalence is rising with the most recent figures showing an estimated 14.1 million cancer cases around the world in 2012. Of these 7.4 million cases were in men and 6.7 million in women. Not only that but the number is expected to increase to 24 million by 2035. So are we all destined to get cancer or are there things we can do to prevent it? Writer and founder of the medical blogging site The Hippocratic Post , Thea Jourdan explains the risk of getting cancer.          Most people will be affected by cancer in their lifetime either through getting it themselves or knowing someone has it. Figures reveal one in three of us will develop cancer at some stage THE LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING CANCER  Cancer is such a common illness now that it has been estimated that more than one in three people (33 per cent) will develop cancer at some point in their lifetime, according to MacMillan Cancer Support.          Cancers can occur at any time but the risk increases with age Cancers can occur at any age, but the risk of developing cancer increases with age. The probability that a man will develop cancer in the next 12 months doubles from 65-69, when it is 1.8 per cent to 3.5 per cent when he is over 85 years old. The same jump is seen in older women, rising from a 1.3 per cent chance for women aged between 65-69 to 2.1 per cent when she is over the age of 85, according to figures from Cancer Research UK. By 2030 it is estimated that three million people in England will have had some form of the disease, which is caused by abnormal cell growth. Around one third of cancers, including lung cancer and bowel cancer are linked to smoking, diet, alcohol and obesity, but age is a major risk factor. WHO IS MOST AT RISK? Figures show that death rates from cancer accelerate as people age. Tom Stansfeld, health information officer at Cancer Research UK explains: ‘Cancer is a disease that develops when cells’ DNA gets damaged, upsetting the normal process of cell growth, division and death and letting cells grow out of control.

Instead of dying like a normal healthy cells, cancer cells start multiplying freely and spread throughout the body. This is a cumulative effect so cancer becomes more likely with age.          The chances of getting cancer increase with age and a third of cancers are linked to lifestyle factors such as smoking and diet In fact, 63 per cent of cases are diagnosed in people aged 65 and over, according to The King’s Fund. The average number of cancer cases diagnosed in a given year rises rapidly in both men and women from the age of 60 to over 80, according to 2009-2011 figures published by Cancer Research UK. The lifetime risk of developing cancer is about one in three people. The probability of a man aged 65 to 69 being diagnosed with cancer in the next year is 1.8 per cent. But by the time a man is aged between 80 to 84, that probability has gone up to 3.2 per cent and the probability of a man aged 85+ being diagnosed with cancer in the next year is 3.5 per cent. Women of all ages have less risk of being diagnosed with cancer than men. The probability of a woman aged 65 to 69 being diagnosed with cancer in the next year is 1.3 per cent, going up to 2.1 per cent for women over the age of 85. This is probably due to the prevalence of prostate cancer in men – it affects most men over the age of 80. THE MOST COMMON AND MOST DEADLY          Breast cancer is the most common for women Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in the UK, although it is not the most common cancer. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, followed by bowel cancer and then lung cancer. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, followed by lung cancer. Professor Ian Smith, head of the Breast Unit at the Royal Marsden Hospital, says that although the lifetime risk of breast cancer for a woman is 12.5 per cent, this rises steadily with age. Just over 80 per cent of breast cancers occur in women who are over the age of 50. Around a third (34 per cent) of cancer cases diagnosed in females aged 50-74 are breast cancers, many of which are diagnosed through mammogram screening. Nearly half of all breast cancer cases are diagnosed in people in the 50-69 age group, but risk does increase with age.        IMPROVING SURVIVAL RATES Survival rates are improving all the time. According to Cancer Research UK, 85.1 per cent of adult female breast cancer patients in England and Wales survived their cancer for five years or more in 2005-2009 compared with 86.6 per cent in 2010-2011. ‘The improved survival rates are due to earlier diagnosis and improved treatments,’ says Professor Ian Smith.          While cancer rates are steadily rising, so are the survival rates with improved diagnosis and treatment behind the better survival rates, according to experts Prostate cancer, which accounts for more than a quarter (28 per cent) of cancer cases diagnosed in men aged between 50-74, is so common in elderly men that if it was reported accurately, it would probably be found in most men over the age of 80, according to Chris Parker, a consultant prostate oncologist at the Royal Marsden. ‘However, only 3 per cent of all men die from prostate cancer, because it is too slow growing to cause health problems and death occurs because of something else.’ Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, followed by lung cancer.

By Mayo Clinic Staff    You might wonder about your chances of developing cancer. News reports can make it sound as if every day something is found to dramatically raise your risk. Sorting through all the information and figuring out what's valid can be tricky.   What is risk?    When scientists talk about risk, they're referring to a probability — the chance that something may occur, but not a guarantee that it will. For example, if you flip a coin, there is one chance in two, or a 50 percent chance, that the coin will land heads up.  Risk estimates for cancer and other diseases are determined by studying large groups of people. Researchers focus on the probability that any person or category of people will develop the disease over a certain period of time. They also look to see what characteristics or behaviors are associated with increased or decreased risk.   How is risk expressed?      Absolute risk        Relative risk    Risk is generally divided into two categories: absolute risk and relative risk.  Absolute risk  Absolute risk refers to the actual numeric chance or probability of developing cancer during a specified time period — for example, within the year, within the next five years, by age 50, by age 70, or during the course of a lifetime.  One type of absolute risk is lifetime risk, which is the probability that an individual will develop cancer during the course of a lifetime. For instance, an American man's absolute risk of developing prostate cancer in his lifetime is about 12 percent. Put another way, about 12 out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer at some time in their lives. This also means that 88 out of every 100 men won't develop prostate cancer.  Lifetime risk isn't the risk that a person will develop cancer in the next year or the next five years. An individual's cancer risk has a lot to do with other factors, such as age. For instance, a woman's lifetime risk of developing colon and rectal cancer is just over 4 percent, or about 42 out of every 1,000 women. But her risk of developing colon and rectal cancer before the age of 50 is 0.3 percent, or about 3 out of every 1,000 women.  Relative risk  Relative risk gives you a comparison or ratio rather than an absolute value. It shows the strength of the relationship between a risk factor and a particular type of cancer by comparing the number of cancers in a group of people who have a particular trait with the number of cancers in a group of people who don't have that trait.  For instance, compare the relative lung cancer risk for people who smoke with the relative lung cancer risk in a similar group of people who don't smoke. You might hear relative risk being expressed like this: The risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25 times higher than the risk for people who don't smoke. So the relative risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25.  Relative risk is also given as a percentage. For example, the risk of lung cancer for smokers is 2,500 percent higher than it is for people who don't smoke.  When you hear about relative risk, there's no upper limit to the percentage increase in risk. Most people think 100 percent is the highest possible risk, but that isn't true in this case.  A relative risk of 100 percent means your risk is twice as high as that of someone without that risk factor. A 200 percent relative risk means that you are three times as likely to develop that condition.  Risk seems greater when put in these terms. A 100 percent increase in risk may seem enormous, but if the risk began as 1 in 100 people, a 100 percent increase in risk means that 2 out of 100 will be affected.

The number of deaths was 166.1 per 100,000 men and women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2010-2014 cases and deaths.  Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer : Approximately 38.5 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer of any site at some point during their lifetime, based on 2012-2014 data.  Prevalence of This Cancer : In 2014, there were an estimated 14,738,719 people living with cancer of any site in the United States.   Survival Statistics   How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Cancer of Any Site?  Relative survival statistics compare the survival of patients diagnosed with cancer with the survival of people in the general population who are the same age, race, and sex and who have not been diagnosed with cancer. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.          Percent Surviving 5 Years  67.0%      Based on data from SEER 18 2007-2013. Gray figures represent those who have died from cancer of any site. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.

Females have the highest lifetime risk of breast, lung and bowel cancers.  Males have the highest lifetime risk of prostate, lung and bowel cancers.  See more in-depth statistics on lifetime risk of being diagnosed with cancer        Preventable cancers     A person’s risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including age, genetics, and exposure to risk factors.  Around 4 in 10 UK cancer cases every year could be prevented, that’s more than 135,000 every year.  Nearly 112,000 England cases, around 13,000 Scotland cancer cases, around 7,200 Wales cancer cases, and around 3,500 Northern Ireland cancer cases every year could be prevented.  Lung cancer, bowel cancer, melanoma skin cancer, and breast cancer together account for almost two-thirds of all preventable cancer cases in the UK.  For 10 cancer types, including two of the five most common cancer types in the UK (lung cancer and melanoma skin cancer), more than 70% of UK cancer cases were attributable to known risk factors.  Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, exposure to certain substances at work, exposure to certain infections, drinking alcohol, and eating too little fibre each cause 3-4% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to ionising radiation and eating processed meat each cause 1-2% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to outdoor air pollution and doing too little physical activity each cause 1% or less of cancer cases in the UK.  See more in-depth statistics on preventable cancer cases        Tobacco statistics     Smoking is the largest cause of cancer in the UK.  Around 1 in 5 UK adults currently smoke cigarettes, around 9.4 million people.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults in the UK decreases with age.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults has decreased since the late 1940s.  In recent years the difference between men and women in cigarette smoking prevalence has narrowed.  Cigarette smoking in England is more common in people living in the most deprived areas.  Cigarette smoking prevalence varies by ethnic group but patterns are difficult to interpret.  Worldwide, 1 billion adults currently smoke cigarettes.  Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in the world, and around a third of tobacco-caused deaths are due to cancer (2015 projected).  Around 11,000 deaths per year in the UK are caused by second-hand smoke, four-fifths occurring at home and the rest from the workplace.  More than half of smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are successful.  Almost 4 in 10 smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in Scotland are successful.  See more in-depth statistics on tobacco        Childhood smoking statistics     Smoking prevalence is higher in children whose parents, siblings and/or peers smoke.  Almost 5 in 100 children under 16 in the UK smoke regularly.  Almost a fifth of children have tried smoking, and girls are much more likely than boys to smoke.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England increases with age.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England has decreased since the 1990s.  Around 40% of regular smokers in Great Britain began smoking before age 16.  Around 7 million smokers in 2012 in the UK started smoking before the age of 18.  An average of 136,500 children aged 11-15 started smoking each year between 2012 and 2014 in the UK but the number of new childhood smokers each year is falling.  See more in-depth statistics on childhood smoking        Alcohol statistics     Drinking too much alcohol causes 3% of cancer cases in the UK.  Nearly 6 in 10 adults in Great Britain drank alcohol at least once in the past week.  Under 1 in 10 children aged 11-15 in England drank alcohol at least once in the past week. Alcohol drinking prevalence in children increases with age, and rates have decreased since 2003.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain peaks in middle-age.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain has decreased since 2005, this is mainly due to declining prevalence among younger adults.  Around half of adults in Great Britain who drank alcohol at least once in the past week exceeded the recommended daily alcohol limit on their heaviest drinking day.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain is higher in employed people compared with unemployed or economically inactive people.  Alcohol drinking prevalence adults in Great Britain is more common in white people than non-white people.  Alcohol drinking causes an estimated 6% of deaths worldwide, around 1 in 8 of which are due to cancer (2012). Alcohol drinking prevalence is highest in Europe and America.  See more in-depth statistics on alcohol        Adult overweight and obesity statistics     Overweight and obesity causes more than 1 in 20 cancer cases in the UK.  More than 6 in 10 UK adults are overweight or obese (body mass index 25 or more).  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in the UK increases until late middle-age and then decreases in older adults. However, prevalence of overweight and obesity increases in Scotland in older females and in Northern Ireland.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England has increased since the early 1990s.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England is higher in lower-income households compared with higher-income households.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity varies by ethnic group in England.  Overweight and obesity prevalence is increasing particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Overweight and obesity are leading causes of death worldwide.  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for adults        Childhood overweight and obesity statistics     People who are overweight or obese in early life may remain obese in adulthood.  Around 3 in 10 children in the UK’s constituent countries are overweight or obese.  Childhood overweight and obesity prevalence in England has increased since the mid-1990s, though this includes an increase to the mid-2000s followed by a decrease.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity among children in England is higher in those from lower-income households compared with higher income households  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for children        Cancer risk publications            Preventable cancers poster (simple version) (August 2014)  Preventable cancers poster (in-depth version)  (August 2014)  Preventable cancers PowerPoint slides (September 2014)  Want to create your own lifetime risk calculations?

But shockingly, half of all adults will get a cancer diagnosis, according to a new study from the British Journal of Cancer , which predicts that one out of every two U.K. adults born in 1960 will develop the disease during their lifetime.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    Broken down by gender, the numbers slightly favor women, but only because more men smoke: Men born in 1960 have a lifetime cancer risk of 53.5 percent, while the risk is 47.5 percent for women. The study forecasts a rise in cancer rates; by contrast, only one in three U.K. residents born in 1930 were projected to get cancer. It’s scary news, but do the numbers translate across the pond here in America? They line up pretty closely, says Len Lichtenfeld, M.D., deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, with one in two men and one in three women in the U.S. expected to be diagnosed with the big C. “The numbers reflect a few things: First, people are living longer, and advancing age is a significant risk factor for cancer,” says Lichtenfeld. “Also, we’re diagnosing cancer at greater rates because of technological advances in screening, such as mammography for breast cancer and PSA tests for prostate cancer.” Speaking of better diagnostic tools, this is the reason for some good news concerning cancer: While more people are receiving a cancer diagnosis, the death rates for the disease have been steadily going down. “Since the early 1990s, cancer deaths have declined about 20 percent,” says Lichtenfeld. And keep in mind that the stats, while startling, don’t take into account an individual’s lifestyle, which plays a role. Not using tobacco, being active, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in processed food are all things that can keep your lifetime cancer risk lower than the numbers predict.

country, you know that smoking isn't exactly the best thing for your
health. Scientists have succeeded in associating the habit with
everything from countless cancers to bad-hair days, or so it seems with
some reports.  Nevertheless, during the 33rd annual Great American Smokeout this
Thursday, many of the estimated 43 million adult smokers in the United
States will choose to willfully continue smoking while grumbling about
how the reported health risks are overblown.  In some respects they are right. A public health message has been spun to imply that not only will smoking surely kill you but it will come to spit on your grave after you die. This has caused a
backlash among smokers who mock the health statistics and, persuasively
to some, attribute most of smoking's ills to bad genetics.  A reexamination of the statistics might help to clear the air.   Didn't kill grandpa   Surprisingly, fewer than 10 percent of lifelong smokers will get
lung cancer. Fewer yet will contract the long list of other cancers,
such as throat or mouth cancers. In the game of risk, you're more
likely to have a condom break than to get cancer from smoking.  That the majority of smokers beat cancer doesn't make for effective
anti-smoking campaigning. So the statistics are turned around: Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 87 percent of lung
cancer deaths; the risk of developing lung cancer is about 23 times
higher in male smokers compared to non-smokers; smoking is associated
with increased risk of at least 15 types of cancer; or that smoking
causes millions of deaths worldwide.  What does this mean? To the happy and dedicated smoker, it means
nothing. The Internet is rife with pro-smoking sites dismissing these
kinds of facts. There are billions of people, the argument goes, and
they have to die of something, even rare diseases .   The smoking gun   Rarely are simple messages heard, such as the fact that about half
of all smokers will die from smoking, and of these, about half will die
before or around age 50. These numbers come from a landmark 50-year
study of physicians in England, initiated in 1951.  Similarly, research from the ongoing Nurses' Health Study, published in May this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association ,
finds that 64 percent of nurses who smoked died from smoking-related
causes. The life expectancy for a smoker in the United States is about
64, which is 14 years shorter than the national average (which includes
smokers), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Going by these numbers it becomes clear that few pastimes, habits or
addictions are deadlier than smoking. Only Russian roulette and
scorpion juggling come to mind.   Much more than cancer   Part of the problem of the misconception of real risks is the
emphasis on smoking and lung cancer. The greater danger is from
vascular diseases leading to heart attacks and stroke, which kill more
smokers than all cancers combined. Toxins in the tobacco smoke cause
inflammation and hardening in the arteries.  Nearly as common as lung cancer among smokers is chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, which entails the narrowing of airways in the lung,
largely in the form of chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Bronchitis is a
result of smoking-induced inflammation; emphysema stems from cigarette
smoking hardening the alveoli, the little sacks in the lungs where
oxygen meets blood.  If painful death as a middle-age adult doesn't move you, consider
life-quality issues. Smokers get sick more often because smoke
paralyzes tiny hair-like structures in the lungs called cilia, which
otherwise sweep dirt and bacteria out of your lungs. Smokers have less
endurance, particularly sexual endurance , because carbon monoxide replaces oxygen in the blood.  Yet the core argument of ardent smokers remains firm: Smoking
doesn't kill everyone. About 50 percent of smokers do reach old age,
albeit with diminished taste buds, diminished endurance, diminished
eyesight, yellow teeth and bad breath.  Quitting isn't easy. But the first steps are believing the risks are real and deciding whether they are worth avoiding.   10 Easy Paths to Self Destruction  Top 10 Bad Things That Are Good For You  Video - Addiction is in Your Genes    Christopher Wanjek is the author of the books " Bad Medicine " and " Food At Work ."

Category Cancer A-Z          Cancer Basics             Lifetime Risk of Developing or Dying From Cancer      The lifetime risk of developing or dying from cancer refers to the chance a person has, over the course of his or her lifetime (from birth to death), of being diagnosed with or dying from cancer. These risk estimates, like annual incidence and mortality data, provide another measure of how widespread cancer is in the United States.  The following tables list lifetime risks of developing and dying from certain cancers for men and women. The information is from the US National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Database, and is based on incidence and mortality data for the United States from 2012 through 2014, the most current years for which data are available.  The risk is expressed both in terms of a percentage and as odds.   For example, the risk that a man will develop bladder cancer during his lifetime is 3.76%. This means he has about 1 chance in 27 of developing bladder cancer (100/3.76 = 26.6).  Put another way, 1 out of every 27 men in the United States will develop bladder cancer during his lifetime.   These numbers are average risks for the overall US population. Your risk may be higher or lower than these numbers, depending on your particular risk factors.

Unfortunately, these messages are often missing basic facts needed for people to understand their chance of cancer: the magnitude of the chance and how it compares with the chance of other diseases.  Risk charts present these basic facts by showing the chance of dying from a variety of cancer and other diseases over specific time frames. Because age, sex and race are so important in determining your chances, the charts let you account for these factors. While other factors make an important difference (like smoking or having a serious disease run in your family), the numbers from the charts will get you into the right ballpark.  Get Started  Choose from one of the four risk charts offered below.         Big Picture Charts  Ready made charts with the 10-year chance of dying from major causes.  View The Charts   Create Custom Charts  Select the causes of death and time frame for the chart.  Design A Chart   Your Chances  Display the chances of dying from the most common causes based on age, race and sex.  View Your Chances   Special Cancer Tables  Compare the risk of diagnosis and death for specific cancers.  View Comparisons         DISCLAIMER: The charts do not account for some individual characteristics that affect the chance of death, most importantly smoking. Smoking substantially increases the chance of dying from heart attacks, stroke, lung cancer, chronic lung disease, and all-causes combined. If you smoke, your chances of dying from these causes are higher than those shown in the charts - and if you never smoked, your chances of dying are lower.

By Mayo Clinic Staff    You might wonder about your chances of developing cancer. News reports can make it sound as if every day something is found to dramatically raise your risk. Sorting through all the information and figuring out what's valid can be tricky.   What is risk?    When scientists talk about risk, they're referring to a probability — the chance that something may occur, but not a guarantee that it will. For example, if you flip a coin, there is one chance in two, or a 50 percent chance, that the coin will land heads up.  Risk estimates for cancer and other diseases are determined by studying large groups of people. Researchers focus on the probability that any person or category of people will develop the disease over a certain period of time. They also look to see what characteristics or behaviors are associated with increased or decreased risk.   How is risk expressed?      Absolute risk        Relative risk    Risk is generally divided into two categories: absolute risk and relative risk.  Absolute risk  Absolute risk refers to the actual numeric chance or probability of developing cancer during a specified time period — for example, within the year, within the next five years, by age 50, by age 70, or during the course of a lifetime.  One type of absolute risk is lifetime risk, which is the probability that an individual will develop cancer during the course of a lifetime. For instance, an American man's absolute risk of developing prostate cancer in his lifetime is about 12 percent. Put another way, about 12 out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer at some time in their lives. This also means that 88 out of every 100 men won't develop prostate cancer.  Lifetime risk isn't the risk that a person will develop cancer in the next year or the next five years. An individual's cancer risk has a lot to do with other factors, such as age. For instance, a woman's lifetime risk of developing colon and rectal cancer is just over 4 percent, or about 42 out of every 1,000 women. But her risk of developing colon and rectal cancer before the age of 50 is 0.3 percent, or about 3 out of every 1,000 women.  Relative risk  Relative risk gives you a comparison or ratio rather than an absolute value. It shows the strength of the relationship between a risk factor and a particular type of cancer by comparing the number of cancers in a group of people who have a particular trait with the number of cancers in a group of people who don't have that trait.  For instance, compare the relative lung cancer risk for people who smoke with the relative lung cancer risk in a similar group of people who don't smoke. You might hear relative risk being expressed like this: The risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25 times higher than the risk for people who don't smoke. So the relative risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25.  Relative risk is also given as a percentage. For example, the risk of lung cancer for smokers is 2,500 percent higher than it is for people who don't smoke.  When you hear about relative risk, there's no upper limit to the percentage increase in risk. Most people think 100 percent is the highest possible risk, but that isn't true in this case.  A relative risk of 100 percent means your risk is twice as high as that of someone without that risk factor. A 200 percent relative risk means that you are three times as likely to develop that condition.  Risk seems greater when put in these terms. A 100 percent increase in risk may seem enormous, but if the risk began as 1 in 100 people, a 100 percent increase in risk means that 2 out of 100 will be affected.

Jordan           New Study: 1 in 2 People Will Get Cancer  Your odds are frightening—but here’s what you can do to reduce your chances              By Esther Crain for Women's Health and Thinkstock     Apr 1, 2015                                        Hearing “you have cancer” from your doctor is something no one wants to experience at any point in life. But shockingly, half of all adults will get a cancer diagnosis, according to a new study from the British Journal of Cancer , which predicts that one out of every two U.K. adults born in 1960 will develop the disease during their lifetime.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below    Broken down by gender, the numbers slightly favor women, but only because more men smoke: Men born in 1960 have a lifetime cancer risk of 53.5 percent, while the risk is 47.5 percent for women. The study forecasts a rise in cancer rates; by contrast, only one in three U.K. residents born in 1930 were projected to get cancer. It’s scary news, but do the numbers translate across the pond here in America? They line up pretty closely, says Len Lichtenfeld, M.D., deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, with one in two men and one in three women in the U.S. expected to be diagnosed with the big C. “The numbers reflect a few things: First, people are living longer, and advancing age is a significant risk factor for cancer,” says Lichtenfeld. “Also, we’re diagnosing cancer at greater rates because of technological advances in screening, such as mammography for breast cancer and PSA tests for prostate cancer.” Speaking of better diagnostic tools, this is the reason for some good news concerning cancer: While more people are receiving a cancer diagnosis, the death rates for the disease have been steadily going down. “Since the early 1990s, cancer deaths have declined about 20 percent,” says Lichtenfeld. And keep in mind that the stats, while startling, don’t take into account an individual’s lifestyle, which plays a role. Not using tobacco, being active, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in processed food are all things that can keep your lifetime cancer risk lower than the numbers predict.

In the UK in 2013-2015, on average each year more than a third (36%) of new cases were in people aged 75 and over.[ 1-4 ]  Age-specific incidence rates rise steeply from around age 55-59. The highest rates are in the 85 to 89 age group for males and females.  Incidence rates are significantly lower in males than females in the younger age groups and significantly higher in males than females in the older age groups. The gap is widest at age 90+, when the age-specific incidence rate is 1.7 times higher in males than females.  All Cancers (C00-C97 Excl.

There are more people aged 50-74 than aged 75+ in the population overall, hence the number of cancer cases is higher in 50-74s, but incidence rates are higher in 75+s.

Females have the highest lifetime risk of breast, lung and bowel cancers.  Males have the highest lifetime risk of prostate, lung and bowel cancers.  See more in-depth statistics on lifetime risk of being diagnosed with cancer        Preventable cancers     A person’s risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including age, genetics, and exposure to risk factors.  Around 4 in 10 UK cancer cases every year could be prevented, that’s more than 135,000 every year.  Nearly 112,000 England cases, around 13,000 Scotland cancer cases, around 7,200 Wales cancer cases, and around 3,500 Northern Ireland cancer cases every year could be prevented.  Lung cancer, bowel cancer, melanoma skin cancer, and breast cancer together account for almost two-thirds of all preventable cancer cases in the UK.  For 10 cancer types, including two of the five most common cancer types in the UK (lung cancer and melanoma skin cancer), more than 70% of UK cancer cases were attributable to known risk factors.  Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, exposure to certain substances at work, exposure to certain infections, drinking alcohol, and eating too little fibre each cause 3-4% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to ionising radiation and eating processed meat each cause 1-2% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to outdoor air pollution and doing too little physical activity each cause 1% or less of cancer cases in the UK.  See more in-depth statistics on preventable cancer cases        Tobacco statistics     Smoking is the largest cause of cancer in the UK.  Around 1 in 5 UK adults currently smoke cigarettes, around 9.4 million people.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults in the UK decreases with age.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults has decreased since the late 1940s.  In recent years the difference between men and women in cigarette smoking prevalence has narrowed.  Cigarette smoking in England is more common in people living in the most deprived areas.  Cigarette smoking prevalence varies by ethnic group but patterns are difficult to interpret.  Worldwide, 1 billion adults currently smoke cigarettes.  Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in the world, and around a third of tobacco-caused deaths are due to cancer (2015 projected).  Around 11,000 deaths per year in the UK are caused by second-hand smoke, four-fifths occurring at home and the rest from the workplace.  More than half of smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are successful.  Almost 4 in 10 smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in Scotland are successful.  See more in-depth statistics on tobacco        Childhood smoking statistics     Smoking prevalence is higher in children whose parents, siblings and/or peers smoke.  Almost 5 in 100 children under 16 in the UK smoke regularly.  Almost a fifth of children have tried smoking, and girls are much more likely than boys to smoke.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England increases with age.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England has decreased since the 1990s.  Around 40% of regular smokers in Great Britain began smoking before age 16.  Around 7 million smokers in 2012 in the UK started smoking before the age of 18.  An average of 136,500 children aged 11-15 started smoking each year between 2012 and 2014 in the UK but the number of new childhood smokers each year is falling.  See more in-depth statistics on childhood smoking        Alcohol statistics     Drinking too much alcohol causes 3% of cancer cases in the UK.  Nearly 6 in 10 adults in Great Britain drank alcohol at least once in the past week.  Under 1 in 10 children aged 11-15 in England drank alcohol at least once in the past week. Alcohol drinking prevalence in children increases with age, and rates have decreased since 2003.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain peaks in middle-age.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain has decreased since 2005, this is mainly due to declining prevalence among younger adults.  Around half of adults in Great Britain who drank alcohol at least once in the past week exceeded the recommended daily alcohol limit on their heaviest drinking day.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain is higher in employed people compared with unemployed or economically inactive people.  Alcohol drinking prevalence adults in Great Britain is more common in white people than non-white people.  Alcohol drinking causes an estimated 6% of deaths worldwide, around 1 in 8 of which are due to cancer (2012). Alcohol drinking prevalence is highest in Europe and America.  See more in-depth statistics on alcohol        Adult overweight and obesity statistics     Overweight and obesity causes more than 1 in 20 cancer cases in the UK.  More than 6 in 10 UK adults are overweight or obese (body mass index 25 or more).  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in the UK increases until late middle-age and then decreases in older adults. However, prevalence of overweight and obesity increases in Scotland in older females and in Northern Ireland.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England has increased since the early 1990s.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England is higher in lower-income households compared with higher-income households.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity varies by ethnic group in England.  Overweight and obesity prevalence is increasing particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Overweight and obesity are leading causes of death worldwide.  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for adults        Childhood overweight and obesity statistics     People who are overweight or obese in early life may remain obese in adulthood.  Around 3 in 10 children in the UK’s constituent countries are overweight or obese.  Childhood overweight and obesity prevalence in England has increased since the mid-1990s, though this includes an increase to the mid-2000s followed by a decrease.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity among children in England is higher in those from lower-income households compared with higher income households  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for children        Cancer risk publications            Preventable cancers poster (simple version) (August 2014)  Preventable cancers poster (in-depth version)  (August 2014)  Preventable cancers PowerPoint slides (September 2014)  Want to create your own lifetime risk calculations?

What Are Your Chances of Getting Cancer?                What Are Your Chances of Getting Cancer?  2015 - 07 - 21     A few days ago a supporter wrote, “My teammate shared this image on Facebook and got slammed
    by someone calling it ‘misinformed,’’misleading’ and ‘junk science.’ I have no idea where I could find the truth, and I thought perhaps you could point
    me in the right direction.” As my late friend Dr. David Kritchevsky, former Associate Director of Wistar Institute, quipped, “If you torture the statistics
    long enough they’ll confess.”  So should we trust those statistics?  I have not found a source for lifetime cancer risk in 1900, but the later data seem to have originated from the website of Cancer Research of the United
    Kingdom (cancerresearchuk.org), which states: “In 1975 the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with cancer in the UK was one in four people; by the 1990s it had risen to one in three, and by 2010 it was four in 10.” That means that the risk of getting cancer
    is now close to one in two.  Similar data come from the SEER Cancer Statistics Review released April 23, 2015.  The Review, a report of the most recent cancer incidence, mortality,
    survival, prevalence, and lifetime risk statistics, is published annually by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The latest edition includes statistics
    from 1975 through 2012, the most recent year for which data are available. For all sites, the lifetime risk was again declared to be four in 10.  That figure is corroborated by the American Cancer Society website, which states that the risk of developing cancer for all invasive cancer sites is one
    in two for males and one in three for females.  Indeed, the odds of avoiding a cancer diagnosis do not seem very good. But read on.  Cancer Risk Factors  On the Mayo Clinic site, in an article entitled “Cancer Risk: What the Numbers Mean,” the writer explains:  “ Risk statistics can be frustrating because they can't tell you your risk of cancer. Studies may have found that men have a nearly 45
    percent chance of developing cancer in their lifetimes, but that doesn't mean your risk is 45 percent. Your individual risk is based on many different
    factors, such as age and habits (including eating habits), family history of cancer, and the environment in which you live.”  The World Health Organization (WHO), through its International Agency for Research on Cancer, classifies cancer causing agents in three main groups:   physical carcinogens (such as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation)  chemical carcinogens (such as asbestos, tobacco, pesticides and arsenic )  biological carcinogens (such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and Human Papilloma viral infections ,
        which increase the risk for liver or cervical cancer ).
        Infections account for a high proportion – about 18% -- of the global cancer burden.    Smoking , alcohol, physical inactivity, overweight or
    obesity, and unhealthy diet are the main cancer risk factors worldwide.   Tobacco use -- Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in the world; around a third of tobacco-caused deaths are due
        to cancer, according to projections from Cancer Research UK. Smoking and second-hand smoke contribute to at least 14 different cancers.  Alcohol use -- According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse website, a meta-analysis of 229 studies reporting on 115,199 cases
        confirms that high levels of alcohol consumption (more than four drinks per day) result in a substantial risk of cancer development at several
        sites. Lower levels of consumption result in a moderately increased risk for various cancers. In fact, the researchers were unable to identify
        a threshold level of alcohol consumption below which no increased risk for cancer is evident.  Lack of physical activity – A sedentary lifestyle is a risk factor for cancer. According to the NCI website, “There is convincing
        evidence that physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of cancers of the colon and breast. Several studies also have reported links
        between physical activity and a reduced risk of cancers of the prostate, lung, and lining of the uterus.”  Being overweight or obese – Seven different cancers have known links to obesity. The 2014 Cancer Progress Report from the American
        Association for Cancer Research states that overweight/obesity is responsible for nearly 25% of cancer incidence, and the American Institute for
        Cancer Research states that more than 121,000 cases of cancer each year are caused by excess body fat. A November 2014 position statement by the
        American Society of Clinical Oncology identified obesity as "quickly overtaking tobacco as the leading preventable cause of cancer."  Unhealthy diet with low fruit and vegetable intake – In an article published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, the author states that “Nutrient sparse foods such as concentrated
        sugars and refined flour products, …low fiber intake, consumption of red meat, and imbalance of omega 3 and omega 6 fats all contribute
        to excess cancer risk.”  Aging is another important factor in the development of cancer. That the incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age is most likely due to an accumulation
of risk factors combined with the tendency for cellular repair mechanisms to be less effective as a person grows older.  Nonetheless, although we
cannot change the fact that we age, we can age healthfully.   What Can We Do About Cancer Risk?  The good news is that according to the WHO’s World Cancer Report , one-third of cancer deaths could be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk
    factors, including lifestyle factors.  And in a 2008 review published in Pharmaceutical Research , scientists at MD Anderson Cancer Center
    present even stronger evidence for prevention:  “The evidence indicates that of all cancer-related deaths...25-30% are due to tobacco, ...30-35% are linked to diet, about 15-20% are due to infections,
    and the remaining percentage are due to other factors like radiation, stress ,
    physical activity, environmental pollutants, etc.” Declaring that inflammation is the link between the factors that cause cancer and those that prevent
    it, the authors provide strong evidence that “cancer is a preventable disease that requires major lifestyle changes.”  Biochemist Dr. T. Colin Campbell of Cornell goes even further: His empowering research proved to him that “diet trumps carcinogens every single time.”
    The 2007 joint report of the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund included a review of over 7000 scientific studies
    by a panel of 21 world-renowned experts.  Their conclusion: diets that are protective of cancer are mainly made up from foods of plant origin.
     A diet high in fruits and vegetables has
    been associated with a decreased risk of at least 15 different types of cancer.  According to CancerResearchUK.org, an estimated 14.1 million new cases of cancer occurred worldwide in 2012, and the World Cancer Report predicts
    that global cancer rates could increase to 15 million by 2020. What’s important is not the growth of cancer worldwide or even the statistic of your
    having a one in two lifetime risk of getting cancer.  What’s important is what you can do about it through wise lifestyle choices, and whether
    you are willing to seize that challenge.   Join the conversation. Create a topic in our forum.     References:  [1] Anand P, Kunnumakara A, Sundaram C, et al. Cancer is a preventable disease that requires major lifestyle changes. Pharm Res 2008 Sept; 25(9):2097-2116.

From the well-known triggers like smoking to new official risk factors such as eating red meat, it can feel like everything we do contains a risk. Cancer prevalence is rising with the most recent figures showing an estimated 14.1 million cancer cases around the world in 2012. Of these 7.4 million cases were in men and 6.7 million in women. Not only that but the number is expected to increase to 24 million by 2035. So are we all destined to get cancer or are there things we can do to prevent it? Writer and founder of the medical blogging site The Hippocratic Post , Thea Jourdan explains the risk of getting cancer.          Most people will be affected by cancer in their lifetime either through getting it themselves or knowing someone has it. Figures reveal one in three of us will develop cancer at some stage THE LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING CANCER  Cancer is such a common illness now that it has been estimated that more than one in three people (33 per cent) will develop cancer at some point in their lifetime, according to MacMillan Cancer Support.          Cancers can occur at any time but the risk increases with age Cancers can occur at any age, but the risk of developing cancer increases with age. The probability that a man will develop cancer in the next 12 months doubles from 65-69, when it is 1.8 per cent to 3.5 per cent when he is over 85 years old. The same jump is seen in older women, rising from a 1.3 per cent chance for women aged between 65-69 to 2.1 per cent when she is over the age of 85, according to figures from Cancer Research UK. By 2030 it is estimated that three million people in England will have had some form of the disease, which is caused by abnormal cell growth. Around one third of cancers, including lung cancer and bowel cancer are linked to smoking, diet, alcohol and obesity, but age is a major risk factor. WHO IS MOST AT RISK? Figures show that death rates from cancer accelerate as people age. Tom Stansfeld, health information officer at Cancer Research UK explains: ‘Cancer is a disease that develops when cells’ DNA gets damaged, upsetting the normal process of cell growth, division and death and letting cells grow out of control.

Instead of dying like a normal healthy cells, cancer cells start multiplying freely and spread throughout the body. This is a cumulative effect so cancer becomes more likely with age.          The chances of getting cancer increase with age and a third of cancers are linked to lifestyle factors such as smoking and diet In fact, 63 per cent of cases are diagnosed in people aged 65 and over, according to The King’s Fund. The average number of cancer cases diagnosed in a given year rises rapidly in both men and women from the age of 60 to over 80, according to 2009-2011 figures published by Cancer Research UK. The lifetime risk of developing cancer is about one in three people. The probability of a man aged 65 to 69 being diagnosed with cancer in the next year is 1.8 per cent. But by the time a man is aged between 80 to 84, that probability has gone up to 3.2 per cent and the probability of a man aged 85+ being diagnosed with cancer in the next year is 3.5 per cent. Women of all ages have less risk of being diagnosed with cancer than men. The probability of a woman aged 65 to 69 being diagnosed with cancer in the next year is 1.3 per cent, going up to 2.1 per cent for women over the age of 85. This is probably due to the prevalence of prostate cancer in men – it affects most men over the age of 80. THE MOST COMMON AND MOST DEADLY          Breast cancer is the most common for women Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in the UK, although it is not the most common cancer. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, followed by bowel cancer and then lung cancer. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, followed by lung cancer. Professor Ian Smith, head of the Breast Unit at the Royal Marsden Hospital, says that although the lifetime risk of breast cancer for a woman is 12.5 per cent, this rises steadily with age. Just over 80 per cent of breast cancers occur in women who are over the age of 50. Around a third (34 per cent) of cancer cases diagnosed in females aged 50-74 are breast cancers, many of which are diagnosed through mammogram screening. Nearly half of all breast cancer cases are diagnosed in people in the 50-69 age group, but risk does increase with age.        IMPROVING SURVIVAL RATES Survival rates are improving all the time. According to Cancer Research UK, 85.1 per cent of adult female breast cancer patients in England and Wales survived their cancer for five years or more in 2005-2009 compared with 86.6 per cent in 2010-2011. ‘The improved survival rates are due to earlier diagnosis and improved treatments,’ says Professor Ian Smith.          While cancer rates are steadily rising, so are the survival rates with improved diagnosis and treatment behind the better survival rates, according to experts Prostate cancer, which accounts for more than a quarter (28 per cent) of cancer cases diagnosed in men aged between 50-74, is so common in elderly men that if it was reported accurately, it would probably be found in most men over the age of 80, according to Chris Parker, a consultant prostate oncologist at the Royal Marsden. ‘However, only 3 per cent of all men die from prostate cancer, because it is too slow growing to cause health problems and death occurs because of something else.’ Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, followed by lung cancer.
