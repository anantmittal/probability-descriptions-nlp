My problem is that I've tried two approaches which both seem valid to me, but give differing answers.  One approach is to use binomial probability, where the probability of success (particle in the volume of interest) is $\frac{v}{V}$. Furthermore, the particles are indistinguishable, so it doesn't matter the order of "successes" and "failures". This gives:  $P=(1-\frac{v}{V})^{N-n}\,(\frac{v}{V})^{n}\,\frac{N!}{(N-n)!n!}$  My other approach is to say to start saying that any configuration (remembering particles are indistinguishable) has equal probability and so the probability for our event is simply $P=\frac{\mathrm{\#\ of\ configurations\ with\ n\ particles\ in\ the\ cell}}{\mathrm{\#\ of\ configurations}}$. Now from combinatorics, the number of configurations is $\binom{N+\frac{V}{v}-1}{N}$, and the number of configurations with $n$ particles in $v$ is $\binom{N-n+\frac{V}{v}-2}{N-n}$. This gives a probability:  $P=\frac{\binom{N-n+\frac{V}{v}-2}{N-n}}{\binom{N+\frac{V}{v}-1}{N}}=\frac{(\frac{V}{v}-1)!\,N!\,(N-n+\frac{V}{v}-2)!}{(N+\frac{V}{v}-1)!\,(\frac{V}{v}-2)!\,(N-n)!}$  Which definitively isn't the binomial distribution, I checked numerically as well. So what is the problem?    statistical-mechanics  probability     share | cite | improve this question      edited Jan 6 '14 at 13:06             asked Jan 6 '14 at 13:01       guillefix   823 6 20                  "At least n" or "Exactly n" ? – Carl Witthoft  Jan 6 '14 at 14:06            It's exactly n. – guillefix  Jan 6 '14 at 14:14        3      I don't understand what you're trying to do in the second approach. How do you encode configurations? Just keeping track of how many of the $N$ particles are in $v$? If yes, then these are not equiprobable: just think of what happens when $v\ll V$; in that case, having all $N$ particles in $v$ has certainly not the same probability of having all of them in $V\setminus v$. – Yvan Velenik  Jan 6 '14 at 14:27            No, I encode configurations by how many particles are in each of the $\frac{V}{v}$ cells. – guillefix  Jan 6 '14 at 15:36            OP: No idea what made you accept the posted answer but be aware that it is not correct, for the reason explained by Yvan above. – Did  Feb 6 '14 at 20:52        add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  2  down vote  accepted      The discrepancy results from the fact that the first approach implicitly assume distinguish-ability while the second doesn't.  Let's take a simple example: $n=1$,$N=2$, and there are two cells($v=\frac{1}{2}V$), what's the probability to have 1 particle in the first cell? Now label the particles by $1$ and $2$(and remove the label in the end) and exam your two approaches.   There are four configurations, $[(1,2),()]$, $[(1),(2)]$, $[(2),(1)]$, $[(),(1,2)]$. You treat them with equal probability $\frac{1}{4}$. There are two configurations with only 1 particle in the first cell. So the probability is $\frac{1}{2}$.  There are only three configurations, because $[(1),(2)]$ and $[(2),(1)]$ are the same physical states. The probability is therefore $\frac{1}{3}$.   The second approach is correct, because only different physical  states are equally likely.  EDIT Feb. 7, 2014: My conclusion was wrong, although particles should be indistinguishable.  OP and I implicitly assume there is only 1 microstate in each cell, which is not realistic. Suppose there are $M$ sub-cells in the unit cell with volume $v$; equivalently there are $M$ different states in each cell $v$. Let $\frac{V}{v} = C$, then there are $(C-1)M$ sub-cells outside $v$ as shown in the figure.  There are $\binom{M+n-1}{M-1}$ ways to distribute $n$ indistinguishable particles into $M$ sub-cells in $v$. Similarly there are $\binom{(C-1)M+N-n+1}{C(M-1) -1}$ ways to distribute the rest $N-n$ particles into $(C-1)M$ sub-cells outside $v$. So the total number of configurations for exactly $n$ particles in $v$ is
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(n) =\binom{M+n-1}{M-1} \binom{(C-1)M+N-n-1}{(C-1)M -1}
\end{equation}
while the total number of configurations is the ways to distribute $N$ particles into $CM$ sub-cells, 
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{n=0}^{N}\Gamma(n) = \binom{CM+N-1}{CM-1}
\end{equation}  The probability in question is then
\begin{equation}
  p_n = \frac{\Gamma(n)}{\sum_{i=0}^{N}\Gamma(i)} = \binom{N}{n} \frac{(M+n-1)!}{(M-1)!} \frac{[(C-1)M+N-n-1]!}{[(C-1)M-1]!} \frac{(CM-1)!}{(CM+N-1)!}
\end{equation}  Then we take the dilute limit, which means the number of sub-cells $M$ are large compared even with $N$. These factorials can be simplified,
\begin{equation}
p_n \approx \binom{N}{n} ( \frac{1}{C})^n (\frac{1-C}{C})^{N-n} =  \binom{N}{n} ( \frac{v}{V})^n (1- \frac{v}{V})^{N-n} 
\end{equation}
Oh God, I got the same answer as the first approach.  So there is no inconstancy for these two approaches after we take $M\rightarrow \infty$; that means particles even in $v$ can only occupy a small fraction of sub-cells, which somehow makes them effectively distinguishable.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Feb 7 '14 at 17:06             answered Jan 6 '14 at 16:06       anecdote   511 3 6                  Thank you! There's so much subtlety in these considerations. I had a feeling it was something to do with distinguish-ability. The second part of what I wanted to do is to take the limit for large $N$ and $V$ to show it's a Poisson distribution. I knew how to do this for a binomial, I'll see if I can get it too for the second one. – guillefix  Jan 6 '14 at 16:48         1      Hmmm... So, what you are saying is that, with N particles and two cells, the first cell has twice as many chances to receive between 0% and 20% of the N particles than between 45% and 55% of them because there are N/5 states in the first case and N/10 in the second case? This seems as wrong as can be since, when N grows large, the probability of the 45%-55% range goes to 1. – Did  Feb 6 '14 at 16:06        1      Three comments, and I still do not see where you address the point I (after others) made. (Maybe a problem of language?) Anyway, first, $V$ is irrelevant, only the ratio $V/v$ matters. Second, as already said, for $V/v=2$ fixed (no limit here), the distribution of $n$ is not uniform (for no $N$ except $N=2$). On the contrary it is concentrating pretty quickly arounf $N/2$ when $N$ grows. Already for $N=16$ (hardly of Avogadro size), the range $(25\% N,75\% N)$ receives more than $95\%$ of the total mass, not the $50\%$ your solution predict. – Did  Feb 7 '14 at 7:19         1      Honestly I did not try to check the computations in your revised version but I see no reason why $p_n$ should not be eactly equal to $p_n={N\choose n}x^n(1-x)^{N-n}$ with $x=v/V$, for every $n$. – Did  Feb 7 '14 at 18:16         1      @Did, that does not contradict our experience, because in these two volumes, there are $M$ states. As shown in my revised answer, the split 5-5 will dominant when $M \rightarrow \infty$. – anecdote  Feb 8 '14 at 13:43        |  show 13 more comments           Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

This is strange to me given the likelihood of getting a pocket pair for anyone is only 6%.  The following table from Wikipedia shows the probability that before the flop another player has a larger pocket pair when there are one to nine other players in the hand. Note the figures when you're playing against 6 or more players is ridiculously high. If anyone has a 6% chance of getting a pocket pair as starting hand, when you look at the probabilities in the against 6-9 players columns for comparison it simply doesn't make sense, to me anyway. How is this explained?  ps: will need to x100 to get percentage for the probabilities.

If I have time I will try to post an answer showing how you would actually calculate these entries. It is worth noting that the table you provide is just from a simulation of 1 million hands and so not exact (although it is accurate enough for any purposes) – hmmmm  Mar 12 '13 at 17:39        add a comment |           7 Answers 7     active  oldest  votes            up vote  3  down vote      There are 10 players at the table, any one of them has a 6% chance of having a pocket pair.  So the chance that no-one is dealt a pocket pair is 0.94^10 ≈ 0.54, ie chance of someone having a pocket pair at a FR table ≈ 0.46.  Excluding card removal for ease:  You have a pocket pair, what is the chance that out of 9 players none of them has a pocket pair ?  0.94^9 ≈ 0.57, so the chance of one of the other 9 having a pair is ≈ 0.43  (math is approximated in more than 1 way in the examples)  The equation used is a standard way of working out probabilities of multiple events.  If you roll a die, the chance of a 6 is 0.1667  If you roll the die 10 times, what is the chance that you will roll at least one 6 ?  You can't sum the probabilities, 0.1667 added 10 times would give a probability of 1.667 !  You say, on this roll my chance of not rolling a 6 is (1-0.1667). If I roll it again, the chance is the same on that roll, so overall the chances of not having rolled a 6 in either try are  (1-0.1667) * (1-0.1667) ≈ 0.69  so the chances of rolling the die 10 times and never having a 6 are  (1-0.1667)^10 ≈ 0.16  so the chances of rolling a die 10 times and rolling at least one 6 are  1 - 0.16 ≈ 0.84     share | improve this answer     answered Mar 10 '13 at 19:02       Theo   571 1 8 17                  What relation does this answer have to the question? – hmmmm  Mar 11 '13 at 20:15        1      Also you might want to consider treating the probabilities as discrete distributions as everything is equally likely. This is obviously not possible for even small calculations but it gives better understanding of what is going on. If we use the die example with just 2 rolls we see that the possible combinations are: {11,12,13,14,15,16,21,22,23,24,25,26,31,32,33,34,35,36,41,42,43,44,45,46,51,52,53,54,55,56,61,62,63,64,65,66} Now that is 36 possibilities each as likely as each other and 25 don't have a 6 so there is 25/36=0.694r chance of not having a 6 – hmmmm  Mar 11 '13 at 20:19             I don't see how this answer deals with the aspect of the question where we're trying to determine the chance of another player holding a higher pair than ours. – 3N1GM4  Dec 29 '16 at 12:09            It is not the same as rolling the dice as you pick up the dice and roll again.  In poker the  2 cards are down and select the next 2.  1 or the prior 2 could have been an Ace which kill an out.  See my answer. – paparazzo  Mar 31 '17 at 20:53        add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      First off, I believe it is easier to understand the probability of getting dealt a pocket pair this way:  Your first card can be any of 52 cards, so it is not relevant in the calculation. The 2nd card must be one of the 3 cards that match the value of your other card. There are 51 cards left in the deck now, so the probability of being dealt a pocket pair is 3/51 = 1/17 = 5.88%.  Another way to think about this is that you should be dealt a pocket pair, on average, once every 17 hands.  It's difficult to answer your question as to why the probability "seems too high", since the numbers won't seem high to someone who lives and breathes probabilities. But perhaps this will help: At a 10 person table you're getting 10 tries at a 1/17 shot. The chance of at least 1 person getting a pocket pair is 45%. So maybe now it's easier to see that the likelihood of 2 or more getting a pocket pair is less than 45%, but not "much" less.     share | improve this answer      edited Dec 29 '16 at 17:46             answered Mar 12 '13 at 9:32       TTT   514 4 10                  I don't think the OP is asking about "the likelihood of 2 or more [players] getting a pair", so not sure how this answers the question? – 3N1GM4  Dec 29 '16 at 12:26            @3N1GM4 - this question is exactly about 2 or more players getting dealt a pocket pair.

This comes to 0.0049 or 0.49% .  From here, we can extrapolate for the number of players by simply multiplying the above by the number of players, so against 2 players we are twice as likely to face AA (this ignore card removal, see below) and so we expect this 0.0049 * 2 = 0.0098 or 0.98% of the time.  Similarly, we can extrapolate our chances of facing  a larger pair when we ourselves hold a smaller pair by just multiplying by the number of larger pairs. When we hold QQ , the chance of a single opponent holding a higher pair is twice as large (as holding AA or KK are mutually exclusive). We can show this explicitly:  [chance of facing AA or KK when holding QQ]
= (8/50)*(3/49)
= 0.0098 (0.98%)  or by simply doubling our original result.  By this method, we can calculate all of the values:  /---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/  However, this is not strictly the correct set of values because the chances of a player making a pair are not mutually exclusive from the chances of another player in the same hand making a pair.  Consider for example a game with 9 players - the chances of a single player getting a pair (without any other information) is 3/52 = 0.0577 (5.77%) , but what if we already know that some players already have pairs? Let's say for example that we know the hands of 3 other players at the table, who each have 44, 77 and KK respectively. Well now our chances of making a pair are:  [chance of making 44, 77 or KK] + [chance of making any other pair]
= [(6/46)*(1/45)] + [(40/46)*(3/45)]
= 0.0609 (6.09%)  We have a greater chance of making a pair because other players have already made pairs, which has polarised the deck with regards to pairs. Taking this to it's logical conclusion, think about a situation at a 10-handed table where all 9 of your opponents have pairs (AA x 2, KK x 2, QQ x 2, JJ x 2 and TT). Now our chances of making a pair are:  [chance of making JJ+] + [chance of making TT] + [chance of making 22-99]
= [0] + [(2/34)*(1/33)] + [(32/34)*(3/33)]
= 0.0873 (8.73%)  Similarly, sometimes if we know that other players have not made pairs, our chances of making pairs also increases, for example if we know 3 players hold AK , QJ and T9 respectively, our chances of making a pair are:  [chance of making 99+] + [chance of making 22-99]
= [(18/46)*(2/45)] + [(32/46)*(3/45)]
= 0.0638 (6.38%)  However, if lots of different ranks are known to be in other player's hands, our chances to make a pair will be decreased. For example, if we are in a 10-handed game where we know 6 of our opponents hold AK , QJ , T9 , 87 , 65 , 43 , our chances of making a pair are:  [chance of making 22] + [chance of making 33+]
= [(4/40)*(3/39)] + [(36/40)*(2/39)]
= 0.0538 (5.38%)  For this reason, my simplified approach above is not 100% accurate, because it is not correct to say that if the chance of facing an overpair with KK against one opponent is 0.49%, then it must be double this chance against two opponents - this is flawed because the chance of that second player having a pair is affected by what the first player held. At least that's my understanding.  In any case, the numbers above will certainly be close enough to the "real" figures to be useful to you, and hopefully this answer has helped show you how these numbers are calculated.     share | improve this answer     answered Dec 29 '16 at 13:10       3N1GM4   1,645 2 24              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      This is using binomial distribution I know it does not agree with other answers but I think this is correct  this is for KK - for the rest you just multiply

Gambling led to the development of probability theory in the late 1400s. When playing a game with high stakes, players wanted to know what the chance of winning would be. In 1494, Fra Luca Paccioli released his work Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni e proportionalita which was the first written text on probability. Motivated by Paccioli’s work, Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) made further developments in probability theory. His work from 1550, titled Liber de Ludo Aleae , discussed the concepts of probability and how they directly related to gambling. However, his work did not receive any recognition because it was not published until after his death. Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) also contributed to probability theory. His friend, Chevalier de Méré, was an avid gambler with the goal to become wealthy from it. De Méré tried a new mathematical approach to a gambling game but did not get the desired results. Determined to know why his strategy was unsuccessful, he consulted with Pascal. Pascal’s work on this problem began an important correspondence between him and fellow mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Communicating through letters, the two continued to exchange their ideas and thoughts. These interactions led to the conception of basic probability theory. To this day, many gamblers still rely on the basic concepts of probability theory in order to make informed decisions while gambling.

Wild cards are not considered. In this chart:   Distinct hands is the number of different ways to draw the hand, not counting different suits.  Frequency is the number of ways to draw the hand, including the same card values in different suits.  The Probability of drawing a given hand is calculated by dividing the number of ways of drawing the hand ( Frequency ) by the total number of 5-card hands (the sample space ;             (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle \,{\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   ). For example, there are 4 different ways to draw a royal flush (one for each suit), so the probability is 4 / 2,598,960 , or one in 649,740. One would then expect to draw this hand about once in every 649,740 draws, that's nearly 0.000154% of the time.  Cumulative probability refers to the probability of drawing a hand as good as or better than the specified one. For example, the probability of drawing three of a kind is approximately 2.11%, while the probability of drawing a hand at least as good as three of a kind is about 2.87%. The cumulative probability is determined by adding one hand's probability with the probabilities of all hands above it.  The Odds are defined as the ratio of the number of ways not to draw the hand, to the number of ways to draw it. For instance, with a royal flush, there are 4 ways to draw one, and 2,598,956 ways to draw something else (2,598,960 - 4), so the odds against drawing a royal flush are 2,598,956 : 4, or 649,739 : 1. The formula for establishing the odds can also be stated as (1/p) - 1 : 1 , where p is the aforementioned probability.  The values given for Probability , Cumulative probability , and Odds are rounded off for simplicity; the Distinct hands and Frequency values are exact.   The nCr function on most scientific calculators can be used to calculate hand frequencies; entering nCr with 52 and 5 , for example, yields            (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   as above.

It can be formed 4 ways (one for each suit), giving it a probability of 0.000154% and odds of 649,739 : 1.  When ace-low straights and ace-low straight flushes are not counted, the probabilities of each are reduced: straights and straight flushes each become 9/10 as common as they otherwise would be. The 4 missed straight flushes become flushes and the 1,020 missed straights become no pair.  Note that since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. For example, the hand 3♣ 7♣ 8♣ Q♠ A♠ is identical to 3♦ 7♦ 8♦ Q♥ A♥ because replacing all of the clubs in the first hand with diamonds and all of the spades with hearts produces the second hand. So eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values, there are only 134,459 distinct hands.  The number of distinct poker hands is even smaller. For example, 3♣ 7♣ 8♣ Q♠ A♠ and 3♦ 7♣ 8♦ Q♥ A♥ are not identical hands when just ignoring suit assignments because one hand has three suits, while the other hand has only two—that difference could affect the relative value of each hand when there are more cards to come. However, even though the hands are not identical from that perspective, they still form equivalent poker hands because each hand is an A-Q-8-7-3 high card hand. There are 7,462 distinct poker hands.  Frequency of 7-card poker hands [ edit ]  In some popular variations of poker, a player uses the best five-card poker hand out of seven cards. The frequencies are calculated in a manner similar to that shown for 5-card hands, except additional complications arise due to the extra two cards in the 7-card poker hand. The total number of distinct 7-card hands is            (    52  7    )     =  133  ,  784  ,  560        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 7}=133,784,560\end{matrix}}}   . It is notable that the probability of a no-pair hand is less than the probability of a one-pair or two-pair hand.  The Ace-high straight flush or royal flush is slightly more frequent (4324) than the lower straight flushes (4140 each) because the remaining two cards can have any value; a King-high straight flush, for example, cannot have the Ace of its suit in the hand (as that would make it ace-high instead).      Hand  Frequency  Probability  Cumulative  Odds    Royal flush  4,324  0.0032%  0.0032%  30,939 : 1    Straight flush (excl. royal flush)  37,260  0.0279%  0.0311%  3,589.6 : 1    Four of a kind  224,848  0.168%  0.199%  594 : 1    Full house  3,473,184  2.60%  2.80%  37.5 : 1    Flush  4,047,644  3.03%  5.82%  32.1 : 1    Straight  6,180,020  4.62%  10.4%  20.6 : 1    Three of a kind  6,461,620  4.83%  15.3%  19.7 : 1    Two pair  31,433,400  23.5%  38.8%  3.26 : 1    One pair  58,627,800  43.8%  82.6%  1.28 : 1    No pair  23,294,460  17.4%  100%  4.74 : 1    Total  133,784,560  100%  100%  0 : 1      (The frequencies given are exact; the probabilities and odds are approximate.)  Since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. Eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values leaves 6,009,159 distinct 7-card hands.  The number of distinct 5-card poker hands that are possible from 7 cards is 4,824. Perhaps surprisingly, this is fewer than the number of 5-card poker hands from 5 cards because some 5-card hands are impossible with 7 cards (e.g. 7-high).  Frequency of 5-card lowball poker hands [ edit ]  See also: Lowball (poker)  Some variants of poker, called lowball , use a low hand to determine the winning hand. In most variants of lowball, the ace is counted as the lowest card and straights and flushes don't count against a low hand, so the lowest hand is the five-high hand A-2-3-4-5 , also called a wheel . The probability is calculated based on            (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   , the total number of 5-card combinations.

The initial formulation of the question dates back to at least 1959, when Martin Gardner published one of the earliest variants of the paradox in Scientific American . Titled The Two Children Problem , he phrased the paradox as follows:   Mr. Jones has two children. The older child is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?  Mr. Smith has two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?   Gardner initially gave the answers 1 / 2 and 1 / 3 , respectively, but later acknowledged that the second question was ambiguous. [3] Its answer could be 1 / 2 , depending on how you found out that one child was a boy. The ambiguity, depending on the exact wording and possible assumptions, was confirmed by Bar-Hillel and Falk, [4] and Nickerson. [5]  Other variants of this question, with varying degrees of ambiguity, have been popularized by Ask Marilyn in Parade Magazine , [6]  John Tierney of The New York Times , [7] and Leonard Mlodinow in Drunkard's Walk . [8] One scientific study showed that when identical information was conveyed, but with different partially ambiguous wordings that emphasized different points, that the percentage of MBA students who answered 1 / 2 changed from 85% to 39%. [2]  The paradox has frequently stimulated a great deal of controversy. [5] Many people argued strongly for both sides with a great deal of confidence, sometimes showing disdain for those who took the opposing view. The paradox stems from whether the problem setup is similar for the two questions. [2] [8] The intuitive answer is 1 / 2 . [2] This answer is intuitive if the question leads the reader to believe that there are two equally likely possibilities for the sex of the second child (i.e., boy and girl), [2] [9] and that the probability of these outcomes is absolute, not conditional . [10]  Biologically, according to studies of the human sex ratio , it is more likely for any one person to be born into the male sex than the female sex.     Contents    1  Common assumptions  2  First question  3  Second question  4  Analysis of the ambiguity  5  Modelling the generative process  6  Bayesian analysis  7  Martingale analysis  8  Variants of the question   8.1  Information about the child    9  Psychological investigation  10  See also  11  References  12  External links     Common assumptions [ edit ]  The two possible answers share a number of assumptions. First, it is assumed that the space of all possible events can be easily enumerated, providing an extensional definition of outcomes: {BB, BG, GB, GG}. [11] This notation indicates that there are four possible combinations of children, labeling boys B and girls G, and using the first letter to represent the older child. Second, it is assumed that these outcomes are equally probable. [11] This implies the following model , a Bernoulli process with p = 1 / 2 :   Each child is either male or female.  Each child has the same chance of being male as of being female.  The sex of each child is independent of the sex of the other.   The mathematical outcome would be the same if it were phrased in terms of a coin toss .  First question [ edit ]        This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .  (February 2015)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )      Mr. Jones has two children. The older child is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?   Under the aforementioned assumptions, in this problem, a random family is selected. In this sample space, there are four equally probable events:      Older child  Younger child    Girl  Girl    Girl  Boy    Boy  Girl    Boy  Boy      Only two of these possible events meet the criteria specified in the question (i.e., GG, GB). Since both of the two possibilities in the new sample space {GG, GB} are equally likely, and only one of the two, GG, includes two girls, the probability that the younger child is also a girl is 1 / 2 .  Second question [ edit ]   Mr. Smith has two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?   This question is identical to question one, except that instead of specifying that the older child is a boy, it is specified that at least one of them is a boy. In response to reader criticism of the question posed in 1959, Gardner agreed that a precise formulation of the question is critical to getting different answers for question 1 and 2. Specifically, Gardner argued that a "failure to specify the randomizing procedure" could lead readers to interpret the question in two distinct ways:   From all families with two children, at least one of whom is a boy, a family is chosen at random. This would yield the answer of 1 / 3 .  From all families with two children, one child is selected at random, and the sex of that child is specified to be a boy. This would yield an answer of 1 / 2 . [4] [5]   Grinstead and Snell argue that the question is ambiguous in much the same way Gardner did. [12]  For example, if you see the children in the garden, you may see a boy. The other child may be hidden behind a tree. In this case, the statement is equivalent to the second (the child that you can see is a boy). The first statement does not match as one case is one boy, one girl. Then the girl may be visible. (The first statement says that it can be either.)  While it is certainly true that every possible Mr. Smith has at least one boy (i.e., the condition is necessary) it is not clear that every Mr. Smith with at least one boy is intended. That is, the problem statement does not say that having a boy is a sufficient condition for Mr. Smith to be identified as having a boy this way.  Commenting on Gardner's version of the problem, Bar-Hillel and Falk [4] note that "Mr. Smith, unlike the reader, is presumably aware of the sex of both of his children when making this statement", i.e. that 'I have two children and at least one of them is a boy.' If it is further assumed that Mr. Smith would report this fact if it were true then the correct answer is 1 / 3 as Gardner intended.  Analysis of the ambiguity [ edit ]  If it is assumed that this information was obtained by looking at both children to see if there is at least one boy, the condition is both necessary and sufficient. Three of the four equally probable events for a two-child family in the sample space above meet the condition, as in this table:      Older child  Younger child    Girl  Girl    Girl  Boy    Boy  Girl    Boy  Boy      Thus, if it is assumed that both children were considered while looking for a boy, the answer to question 2 is 1 / 3 . However, if the family was first selected and then a random, true statement was made about the gender of one child in that family, whether or not both were considered, the correct way to calculate the conditional probability is not to count all of the cases that include a child with that gender. Instead, one must consider only the probabilities where the statement will be made in each case. [12] So, if ALOB represents the event where the statement is "at least one boy", and ALOG represents the event where the statement is "at least one girl", then this table describes the sample space:      Older child  Younger child  P(this family)  P(ALOB given this family)  P(ALOG given this family)  P(ALOB and this family)  P(ALOG and this family)    Girl  Girl  1 / 4  0  1  0  1 / 4    Girl  Boy  1 / 4  1 / 2  1 / 2  1 / 8  1 / 8    Boy  Girl  1 / 4  1 / 2  1 / 2  1 / 8  1 / 8    Boy  Boy  1 / 4  1  0  1 / 4  0      So, if you are told that at least one is a boy when the fact is chosen randomly, the probability that both are boys is          P  (  A  L  O  B   a  n  d   B  B  )    P  (  A  L  O  B  )     =     1  4    0  +    1  8    +    1  8    +    1  4       =    1  2     .    {\displaystyle \mathrm {\frac {P(ALOB\;and\;BB)}{P(ALOB)}} ={\frac {\frac {1}{4}}{0+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{4}}}}={\frac {1}{2}}\,.}     The paradox occurs when it is not known how the statement "at least one is a boy" was generated. Either answer could be correct, based on what is assumed. [13]  However, the " 1 / 3 " answer is obtained only by assuming P(ALOB|BG) = P(ALOB|GB) =1, which implies P(ALOG|BG) = P(ALOG|GB) = 0, that is, the other child's sex is never mentioned although it is present. As Marks and Smith say, "This extreme assumption is never included in the presentation of the two-child problem, however, and is surely not what people have in mind when they present it." [13]  Modelling the generative process [ edit ]  Another way to analyse the ambiguity (for question 2) is by making explicit the generative process (all draws are independent).   The following process leads to answer     p  (   c   1    =   c   2    =  B   |    O  b  s  e  r  v  a  t  i  o  n   )  =    1  3      {\displaystyle p(c_{1}=c_{2}=B|\mathrm {Observation} )={\frac {1}{3}}}   :  Draw      c   1      {\displaystyle c_{1}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Draw      c   2      {\displaystyle c_{2}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Observe      c   1    =  B  ∨   c   2    =  B    {\displaystyle c_{1}=B\vee c_{2}=B}      The following process leads to answer     p  (   c   1    =   c   2    =  B   |    O  b  s  e  r  v  a  t  i  o  n   )  =    1  2      {\displaystyle p(c_{1}=c_{2}=B|\mathrm {Observation} )={\frac {1}{2}}}   :  Draw      c   1      {\displaystyle c_{1}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Draw      c   2      {\displaystyle c_{2}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Draw index     i    {\displaystyle i}   equiprobably from     {  1  ,  2  }    {\displaystyle \{1,2\}}    Observe      c   i    =  B    {\displaystyle c_{i}=B}       Bayesian analysis [ edit ]  Following classical probability arguments, we consider a large urn containing two children. We assume equal probability that either is a boy or a girl. The three discernible cases are thus: 1. both are girls (GG) — with probability P(GG) = 1 / 4 , 2. both are boys (BB) — with probability of P(BB) = 1 / 4 , and 3. one of each (G·B) — with probability of P(G·B) = 1 / 2 . These are the prior probabilities.  Now we add the additional assumption that "at least one is a boy" = B. Using Bayes' Theorem , we find        P  (  B  B  ∣  B  )   =   P  (  B  ∣  B  B  )  ×     P  (  B  B  )    P  (  B  )      =  1  ×     (    1  4    )    (    3  4    )     =    1  3     .    {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B)} =\mathrm {P(B\mid BB)\times {\frac {P(BB)}{P(B)}}} =1\times {\frac {\left({\frac {1}{4}}\right)}{\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)}}={\frac {1}{3}}\,.}     where P(A|B) means "probability of A given B". P(B|BB) = probability of at least one boy given both are boys = 1. P(BB) = probability of both boys = 1 / 4 from the prior distribution. P(B) = probability of at least one being a boy, which includes cases BB and G·B = 1 / 4 + 1 / 2 = 3 / 4 .  Note that, although the natural assumption seems to be a probability of 1 / 2 , so the derived value of 1 / 3 seems low, the actual "normal" value for P(BB) is 1 / 4 , so the 1 / 3 is actually a bit higher .  The paradox arises because the second assumption is somewhat artificial, and when describing the problem in an actual setting things get a bit sticky. Just how do we know that "at least" one is a boy? One description of the problem states that we look into a window, see only one child and it is a boy. This sounds like the same assumption. However, this one is equivalent to "sampling" the distribution (i.e. removing one child from the urn, ascertaining that it is a boy, then replacing). Let's call the statement "the sample is a boy" proposition "b". Now we have:        P  (  B  B  ∣  b  )   =   P  (  b  ∣  B  B  )  ×     P  (  B  B  )    P  (  b  )      =  1  ×     (    1  4    )    (    1  2    )     =    1  2     .    {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid b)} =\mathrm {P(b\mid BB)\times {\frac {P(BB)}{P(b)}}} =1\times {\frac {\left({\frac {1}{4}}\right)}{\left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)}}={\frac {1}{2}}\,.}     The difference here is the P(b), which is just the probability of drawing a boy from all possible cases (i.e. without the "at least"), which is clearly 1 / 2 .  The Bayesian analysis generalizes easily to the case in which we relax the 50:50 population assumption. If we have no information about the populations then we assume a "flat prior", i.e. P(GG) = P(BB) = P(G·B) = 1 / 3 . In this case the "at least" assumption produces the result P(BB|B) = 1 / 2 , and the sampling assumption produces P(BB|b) = 2 / 3 , a result also derivable from the Rule of Succession .  Martingale analysis [ edit ]  Suppose you had wagered that Mr Smith had two boys, and received fair odds. You paid $1 and you will receive $4 if he has two boys. We think of your wager as investment that will increase in value as good news arrives. What evidence would make you happier about your investment? Learning that at least one child out of two is a boy, or learning that at least one child out of one is a boy?  The latter is a priori less likely, and therefore better news. That is why the two answers cannot be the same.  Now for the numbers. If we bet on one child and win, the value of your investment has doubled. It must double again to get to $4, so the odds are 1 in 2.  On the other hand if we learn that at least one of two children is a boy, our investment increases as if we had wagered on this question. Our $1 is now worth $ 1  1 / 3 . To get to $4 we still have to increase our wealth threefold. So the answer is 1 in 3.  Variants of the question [ edit ]  Following the popularization of the paradox by Gardner it has been presented and discussed in various forms. The first variant presented by Bar-Hillel & Falk [4] is worded as follows:   Mr. Smith is the father of two. We meet him walking along the street with a young boy whom he proudly introduces as his son. What is the probability that Mr. Smith's other child is also a boy?   Bar-Hillel & Falk use this variant to highlight the importance of considering the underlying assumptions. The intuitive answer is 1 / 2 and, when making the most natural assumptions, this is correct. However, someone may argue that "…before Mr. Smith identifies the boy as his son, we know only that he is either the father of two boys, BB, or of two girls, GG, or of one of each in either birth order, i.e., BG or GB. Assuming again independence and equiprobability, we begin with a probability of 1 / 4 that Smith is the father of two boys. Discovering that he has at least one boy rules out the event GG. Since the remaining three events were equiprobable, we obtain a probability of 1 / 3 for BB." [4]  The natural assumption is that Mr. Smith selected the child companion at random. If so, as combination BB has twice the probability of either BG or GB of having resulted in the boy walking companion (and combination GG has zero probability, ruling it out), the union of events BG and GB becomes equiprobable with event BB, and so the chance that the other child is also a boy is 1 / 2 . Bar-Hillel & Falk, however, suggest an alternative scenario. They imagine a culture in which boys are invariably chosen over girls as walking companions. In this case, the combinations of BB, BG and GB are assumed equally likely to have resulted in the boy walking companion, and thus the probability that the other child is also a boy is 1 / 3 .  In 1991, Marilyn vos Savant responded to a reader who asked her to answer a variant of the Boy or Girl paradox that included beagles. [6] In 1996, she published the question again in a different form. The 1991 and 1996 questions, respectively were phrased:   A shopkeeper says she has two new baby beagles to show you, but she doesn't know whether they're male, female, or a pair. You tell her that you want only a male, and she telephones the fellow who's giving them a bath. "Is at least one a male?" she asks him. "Yes!" she informs you with a smile. What is the probability that the other one is a male?  Say that a woman and a man (who are unrelated) each has two children. We know that at least one of the woman's children is a boy and that the man's oldest child is a boy. Can you explain why the chances that the woman has two boys do not equal the chances that the man has two boys?   With regard to the second formulation Vos Savant gave the classic answer that the chances that the woman has two boys are about 1 / 3 whereas the chances that the man has two boys are about 1 / 2 . In response to reader response that questioned her analysis vos Savant conducted a survey of readers with exactly two children, at least one of which is a boy. Of 17,946 responses, 35.9% reported two boys. [11]  Vos Savant's articles were discussed by Carlton and Stansfield [11] in a 2005 article in The American Statistician . The authors do not discuss the possible ambiguity in the question and conclude that her answer is correct from a mathematical perspective, given the assumptions that the likelihood of a child being a boy or girl is equal, and that the sex of the second child is independent of the first. With regard to her survey they say it "at least validates vos Savant's correct assertion that the “chances” posed in the original question, though similar-sounding, are different, and that the first probability is certainly nearer to 1 in 3 than to 1 in 2."  Carlton and Stansfield go on to discuss the common assumptions in the Boy or Girl paradox. They demonstrate that in reality male children are actually more likely than female children, and that the sex of the second child is not independent of the sex of the first. The authors conclude that, although the assumptions of the question run counter to observations, the paradox still has pedagogical value, since it "illustrates one of the more intriguing applications of conditional probability." [11] Of course, the actual probability values do not matter; the purpose of the paradox is to demonstrate seemingly contradictory logic, not actual birth rates.  Information about the child [ edit ]  Suppose we were told not only that Mr. Smith has two children, and one of them is a boy, but also that the boy was born on a Tuesday: does this change the previous analyses? Again, the answer depends on how this information was presented - what kind of selection process produced this knowledge.  Following the tradition of the problem, suppose that in the population of two-child families, the sex of the two children is independent of one another, equally likely boy or girl, and that the birth date of each child is independent of the other child. The chance of being born on any given day of the week is 1 / 7 .  From Bayes' Theorem that the probability of two boys, given that one boy was born on a Tuesday is given by:        P  (  B  B  ∣   B   T    )  =     P  (   B   T    ∣  B  B  )  ×  P  (  B  B  )    P  (   B   T    )        {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B_{T})={\frac {P(B_{T}\mid BB)\times P(BB)}{P(B_{T})}}} }     Assume that the probability of being born on a Tuesday is ε ( ε = 1 / 7 will be set after arriving at the general solution). The first term in the numerator is therefore the probability of at least one boy born on Tuesday, given that the family has two boys, or 1 − (1 − ε ) 2 (one minus the probability that neither boy is born on Tuesday). The second term in the numerator is simply 1 / 4 , the probability of having two boys. The denominator is trickier; the required probability is that of having at least one boy on Tuesday over the entire sample space (two-child families). Therefore there are 4 cases to evaluate: BB, BG, GB, GG. Each of these occurs with probability 1 / 4 . P(B T (GG)) is 0, there are no boys. P(B T (BG)) and P(B T (GB)) is ε , there is one and only one boy, thus he has ε chance of being born on Tuesday. P(B T (BB)) is ε + ε − ε 2 . It is the chance that one boy is born on Tuesday, plus the chance that the other boy is born on Tuesday, minus the chance that they both are (this term arises from the fact that P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A)P(B), assuming that A and B are independent). Therefore, the full equation is:        P  (  B  B  ∣   B   T    )   =      (   1  −  (  1  −  ε   )   2     )   ×    1  4      0  +    1  4    ε  +    1  4    ε  +    1  4     (   ε  +  ε  −   ε   2     )      =     1  −  (  1  −  ε   )   2      4  ε  −   ε   2         {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B_{T})} ={\frac {\left(1-(1-\varepsilon )^{2}\right)\times {\frac {1}{4}}}{0+{\frac {1}{4}}\varepsilon +{\frac {1}{4}}\varepsilon +{\frac {1}{4}}\left(\varepsilon +\varepsilon -\varepsilon ^{2}\right)}}={\frac {1-(1-\varepsilon )^{2}}{4\varepsilon -\varepsilon ^{2}}}}      For     ε  >  0    {\displaystyle \varepsilon >0}   , this reduces to      P  (  B  B  ∣   B   T    )   =     2  −  ε    4  −  ε       {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B_{T})} ={\frac {2-\varepsilon }{4-\varepsilon }}}     If ε is now set to 1 / 7 , the probability becomes 13 / 27 , or about 0.48. In fact, as ε approaches 0, the total probability goes to 1 / 2 , which is the answer expected when one child is sampled (e.g. the oldest child is a boy) and is thus removed from the pool of possible children. In other words, as more and more details about the boy child are given (for instance: born on January 1), the chance that the other child is a girl approaches one half.  It seems that quite irrelevant information was introduced, yet the probability of the sex of the other child has changed dramatically from what it was before (the chance the other child was a girl was 2 / 3 , when it was not known that the boy was born on Tuesday).  However, is it really plausible that the family with at least one boy born on a Tuesday was produced by choosing just one of such families at random? It is much more easy to imagine the following scenario.   We know Mr. Smith has two children. We knock at his door and a boy comes and answers the door. We ask the boy on what day of the week he was born.   Assume that which of the two children answers the door is determined by chance. Then the procedure was ( 1 ) pick a two-child family at random from all two-child families ( 2 ) pick one of the two children at random, ( 3 ) see if it is a boy and ask on what day he was born. The chance the other child is a girl is 1 / 2 . This is a very different procedure from ( 1 ) picking a two-child family at random from all families with two children, at least one a boy, born on a Tuesday. The chance the family consists of a boy and a girl is 14 / 27 , about 0.52.  This variant of the boy and girl problem is discussed on many internet blogs and is the subject of a paper by Ruma Falk. [14] The moral of the story is that these probabilities do not just depend on the known information, but on how that information was obtained.  Psychological investigation [ edit ]  From the position of statistical analysis the relevant question is often ambiguous and as such there is no “correct” answer. However, this does not exhaust the boy or girl paradox for it is not necessarily the ambiguity that explains how the intuitive probability is derived. A survey such as vos Savant's suggests that the majority of people adopt an understanding of Gardner's problem that if they were consistent would lead them to the 1 / 3 probability answer but overwhelmingly people intuitively arrive at the 1 / 2 probability answer. Ambiguity notwithstanding, this makes the problem of interest to psychological researchers who seek to understand how humans estimate probability.  Fox & Levav (2004) used the problem (called the Mr. Smith problem , credited to Gardner, but not worded exactly the same as Gardner's version) to test theories of how people estimate conditional probabilities. [2] In this study, the paradox was posed to participants in two ways:   "Mr. Smith says: 'I have two children and at least one of them is a boy.' Given this information, what is the probability that the other child is a boy?"  "Mr. Smith says: 'I have two children and it is not the case that they are both girls.' Given this information, what is the probability that both children are boys?"   The authors argue that the first formulation gives the reader the mistaken impression that there are two possible outcomes for the "other child", [2] whereas the second formulation gives the reader the impression that there are four possible outcomes, of which one has been rejected (resulting in 1 / 3 being the probability of both children being boys, as there are 3 remaining possible outcomes, only one of which is that both of the children are boys). The study found that 85% of participants answered 1 / 2 for the first formulation, while only 39% responded that way to the second formulation. The authors argued that the reason people respond differently to each question (along with other similar problems, such as the Monty Hall Problem and the Bertrand's box paradox ) is because of the use of naive heuristics that fail to properly define the number of possible outcomes.

My problem is that I've tried two approaches which both seem valid to me, but give differing answers.  One approach is to use binomial probability, where the probability of success (particle in the volume of interest) is $\frac{v}{V}$. Furthermore, the particles are indistinguishable, so it doesn't matter the order of "successes" and "failures". This gives:  $P=(1-\frac{v}{V})^{N-n}\,(\frac{v}{V})^{n}\,\frac{N!}{(N-n)!n!}$  My other approach is to say to start saying that any configuration (remembering particles are indistinguishable) has equal probability and so the probability for our event is simply $P=\frac{\mathrm{\#\ of\ configurations\ with\ n\ particles\ in\ the\ cell}}{\mathrm{\#\ of\ configurations}}$. Now from combinatorics, the number of configurations is $\binom{N+\frac{V}{v}-1}{N}$, and the number of configurations with $n$ particles in $v$ is $\binom{N-n+\frac{V}{v}-2}{N-n}$. This gives a probability:  $P=\frac{\binom{N-n+\frac{V}{v}-2}{N-n}}{\binom{N+\frac{V}{v}-1}{N}}=\frac{(\frac{V}{v}-1)!\,N!\,(N-n+\frac{V}{v}-2)!}{(N+\frac{V}{v}-1)!\,(\frac{V}{v}-2)!\,(N-n)!}$  Which definitively isn't the binomial distribution, I checked numerically as well.

How do you encode configurations? Just keeping track of how many of the $N$ particles are in $v$? If yes, then these are not equiprobable: just think of what happens when $v\ll V$; in that case, having all $N$ particles in $v$ has certainly not the same probability of having all of them in $V\setminus v$. – Yvan Velenik  Jan 6 '14 at 14:27            No, I encode configurations by how many particles are in each of the $\frac{V}{v}$ cells. – guillefix  Jan 6 '14 at 15:36            OP: No idea what made you accept the posted answer but be aware that it is not correct, for the reason explained by Yvan above. – Did  Feb 6 '14 at 20:52        add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  2  down vote  accepted      The discrepancy results from the fact that the first approach implicitly assume distinguish-ability while the second doesn't.  Let's take a simple example: $n=1$,$N=2$, and there are two cells($v=\frac{1}{2}V$), what's the probability to have 1 particle in the first cell? Now label the particles by $1$ and $2$(and remove the label in the end) and exam your two approaches.   There are four configurations, $[(1,2),()]$, $[(1),(2)]$, $[(2),(1)]$, $[(),(1,2)]$. You treat them with equal probability $\frac{1}{4}$. There are two configurations with only 1 particle in the first cell. So the probability is $\frac{1}{2}$.  There are only three configurations, because $[(1),(2)]$ and $[(2),(1)]$ are the same physical states. The probability is therefore $\frac{1}{3}$.   The second approach is correct, because only different physical  states are equally likely.  EDIT Feb. 7, 2014: My conclusion was wrong, although particles should be indistinguishable.  OP and I implicitly assume there is only 1 microstate in each cell, which is not realistic. Suppose there are $M$ sub-cells in the unit cell with volume $v$; equivalently there are $M$ different states in each cell $v$. Let $\frac{V}{v} = C$, then there are $(C-1)M$ sub-cells outside $v$ as shown in the figure.  There are $\binom{M+n-1}{M-1}$ ways to distribute $n$ indistinguishable particles into $M$ sub-cells in $v$. Similarly there are $\binom{(C-1)M+N-n+1}{C(M-1) -1}$ ways to distribute the rest $N-n$ particles into $(C-1)M$ sub-cells outside $v$. So the total number of configurations for exactly $n$ particles in $v$ is
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(n) =\binom{M+n-1}{M-1} \binom{(C-1)M+N-n-1}{(C-1)M -1}
\end{equation}
while the total number of configurations is the ways to distribute $N$ particles into $CM$ sub-cells, 
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{n=0}^{N}\Gamma(n) = \binom{CM+N-1}{CM-1}
\end{equation}  The probability in question is then
\begin{equation}
  p_n = \frac{\Gamma(n)}{\sum_{i=0}^{N}\Gamma(i)} = \binom{N}{n} \frac{(M+n-1)!}{(M-1)!} \frac{[(C-1)M+N-n-1]!}{[(C-1)M-1]!} \frac{(CM-1)!}{(CM+N-1)!}
\end{equation}  Then we take the dilute limit, which means the number of sub-cells $M$ are large compared even with $N$. These factorials can be simplified,
\begin{equation}
p_n \approx \binom{N}{n} ( \frac{1}{C})^n (\frac{1-C}{C})^{N-n} =  \binom{N}{n} ( \frac{v}{V})^n (1- \frac{v}{V})^{N-n} 
\end{equation}
Oh God, I got the same answer as the first approach.  So there is no inconstancy for these two approaches after we take $M\rightarrow \infty$; that means particles even in $v$ can only occupy a small fraction of sub-cells, which somehow makes them effectively distinguishable.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Feb 7 '14 at 17:06             answered Jan 6 '14 at 16:06       anecdote   511 3 6                  Thank you! There's so much subtlety in these considerations. I had a feeling it was something to do with distinguish-ability. The second part of what I wanted to do is to take the limit for large $N$ and $V$ to show it's a Poisson distribution. I knew how to do this for a binomial, I'll see if I can get it too for the second one. – guillefix  Jan 6 '14 at 16:48         1      Hmmm... So, what you are saying is that, with N particles and two cells, the first cell has twice as many chances to receive between 0% and 20% of the N particles than between 45% and 55% of them because there are N/5 states in the first case and N/10 in the second case? This seems as wrong as can be since, when N grows large, the probability of the 45%-55% range goes to 1. – Did  Feb 6 '14 at 16:06        1      Three comments, and I still do not see where you address the point I (after others) made. (Maybe a problem of language?) Anyway, first, $V$ is irrelevant, only the ratio $V/v$ matters. Second, as already said, for $V/v=2$ fixed (no limit here), the distribution of $n$ is not uniform (for no $N$ except $N=2$). On the contrary it is concentrating pretty quickly arounf $N/2$ when $N$ grows. Already for $N=16$ (hardly of Avogadro size), the range $(25\% N,75\% N)$ receives more than $95\%$ of the total mass, not the $50\%$ your solution predict. – Did  Feb 7 '14 at 7:19         1      Honestly I did not try to check the computations in your revised version but I see no reason why $p_n$ should not be eactly equal to $p_n={N\choose n}x^n(1-x)^{N-n}$ with $x=v/V$, for every $n$. – Did  Feb 7 '14 at 18:16         1      @Did, that does not contradict our experience, because in these two volumes, there are $M$ states. As shown in my revised answer, the split 5-5 will dominant when $M \rightarrow \infty$. – anecdote  Feb 8 '14 at 13:43        |  show 13 more comments           Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

This is strange to me given the likelihood of getting a pocket pair for anyone is only 6%.  The following table from Wikipedia shows the probability that before the flop another player has a larger pocket pair when there are one to nine other players in the hand. Note the figures when you're playing against 6 or more players is ridiculously high. If anyone has a 6% chance of getting a pocket pair as starting hand, when you look at the probabilities in the against 6-9 players columns for comparison it simply doesn't make sense, to me anyway. How is this explained?  ps: will need to x100 to get percentage for the probabilities.

So the chance that no-one is dealt a pocket pair is 0.94^10 ≈ 0.54, ie chance of someone having a pocket pair at a FR table ≈ 0.46.  Excluding card removal for ease:  You have a pocket pair, what is the chance that out of 9 players none of them has a pocket pair ?  0.94^9 ≈ 0.57, so the chance of one of the other 9 having a pair is ≈ 0.43  (math is approximated in more than 1 way in the examples)  The equation used is a standard way of working out probabilities of multiple events.  If you roll a die, the chance of a 6 is 0.1667  If you roll the die 10 times, what is the chance that you will roll at least one 6 ?  You can't sum the probabilities, 0.1667 added 10 times would give a probability of 1.667 !  You say, on this roll my chance of not rolling a 6 is (1-0.1667). If I roll it again, the chance is the same on that roll, so overall the chances of not having rolled a 6 in either try are  (1-0.1667) * (1-0.1667) ≈ 0.69  so the chances of rolling the die 10 times and never having a 6 are  (1-0.1667)^10 ≈ 0.16  so the chances of rolling a die 10 times and rolling at least one 6 are  1 - 0.16 ≈ 0.84     share | improve this answer     answered Mar 10 '13 at 19:02       Theo   571 1 8 17                  What relation does this answer have to the question? – hmmmm  Mar 11 '13 at 20:15        1      Also you might want to consider treating the probabilities as discrete distributions as everything is equally likely. This is obviously not possible for even small calculations but it gives better understanding of what is going on. If we use the die example with just 2 rolls we see that the possible combinations are: {11,12,13,14,15,16,21,22,23,24,25,26,31,32,33,34,35,36,41,42,43,44,45,46,51,52,53,54,55,56,61,62,63,64,65,66} Now that is 36 possibilities each as likely as each other and 25 don't have a 6 so there is 25/36=0.694r chance of not having a 6 – hmmmm  Mar 11 '13 at 20:19             I don't see how this answer deals with the aspect of the question where we're trying to determine the chance of another player holding a higher pair than ours. – 3N1GM4  Dec 29 '16 at 12:09            It is not the same as rolling the dice as you pick up the dice and roll again.

See my answer. – paparazzo  Mar 31 '17 at 20:53        add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      First off, I believe it is easier to understand the probability of getting dealt a pocket pair this way:  Your first card can be any of 52 cards, so it is not relevant in the calculation. The 2nd card must be one of the 3 cards that match the value of your other card. There are 51 cards left in the deck now, so the probability of being dealt a pocket pair is 3/51 = 1/17 = 5.88%.  Another way to think about this is that you should be dealt a pocket pair, on average, once every 17 hands.  It's difficult to answer your question as to why the probability "seems too high", since the numbers won't seem high to someone who lives and breathes probabilities. But perhaps this will help: At a 10 person table you're getting 10 tries at a 1/17 shot. The chance of at least 1 person getting a pocket pair is 45%. So maybe now it's easier to see that the likelihood of 2 or more getting a pocket pair is less than 45%, but not "much" less.     share | improve this answer      edited Dec 29 '16 at 17:46             answered Mar 12 '13 at 9:32       TTT   514 4 10                  I don't think the OP is asking about "the likelihood of 2 or more [players] getting a pair", so not sure how this answers the question? – 3N1GM4  Dec 29 '16 at 12:26            @3N1GM4 - this question is exactly about 2 or more players getting dealt a pocket pair.

This comes to 0.0049 or 0.49% .  From here, we can extrapolate for the number of players by simply multiplying the above by the number of players, so against 2 players we are twice as likely to face AA (this ignore card removal, see below) and so we expect this 0.0049 * 2 = 0.0098 or 0.98% of the time.  Similarly, we can extrapolate our chances of facing  a larger pair when we ourselves hold a smaller pair by just multiplying by the number of larger pairs. When we hold QQ , the chance of a single opponent holding a higher pair is twice as large (as holding AA or KK are mutually exclusive). We can show this explicitly:  [chance of facing AA or KK when holding QQ]
= (8/50)*(3/49)
= 0.0098 (0.98%)  or by simply doubling our original result.  By this method, we can calculate all of the values:  /---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/  However, this is not strictly the correct set of values because the chances of a player making a pair are not mutually exclusive from the chances of another player in the same hand making a pair.  Consider for example a game with 9 players - the chances of a single player getting a pair (without any other information) is 3/52 = 0.0577 (5.77%) , but what if we already know that some players already have pairs? Let's say for example that we know the hands of 3 other players at the table, who each have 44, 77 and KK respectively. Well now our chances of making a pair are:  [chance of making 44, 77 or KK] + [chance of making any other pair]
= [(6/46)*(1/45)] + [(40/46)*(3/45)]
= 0.0609 (6.09%)  We have a greater chance of making a pair because other players have already made pairs, which has polarised the deck with regards to pairs. Taking this to it's logical conclusion, think about a situation at a 10-handed table where all 9 of your opponents have pairs (AA x 2, KK x 2, QQ x 2, JJ x 2 and TT). Now our chances of making a pair are:  [chance of making JJ+] + [chance of making TT] + [chance of making 22-99]
= [0] + [(2/34)*(1/33)] + [(32/34)*(3/33)]
= 0.0873 (8.73%)  Similarly, sometimes if we know that other players have not made pairs, our chances of making pairs also increases, for example if we know 3 players hold AK , QJ and T9 respectively, our chances of making a pair are:  [chance of making 99+] + [chance of making 22-99]
= [(18/46)*(2/45)] + [(32/46)*(3/45)]
= 0.0638 (6.38%)  However, if lots of different ranks are known to be in other player's hands, our chances to make a pair will be decreased. For example, if we are in a 10-handed game where we know 6 of our opponents hold AK , QJ , T9 , 87 , 65 , 43 , our chances of making a pair are:  [chance of making 22] + [chance of making 33+]
= [(4/40)*(3/39)] + [(36/40)*(2/39)]
= 0.0538 (5.38%)  For this reason, my simplified approach above is not 100% accurate, because it is not correct to say that if the chance of facing an overpair with KK against one opponent is 0.49%, then it must be double this chance against two opponents - this is flawed because the chance of that second player having a pair is affected by what the first player held. At least that's my understanding.  In any case, the numbers above will certainly be close enough to the "real" figures to be useful to you, and hopefully this answer has helped show you how these numbers are calculated.     share | improve this answer     answered Dec 29 '16 at 13:10       3N1GM4   1,645 2 24              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      This is using binomial distribution I know it does not agree with other answers but I think this is correct  this is for KK - for the rest you just multiply

Gambling led to the development of probability theory in the late 1400s. When playing a game with high stakes, players wanted to know what the chance of winning would be. In 1494, Fra Luca Paccioli released his work Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni e proportionalita which was the first written text on probability. Motivated by Paccioli’s work, Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) made further developments in probability theory. His work from 1550, titled Liber de Ludo Aleae , discussed the concepts of probability and how they directly related to gambling. However, his work did not receive any recognition because it was not published until after his death. Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) also contributed to probability theory. His friend, Chevalier de Méré, was an avid gambler with the goal to become wealthy from it. De Méré tried a new mathematical approach to a gambling game but did not get the desired results. Determined to know why his strategy was unsuccessful, he consulted with Pascal. Pascal’s work on this problem began an important correspondence between him and fellow mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Communicating through letters, the two continued to exchange their ideas and thoughts. These interactions led to the conception of basic probability theory. To this day, many gamblers still rely on the basic concepts of probability theory in order to make informed decisions while gambling. [1]  [2]  Frequency of 5-card poker hands [ edit ]     A Venn diagram depicting poker hands and their odds from a typical American 9/6 Jacks or Better machine    The following chart enumerates the (absolute) frequency of each hand, given all combinations of 5 cards randomly drawn from a full deck of 52 without replacement. Wild cards are not considered. In this chart:   Distinct hands is the number of different ways to draw the hand, not counting different suits.  Frequency is the number of ways to draw the hand, including the same card values in different suits.  The Probability of drawing a given hand is calculated by dividing the number of ways of drawing the hand ( Frequency ) by the total number of 5-card hands (the sample space ;             (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle \,{\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   ). For example, there are 4 different ways to draw a royal flush (one for each suit), so the probability is 4 / 2,598,960 , or one in 649,740. One would then expect to draw this hand about once in every 649,740 draws, that's nearly 0.000154% of the time.  Cumulative probability refers to the probability of drawing a hand as good as or better than the specified one. For example, the probability of drawing three of a kind is approximately 2.11%, while the probability of drawing a hand at least as good as three of a kind is about 2.87%. The cumulative probability is determined by adding one hand's probability with the probabilities of all hands above it.  The Odds are defined as the ratio of the number of ways not to draw the hand, to the number of ways to draw it. For instance, with a royal flush, there are 4 ways to draw one, and 2,598,956 ways to draw something else (2,598,960 - 4), so the odds against drawing a royal flush are 2,598,956 : 4, or 649,739 : 1. The formula for establishing the odds can also be stated as (1/p) - 1 : 1 , where p is the aforementioned probability.  The values given for Probability , Cumulative probability , and Odds are rounded off for simplicity; the Distinct hands and Frequency values are exact.   The nCr function on most scientific calculators can be used to calculate hand frequencies; entering nCr with 52 and 5 , for example, yields            (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   as above.

It can be formed 4 ways (one for each suit), giving it a probability of 0.000154% and odds of 649,739 : 1.  When ace-low straights and ace-low straight flushes are not counted, the probabilities of each are reduced: straights and straight flushes each become 9/10 as common as they otherwise would be. The 4 missed straight flushes become flushes and the 1,020 missed straights become no pair.  Note that since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. For example, the hand 3♣ 7♣ 8♣ Q♠ A♠ is identical to 3♦ 7♦ 8♦ Q♥ A♥ because replacing all of the clubs in the first hand with diamonds and all of the spades with hearts produces the second hand. So eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values, there are only 134,459 distinct hands.  The number of distinct poker hands is even smaller. For example, 3♣ 7♣ 8♣ Q♠ A♠ and 3♦ 7♣ 8♦ Q♥ A♥ are not identical hands when just ignoring suit assignments because one hand has three suits, while the other hand has only two—that difference could affect the relative value of each hand when there are more cards to come. However, even though the hands are not identical from that perspective, they still form equivalent poker hands because each hand is an A-Q-8-7-3 high card hand. There are 7,462 distinct poker hands.  Frequency of 7-card poker hands [ edit ]  In some popular variations of poker, a player uses the best five-card poker hand out of seven cards. The frequencies are calculated in a manner similar to that shown for 5-card hands, except additional complications arise due to the extra two cards in the 7-card poker hand. The total number of distinct 7-card hands is            (    52  7    )     =  133  ,  784  ,  560        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 7}=133,784,560\end{matrix}}}   . It is notable that the probability of a no-pair hand is less than the probability of a one-pair or two-pair hand.  The Ace-high straight flush or royal flush is slightly more frequent (4324) than the lower straight flushes (4140 each) because the remaining two cards can have any value; a King-high straight flush, for example, cannot have the Ace of its suit in the hand (as that would make it ace-high instead).

Since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. Eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values leaves 6,009,159 distinct 7-card hands.  The number of distinct 5-card poker hands that are possible from 7 cards is 4,824. Perhaps surprisingly, this is fewer than the number of 5-card poker hands from 5 cards because some 5-card hands are impossible with 7 cards (e.g. 7-high).  Frequency of 5-card lowball poker hands [ edit ]  See also: Lowball (poker)  Some variants of poker, called lowball , use a low hand to determine the winning hand. In most variants of lowball, the ace is counted as the lowest card and straights and flushes don't count against a low hand, so the lowest hand is the five-high hand A-2-3-4-5 , also called a wheel . The probability is calculated based on            (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   , the total number of 5-card combinations.

The initial formulation of the question dates back to at least 1959, when Martin Gardner published one of the earliest variants of the paradox in Scientific American . Titled The Two Children Problem , he phrased the paradox as follows:   Mr. Jones has two children. The older child is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?  Mr. Smith has two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?   Gardner initially gave the answers 1 / 2 and 1 / 3 , respectively, but later acknowledged that the second question was ambiguous. [3] Its answer could be 1 / 2 , depending on how you found out that one child was a boy. The ambiguity, depending on the exact wording and possible assumptions, was confirmed by Bar-Hillel and Falk, [4] and Nickerson. [5]  Other variants of this question, with varying degrees of ambiguity, have been popularized by Ask Marilyn in Parade Magazine , [6]  John Tierney of The New York Times , [7] and Leonard Mlodinow in Drunkard's Walk . [8] One scientific study showed that when identical information was conveyed, but with different partially ambiguous wordings that emphasized different points, that the percentage of MBA students who answered 1 / 2 changed from 85% to 39%. [2]  The paradox has frequently stimulated a great deal of controversy. [5] Many people argued strongly for both sides with a great deal of confidence, sometimes showing disdain for those who took the opposing view. The paradox stems from whether the problem setup is similar for the two questions. [2] [8] The intuitive answer is 1 / 2 . [2] This answer is intuitive if the question leads the reader to believe that there are two equally likely possibilities for the sex of the second child (i.e., boy and girl), [2] [9] and that the probability of these outcomes is absolute, not conditional . [10]  Biologically, according to studies of the human sex ratio , it is more likely for any one person to be born into the male sex than the female sex.

First, it is assumed that the space of all possible events can be easily enumerated, providing an extensional definition of outcomes: {BB, BG, GB, GG}. [11] This notation indicates that there are four possible combinations of children, labeling boys B and girls G, and using the first letter to represent the older child. Second, it is assumed that these outcomes are equally probable. [11] This implies the following model , a Bernoulli process with p = 1 / 2 :   Each child is either male or female.  Each child has the same chance of being male as of being female.  The sex of each child is independent of the sex of the other.   The mathematical outcome would be the same if it were phrased in terms of a coin toss .  First question [ edit ]        This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .  (February 2015)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )      Mr. Jones has two children. The older child is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?   Under the aforementioned assumptions, in this problem, a random family is selected. In this sample space, there are four equally probable events:      Older child  Younger child    Girl  Girl    Girl  Boy    Boy  Girl    Boy  Boy      Only two of these possible events meet the criteria specified in the question (i.e., GG, GB). Since both of the two possibilities in the new sample space {GG, GB} are equally likely, and only one of the two, GG, includes two girls, the probability that the younger child is also a girl is 1 / 2 .  Second question [ edit ]   Mr. Smith has two children. At least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?   This question is identical to question one, except that instead of specifying that the older child is a boy, it is specified that at least one of them is a boy. In response to reader criticism of the question posed in 1959, Gardner agreed that a precise formulation of the question is critical to getting different answers for question 1 and 2. Specifically, Gardner argued that a "failure to specify the randomizing procedure" could lead readers to interpret the question in two distinct ways:   From all families with two children, at least one of whom is a boy, a family is chosen at random. This would yield the answer of 1 / 3 .  From all families with two children, one child is selected at random, and the sex of that child is specified to be a boy. This would yield an answer of 1 / 2 . [4] [5]   Grinstead and Snell argue that the question is ambiguous in much the same way Gardner did. [12]  For example, if you see the children in the garden, you may see a boy. The other child may be hidden behind a tree. In this case, the statement is equivalent to the second (the child that you can see is a boy). The first statement does not match as one case is one boy, one girl. Then the girl may be visible. (The first statement says that it can be either.)  While it is certainly true that every possible Mr. Smith has at least one boy (i.e., the condition is necessary) it is not clear that every Mr. Smith with at least one boy is intended. That is, the problem statement does not say that having a boy is a sufficient condition for Mr. Smith to be identified as having a boy this way.  Commenting on Gardner's version of the problem, Bar-Hillel and Falk [4] note that "Mr. Smith, unlike the reader, is presumably aware of the sex of both of his children when making this statement", i.e. that 'I have two children and at least one of them is a boy.' If it is further assumed that Mr. Smith would report this fact if it were true then the correct answer is 1 / 3 as Gardner intended.  Analysis of the ambiguity [ edit ]  If it is assumed that this information was obtained by looking at both children to see if there is at least one boy, the condition is both necessary and sufficient. Three of the four equally probable events for a two-child family in the sample space above meet the condition, as in this table:      Older child  Younger child    Girl  Girl    Girl  Boy    Boy  Girl    Boy  Boy      Thus, if it is assumed that both children were considered while looking for a boy, the answer to question 2 is 1 / 3 . However, if the family was first selected and then a random, true statement was made about the gender of one child in that family, whether or not both were considered, the correct way to calculate the conditional probability is not to count all of the cases that include a child with that gender. Instead, one must consider only the probabilities where the statement will be made in each case. [12] So, if ALOB represents the event where the statement is "at least one boy", and ALOG represents the event where the statement is "at least one girl", then this table describes the sample space:      Older child  Younger child  P(this family)  P(ALOB given this family)  P(ALOG given this family)  P(ALOB and this family)  P(ALOG and this family)    Girl  Girl  1 / 4  0  1  0  1 / 4    Girl  Boy  1 / 4  1 / 2  1 / 2  1 / 8  1 / 8    Boy  Girl  1 / 4  1 / 2  1 / 2  1 / 8  1 / 8    Boy  Boy  1 / 4  1  0  1 / 4  0      So, if you are told that at least one is a boy when the fact is chosen randomly, the probability that both are boys is          P  (  A  L  O  B   a  n  d   B  B  )    P  (  A  L  O  B  )     =     1  4    0  +    1  8    +    1  8    +    1  4       =    1  2     .    {\displaystyle \mathrm {\frac {P(ALOB\;and\;BB)}{P(ALOB)}} ={\frac {\frac {1}{4}}{0+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{4}}}}={\frac {1}{2}}\,.}     The paradox occurs when it is not known how the statement "at least one is a boy" was generated. Either answer could be correct, based on what is assumed. [13]  However, the " 1 / 3 " answer is obtained only by assuming P(ALOB|BG) = P(ALOB|GB) =1, which implies P(ALOG|BG) = P(ALOG|GB) = 0, that is, the other child's sex is never mentioned although it is present. As Marks and Smith say, "This extreme assumption is never included in the presentation of the two-child problem, however, and is surely not what people have in mind when they present it." [13]  Modelling the generative process [ edit ]  Another way to analyse the ambiguity (for question 2) is by making explicit the generative process (all draws are independent).   The following process leads to answer     p  (   c   1    =   c   2    =  B   |    O  b  s  e  r  v  a  t  i  o  n   )  =    1  3      {\displaystyle p(c_{1}=c_{2}=B|\mathrm {Observation} )={\frac {1}{3}}}   :  Draw      c   1      {\displaystyle c_{1}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Draw      c   2      {\displaystyle c_{2}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Observe      c   1    =  B  ∨   c   2    =  B    {\displaystyle c_{1}=B\vee c_{2}=B}      The following process leads to answer     p  (   c   1    =   c   2    =  B   |    O  b  s  e  r  v  a  t  i  o  n   )  =    1  2      {\displaystyle p(c_{1}=c_{2}=B|\mathrm {Observation} )={\frac {1}{2}}}   :  Draw      c   1      {\displaystyle c_{1}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Draw      c   2      {\displaystyle c_{2}}   equiprobably from     {  B  ,  G  }    {\displaystyle \{B,G\}}    Draw index     i    {\displaystyle i}   equiprobably from     {  1  ,  2  }    {\displaystyle \{1,2\}}    Observe      c   i    =  B    {\displaystyle c_{i}=B}       Bayesian analysis [ edit ]  Following classical probability arguments, we consider a large urn containing two children. We assume equal probability that either is a boy or a girl. The three discernible cases are thus: 1. both are girls (GG) — with probability P(GG) = 1 / 4 , 2. both are boys (BB) — with probability of P(BB) = 1 / 4 , and 3. one of each (G·B) — with probability of P(G·B) = 1 / 2 . These are the prior probabilities.  Now we add the additional assumption that "at least one is a boy" = B. Using Bayes' Theorem , we find        P  (  B  B  ∣  B  )   =   P  (  B  ∣  B  B  )  ×     P  (  B  B  )    P  (  B  )      =  1  ×     (    1  4    )    (    3  4    )     =    1  3     .    {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B)} =\mathrm {P(B\mid BB)\times {\frac {P(BB)}{P(B)}}} =1\times {\frac {\left({\frac {1}{4}}\right)}{\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)}}={\frac {1}{3}}\,.}     where P(A|B) means "probability of A given B". P(B|BB) = probability of at least one boy given both are boys = 1. P(BB) = probability of both boys = 1 / 4 from the prior distribution. P(B) = probability of at least one being a boy, which includes cases BB and G·B = 1 / 4 + 1 / 2 = 3 / 4 .  Note that, although the natural assumption seems to be a probability of 1 / 2 , so the derived value of 1 / 3 seems low, the actual "normal" value for P(BB) is 1 / 4 , so the 1 / 3 is actually a bit higher .  The paradox arises because the second assumption is somewhat artificial, and when describing the problem in an actual setting things get a bit sticky. Just how do we know that "at least" one is a boy? One description of the problem states that we look into a window, see only one child and it is a boy. This sounds like the same assumption. However, this one is equivalent to "sampling" the distribution (i.e. removing one child from the urn, ascertaining that it is a boy, then replacing). Let's call the statement "the sample is a boy" proposition "b". Now we have:        P  (  B  B  ∣  b  )   =   P  (  b  ∣  B  B  )  ×     P  (  B  B  )    P  (  b  )      =  1  ×     (    1  4    )    (    1  2    )     =    1  2     .    {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid b)} =\mathrm {P(b\mid BB)\times {\frac {P(BB)}{P(b)}}} =1\times {\frac {\left({\frac {1}{4}}\right)}{\left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)}}={\frac {1}{2}}\,.}     The difference here is the P(b), which is just the probability of drawing a boy from all possible cases (i.e. without the "at least"), which is clearly 1 / 2 .  The Bayesian analysis generalizes easily to the case in which we relax the 50:50 population assumption. If we have no information about the populations then we assume a "flat prior", i.e. P(GG) = P(BB) = P(G·B) = 1 / 3 . In this case the "at least" assumption produces the result P(BB|B) = 1 / 2 , and the sampling assumption produces P(BB|b) = 2 / 3 , a result also derivable from the Rule of Succession .  Martingale analysis [ edit ]  Suppose you had wagered that Mr Smith had two boys, and received fair odds. You paid $1 and you will receive $4 if he has two boys. We think of your wager as investment that will increase in value as good news arrives. What evidence would make you happier about your investment? Learning that at least one child out of two is a boy, or learning that at least one child out of one is a boy?  The latter is a priori less likely, and therefore better news. That is why the two answers cannot be the same.  Now for the numbers. If we bet on one child and win, the value of your investment has doubled. It must double again to get to $4, so the odds are 1 in 2.  On the other hand if we learn that at least one of two children is a boy, our investment increases as if we had wagered on this question. Our $1 is now worth $ 1  1 / 3 . To get to $4 we still have to increase our wealth threefold. So the answer is 1 in 3.  Variants of the question [ edit ]  Following the popularization of the paradox by Gardner it has been presented and discussed in various forms. The first variant presented by Bar-Hillel & Falk [4] is worded as follows:   Mr. Smith is the father of two. We meet him walking along the street with a young boy whom he proudly introduces as his son. What is the probability that Mr. Smith's other child is also a boy?   Bar-Hillel & Falk use this variant to highlight the importance of considering the underlying assumptions. The intuitive answer is 1 / 2 and, when making the most natural assumptions, this is correct. However, someone may argue that "…before Mr. Smith identifies the boy as his son, we know only that he is either the father of two boys, BB, or of two girls, GG, or of one of each in either birth order, i.e., BG or GB. Assuming again independence and equiprobability, we begin with a probability of 1 / 4 that Smith is the father of two boys. Discovering that he has at least one boy rules out the event GG. Since the remaining three events were equiprobable, we obtain a probability of 1 / 3 for BB." [4]  The natural assumption is that Mr. Smith selected the child companion at random. If so, as combination BB has twice the probability of either BG or GB of having resulted in the boy walking companion (and combination GG has zero probability, ruling it out), the union of events BG and GB becomes equiprobable with event BB, and so the chance that the other child is also a boy is 1 / 2 . Bar-Hillel & Falk, however, suggest an alternative scenario. They imagine a culture in which boys are invariably chosen over girls as walking companions. In this case, the combinations of BB, BG and GB are assumed equally likely to have resulted in the boy walking companion, and thus the probability that the other child is also a boy is 1 / 3 .  In 1991, Marilyn vos Savant responded to a reader who asked her to answer a variant of the Boy or Girl paradox that included beagles. [6] In 1996, she published the question again in a different form. The 1991 and 1996 questions, respectively were phrased:   A shopkeeper says she has two new baby beagles to show you, but she doesn't know whether they're male, female, or a pair. You tell her that you want only a male, and she telephones the fellow who's giving them a bath. "Is at least one a male?" she asks him. "Yes!" she informs you with a smile. What is the probability that the other one is a male?  Say that a woman and a man (who are unrelated) each has two children. We know that at least one of the woman's children is a boy and that the man's oldest child is a boy. Can you explain why the chances that the woman has two boys do not equal the chances that the man has two boys?   With regard to the second formulation Vos Savant gave the classic answer that the chances that the woman has two boys are about 1 / 3 whereas the chances that the man has two boys are about 1 / 2 . In response to reader response that questioned her analysis vos Savant conducted a survey of readers with exactly two children, at least one of which is a boy. Of 17,946 responses, 35.9% reported two boys. [11]  Vos Savant's articles were discussed by Carlton and Stansfield [11] in a 2005 article in The American Statistician . The authors do not discuss the possible ambiguity in the question and conclude that her answer is correct from a mathematical perspective, given the assumptions that the likelihood of a child being a boy or girl is equal, and that the sex of the second child is independent of the first. With regard to her survey they say it "at least validates vos Savant's correct assertion that the “chances” posed in the original question, though similar-sounding, are different, and that the first probability is certainly nearer to 1 in 3 than to 1 in 2."  Carlton and Stansfield go on to discuss the common assumptions in the Boy or Girl paradox. They demonstrate that in reality male children are actually more likely than female children, and that the sex of the second child is not independent of the sex of the first. The authors conclude that, although the assumptions of the question run counter to observations, the paradox still has pedagogical value, since it "illustrates one of the more intriguing applications of conditional probability." [11] Of course, the actual probability values do not matter; the purpose of the paradox is to demonstrate seemingly contradictory logic, not actual birth rates.  Information about the child [ edit ]  Suppose we were told not only that Mr. Smith has two children, and one of them is a boy, but also that the boy was born on a Tuesday: does this change the previous analyses? Again, the answer depends on how this information was presented - what kind of selection process produced this knowledge.  Following the tradition of the problem, suppose that in the population of two-child families, the sex of the two children is independent of one another, equally likely boy or girl, and that the birth date of each child is independent of the other child. The chance of being born on any given day of the week is 1 / 7 .  From Bayes' Theorem that the probability of two boys, given that one boy was born on a Tuesday is given by:        P  (  B  B  ∣   B   T    )  =     P  (   B   T    ∣  B  B  )  ×  P  (  B  B  )    P  (   B   T    )        {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B_{T})={\frac {P(B_{T}\mid BB)\times P(BB)}{P(B_{T})}}} }     Assume that the probability of being born on a Tuesday is ε ( ε = 1 / 7 will be set after arriving at the general solution). The first term in the numerator is therefore the probability of at least one boy born on Tuesday, given that the family has two boys, or 1 − (1 − ε ) 2 (one minus the probability that neither boy is born on Tuesday). The second term in the numerator is simply 1 / 4 , the probability of having two boys. The denominator is trickier; the required probability is that of having at least one boy on Tuesday over the entire sample space (two-child families). Therefore there are 4 cases to evaluate: BB, BG, GB, GG. Each of these occurs with probability 1 / 4 . P(B T (GG)) is 0, there are no boys. P(B T (BG)) and P(B T (GB)) is ε , there is one and only one boy, thus he has ε chance of being born on Tuesday. P(B T (BB)) is ε + ε − ε 2 . It is the chance that one boy is born on Tuesday, plus the chance that the other boy is born on Tuesday, minus the chance that they both are (this term arises from the fact that P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A)P(B), assuming that A and B are independent). Therefore, the full equation is:        P  (  B  B  ∣   B   T    )   =      (   1  −  (  1  −  ε   )   2     )   ×    1  4      0  +    1  4    ε  +    1  4    ε  +    1  4     (   ε  +  ε  −   ε   2     )      =     1  −  (  1  −  ε   )   2      4  ε  −   ε   2         {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B_{T})} ={\frac {\left(1-(1-\varepsilon )^{2}\right)\times {\frac {1}{4}}}{0+{\frac {1}{4}}\varepsilon +{\frac {1}{4}}\varepsilon +{\frac {1}{4}}\left(\varepsilon +\varepsilon -\varepsilon ^{2}\right)}}={\frac {1-(1-\varepsilon )^{2}}{4\varepsilon -\varepsilon ^{2}}}}      For     ε  >  0    {\displaystyle \varepsilon >0}   , this reduces to      P  (  B  B  ∣   B   T    )   =     2  −  ε    4  −  ε       {\displaystyle \mathrm {P(BB\mid B_{T})} ={\frac {2-\varepsilon }{4-\varepsilon }}}     If ε is now set to 1 / 7 , the probability becomes 13 / 27 , or about 0.48. In fact, as ε approaches 0, the total probability goes to 1 / 2 , which is the answer expected when one child is sampled (e.g. the oldest child is a boy) and is thus removed from the pool of possible children. In other words, as more and more details about the boy child are given (for instance: born on January 1), the chance that the other child is a girl approaches one half.  It seems that quite irrelevant information was introduced, yet the probability of the sex of the other child has changed dramatically from what it was before (the chance the other child was a girl was 2 / 3 , when it was not known that the boy was born on Tuesday).  However, is it really plausible that the family with at least one boy born on a Tuesday was produced by choosing just one of such families at random? It is much more easy to imagine the following scenario.   We know Mr. Smith has two children. We knock at his door and a boy comes and answers the door. We ask the boy on what day of the week he was born.   Assume that which of the two children answers the door is determined by chance. Then the procedure was ( 1 ) pick a two-child family at random from all two-child families ( 2 ) pick one of the two children at random, ( 3 ) see if it is a boy and ask on what day he was born. The chance the other child is a girl is 1 / 2 . This is a very different procedure from ( 1 ) picking a two-child family at random from all families with two children, at least one a boy, born on a Tuesday. The chance the family consists of a boy and a girl is 14 / 27 , about 0.52.  This variant of the boy and girl problem is discussed on many internet blogs and is the subject of a paper by Ruma Falk. [14] The moral of the story is that these probabilities do not just depend on the known information, but on how that information was obtained.  Psychological investigation [ edit ]  From the position of statistical analysis the relevant question is often ambiguous and as such there is no “correct” answer. However, this does not exhaust the boy or girl paradox for it is not necessarily the ambiguity that explains how the intuitive probability is derived. A survey such as vos Savant's suggests that the majority of people adopt an understanding of Gardner's problem that if they were consistent would lead them to the 1 / 3 probability answer but overwhelmingly people intuitively arrive at the 1 / 2 probability answer. Ambiguity notwithstanding, this makes the problem of interest to psychological researchers who seek to understand how humans estimate probability.  Fox & Levav (2004) used the problem (called the Mr. Smith problem , credited to Gardner, but not worded exactly the same as Gardner's version) to test theories of how people estimate conditional probabilities. [2] In this study, the paradox was posed to participants in two ways:   "Mr. Smith says: 'I have two children and at least one of them is a boy.' Given this information, what is the probability that the other child is a boy?"  "Mr. Smith says: 'I have two children and it is not the case that they are both girls.' Given this information, what is the probability that both children are boys?"   The authors argue that the first formulation gives the reader the mistaken impression that there are two possible outcomes for the "other child", [2] whereas the second formulation gives the reader the impression that there are four possible outcomes, of which one has been rejected (resulting in 1 / 3 being the probability of both children being boys, as there are 3 remaining possible outcomes, only one of which is that both of the children are boys). The study found that 85% of participants answered 1 / 2 for the first formulation, while only 39% responded that way to the second formulation. The authors argued that the reason people respond differently to each question (along with other similar problems, such as the Monty Hall Problem and the Bertrand's box paradox ) is because of the use of naive heuristics that fail to properly define the number of possible outcomes.
