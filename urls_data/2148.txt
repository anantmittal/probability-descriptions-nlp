I also know that I often had &quot;symptoms&quot; and my cycle got all messed up. I would be early some months and late others. My best recommendation is to buy 100 cheapo tests on amazon, so anytime you wonder you can test before you stress.           a BabyCenter member   Answered 6/27/12               9 found this helpful     Can you get pregnant with your tubes tied           a BabyCenter member   Answered 5/2/17               7 found this helpful     It is quite rare these days, if your surgery was done correctly. You should find out as soon as you can, in case it is ectopic.           a BabyCenter member   Answered 6/27/12               7 found this helpful     Studies have shown that tubal ligation (tying of the fallopian tubes) is not a 100% guarantee of contraception. There&#39;s still at least a 1% chance of getting pregnant after your tubes are tied. This risk then increases to about 1.8% after 10 years. It has also been noted that most pregnancies occurring after ligation are ectopic in nature, meaning that the pregnancy occurs at the fallopian tube instead of the uterus. I would highly suggest you this method from http://mommyrainbow.com that can help you to get pregnant with your tubes tied.           a BabyCenter member   Answered 4/15/15               6 found this helpful     *healthy                 greenprincess69    Answered 7/3/12               5 found this helpful     Unfortunately the only way to know is by waiting it out after you miss your period. I would think it's somewhat rare, but I know it's possible, because I know someone that got pregs after having her tubes tied. : )                 jacobsmom45    Answered 6/27/12               5 found this helpful     I had my tubes cut and cauterized after a c section after having my fourth baby. Would it still be possible for me to get pregnant? That would be so bad, my uterus almost ruptured this last pregnancy. I am still producing milk, though.

Asked by Sherry, Illinois   Is it possible for a woman to still get pregnant after having her tubes tied?       Living Well Expert  Dr. Jennifer Shu Pediatrician, Children's Medical Group  Expert Answer:  There is a very small chance of becoming pregnant after having fallopian tube sterilization. More than 1 million women have the procedure each year, and according to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the risk of getting pregnant is less than 1 percent.  Tubal sterilization aims to prevent pregnancy by blocking an egg and sperm from meeting in the fallopian tube. The procedure may include either cutting and removing a portion of the tubes, using an electric current to burn (cauterize) part of the tubes, sealing off the tubes with a ring or clip, or inserting an implant that creates scar tissue that  will eventually block the tubes.  Depending on the type of procedure used, the sterilization may be effective right away or may take a few months to work. Sometimes, a special X-ray test called a hysteropsalpingogram must be performed to make sure the tubes are completely blocked.  If a pregnancy does occur following tubal sterilization, it is more likely to happen if the clip method was used. The risk is also higher in women who had the sterilization done before the age of 30, as well as in women who had an implant placed but did not follow up with the X-ray test to confirm blockage of the tubes.  Pregnancies following tubal sterilization are often "ectopic," which means that the fertilized egg grows outside of the uterus, most commonly in a fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancies must be treated immediately to prevent harm to the pregnant woman, so it's important to consult with an obstetrician right away if you suspect a pregnancy following tubal sterilization.  Your obstetrician can talk with you in more detail about the risks and benefits of the different types of tubal sterilization, how soon the sterilization is expected to take effect, whether back-up birth control needs to be used for a short period after the procedure, and the chances of becoming pregnant afterward for your specific situation.

Newsletter Pregnancy After Tubal Ligation: Know the Symptoms Medically reviewed by Debra Rose Wilson, PhD, MSN, RN, IBCLC, AHN-BC, CHT on  June 22, 2017 — Written by Rachel Nall, RN, BSN, CCRN Risks Pregnancy symptoms Ectopic pregnancy symptoms Next steps Overview  Tubal ligation , also known as “getting your tubes tied,” is an option for women who no longer want to have children. This outpatient surgical procedure involves blocking or cutting the fallopian tubes . It prevents an egg that’s released from your ovary from traveling to your uterus , where the egg could typically be fertilized.  While tubal ligation is effective in preventing most pregnancies, it isn’t an absolute. An estimated 1 out of every 200 women will become pregnant after tubal ligation.  Tubal ligation can increase your risk of an ectopic pregnancy . This is where a fertilized egg implants in the fallopian tubes instead of traveling to the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy can turn into an emergency. It’s important to be aware of the symptoms.  Risks What's the risk of pregnancy after tubal ligation?  When a surgeon performs a tubal ligation, the fallopian tubes are banded, cut, sealed, or tied. Tubal ligation can result in pregnancy if the fallopian tubes grow back together after this process.  A woman is at greater risk of this occurring the younger she is when she has a tubal ligation. According to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , the rates of pregnancy after tubal ligation are:   5 percent in women younger than 28  2 percent in women between ages 28 and 33  1 percent in women older than 34   After a tubal ligation procedure, a woman may also discover she was already pregnant. This is because a fertilized egg may have already implanted in her uterus before her procedure. For this reason, many women opt for tubal ligation just after giving birth or just after a menstrual period, when the risk of pregnancy is lower.  Pregnancy symptoms Symptoms of pregnancy  If your fallopian tube has grown back together after tubal ligation, it’s possible you could have a full-term pregnancy. Some women also opt to have a tubal ligation reversal, where a doctor puts the fallopian tubes back together. This isn’t always effective for women who want to get pregnant, but it can be.  Symptoms associated with pregnancy include:   breast tenderness   food cravings  feeling sick when thinking about certain foods  missing a period   nausea , especially in the morning   unexplained fatigue  urinating more frequently    If you think you may be pregnant, you can take an at-home pregnancy test . These tests aren’t 100 percent reliable, especially early in your pregnancy. Your doctor can also perform a blood test or ultrasound to confirm a pregnancy.  Ectopic pregnancy symptoms Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy  Having previous pelvic surgery or tubal ligation can increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. This is also true if you use an intrauterine device (IUD) as a contraceptive method .  The symptoms associated with an ectopic pregnancy can initially look like a traditional pregnancy. For example, if you take a pregnancy test, it will be positive. But the fertilized egg isn’t implanted in a place where it can grow. As a result, the pregnancy can’t continue.  Besides traditional pregnancy symptoms, symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy can include:   abdominal pain  light vaginal bleeding   pelvic pain   pelvic pressure, especially during a bowel movement   These symptoms shouldn’t be ignored. An ectopic pregnancy can cause the fallopian tube to rupture, which can result in internal bleeding that leads to fainting and shock . Seek immediate medical treatment if you experience the following symptoms with an ectopic pregnancy:   feeling extremely lightheaded or passing out  severe pain in your stomach or pelvis  severe vaginal bleeding  shoulder pain    If your doctor determines that your pregnancy is ectopic at an early stage, they may prescribe a medication called methotrexate . This medication can stop the egg from growing further or causing bleeding. Your doctor will monitor your levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone associated with pregnancy.  If this method isn’t effective, surgery may be needed to remove the tissue. Your doctor will try to repair the fallopian tube. If that’s not possible, the fallopian tube will be removed.  Doctors treat a ruptured fallopian tube with surgery to repair or remove it. You may require blood products if you’ve lost a lot of blood. Your doctor will also monitor you for signs of infection, such as fever or difficulty maintaining normal blood pressure .  Next steps Next steps  While tubal ligation is a very effective contraception method, it doesn’t protect against pregnancy 100 percent of the time. It’s important to remember as well that the procedure doesn’t protect against sexually transmitted infections . If you and your partner aren’t monogamous, it’s important to use a condom each time you have sex.  Talk to your doctor if you’re concerned your tubal ligation won’t be effective. If you had your procedure at a young age or if it’s been more than a decade since you had your procedure, you could be at a small but increased risk of pregnancy. You and your partner can use other contraception options to reduce the risks. These could include a vasectomy (male sterilization) or condoms.

My best recommendation is to buy 100 cheapo tests on amazon, so anytime you wonder you can test before you stress.           a BabyCenter member   Answered 6/27/12               9 found this helpful     Can you get pregnant with your tubes tied           a BabyCenter member   Answered 5/2/17               7 found this helpful     It is quite rare these days, if your surgery was done correctly. You should find out as soon as you can, in case it is ectopic.           a BabyCenter member   Answered 6/27/12               7 found this helpful     Studies have shown that tubal ligation (tying of the fallopian tubes) is not a 100% guarantee of contraception. There&#39;s still at least a 1% chance of getting pregnant after your tubes are tied. This risk then increases to about 1.8% after 10 years. It has also been noted that most pregnancies occurring after ligation are ectopic in nature, meaning that the pregnancy occurs at the fallopian tube instead of the uterus. I would highly suggest you this method from http://mommyrainbow.com that can help you to get pregnant with your tubes tied.           a BabyCenter member   Answered 4/15/15               6 found this helpful     *healthy                 greenprincess69    Answered 7/3/12               5 found this helpful     Unfortunately the only way to know is by waiting it out after you miss your period. I would think it's somewhat rare, but I know it's possible, because I know someone that got pregs after having her tubes tied. : )                 jacobsmom45    Answered 6/27/12               5 found this helpful     I had my tubes cut and cauterized after a c section after having my fourth baby. Would it still be possible for me to get pregnant? That would be so bad, my uterus almost ruptured this last pregnancy. I am still producing milk, though.

I didnt plan on any other children, thats why I had the surgery , and no I didnt have it reversed. But I wouldnt trade him for all the money in this world!!                 LCamplese    Answered 11/8/08                130 found this helpful     The failure rate of tubal ligation is about 1 in 1000. Artificial insemination probably wont work. The best chance of pregnancy would be from in vitro fetilization because they retreive the egg directly from the ovary and place the embrio in the uterus, completely bypassing the fallopian tube.

I just wanted to settle down with the right woman. I finally meet the right woman. Her smile is so captivating and she is as beautiful as life itself. As we began spending time together I imagined her having my child but I did not think it was possible since she had a proceedure where her tubes were tied and cut 9 years ago. A few months ago she began to have all of the symptoms of being pregnant. No doctor would assist since she was sitll having her normal cycle. She even had one last week. We finally went to the ER and thought we would find a doctor who could help. The blood test and urine test was -. He then wanted to run all kinds of dangerous tests that could be harmful to a fetus. We signed out AMA and went home. I prayed and asked God to give us a sign. A few days later the baby started kicking like you would not believe! I hope she comes out looking like my wife!                 teddyg414    Answered 10/2/11               44 found this helpful     Actaully Yes That Can Happy !

Asked by Sherry, Illinois   Is it possible for a woman to still get pregnant after having her tubes tied?       Living Well Expert  Dr. Jennifer Shu Pediatrician, Children's Medical Group  Expert Answer:  There is a very small chance of becoming pregnant after having fallopian tube sterilization. More than 1 million women have the procedure each year, and according to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the risk of getting pregnant is less than 1 percent.  Tubal sterilization aims to prevent pregnancy by blocking an egg and sperm from meeting in the fallopian tube. The procedure may include either cutting and removing a portion of the tubes, using an electric current to burn (cauterize) part of the tubes, sealing off the tubes with a ring or clip, or inserting an implant that creates scar tissue that  will eventually block the tubes.  Depending on the type of procedure used, the sterilization may be effective right away or may take a few months to work. Sometimes, a special X-ray test called a hysteropsalpingogram must be performed to make sure the tubes are completely blocked.  If a pregnancy does occur following tubal sterilization, it is more likely to happen if the clip method was used. The risk is also higher in women who had the sterilization done before the age of 30, as well as in women who had an implant placed but did not follow up with the X-ray test to confirm blockage of the tubes.  Pregnancies following tubal sterilization are often "ectopic," which means that the fertilized egg grows outside of the uterus, most commonly in a fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancies must be treated immediately to prevent harm to the pregnant woman, so it's important to consult with an obstetrician right away if you suspect a pregnancy following tubal sterilization.  Your obstetrician can talk with you in more detail about the risks and benefits of the different types of tubal sterilization, how soon the sterilization is expected to take effect, whether back-up birth control needs to be used for a short period after the procedure, and the chances of becoming pregnant afterward for your specific situation.

Will it work for you? Is it worth going through the procedure? How much risk is there? After all, everyone has heard about rare cases in which a pregnancy after tubal ligation occurs. Whether you saw the statistics or know someone who experienced it first-hand, the thought of an unexpected pregnancy after getting your tubes tied can be terrifying.        The best antidote for fear and anxiety before making any final decisions about getting the procedure done, or to put your worries to rest after having gone through a tubal ligation, is information. Here are the 5 truths every woman should know about pregnancy after tubal ligation:    Pregnancy after tubal ligation is…    What does it mean to have a pregnancy after a tubal ligation? First, you must understand what a tubal ligation is. This surgical procedure is performed to cut, tie, clamp or band the fallopian tubes shut. As a result, it is impossible for the eggs in your ovaries to reach your uterus, where fertilization typically occurs.  A tubal ligation is a form of permanent birth control. So pregnancy after a tubal ligation, although highly uncommon, refers to the event when a woman still becomes pregnant after having undergone the procedure.    It is very uncommon    How typical is pregnancy after tubal ligation? Not very. But, it still happens. Official estimates show that within 10 years of having the procedure done, between 18 to 37 women out of 1,000 become pregnant. That means there’s about a 2 to 4% chance it might happen. In these cases, the woman’s tubes grow back together, making pregnancy possible again. But, it really depends on your age. The older you are, the lower your chances of pregnancy after tubal ligation. There’s only about a 1% chance for women age 34 and older.         Tubal ligation is not easily reversible    Although it’s possible to undergo surgery to reverse the procedure so that you can become pregnant after tubal ligation, it doesn’t always work. A reversal isn’t possible in all cases. It depends on how long ago you had the procedure done and how damaged your tubes are as a result.  Generally speaking, tubal ligation is permanent, meaning there’s no going back. If there’s any possibility that you may want to have another baby, don’t get a tubal ligation. Instead, use another non-permanent form of birth control.    It could have happened before the procedure    In some cases, women are pregnant when they go into tubal ligation surgery, which can be quite a surprise! Many women choose to have a tubal ligation done just after childbirth to eliminate this possibility. Another optimal time to have the surgery is just after a menstrual period.    It could be ectopic    One risk factor for ectopic pregnancy is having had your tubes tied. In this type of pregnancy, a fertilized egg begins to grow in one of the fallopian tubes instead of in the uterus. This dangerous situation can result in a ruptured tube and significant internal bleeding. Pregnancy after tubal ligation is more likely to be ectopic than pregnancies in women who haven’t had the procedure done.  As you can see, a tubal ligation is an effective permanent form of birth control that leaves a minimal possibility for a pregnancy afterward. Yes, there are some cases that crop up. But, for most women, the risk is very low.        Just to be sure, if you have had the procedure or will have it soon, you should know the signs of pregnancy after tubal ligation. That way, if you experience any symptoms, you can seek medical attention as soon as possible.  Symptoms of Pregnancy After Tubal Ligation  Pregnancy after tubal ligation results in the same symptoms that any pregnancy brings. However, you should also be aware of the signs of ectopic pregnancies which are more common following a tubal ligation. Here’s what to look for:     Vaginal Discharge: Implantation can cause light spotting and cramping. You may think it’s the start of your period, but if your full period never comes, it could be the sign that tips you off.   Tender Breasts: The hormonal changes associated with early pregnancy may result in pain or tenderness, swollenness, or other changes in the breasts.   Tiredness: Hormones are to blame again! Changes in hormones may cause you to experience fatigue, even within a week after conceiving.   Morning Sickness: While not all women experience this symptom, it is a tell-tale sign of pregnancy. Nausea can happen at any time of the day, although the morning is often the worst. Cravings and food aversions are other related symptoms common in early pregnancy.   Missed Period: If you miss a period, you could be pregnant. But, you may have missed your period for another reason. The good news is after you’ve missed a period, you can take a home pregnancy test that’s likely to be accurate.    If you’re not sure, you can always take a home pregnancy test or see your gynecologist. That way, you’ll have peace of mind knowing whether or not you’re pregnant, and address any other medical issues that you may be experiencing.  Source  Ectopic Pregnancy Symptoms  After a tubal ligation, your risk of ectopic pregnancy is higher. In an ectopic pregnancy, you may experience the above symptoms, but may also notice:     Abnormal Bleeding: If you’re not expecting your period but have bleeding that’s light or heavy, it could be related to an ectopic pregnancy.   Pain: You may experience abdominal pain similar to cramps, or sharper pain. Pain can also be felt in your shoulder if a ruptured fallopian tube results in internal bleeding.   Dizziness: A loss of blood may leave you feeling dizzy, faint and/or weak.    An ectopic pregnancy requires immediate medical attention since the condition may be life-threatening. Surgery is often needed to remove the pregnancy and stop or prevent internal bleeding.  Remember, the risk of pregnancy after tubal ligation is low. So, if you experience symptoms, there’s most likely another explanation. In any case, it’s best to speak with your medical professional to ensure that you get to the bottom of it.  It’s also important to note that while tubal ligation can prevent pregnancies, it doesn’t protect against sexually transmitted illnesses (STIs). If you have sex with a non-monogamous or new partner, be sure to use a condom until you can both be tested for STIs.  Source  The Bottom Line on Pregnancy After Tubal Ligation  Tubal ligation is one of the most effective methods of permanent birth control. Especially if you’re over the age of 34 and have the procedure done following childbirth, it’s doubtful that you’ll get pregnant after a tubal ligation.  This form of birth control is also complicated to reverse. If you are young or have even the slightest question in your mind about getting pregnant in the future, choose another form of birth control. There are many options out there; make sure you find the one that’s right for you.  Do you have an experience or comment to share about pregnancy after tubal ligation?

This outpatient surgical procedure involves blocking or cutting the fallopian tubes . It prevents an egg that’s released from your ovary from traveling to your uterus , where the egg could typically be fertilized.  While tubal ligation is effective in preventing most pregnancies, it isn’t an absolute. An estimated 1 out of every 200 women will become pregnant after tubal ligation.  Tubal ligation can increase your risk of an ectopic pregnancy . This is where a fertilized egg implants in the fallopian tubes instead of traveling to the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy can turn into an emergency. It’s important to be aware of the symptoms.  Risks What's the risk of pregnancy after tubal ligation?  When a surgeon performs a tubal ligation, the fallopian tubes are banded, cut, sealed, or tied. Tubal ligation can result in pregnancy if the fallopian tubes grow back together after this process.  A woman is at greater risk of this occurring the younger she is when she has a tubal ligation. According to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , the rates of pregnancy after tubal ligation are:   5 percent in women younger than 28  2 percent in women between ages 28 and 33  1 percent in women older than 34   After a tubal ligation procedure, a woman may also discover she was already pregnant. This is because a fertilized egg may have already implanted in her uterus before her procedure. For this reason, many women opt for tubal ligation just after giving birth or just after a menstrual period, when the risk of pregnancy is lower.  Pregnancy symptoms Symptoms of pregnancy  If your fallopian tube has grown back together after tubal ligation, it’s possible you could have a full-term pregnancy. Some women also opt to have a tubal ligation reversal, where a doctor puts the fallopian tubes back together. This isn’t always effective for women who want to get pregnant, but it can be.  Symptoms associated with pregnancy include:   breast tenderness   food cravings  feeling sick when thinking about certain foods  missing a period   nausea , especially in the morning   unexplained fatigue  urinating more frequently    If you think you may be pregnant, you can take an at-home pregnancy test . These tests aren’t 100 percent reliable, especially early in your pregnancy. Your doctor can also perform a blood test or ultrasound to confirm a pregnancy.  Ectopic pregnancy symptoms Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy  Having previous pelvic surgery or tubal ligation can increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. This is also true if you use an intrauterine device (IUD) as a contraceptive method .  The symptoms associated with an ectopic pregnancy can initially look like a traditional pregnancy. For example, if you take a pregnancy test, it will be positive. But the fertilized egg isn’t implanted in a place where it can grow. As a result, the pregnancy can’t continue.  Besides traditional pregnancy symptoms, symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy can include:   abdominal pain  light vaginal bleeding   pelvic pain   pelvic pressure, especially during a bowel movement   These symptoms shouldn’t be ignored. An ectopic pregnancy can cause the fallopian tube to rupture, which can result in internal bleeding that leads to fainting and shock . Seek immediate medical treatment if you experience the following symptoms with an ectopic pregnancy:   feeling extremely lightheaded or passing out  severe pain in your stomach or pelvis  severe vaginal bleeding  shoulder pain    If your doctor determines that your pregnancy is ectopic at an early stage, they may prescribe a medication called methotrexate . This medication can stop the egg from growing further or causing bleeding. Your doctor will monitor your levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone associated with pregnancy.  If this method isn’t effective, surgery may be needed to remove the tissue. Your doctor will try to repair the fallopian tube. If that’s not possible, the fallopian tube will be removed.  Doctors treat a ruptured fallopian tube with surgery to repair or remove it. You may require blood products if you’ve lost a lot of blood. Your doctor will also monitor you for signs of infection, such as fever or difficulty maintaining normal blood pressure .  Next steps Next steps  While tubal ligation is a very effective contraception method, it doesn’t protect against pregnancy 100 percent of the time. It’s important to remember as well that the procedure doesn’t protect against sexually transmitted infections . If you and your partner aren’t monogamous, it’s important to use a condom each time you have sex.  Talk to your doctor if you’re concerned your tubal ligation won’t be effective. If you had your procedure at a young age or if it’s been more than a decade since you had your procedure, you could be at a small but increased risk of pregnancy. You and your partner can use other contraception options to reduce the risks. These could include a vasectomy (male sterilization) or condoms.

Is it possible to get pregnant after having my tubes tied?   Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Q: I am 28 years old and the proud mother of three kids.  I had my tubes tied four years ago but, for the past two months, my menstrual cycle has been off.  I have also been moody and tired.  Could I be pregnant? A: Having your tubes tied (or getting a bilateral tubal ligation) is one of the most effective methods of female sterilization.  It is 99.9% effective.  It is not 100% effective.  In fact, nothing is....except abstinence.  So, although getting pregnant after having your tubes tied is highly unlikely, it is possible.  If you feel like you may be pregnant, the easiest thing to do is to take an over-the-counter home pregnancy test.  The more likely explanation is that your periods are changing, as many of ours do after childbirth and as we age (although you are still very young!).  It may also be that something else is going on with your health, which could be affecting your body and your menstrual cycle.  Thyroid disease, for example, can cause fatigue, mood changes, weight loss or weight gain, and changes in a woman's menstrual cycle.  If you aren't pregnant and your symptoms continue, I recommend having a consultation with your OBGYN.

It is sometimes referred to as “having your tubes tied.” Tubal ligation is a surgical procedure that blocks the fallopian (fuh-LOPE-ee-in) tubes. The fallopian tubes normally carry the woman’s egg from the ovary to the uterus. Blocking the tubes stops the man’s sperm from reaching and fertilizing the woman’s egg. How is tubal ligation done? During tubal ligation surgery, the fallopian tubes are either cut, tied, banded, or sealed. All of these are considered to be permanent. A tubal ligation may be reversed, but it is not recommended. Most insurance plans do not cover a tubal reversal. It is expensive. How effective is tubal ligation?  Tubal ligation is one of the most effective methods of birth control. In general, about 95 out of every 100 women who get their tubes tied will never become pregnant.  But in some cases the tube(s) may grow back together, making pregnancy possible. The risk of pregnancy is higher in women who have a tubal ligation at a young age.  The risk of pregnancy in the 10 years after a tubal ligation is as follows:  Women who are younger than 28 years old: 5 percent  Women between 28 and 33 years old: 2 percent  Women 34 years and older: 1 percent  The risk is lower if the tubal ligation is done just after giving birth. If you get pregnant after tubal ligation, the fertilized egg may be in the fallopian tube instead of in the uterus. This abnormal pregnancy is called a tubal or an ectopic (eck-TOP-ik) pregnancy. You may need to have surgery to remove the pregnancy from the tube.  When can tubal ligation be done?  Tubal ligation can be done within 24 hours after having a baby. A small cut (incision) is made below the navel. The tubes are then cut and tied. The procedure requires anesthesia.  If you have a cesarean birth, the tubal ligation is done during the cesarean section. This way no other incisions are made.  Tubal ligation done at a time other than after having a baby is usually done using a laparoscope (LAP-er-uh-skope). This method is done under anesthesia. It requires 2 small incisions — one below the navel and one just above the pubic bone. Most tubal ligations can be done as outpatient surgery.  Complications  Complications of tubal ligation are rare. They include:  Bleeding  Infection  Damage to other organs  Risks of anesthesia  There is some discomfort for a few days after tubal ligation, but it can be controlled with medicine.  Take time to make the decision  A tubal ligation is considered to be a permanent method of birth control. Take some time to carefully consider if this method is right for you.  Use condoms the right way  A tubal ligation will help prevent pregnancy, but it won’t protect you against STIs (sexually transmitted infections). To protect against STIs, use condoms the right way.  Except for not having sex (abstinence), latex condoms give the best protection from many STIs, including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Condoms are helpful only if used the right way. Use a latex condom every time you have sex. Always put the condom on before the penis touches or enters the vagina. If you or your partner has an allergy to latex, you should use a plastic (polyurethane) condom.  Important steps for using condoms the right way:  Open the package carefully.  Hold the condom by the last inch at the tip and squeeze out the air.  If the penis is uncircumcised, pull back the foreskin.  Place the condom on the tip of the penis.  Unroll the condom to the base of the penis. Smooth out any extra air.  If you want or need to use lubricant on the condom, use only water-based lubricants like KY Jelly or Surgilube. Do not use oil-based lubricants. They can weaken condoms and cause them to break. Do not use petroleum jelly, cooking or vegetable oil, mineral or baby oil, massage oil, butter or margarine, oil-based creams, or lotions.  Immediately after ejaculation, hold the condom firmly by the rim at the base of the penis. Pull the penis and condom out of the vagina together while the penis is still erect.  Look carefully at the condom to see if there is a hole in the condom. If you are not sure, fill the condom with water to see if it leaks.  Discard the condom. Wrap it in tissue and throw it away. Do not flush it down the toilet.  Never re-use a condom.

Can You Get Pregnant With Your Tubes Tied?   By  Amanda -   November 8, 2016  0       Share on Facebook  Tweet on Twitter     tweet    Source: http://www.conceiveeasy.com/       W e’ve all heard the horror stories of women who had their tubes tied and then ten years later they have a surprise pregnancy. Some of them end up on television shows because they were oblivious to the fact that they were pregnant while assuming it was impossible. It’s not. Women get their tubes tied pretty routinely in this country and many of them end up pregnant afterward.In some cases, the pregnancy won’t be viable. In other cases, women are likely not prepared for the pregnancy that they are blessed with. Regardless, it’s a situation anyone with a uterus can find themselves in — sterilized or not.

The most traditional method involves cutting the tubes and tying them in knots. In some cases, doctors will now use a cauterizing tool to burn the snipped ends so that they cannot easily fuse back together. Tubal ligation can typically be performed on an outpatient basis, but general anesthesia is still required. The process might be done via the cervix with a long tool fitted with a camera on the end; this is known as a hysteroscopic tubal ligation. Other doctors may prefer to complete the tubal ligation laparoscopically via small incisions made in the wall of the abdomen. [Read more about Tubal Ligation] Rates of Efficacy Source: https://www.drugs.com T he effectiveness of a tubal ligation is actually better the more time passes. Some people think it should be the other way around, but it starts out poorer and increases as time goes by since the likelihood that the tubes will fuse back together and overall fertility both decrease with age . In the first ten years following the surgery, the efficacy of a tubal ligation is estimated by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center as being roughly 95 percent in women under 28 years old, 98 percent in women aged 28 to 33, and 99 percent in women aged 34 and older. Pregnancy After a Tubal M ost people would wonder how a pregnancy could be possible after a tubal ligation is performed. The short answer is that the tubal manages to undo itself. Sometimes the tubes actually find one another again. The body is constantly trying to repair itself from injury and that is how it views tubal ligation — as an attack on itself. Given the opportunity, the amazing human body will attempt to fuse those tubes back together. If successful, the woman would likely never know unless she gets pregnant. It is more likely that this will happen in younger women than older. [Read more about Pregnancy After Tubal] Ectopic Pregnancies Source: https://www.epainassist.com I n other circumstances, a pregnancy may occur outside of the uterus and implant itself elsewhere. The most common site for this in the case of women who have had tubal ligations is in the actual tube itself. The sperm manages to make its way to fertilize the egg and it resides inside a fallopian tube . These pregnancies are known as ectopic pregnancies. They are never viable since a baby cannot possibly grow and develop inside a fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancies are very risky to the health of the mother, too; they can be fatal in some cases. The end result could also cost the woman her tube. While this isn’t a major concern to most women who have already had a tubal ligation and decided they don’t want any (more) children, the situation is further complicated should they ever change their mind on that. Tubal reversals actually have pretty impressive efficacy rates. However, women who have lost a tube will have impaired fertility. Losing a Tube E ctopic pregnancies must be surgically removed. Sometimes the tube must be removed with the ectopic pregnancy if the pregnancy has progressed too much. Even if fertility isn’t a concern, women who lose a tube due to ectopic pregnancy after a tubal ligation will see some side effects from it. They may have irregular periods following the loss. This is because the ovaries take turns releasing eggs month after month. Most people think they switch on and off equally taking turns, but this isn’t quite true. Nonetheless, if a tube is lost, then eggs may not make it out each month. This means periods will no longer happen every month. This may sound like a dream to most women, but the period has a purpose and it involves more than fertility . That regular bleeding cycle is necessary for women to maintain optimal health. The decline of hormones is actually the same time in a woman’s life that her overall health starts to decline, too. Skipping periods means the uterus has to wait longer between cycles to shed its lining. As estrogen causes it to keep thickening each cycle before shedding, women may find that their periods are heavier after the loss of a tube. In addition, they may develop PMS symptoms that they didn’t have before, like cramps and backaches. Some women may even develop Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder as a result of the hormonal upset the loss of a tube can cause. Some women develop Post Tubal Ligation Syndrome after having the surgery performed. Those who lose a tube due to ectopic pregnancy are also at risk of developing PTLS. Symptoms of it include:  Irritable mood  Night sweats  Hot flashes  Menstrual cramps  Spotting  Mood lability  Pregnancy on Purpose W omen who are actually hoping to get pregnant after they’ve had a tubal ligation have a few options. Since the likelihood of the tubes fusing together on their own is so small, it isn’t recommended that women hold out hope for natural conception. However, reversal procedures are in place that can help women to conceive again after having their tubes tied. The reversal process involves a surgical procedure — once again under general anesthesia — that stitches the fallopian tubes back together. Reversal is more difficult if the tubes were burned, but it can still be accomplished by first snipping off the burnt ends before stitching them back together. Factors that complicate this procedure can include infection and the formation of scar tissue that could cause the fallopian tube to become blocked. If conception isn’t achieved within the first year of restoring the fallopian tubes intact, an HSG screening may be warranted to rule out any blockages or clear them out. The success of tubal ligation reversals is roughly 70 to 80 percent in the first year for women under 35 years old and around 30 percent for those over that age, per Attain Fertility . The cost of this procedure is approximately $7,900, according to Tubal Reversal . Some women may choose to bypass tubal ligation reversals altogether and opt for more extreme fertility measures. In vitro fertilization involves combining a woman’s eggs with a man’s sperm in test tube form and waiting for fertilization to occur. Monitoring this process in a laboratory environment allows for only fertilized embryos to be transferred into a woman’s uterus to attempt implantation. The success rate is roughly 20 to 40 percent per cycle, according to Resolve , but it comes at a much steeper price than tubal reversal does. The cost of just one round of IVF can be as much as $15,000, per Infertility Resource . Which path a woman chooses to become pregnant following a tubal ligation is an individual choice. She should weigh the pros and cons of both options with her partner and her doctor.

I had a c-section 6 months ago, and got my tubes tied at the same time. Well my periods went back to normal but I have a funny feeling that I am pg again maybe its just in my head but my monthly is due tomorrow and I have not had the normal symptoms that I am going to have my monthly. I am holding off on the pregnancy test until I defiantly miss my period.            a BabyCenter member   Asked 6/27/12         Answer this question        Mom Answers ( 26 )   Best answers   Most recent      BEST ANSWER   yes it is very possible i had my tubes tied in 2009 and i was pregnant 5 months later and had a tubal rupture they removed my left tube and ovary, then5 months later i was pregnant again and had a miscarriage, then 7 months later was pregnant again and had another miscarriage, now almost 3 years after my tubes ligation i am pregnant again and so far this one is a very pregnancy.                 greenprincess69    Answered 7/3/12                10 found this helpful     It is not as rare as people think, I know from experience. I also know that I often had &quot;symptoms&quot; and my cycle got all messed up. I would be early some months and late others. My best recommendation is to buy 100 cheapo tests on amazon, so anytime you wonder you can test before you stress.           a BabyCenter member   Answered 6/27/12               9 found this helpful     Can you get pregnant with your tubes tied           a BabyCenter member   Answered 5/2/17               7 found this helpful     It is quite rare these days, if your surgery was done correctly. You should find out as soon as you can, in case it is ectopic.           a BabyCenter member   Answered 6/27/12               7 found this helpful     Studies have shown that tubal ligation (tying of the fallopian tubes) is not a 100% guarantee of contraception. There&#39;s still at least a 1% chance of getting pregnant after your tubes are tied. This risk then increases to about 1.8% after 10 years. It has also been noted that most pregnancies occurring after ligation are ectopic in nature, meaning that the pregnancy occurs at the fallopian tube instead of the uterus. I would highly suggest you this method from http://mommyrainbow.com that can help you to get pregnant with your tubes tied.           a BabyCenter member   Answered 4/15/15               6 found this helpful     *healthy                 greenprincess69    Answered 7/3/12               5 found this helpful     Unfortunately the only way to know is by waiting it out after you miss your period. I would think it's somewhat rare, but I know it's possible, because I know someone that got pregs after having her tubes tied. : )                 jacobsmom45    Answered 6/27/12               5 found this helpful     I had my tubes cut and cauterized after a c section after having my fourth baby. Would it still be possible for me to get pregnant? That would be so bad, my uterus almost ruptured this last pregnancy. I am still producing milk, though.

Asked by Sherry, Illinois   Is it possible for a woman to still get pregnant after having her tubes tied?       Living Well Expert  Dr. Jennifer Shu Pediatrician, Children's Medical Group  Expert Answer:  There is a very small chance of becoming pregnant after having fallopian tube sterilization. More than 1 million women have the procedure each year, and according to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the risk of getting pregnant is less than 1 percent.  Tubal sterilization aims to prevent pregnancy by blocking an egg and sperm from meeting in the fallopian tube. The procedure may include either cutting and removing a portion of the tubes, using an electric current to burn (cauterize) part of the tubes, sealing off the tubes with a ring or clip, or inserting an implant that creates scar tissue that  will eventually block the tubes.  Depending on the type of procedure used, the sterilization may be effective right away or may take a few months to work. Sometimes, a special X-ray test called a hysteropsalpingogram must be performed to make sure the tubes are completely blocked.  If a pregnancy does occur following tubal sterilization, it is more likely to happen if the clip method was used. The risk is also higher in women who had the sterilization done before the age of 30, as well as in women who had an implant placed but did not follow up with the X-ray test to confirm blockage of the tubes.  Pregnancies following tubal sterilization are often "ectopic," which means that the fertilized egg grows outside of the uterus, most commonly in a fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancies must be treated immediately to prevent harm to the pregnant woman, so it's important to consult with an obstetrician right away if you suspect a pregnancy following tubal sterilization.  Your obstetrician can talk with you in more detail about the risks and benefits of the different types of tubal sterilization, how soon the sterilization is expected to take effect, whether back-up birth control needs to be used for a short period after the procedure, and the chances of becoming pregnant afterward for your specific situation.

Newsletter Pregnancy After Tubal Ligation: Know the Symptoms Medically reviewed by Debra Rose Wilson, PhD, MSN, RN, IBCLC, AHN-BC, CHT on  June 22, 2017 — Written by Rachel Nall, RN, BSN, CCRN Risks Pregnancy symptoms Ectopic pregnancy symptoms Next steps Overview  Tubal ligation , also known as “getting your tubes tied,” is an option for women who no longer want to have children. This outpatient surgical procedure involves blocking or cutting the fallopian tubes . It prevents an egg that’s released from your ovary from traveling to your uterus , where the egg could typically be fertilized.  While tubal ligation is effective in preventing most pregnancies, it isn’t an absolute. An estimated 1 out of every 200 women will become pregnant after tubal ligation.  Tubal ligation can increase your risk of an ectopic pregnancy . This is where a fertilized egg implants in the fallopian tubes instead of traveling to the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy can turn into an emergency. It’s important to be aware of the symptoms.  Risks What's the risk of pregnancy after tubal ligation?  When a surgeon performs a tubal ligation, the fallopian tubes are banded, cut, sealed, or tied. Tubal ligation can result in pregnancy if the fallopian tubes grow back together after this process.  A woman is at greater risk of this occurring the younger she is when she has a tubal ligation. According to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , the rates of pregnancy after tubal ligation are:   5 percent in women younger than 28  2 percent in women between ages 28 and 33  1 percent in women older than 34   After a tubal ligation procedure, a woman may also discover she was already pregnant. This is because a fertilized egg may have already implanted in her uterus before her procedure. For this reason, many women opt for tubal ligation just after giving birth or just after a menstrual period, when the risk of pregnancy is lower.  Pregnancy symptoms Symptoms of pregnancy  If your fallopian tube has grown back together after tubal ligation, it’s possible you could have a full-term pregnancy. Some women also opt to have a tubal ligation reversal, where a doctor puts the fallopian tubes back together. This isn’t always effective for women who want to get pregnant, but it can be.  Symptoms associated with pregnancy include:   breast tenderness   food cravings  feeling sick when thinking about certain foods  missing a period   nausea , especially in the morning   unexplained fatigue  urinating more frequently    If you think you may be pregnant, you can take an at-home pregnancy test . These tests aren’t 100 percent reliable, especially early in your pregnancy. Your doctor can also perform a blood test or ultrasound to confirm a pregnancy.  Ectopic pregnancy symptoms Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy  Having previous pelvic surgery or tubal ligation can increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. This is also true if you use an intrauterine device (IUD) as a contraceptive method .  The symptoms associated with an ectopic pregnancy can initially look like a traditional pregnancy. For example, if you take a pregnancy test, it will be positive. But the fertilized egg isn’t implanted in a place where it can grow. As a result, the pregnancy can’t continue.  Besides traditional pregnancy symptoms, symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy can include:   abdominal pain  light vaginal bleeding   pelvic pain   pelvic pressure, especially during a bowel movement   These symptoms shouldn’t be ignored. An ectopic pregnancy can cause the fallopian tube to rupture, which can result in internal bleeding that leads to fainting and shock . Seek immediate medical treatment if you experience the following symptoms with an ectopic pregnancy:   feeling extremely lightheaded or passing out  severe pain in your stomach or pelvis  severe vaginal bleeding  shoulder pain    If your doctor determines that your pregnancy is ectopic at an early stage, they may prescribe a medication called methotrexate . This medication can stop the egg from growing further or causing bleeding. Your doctor will monitor your levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone associated with pregnancy.  If this method isn’t effective, surgery may be needed to remove the tissue. Your doctor will try to repair the fallopian tube. If that’s not possible, the fallopian tube will be removed.  Doctors treat a ruptured fallopian tube with surgery to repair or remove it. You may require blood products if you’ve lost a lot of blood. Your doctor will also monitor you for signs of infection, such as fever or difficulty maintaining normal blood pressure .  Next steps Next steps  While tubal ligation is a very effective contraception method, it doesn’t protect against pregnancy 100 percent of the time. It’s important to remember as well that the procedure doesn’t protect against sexually transmitted infections . If you and your partner aren’t monogamous, it’s important to use a condom each time you have sex.  Talk to your doctor if you’re concerned your tubal ligation won’t be effective. If you had your procedure at a young age or if it’s been more than a decade since you had your procedure, you could be at a small but increased risk of pregnancy. You and your partner can use other contraception options to reduce the risks. These could include a vasectomy (male sterilization) or condoms.

I had a c-section 6 months ago, and got my tubes tied at the same time. Well my periods went back to normal but I have a funny feeling that I am pg again maybe its just in my head but my monthly is due tomorrow and I have not had the normal symptoms that I am going to have my monthly. I am holding off on the pregnancy test until I defiantly miss my period.            a BabyCenter member   Asked 6/27/12         Answer this question        Mom Answers ( 26 )   Best answers   Most recent      BEST ANSWER   yes it is very possible i had my tubes tied in 2009 and i was pregnant 5 months later and had a tubal rupture they removed my left tube and ovary, then5 months later i was pregnant again and had a miscarriage, then 7 months later was pregnant again and had another miscarriage, now almost 3 years after my tubes ligation i am pregnant again and so far this one is a very pregnancy.                 greenprincess69    Answered 7/3/12                10 found this helpful     It is not as rare as people think, I know from experience. I also know that I often had &quot;symptoms&quot; and my cycle got all messed up. I would be early some months and late others. My best recommendation is to buy 100 cheapo tests on amazon, so anytime you wonder you can test before you stress.           a BabyCenter member   Answered 6/27/12               9 found this helpful     Can you get pregnant with your tubes tied           a BabyCenter member   Answered 5/2/17               7 found this helpful     It is quite rare these days, if your surgery was done correctly. You should find out as soon as you can, in case it is ectopic.           a BabyCenter member   Answered 6/27/12               7 found this helpful     Studies have shown that tubal ligation (tying of the fallopian tubes) is not a 100% guarantee of contraception. There&#39;s still at least a 1% chance of getting pregnant after your tubes are tied. This risk then increases to about 1.8% after 10 years. It has also been noted that most pregnancies occurring after ligation are ectopic in nature, meaning that the pregnancy occurs at the fallopian tube instead of the uterus. I would highly suggest you this method from http://mommyrainbow.com that can help you to get pregnant with your tubes tied.           a BabyCenter member   Answered 4/15/15               6 found this helpful     *healthy                 greenprincess69    Answered 7/3/12               5 found this helpful     Unfortunately the only way to know is by waiting it out after you miss your period. I would think it's somewhat rare, but I know it's possible, because I know someone that got pregs after having her tubes tied. : )                 jacobsmom45    Answered 6/27/12               5 found this helpful     I had my tubes cut and cauterized after a c section after having my fourth baby. Would it still be possible for me to get pregnant? That would be so bad, my uterus almost ruptured this last pregnancy. I am still producing milk, though.

LCamplese    Answered 11/8/08                130 found this helpful     The failure rate of tubal ligation is about 1 in 1000. Artificial insemination probably wont work. The best chance of pregnancy would be from in vitro fetilization because they retreive the egg directly from the ovary and place the embrio in the uterus, completely bypassing the fallopian tube.

I just wanted to settle down with the right woman. I finally meet the right woman. Her smile is so captivating and she is as beautiful as life itself. As we began spending time together I imagined her having my child but I did not think it was possible since she had a proceedure where her tubes were tied and cut 9 years ago. A few months ago she began to have all of the symptoms of being pregnant. No doctor would assist since she was sitll having her normal cycle. She even had one last week. We finally went to the ER and thought we would find a doctor who could help. The blood test and urine test was -. He then wanted to run all kinds of dangerous tests that could be harmful to a fetus. We signed out AMA and went home. I prayed and asked God to give us a sign. A few days later the baby started kicking like you would not believe! I hope she comes out looking like my wife!                 teddyg414    Answered 10/2/11               44 found this helpful     Actaully Yes That Can Happy !

Asked by Sherry, Illinois   Is it possible for a woman to still get pregnant after having her tubes tied?       Living Well Expert  Dr. Jennifer Shu Pediatrician, Children's Medical Group  Expert Answer:  There is a very small chance of becoming pregnant after having fallopian tube sterilization. More than 1 million women have the procedure each year, and according to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the risk of getting pregnant is less than 1 percent.  Tubal sterilization aims to prevent pregnancy by blocking an egg and sperm from meeting in the fallopian tube. The procedure may include either cutting and removing a portion of the tubes, using an electric current to burn (cauterize) part of the tubes, sealing off the tubes with a ring or clip, or inserting an implant that creates scar tissue that  will eventually block the tubes.  Depending on the type of procedure used, the sterilization may be effective right away or may take a few months to work. Sometimes, a special X-ray test called a hysteropsalpingogram must be performed to make sure the tubes are completely blocked.  If a pregnancy does occur following tubal sterilization, it is more likely to happen if the clip method was used. The risk is also higher in women who had the sterilization done before the age of 30, as well as in women who had an implant placed but did not follow up with the X-ray test to confirm blockage of the tubes.  Pregnancies following tubal sterilization are often "ectopic," which means that the fertilized egg grows outside of the uterus, most commonly in a fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancies must be treated immediately to prevent harm to the pregnant woman, so it's important to consult with an obstetrician right away if you suspect a pregnancy following tubal sterilization.  Your obstetrician can talk with you in more detail about the risks and benefits of the different types of tubal sterilization, how soon the sterilization is expected to take effect, whether back-up birth control needs to be used for a short period after the procedure, and the chances of becoming pregnant afterward for your specific situation.

Will it work for you? Is it worth going through the procedure? How much risk is there? After all, everyone has heard about rare cases in which a pregnancy after tubal ligation occurs. Whether you saw the statistics or know someone who experienced it first-hand, the thought of an unexpected pregnancy after getting your tubes tied can be terrifying.        The best antidote for fear and anxiety before making any final decisions about getting the procedure done, or to put your worries to rest after having gone through a tubal ligation, is information. Here are the 5 truths every woman should know about pregnancy after tubal ligation:    Pregnancy after tubal ligation is…    What does it mean to have a pregnancy after a tubal ligation? First, you must understand what a tubal ligation is. This surgical procedure is performed to cut, tie, clamp or band the fallopian tubes shut. As a result, it is impossible for the eggs in your ovaries to reach your uterus, where fertilization typically occurs.  A tubal ligation is a form of permanent birth control. So pregnancy after a tubal ligation, although highly uncommon, refers to the event when a woman still becomes pregnant after having undergone the procedure.    It is very uncommon    How typical is pregnancy after tubal ligation? Not very. But, it still happens. Official estimates show that within 10 years of having the procedure done, between 18 to 37 women out of 1,000 become pregnant. That means there’s about a 2 to 4% chance it might happen. In these cases, the woman’s tubes grow back together, making pregnancy possible again. But, it really depends on your age. The older you are, the lower your chances of pregnancy after tubal ligation. There’s only about a 1% chance for women age 34 and older.         Tubal ligation is not easily reversible    Although it’s possible to undergo surgery to reverse the procedure so that you can become pregnant after tubal ligation, it doesn’t always work. A reversal isn’t possible in all cases. It depends on how long ago you had the procedure done and how damaged your tubes are as a result.  Generally speaking, tubal ligation is permanent, meaning there’s no going back. If there’s any possibility that you may want to have another baby, don’t get a tubal ligation. Instead, use another non-permanent form of birth control.    It could have happened before the procedure    In some cases, women are pregnant when they go into tubal ligation surgery, which can be quite a surprise! Many women choose to have a tubal ligation done just after childbirth to eliminate this possibility. Another optimal time to have the surgery is just after a menstrual period.    It could be ectopic    One risk factor for ectopic pregnancy is having had your tubes tied. In this type of pregnancy, a fertilized egg begins to grow in one of the fallopian tubes instead of in the uterus. This dangerous situation can result in a ruptured tube and significant internal bleeding. Pregnancy after tubal ligation is more likely to be ectopic than pregnancies in women who haven’t had the procedure done.  As you can see, a tubal ligation is an effective permanent form of birth control that leaves a minimal possibility for a pregnancy afterward. Yes, there are some cases that crop up. But, for most women, the risk is very low.        Just to be sure, if you have had the procedure or will have it soon, you should know the signs of pregnancy after tubal ligation. That way, if you experience any symptoms, you can seek medical attention as soon as possible.  Symptoms of Pregnancy After Tubal Ligation  Pregnancy after tubal ligation results in the same symptoms that any pregnancy brings. However, you should also be aware of the signs of ectopic pregnancies which are more common following a tubal ligation. Here’s what to look for:     Vaginal Discharge: Implantation can cause light spotting and cramping. You may think it’s the start of your period, but if your full period never comes, it could be the sign that tips you off.   Tender Breasts: The hormonal changes associated with early pregnancy may result in pain or tenderness, swollenness, or other changes in the breasts.   Tiredness: Hormones are to blame again! Changes in hormones may cause you to experience fatigue, even within a week after conceiving.   Morning Sickness: While not all women experience this symptom, it is a tell-tale sign of pregnancy. Nausea can happen at any time of the day, although the morning is often the worst. Cravings and food aversions are other related symptoms common in early pregnancy.   Missed Period: If you miss a period, you could be pregnant. But, you may have missed your period for another reason. The good news is after you’ve missed a period, you can take a home pregnancy test that’s likely to be accurate.    If you’re not sure, you can always take a home pregnancy test or see your gynecologist. That way, you’ll have peace of mind knowing whether or not you’re pregnant, and address any other medical issues that you may be experiencing.  Source  Ectopic Pregnancy Symptoms  After a tubal ligation, your risk of ectopic pregnancy is higher. In an ectopic pregnancy, you may experience the above symptoms, but may also notice:     Abnormal Bleeding: If you’re not expecting your period but have bleeding that’s light or heavy, it could be related to an ectopic pregnancy.   Pain: You may experience abdominal pain similar to cramps, or sharper pain. Pain can also be felt in your shoulder if a ruptured fallopian tube results in internal bleeding.   Dizziness: A loss of blood may leave you feeling dizzy, faint and/or weak.    An ectopic pregnancy requires immediate medical attention since the condition may be life-threatening. Surgery is often needed to remove the pregnancy and stop or prevent internal bleeding.  Remember, the risk of pregnancy after tubal ligation is low. So, if you experience symptoms, there’s most likely another explanation. In any case, it’s best to speak with your medical professional to ensure that you get to the bottom of it.  It’s also important to note that while tubal ligation can prevent pregnancies, it doesn’t protect against sexually transmitted illnesses (STIs). If you have sex with a non-monogamous or new partner, be sure to use a condom until you can both be tested for STIs.  Source  The Bottom Line on Pregnancy After Tubal Ligation  Tubal ligation is one of the most effective methods of permanent birth control. Especially if you’re over the age of 34 and have the procedure done following childbirth, it’s doubtful that you’ll get pregnant after a tubal ligation.  This form of birth control is also complicated to reverse. If you are young or have even the slightest question in your mind about getting pregnant in the future, choose another form of birth control. There are many options out there; make sure you find the one that’s right for you.  Do you have an experience or comment to share about pregnancy after tubal ligation?

This outpatient surgical procedure involves blocking or cutting the fallopian tubes . It prevents an egg that’s released from your ovary from traveling to your uterus , where the egg could typically be fertilized.  While tubal ligation is effective in preventing most pregnancies, it isn’t an absolute. An estimated 1 out of every 200 women will become pregnant after tubal ligation.  Tubal ligation can increase your risk of an ectopic pregnancy . This is where a fertilized egg implants in the fallopian tubes instead of traveling to the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy can turn into an emergency. It’s important to be aware of the symptoms.  Risks What's the risk of pregnancy after tubal ligation?  When a surgeon performs a tubal ligation, the fallopian tubes are banded, cut, sealed, or tied. Tubal ligation can result in pregnancy if the fallopian tubes grow back together after this process.  A woman is at greater risk of this occurring the younger she is when she has a tubal ligation. According to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , the rates of pregnancy after tubal ligation are:   5 percent in women younger than 28  2 percent in women between ages 28 and 33  1 percent in women older than 34   After a tubal ligation procedure, a woman may also discover she was already pregnant. This is because a fertilized egg may have already implanted in her uterus before her procedure. For this reason, many women opt for tubal ligation just after giving birth or just after a menstrual period, when the risk of pregnancy is lower.  Pregnancy symptoms Symptoms of pregnancy  If your fallopian tube has grown back together after tubal ligation, it’s possible you could have a full-term pregnancy. Some women also opt to have a tubal ligation reversal, where a doctor puts the fallopian tubes back together. This isn’t always effective for women who want to get pregnant, but it can be.  Symptoms associated with pregnancy include:   breast tenderness   food cravings  feeling sick when thinking about certain foods  missing a period   nausea , especially in the morning   unexplained fatigue  urinating more frequently    If you think you may be pregnant, you can take an at-home pregnancy test . These tests aren’t 100 percent reliable, especially early in your pregnancy. Your doctor can also perform a blood test or ultrasound to confirm a pregnancy.  Ectopic pregnancy symptoms Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy  Having previous pelvic surgery or tubal ligation can increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. This is also true if you use an intrauterine device (IUD) as a contraceptive method .  The symptoms associated with an ectopic pregnancy can initially look like a traditional pregnancy. For example, if you take a pregnancy test, it will be positive. But the fertilized egg isn’t implanted in a place where it can grow. As a result, the pregnancy can’t continue.  Besides traditional pregnancy symptoms, symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy can include:   abdominal pain  light vaginal bleeding   pelvic pain   pelvic pressure, especially during a bowel movement   These symptoms shouldn’t be ignored. An ectopic pregnancy can cause the fallopian tube to rupture, which can result in internal bleeding that leads to fainting and shock . Seek immediate medical treatment if you experience the following symptoms with an ectopic pregnancy:   feeling extremely lightheaded or passing out  severe pain in your stomach or pelvis  severe vaginal bleeding  shoulder pain    If your doctor determines that your pregnancy is ectopic at an early stage, they may prescribe a medication called methotrexate . This medication can stop the egg from growing further or causing bleeding. Your doctor will monitor your levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone associated with pregnancy.  If this method isn’t effective, surgery may be needed to remove the tissue. Your doctor will try to repair the fallopian tube. If that’s not possible, the fallopian tube will be removed.  Doctors treat a ruptured fallopian tube with surgery to repair or remove it. You may require blood products if you’ve lost a lot of blood. Your doctor will also monitor you for signs of infection, such as fever or difficulty maintaining normal blood pressure .  Next steps Next steps  While tubal ligation is a very effective contraception method, it doesn’t protect against pregnancy 100 percent of the time. It’s important to remember as well that the procedure doesn’t protect against sexually transmitted infections . If you and your partner aren’t monogamous, it’s important to use a condom each time you have sex.  Talk to your doctor if you’re concerned your tubal ligation won’t be effective. If you had your procedure at a young age or if it’s been more than a decade since you had your procedure, you could be at a small but increased risk of pregnancy. You and your partner can use other contraception options to reduce the risks. These could include a vasectomy (male sterilization) or condoms.

A: Having your tubes tied (or getting a bilateral tubal ligation) is one of the most effective methods of female sterilization.  It is 99.9% effective.  It is not 100% effective.  In fact, nothing is....except abstinence.  So, although getting pregnant after having your tubes tied is highly unlikely, it is possible.  If you feel like you may be pregnant, the easiest thing to do is to take an over-the-counter home pregnancy test.  The more likely explanation is that your periods are changing, as many of ours do after childbirth and as we age (although you are still very young!).  It may also be that something else is going on with your health, which could be affecting your body and your menstrual cycle.  Thyroid disease, for example, can cause fatigue, mood changes, weight loss or weight gain, and changes in a woman's menstrual cycle.  If you aren't pregnant and your symptoms continue, I recommend having a consultation with your OBGYN.

It is sometimes referred to as “having your tubes tied.” Tubal ligation is a surgical procedure that blocks the fallopian (fuh-LOPE-ee-in) tubes. The fallopian tubes normally carry the woman’s egg from the ovary to the uterus. Blocking the tubes stops the man’s sperm from reaching and fertilizing the woman’s egg. How is tubal ligation done? During tubal ligation surgery, the fallopian tubes are either cut, tied, banded, or sealed. All of these are considered to be permanent. A tubal ligation may be reversed, but it is not recommended. Most insurance plans do not cover a tubal reversal. It is expensive. How effective is tubal ligation?  Tubal ligation is one of the most effective methods of birth control. In general, about 95 out of every 100 women who get their tubes tied will never become pregnant.  But in some cases the tube(s) may grow back together, making pregnancy possible. The risk of pregnancy is higher in women who have a tubal ligation at a young age.  The risk of pregnancy in the 10 years after a tubal ligation is as follows:  Women who are younger than 28 years old: 5 percent  Women between 28 and 33 years old: 2 percent  Women 34 years and older: 1 percent  The risk is lower if the tubal ligation is done just after giving birth. If you get pregnant after tubal ligation, the fertilized egg may be in the fallopian tube instead of in the uterus. This abnormal pregnancy is called a tubal or an ectopic (eck-TOP-ik) pregnancy. You may need to have surgery to remove the pregnancy from the tube.  When can tubal ligation be done?  Tubal ligation can be done within 24 hours after having a baby. A small cut (incision) is made below the navel. The tubes are then cut and tied. The procedure requires anesthesia.  If you have a cesarean birth, the tubal ligation is done during the cesarean section. This way no other incisions are made.  Tubal ligation done at a time other than after having a baby is usually done using a laparoscope (LAP-er-uh-skope). This method is done under anesthesia. It requires 2 small incisions — one below the navel and one just above the pubic bone. Most tubal ligations can be done as outpatient surgery.  Complications  Complications of tubal ligation are rare. They include:  Bleeding  Infection  Damage to other organs  Risks of anesthesia  There is some discomfort for a few days after tubal ligation, but it can be controlled with medicine.  Take time to make the decision  A tubal ligation is considered to be a permanent method of birth control. Take some time to carefully consider if this method is right for you.  Use condoms the right way  A tubal ligation will help prevent pregnancy, but it won’t protect you against STIs (sexually transmitted infections). To protect against STIs, use condoms the right way.  Except for not having sex (abstinence), latex condoms give the best protection from many STIs, including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Condoms are helpful only if used the right way. Use a latex condom every time you have sex. Always put the condom on before the penis touches or enters the vagina. If you or your partner has an allergy to latex, you should use a plastic (polyurethane) condom.  Important steps for using condoms the right way:  Open the package carefully.  Hold the condom by the last inch at the tip and squeeze out the air.  If the penis is uncircumcised, pull back the foreskin.  Place the condom on the tip of the penis.  Unroll the condom to the base of the penis. Smooth out any extra air.  If you want or need to use lubricant on the condom, use only water-based lubricants like KY Jelly or Surgilube. Do not use oil-based lubricants. They can weaken condoms and cause them to break. Do not use petroleum jelly, cooking or vegetable oil, mineral or baby oil, massage oil, butter or margarine, oil-based creams, or lotions.  Immediately after ejaculation, hold the condom firmly by the rim at the base of the penis. Pull the penis and condom out of the vagina together while the penis is still erect.  Look carefully at the condom to see if there is a hole in the condom. If you are not sure, fill the condom with water to see if it leaks.  Discard the condom. Wrap it in tissue and throw it away. Do not flush it down the toilet.  Never re-use a condom.

Some of them end up on television shows because they were oblivious to the fact that they were pregnant while assuming it was impossible. It’s not. Women get their tubes tied pretty routinely in this country and many of them end up pregnant afterward.In some cases, the pregnancy won’t be viable. In other cases, women are likely not prepared for the pregnancy that they are blessed with. Regardless, it’s a situation anyone with a uterus can find themselves in — sterilized or not.

The most traditional method involves cutting the tubes and tying them in knots. In some cases, doctors will now use a cauterizing tool to burn the snipped ends so that they cannot easily fuse back together. Tubal ligation can typically be performed on an outpatient basis, but general anesthesia is still required. The process might be done via the cervix with a long tool fitted with a camera on the end; this is known as a hysteroscopic tubal ligation. Other doctors may prefer to complete the tubal ligation laparoscopically via small incisions made in the wall of the abdomen. [Read more about Tubal Ligation] Rates of Efficacy Source: https://www.drugs.com T he effectiveness of a tubal ligation is actually better the more time passes. Some people think it should be the other way around, but it starts out poorer and increases as time goes by since the likelihood that the tubes will fuse back together and overall fertility both decrease with age . In the first ten years following the surgery, the efficacy of a tubal ligation is estimated by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center as being roughly 95 percent in women under 28 years old, 98 percent in women aged 28 to 33, and 99 percent in women aged 34 and older. Pregnancy After a Tubal M ost people would wonder how a pregnancy could be possible after a tubal ligation is performed. The short answer is that the tubal manages to undo itself. Sometimes the tubes actually find one another again. The body is constantly trying to repair itself from injury and that is how it views tubal ligation — as an attack on itself. Given the opportunity, the amazing human body will attempt to fuse those tubes back together. If successful, the woman would likely never know unless she gets pregnant. It is more likely that this will happen in younger women than older. [Read more about Pregnancy After Tubal] Ectopic Pregnancies Source: https://www.epainassist.com I n other circumstances, a pregnancy may occur outside of the uterus and implant itself elsewhere. The most common site for this in the case of women who have had tubal ligations is in the actual tube itself. The sperm manages to make its way to fertilize the egg and it resides inside a fallopian tube . These pregnancies are known as ectopic pregnancies. They are never viable since a baby cannot possibly grow and develop inside a fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancies are very risky to the health of the mother, too; they can be fatal in some cases. The end result could also cost the woman her tube. While this isn’t a major concern to most women who have already had a tubal ligation and decided they don’t want any (more) children, the situation is further complicated should they ever change their mind on that. Tubal reversals actually have pretty impressive efficacy rates. However, women who have lost a tube will have impaired fertility. Losing a Tube E ctopic pregnancies must be surgically removed. Sometimes the tube must be removed with the ectopic pregnancy if the pregnancy has progressed too much. Even if fertility isn’t a concern, women who lose a tube due to ectopic pregnancy after a tubal ligation will see some side effects from it. They may have irregular periods following the loss. This is because the ovaries take turns releasing eggs month after month. Most people think they switch on and off equally taking turns, but this isn’t quite true. Nonetheless, if a tube is lost, then eggs may not make it out each month. This means periods will no longer happen every month. This may sound like a dream to most women, but the period has a purpose and it involves more than fertility . That regular bleeding cycle is necessary for women to maintain optimal health. The decline of hormones is actually the same time in a woman’s life that her overall health starts to decline, too. Skipping periods means the uterus has to wait longer between cycles to shed its lining. As estrogen causes it to keep thickening each cycle before shedding, women may find that their periods are heavier after the loss of a tube. In addition, they may develop PMS symptoms that they didn’t have before, like cramps and backaches. Some women may even develop Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder as a result of the hormonal upset the loss of a tube can cause. Some women develop Post Tubal Ligation Syndrome after having the surgery performed. Those who lose a tube due to ectopic pregnancy are also at risk of developing PTLS. Symptoms of it include:  Irritable mood  Night sweats  Hot flashes  Menstrual cramps  Spotting  Mood lability  Pregnancy on Purpose W omen who are actually hoping to get pregnant after they’ve had a tubal ligation have a few options. Since the likelihood of the tubes fusing together on their own is so small, it isn’t recommended that women hold out hope for natural conception. However, reversal procedures are in place that can help women to conceive again after having their tubes tied. The reversal process involves a surgical procedure — once again under general anesthesia — that stitches the fallopian tubes back together. Reversal is more difficult if the tubes were burned, but it can still be accomplished by first snipping off the burnt ends before stitching them back together. Factors that complicate this procedure can include infection and the formation of scar tissue that could cause the fallopian tube to become blocked. If conception isn’t achieved within the first year of restoring the fallopian tubes intact, an HSG screening may be warranted to rule out any blockages or clear them out. The success of tubal ligation reversals is roughly 70 to 80 percent in the first year for women under 35 years old and around 30 percent for those over that age, per Attain Fertility . The cost of this procedure is approximately $7,900, according to Tubal Reversal . Some women may choose to bypass tubal ligation reversals altogether and opt for more extreme fertility measures. In vitro fertilization involves combining a woman’s eggs with a man’s sperm in test tube form and waiting for fertilization to occur. Monitoring this process in a laboratory environment allows for only fertilized embryos to be transferred into a woman’s uterus to attempt implantation. The success rate is roughly 20 to 40 percent per cycle, according to Resolve , but it comes at a much steeper price than tubal reversal does. The cost of just one round of IVF can be as much as $15,000, per Infertility Resource . Which path a woman chooses to become pregnant following a tubal ligation is an individual choice. She should weigh the pros and cons of both options with her partner and her doctor.
