We were to assume that drawing cards are independent events. We were asked what the probability that the second card drawn is a queen if we take two from the deck. The answer given was 4/52, which seems counter-intuitive to me. How is the probability still 4/52 if there was a card drawn before it? What if the first card drawn was a queen?    probability     share | cite | improve this question     asked May 18 '15 at 4:37       Ampage Green   394 1 4 10              5      If you are assuming that the drawing of cards are independent events, then it must be a drawing with replacement. – nathan.j.mcdougall  May 18 '15 at 4:39         55      It's a red herring.  The first and second cards are not independent, but it doesn't matter because you don't care about the first card at all.  Taking two cards and looking only at the second is just a fancy way of drawing one card from the deck. – Robert Israel  May 18 '15 at 4:48        8      "What if the first card drawn was a queen?" -- and what if the first card wasn't a queen? Now calculate the probability that either (first card is queen and second card  is queen) or (first card is not queen and second card is queen). Not that this calculation helps with the intuition, but it should give you the correct answer. – Steve Jessop  May 18 '15 at 9:39         2      Let $E_1,E_2,E_3,\dots,E_{11},E_{12},E_{13}$ be the events: second card drawn is A, 2, 3, . . ., jack, queen, king. As those $13$ events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, their probabilities add up to one: $P(E_1)+P(E_2)+\cdots+P(E_{12})+P(E_{13})=1$. Now, if you can only manage to convince yourself that those probabilities are all equal, you can deduce that $P(E_{12})=\frac1{13}.$ Well, which do you think is more likely, getting a queen or getting a jack on the second draw? – bof  May 18 '15 at 9:39         7      As with the Monty Hall problem, it's useful to extend the logic to the extreme. What if you take 51 cards and then the last card? What's the chance that the last card is a queen? In general, what's the chance p(N) that the N'th card is a queen? Obviously after 52 cards you must have had 4 queens to the chances better add up to 4.0. If the chance p(N) would decrease with N, p(1) would be the biggest and p(52) the smallest, so p(0) must be greater than 1/13 ! – MSalters  May 18 '15 at 15:38        |  show 5 more comments          15 Answers 15     active  oldest  votes            up vote  63  down vote  accepted      There are two cases here:  Case 1: First card chosen is a queen  $$\frac{4}{52}*\frac{3}{51}=\frac{1}{221}$$  Case 2: First card chosen is not a queen.  $$\frac{48}{52}*\frac{4}{51}=\frac{16}{221}$$  Adding both the cases, we get $\frac{17}{221}$ = $\frac{4}{52}$ = $\frac{1}{13}$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 18 '15 at 5:02       marwalix   12.7k 1 21 36        answered May 18 '15 at 4:41       A.J.

The point of this answer is to get the reader to understand that in the absence of any information about the first card drawn, the second card drawn has an equal chance of being any card in the deck, just as in a shuffled deck the second card in the deck has an equal chance of being any card. – Hammerite  May 18 '15 at 11:06        3      This is a good way of looking at it. The probability of any card in the deck being a queen is 4/52. The probability over a high enough number of runs doesn't change after drawing any number of other cards first. If you add the probabilities of all the cards in the deck you get 4 which is obviously correct because there are four queens in the pack! What is confusing is that when you draw a card and look at it, you forget that there was the other possibility. – CJ Dennis  May 18 '15 at 12:11        add a comment |             up vote  32  down vote      A slightly more intuitive way of looking at this:  The probability that the second card is a queen should be the same as the probability that the second card is an ace, and the same as the probability that the second card is a 2 etc. There are $ 13 $ possibilities for the card number/letter, so the answer is $ \frac{1}{13} $     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 12:45       Esteemator   1,075 7 12              3      This is the cleverest answer I have seen to this question.

If the first card is an ace, then it is less likely that the 2nd card is an ace versus any other card. – Tony Ennis  May 18 '15 at 22:55        1      @TonyEnnis Look at this: there's same number of aces (namely four) as queens, and shuffling makes no preference to one or the other. So the probability of getting each is the same. Similary the probability of getting any chosen value (4, 10 or King alike) at any pre-selected position (be it second or eleventh, or first or fifty-second) is the same. So for 13 possible values it is... what Cliff said. – CiaPan  May 19 '15 at 8:44        1      @Tony - If the first card is an ace, then it is less likely that the 2nd card is an ace. From a card player's perspective, that's true. But, what happens when the first card is not an ace? Then, it is more likely that the second card is an ace. 1/13th of the time the probability will go down, while 12/13ths of the time the probability will go up. In the end, the numbers cancel out, and we're back to 1/13th. A.J.'s answer has the actual values. – J.R.

You're interested in the probability that card B is a queen.  Now consider a different experiment: draw a pair of cards as before, but this time call the first one card B, and the second one card A. I claim that these two experiments are identical. The reason is that for any two cards X,Y, the probability to draw X then Y is the same as the probability to draw Y then X.  The second experiment makes it clear that the probability that card B is a queen is 4/52, since there are 4 queens out of 52 cards.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 5:14       Yuval Filmus   46.7k 3 67 140                  This is good.

Let's try a more feeling-based approach:   Take a deck of cards  Shuffle the cards  Flip over the second card of the deck and check if it is a queen, while leaving the first card on the deck   Perhaps you can see how the chance is the exact same ($\frac{4}{52}$) if you had picked the top card instead of the second to top. Chance, after all, does not play favorites between the two cards.  Then, consider the following set of actions:   Take a deck of cards  Shuffle the cards  Draw the first card  Draw the second card and check if it is a queen   Now, you should be able to see that the chances for the two cases are the exact same. After you shuffle the deck, it doesn't matter if you draw two cards and check the second or you just check the second card without looking at the first; if the second card is a queen, it's a queen, if it's not, it's not.  The flip side of the feeling-based approach is the math to back it up. Let's start with the simple case: you have 52 cards, and want a queen on the second draw. (This has also been done by other answers, but I'll repeat it here.)  You draw a queen on the second draw if:   You draw a queen on the first draw and one on the second
$$\frac{4}{52}*\frac{3}{51}=\frac{12}{2652}=\frac{1}{221}$$  You draw something other than a queen on the first draw and a queen on the second
$$\frac{48}{52}*\frac{4}{51}=\frac{192}{2652}=\frac{16}{221}$$   So in total, the chance is:  $$\frac{1}{221}+\frac{16}{221}=\frac{17}{221}=\frac{4}{52}$$  Now, let's up the ante a little bit. Rather than wanting to know something about queens in a complete deck, I want to know about the more general case. I have a pile of $n$ shuffled cards. In that pile, I know there are $p$ cards that I "like". What I want to know is: what is the chance I draw a card I like.  For the first card, it's simple. The chance simply is $\frac{p}{n}$.  For the second card, we once again have two options:   I like both the first and second card
$$\frac{p}{n}*\frac{p-1}{n-1}=\frac{p^2-p}{n^2-n}$$  I like the second card, but not the first
$$\frac{n - p}{n}*\frac{p}{n-1}=\frac{pn-p^2}{n^2-n}$$   Adding the two, you get:  $$\frac{p^2-p}{n^2-n}+\frac{pn-p^2}{n^2-n}=\frac{p^2+pn-p^2-p}{n^2-n}=\frac{pn-p}{n^2-n}$$  Moving things around a bit more:  $$\frac{pn-p}{n^2-n}=\frac{p(n-1)}{n(n-1)}=\frac{p}{n}$$  Which is the same as the chances for the first card. So, now I can say that no matter the deck size or the amount of cards that represent "success", it doesn't matter if I look to the first or second card to determine success. (Of course, if I look at the second card, it's important that I don't care what the first card is at all.)  I could actually repeat the experiment for each different card in the deck, and then I could draw the conclusion that in general: it doesn't matter if I look at the first or second card, the chances for the card to be a specific one are equal.  The next step could be to proof that the the other cards (third, fourth, etc) have the same chance as well, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.  Disclaimer: my proof probably isn't elegant, optimal or nice, but I do believe it to be correct.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '15 at 15:17             answered May 18 '15 at 15:21       Jasper   181 3                  As pointed out by user CiaPan, a simpler way to proceed after "Moving things around a bit more:" is $\dfrac{pn-p}{n^2 - n} = \dfrac{p(n-1)}{n(n-1)} = \dfrac{p}{n}$. – epimorphic  May 19 '15 at 13:38             To CiaPan: Simplifications are probably best communicated in the comments, given the prohibition against "drastic" edits to non-CW posts authored by others and given that one of the purposes of comments is to "suggest improvements".

If we observed that the first card drawn was a queen, then that would give us a lowered probability of the second card being a queen of $3/51$. However, this is not the same probability as the one asked of in the problem, but the conditional probability given the first card being a queen.  If we instead had had the first card not be a queen, then the conditional probability would have been heightened to $4/51$. The prior probability could then be calculated using the probability of both cases as $$\frac{4}{52}\cdot\frac{3}{51}+\frac{48}{52}\cdot\frac{4}{51}=\frac{4}{52}$$  However, the problem can be simplified as what is important isn't the drawing of the card from the deck, but the observation of the value of the card.  As the value of the first card is never considered in the problem, it can simply be considered as not being drawn at all, which brings us to a second point; If instead of drawing two cards from the deck, you simply fanned out the cards and drew the second card from the top, you would still get the same probabilities as if you chose the top card.  In fact, you would get the same probabilities even if you chose the tenth card or even a card at random. There is nothing special about the top card of the deck unless you choose to do something with it.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 19 '15 at 19:00       PassingStranger   171 3              add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      Consider a more complete event:  When drawing all 52 cards, what is the probability that the second card is a queen?  The reason of changing the original question to this is because this is an expanded process, in other words, if you do draw all cards you certainly drop the first two ones. To solve the new problem is not difficult. One way is to consider every card of the 52 has an equal chance be at the second place. So the probability is 4/52.  It is equal to the same probability that the first card, the 3rd card or the 27th card etc. is a queen, or any other type of card.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 9:02       Serena973   31 2                  If the first card you draw is a queen than the second has a different probability. – hownowbrowncow  May 18 '15 at 13:06            @hownowbrowncow - how, now? – GalacticCowboy  May 18 '15 at 14:13            @GalacticCowboy because then there would be 3 queens within the deck :D – hownowbrowncow  May 18 '15 at 14:21        1      @David  The author didn't specify that one would replace the drawn card back into the deck and therefore, I would assume, one would not.  Thus changing the probability with each additional drawing of a card (the second draw would also have 51 cards within the deck, btw).  Perhaps there is replacement and perfect shuffling after every draw then it's 4/52 all the way down the line. – hownowbrowncow  May 18 '15 at 14:27         1      @hownowbrowncow - A.J.'s answer demonstrates that, even if you consider the first card, the overall probability of card #2 being a queen is still the same. – GalacticCowboy  May 18 '15 at 14:31        |  show 1 more comment            up vote  3  down vote      2 things to consider.  What if the problem stated draw all cards and what is the probability that the last card drawn is a queen then what would your answer be? You might think it is close to 0 because in 51 cards drawn, there is a very good chance that all queens would be already drawn by then.  However, the answer should still be 4/52 because there are 4 queens in the deck and each has an equal chance of being the last card drawn just as all the other cards have.  Also, if you notice on TV when they have Texas Hold 'em, they "waste" the top card when drawing community cards (turn, river...) so if that changed the probability, it would likely be disallowed.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 11:46       David   318 8 30              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      Imagine you buy a ticket in a lottery, where a fraction $p$ of the tickets will win. (From the comments I gather that there are some people who are confused by all kinds of newfangled games with different rules, such as being able to compose the number on one's own ticket; I therefore emphasise this is just an old fashioned lottery with a fixed set of tickets established beforehand, all distinct and all sold before the drawing; drawing then determines a subset of the tickets as winners, with the size of that subset being $p$ times the total number of tickets.) What is your chance of winning? It would be hard to argue that it is anything other then $p$.  But now let us add that before buying a ticket, you had to wait in line, and you happen to notice that the person before you also bought a ticket for the same lottery. Of course you don't know whether her ticket will win, but what is the chance that your ticket will win? It is still $p$. But what if her ticket actually wins? Well with that new information your chances will no doubt be less, but you don't have that information. If her ticket actually looses, that will slightly improve your odds, but you don't know that either. In fact you can be sure that there are hundreds of people who also bought tickets, but as long as you know nothing about their results (and you won't until the winning lots are drawn), it will not affect your chances the slightest bit.  The situation you describe is entirely similar to this.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '15 at 12:28             answered May 18 '15 at 10:34       Marc van Leeuwen   83.1k 4 88 200                  Why would my chances of winning a lottery be less if I know the person in front of me in line already won?  Many lotteries share the jackpot if there are multiple winners.  In that case, my winnings will be reduced but not my chance of winning.  Also if that person loses it will not increase my chance of winning at all. The only exception is if I choose the same numbers as some other person in a lottery (such as 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30). Then if I know that person won then my chances of winning are likely affected (depending on the type of lottery).

For example, if people put their name on a piece of paper and place it into a container to be drawn.  It would depend if they fold it and how and also when they put it in the container since they may not be mixed well before being drawn.  I've actually seen this happen in real life where some last minute entry won because they were not mixed well and they just drew her name from the top. – David  May 18 '15 at 11:51            @David "Imagine you buy a ticket in a lottery, where a fraction p of the tickets will win." <-> "You didn't say a fixed fraction will win."

Obviously if I know another ticket that wins, that will decrease the chances that my ticket too is among the winners (in an extreme example there is only one winning ticket, and knowing another ticket wins ensures tha mine won't; but even if there are say 2 wins out of 100, then $\frac1{99}$ is worse than $p=\frac2{100}$). I don't know what kind of lottery you are thinking of that would not see my chances diminished by knowing a winner that is not my ticket. – Marc van Leeuwen  May 18 '15 at 12:55             @David: Re-reading what you wrote, I really cannot see what you are worrying about, you must have a strange idea of a lottery. It is not about writing anything on tickets, or putting them in a container, and there cannot be "identical" tickets. Tickets are simply a fixed known collection, say numbers $1$ to $n$, and when all are sold then some $k$ of these numbers are "drawn" (from a separate copy of those numbers) to be winning numbers. The chance of winning with one ticket is $p=\frac kn$. Also  I don't see what complaining about biased-ness in real-world lotteries has to do with this. – Marc van Leeuwen  May 18 '15 at 13:10         |  show 3 more comments            up vote  1  down vote      put the first card back in the deck; now you've only drawn one card. the chance it's queen 4/52     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 17:57       Thanos Tintinidis   257 1 5              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Can I convince you of this statement:  If I draw two cards, the probability that the first card is a queen is the same as the probability that the second card is a queen.

(whatever card is drawn , it should be put back in the stack) otherwise the second draw is dependent on the first draw.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '15 at 21:04       Willemien   3,351 2 17 57        answered May 18 '15 at 21:32       Scott   9 1              1      How is independence used in this question or answer? – JiK  May 19 '15 at 10:49        add a comment |             up vote  -3  down vote      This is basically the Monty Hall problem -- as long as you are talking in advance of the draw, the probability is unchanged, once you draw the odds adjust.  You have two goats and a car, if you open two doors, what is the chance that there is a goat behind the second door?  What is the chance it is a car? 2/3 and 1/3 respectively.  After you open the first door, and find that it is a car, you can say that there is zero chance that there is a car behind the second door.  But at that point, they are no longer independent events, which is why in the Monty Hall problem you always switch.  In this case you are effectively saying that the second card is a queen, and you are doing this before you know what the first card was . The chance that that is correct is 1/13.  It (the chance you were correct) will remain 1 in 13 until either the second card is revealed or the position of all queens have been determined, at which point it is not a matter of probability.  In both cases the odds of you having identified the card is unchanged, what changes is the current odds of that card being a queen (ie is this one of the 1 in 13 times where you were correct).  This is where people go wrong with the Monty Hall problem, they confuse the current odds of the car being behind the door with the odds that they correctly identified the door with the car.  In this instance the confusion is between having identified the card vs the card actually being.  Here's another way of looking at it.  Your odds of correctly predicting card 2 is 1 in 13.  So take 4 decks of cards, divide them into 13 rows by   suit (throwing away the 3 extra suits).  Then pick a value for the 2nd card in each row.  Now start randomly revealing cards until each row has been determined -- do you expect this random reveal to result in you having correctly guessed more than the expected 1 row?  Is it any different from just revealing the 2nd card of each row?  Now, suppose that someone who knows what the cards are does the reveal, revealing each card  until there are only 2 cards left per row -- when you do the final reveal for each row, how many rows would you expect to have guessed correctly?  Your chance of predicting the card in advance is 1 in 13 for each row, and it remains 1 in 13 -- revealing cards doesn't change the odds of your having guessed correctly. Your guess is in the past and is now fixed, forever unchanging .  Either it was right or it wasn't.   What changes (assuming random reveal) is my current odds of guessing whether you were right or not .  As with the related Deal Or No Deal game, I get additional information with each random reveal.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 5 '17 at 12:30             answered May 18 '15 at 15:04       jmoreno   341 1 6              2      You start by saying that this is basically the Monty Hall problem, and then you explain that the Monty Hall problem is different from this.

Now calculate the probability that either (first card is queen and second card  is queen) or (first card is not queen and second card is queen).

As those $13$ events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, their probabilities add up to one: $P(E_1)+P(E_2)+\cdots+P(E_{12})+P(E_{13})=1$. Now, if you can only manage to convince yourself that those probabilities are all equal, you can deduce that $P(E_{12})=\frac1{13}.$ Well, which do you think is more likely, getting a queen or getting a jack on the second draw? – bof  May 18 '15 at 9:39         7      As with the Monty Hall problem, it's useful to extend the logic to the extreme. What if you take 51 cards and then the last card? What's the chance that the last card is a queen? In general, what's the chance p(N) that the N'th card is a queen? Obviously after 52 cards you must have had 4 queens to the chances better add up to 4.0. If the chance p(N) would decrease with N, p(1) would be the biggest and p(52) the smallest, so p(0) must be greater than 1/13 ! – MSalters  May 18 '15 at 15:38        |  show 5 more comments          15 Answers 15     active  oldest  votes            up vote  63  down vote  accepted      There are two cases here:  Case 1: First card chosen is a queen  $$\frac{4}{52}*\frac{3}{51}=\frac{1}{221}$$  Case 2: First card chosen is not a queen.  $$\frac{48}{52}*\frac{4}{51}=\frac{16}{221}$$  Adding both the cases, we get $\frac{17}{221}$ = $\frac{4}{52}$ = $\frac{1}{13}$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 18 '15 at 5:02       marwalix   12.7k 1 21 36        answered May 18 '15 at 4:41       A.J.

The point of this answer is to get the reader to understand that in the absence of any information about the first card drawn, the second card drawn has an equal chance of being any card in the deck, just as in a shuffled deck the second card in the deck has an equal chance of being any card. – Hammerite  May 18 '15 at 11:06        3      This is a good way of looking at it. The probability of any card in the deck being a queen is 4/52. The probability over a high enough number of runs doesn't change after drawing any number of other cards first. If you add the probabilities of all the cards in the deck you get 4 which is obviously correct because there are four queens in the pack! What is confusing is that when you draw a card and look at it, you forget that there was the other possibility. – CJ Dennis  May 18 '15 at 12:11        add a comment |             up vote  32  down vote      A slightly more intuitive way of looking at this:  The probability that the second card is a queen should be the same as the probability that the second card is an ace, and the same as the probability that the second card is a 2 etc. There are $ 13 $ possibilities for the card number/letter, so the answer is $ \frac{1}{13} $     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 12:45       Esteemator   1,075 7 12              3      This is the cleverest answer I have seen to this question.

So the probability of getting each is the same. Similary the probability of getting any chosen value (4, 10 or King alike) at any pre-selected position (be it second or eleventh, or first or fifty-second) is the same. So for 13 possible values it is... what Cliff said. – CiaPan  May 19 '15 at 8:44        1      @Tony - If the first card is an ace, then it is less likely that the 2nd card is an ace. From a card player's perspective, that's true. But, what happens when the first card is not an ace? Then, it is more likely that the second card is an ace. 1/13th of the time the probability will go down, while 12/13ths of the time the probability will go up. In the end, the numbers cancel out, and we're back to 1/13th. A.J.'s answer has the actual values. – J.R.

You're interested in the probability that card B is a queen.  Now consider a different experiment: draw a pair of cards as before, but this time call the first one card B, and the second one card A. I claim that these two experiments are identical. The reason is that for any two cards X,Y, the probability to draw X then Y is the same as the probability to draw Y then X.  The second experiment makes it clear that the probability that card B is a queen is 4/52, since there are 4 queens out of 52 cards.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 5:14       Yuval Filmus   46.7k 3 67 140                  This is good.

Let's try a more feeling-based approach:   Take a deck of cards  Shuffle the cards  Flip over the second card of the deck and check if it is a queen, while leaving the first card on the deck   Perhaps you can see how the chance is the exact same ($\frac{4}{52}$) if you had picked the top card instead of the second to top. Chance, after all, does not play favorites between the two cards.  Then, consider the following set of actions:   Take a deck of cards  Shuffle the cards  Draw the first card  Draw the second card and check if it is a queen   Now, you should be able to see that the chances for the two cases are the exact same. After you shuffle the deck, it doesn't matter if you draw two cards and check the second or you just check the second card without looking at the first; if the second card is a queen, it's a queen, if it's not, it's not.  The flip side of the feeling-based approach is the math to back it up. Let's start with the simple case: you have 52 cards, and want a queen on the second draw. (This has also been done by other answers, but I'll repeat it here.)  You draw a queen on the second draw if:   You draw a queen on the first draw and one on the second
$$\frac{4}{52}*\frac{3}{51}=\frac{12}{2652}=\frac{1}{221}$$  You draw something other than a queen on the first draw and a queen on the second
$$\frac{48}{52}*\frac{4}{51}=\frac{192}{2652}=\frac{16}{221}$$   So in total, the chance is:  $$\frac{1}{221}+\frac{16}{221}=\frac{17}{221}=\frac{4}{52}$$  Now, let's up the ante a little bit. Rather than wanting to know something about queens in a complete deck, I want to know about the more general case. I have a pile of $n$ shuffled cards. In that pile, I know there are $p$ cards that I "like". What I want to know is: what is the chance I draw a card I like.  For the first card, it's simple. The chance simply is $\frac{p}{n}$.  For the second card, we once again have two options:   I like both the first and second card
$$\frac{p}{n}*\frac{p-1}{n-1}=\frac{p^2-p}{n^2-n}$$  I like the second card, but not the first
$$\frac{n - p}{n}*\frac{p}{n-1}=\frac{pn-p^2}{n^2-n}$$   Adding the two, you get:  $$\frac{p^2-p}{n^2-n}+\frac{pn-p^2}{n^2-n}=\frac{p^2+pn-p^2-p}{n^2-n}=\frac{pn-p}{n^2-n}$$  Moving things around a bit more:  $$\frac{pn-p}{n^2-n}=\frac{p(n-1)}{n(n-1)}=\frac{p}{n}$$  Which is the same as the chances for the first card. So, now I can say that no matter the deck size or the amount of cards that represent "success", it doesn't matter if I look to the first or second card to determine success. (Of course, if I look at the second card, it's important that I don't care what the first card is at all.)  I could actually repeat the experiment for each different card in the deck, and then I could draw the conclusion that in general: it doesn't matter if I look at the first or second card, the chances for the card to be a specific one are equal.  The next step could be to proof that the the other cards (third, fourth, etc) have the same chance as well, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.  Disclaimer: my proof probably isn't elegant, optimal or nice, but I do believe it to be correct.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '15 at 15:17             answered May 18 '15 at 15:21       Jasper   181 3                  As pointed out by user CiaPan, a simpler way to proceed after "Moving things around a bit more:" is $\dfrac{pn-p}{n^2 - n} = \dfrac{p(n-1)}{n(n-1)} = \dfrac{p}{n}$. – epimorphic  May 19 '15 at 13:38             To CiaPan: Simplifications are probably best communicated in the comments, given the prohibition against "drastic" edits to non-CW posts authored by others and given that one of the purposes of comments is to "suggest improvements".

If we observed that the first card drawn was a queen, then that would give us a lowered probability of the second card being a queen of $3/51$. However, this is not the same probability as the one asked of in the problem, but the conditional probability given the first card being a queen.  If we instead had had the first card not be a queen, then the conditional probability would have been heightened to $4/51$. The prior probability could then be calculated using the probability of both cases as $$\frac{4}{52}\cdot\frac{3}{51}+\frac{48}{52}\cdot\frac{4}{51}=\frac{4}{52}$$  However, the problem can be simplified as what is important isn't the drawing of the card from the deck, but the observation of the value of the card.  As the value of the first card is never considered in the problem, it can simply be considered as not being drawn at all, which brings us to a second point; If instead of drawing two cards from the deck, you simply fanned out the cards and drew the second card from the top, you would still get the same probabilities as if you chose the top card.  In fact, you would get the same probabilities even if you chose the tenth card or even a card at random. There is nothing special about the top card of the deck unless you choose to do something with it.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 19 '15 at 19:00       PassingStranger   171 3              add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      Consider a more complete event:  When drawing all 52 cards, what is the probability that the second card is a queen?  The reason of changing the original question to this is because this is an expanded process, in other words, if you do draw all cards you certainly drop the first two ones. To solve the new problem is not difficult. One way is to consider every card of the 52 has an equal chance be at the second place. So the probability is 4/52.  It is equal to the same probability that the first card, the 3rd card or the 27th card etc. is a queen, or any other type of card.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 9:02       Serena973   31 2                  If the first card you draw is a queen than the second has a different probability. – hownowbrowncow  May 18 '15 at 13:06            @hownowbrowncow - how, now? – GalacticCowboy  May 18 '15 at 14:13            @GalacticCowboy because then there would be 3 queens within the deck :D – hownowbrowncow  May 18 '15 at 14:21        1      @David  The author didn't specify that one would replace the drawn card back into the deck and therefore, I would assume, one would not.  Thus changing the probability with each additional drawing of a card (the second draw would also have 51 cards within the deck, btw).  Perhaps there is replacement and perfect shuffling after every draw then it's 4/52 all the way down the line. – hownowbrowncow  May 18 '15 at 14:27         1      @hownowbrowncow - A.J.'s answer demonstrates that, even if you consider the first card, the overall probability of card #2 being a queen is still the same. – GalacticCowboy  May 18 '15 at 14:31        |  show 1 more comment            up vote  3  down vote      2 things to consider.  What if the problem stated draw all cards and what is the probability that the last card drawn is a queen then what would your answer be? You might think it is close to 0 because in 51 cards drawn, there is a very good chance that all queens would be already drawn by then.  However, the answer should still be 4/52 because there are 4 queens in the deck and each has an equal chance of being the last card drawn just as all the other cards have.  Also, if you notice on TV when they have Texas Hold 'em, they "waste" the top card when drawing community cards (turn, river...) so if that changed the probability, it would likely be disallowed.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 11:46       David   318 8 30              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      Imagine you buy a ticket in a lottery, where a fraction $p$ of the tickets will win. (From the comments I gather that there are some people who are confused by all kinds of newfangled games with different rules, such as being able to compose the number on one's own ticket; I therefore emphasise this is just an old fashioned lottery with a fixed set of tickets established beforehand, all distinct and all sold before the drawing; drawing then determines a subset of the tickets as winners, with the size of that subset being $p$ times the total number of tickets.) What is your chance of winning? It would be hard to argue that it is anything other then $p$.  But now let us add that before buying a ticket, you had to wait in line, and you happen to notice that the person before you also bought a ticket for the same lottery. Of course you don't know whether her ticket will win, but what is the chance that your ticket will win? It is still $p$. But what if her ticket actually wins? Well with that new information your chances will no doubt be less, but you don't have that information. If her ticket actually looses, that will slightly improve your odds, but you don't know that either. In fact you can be sure that there are hundreds of people who also bought tickets, but as long as you know nothing about their results (and you won't until the winning lots are drawn), it will not affect your chances the slightest bit.  The situation you describe is entirely similar to this.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '15 at 12:28             answered May 18 '15 at 10:34       Marc van Leeuwen   83.1k 4 88 200                  Why would my chances of winning a lottery be less if I know the person in front of me in line already won?  Many lotteries share the jackpot if there are multiple winners.  In that case, my winnings will be reduced but not my chance of winning.  Also if that person loses it will not increase my chance of winning at all. The only exception is if I choose the same numbers as some other person in a lottery (such as 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30). Then if I know that person won then my chances of winning are likely affected (depending on the type of lottery).  You didn't say a fixed fraction will win. – David  May 18 '15 at 11:38             It wouldn't be p if the lottery/drawing is biased (which some are).  For example, if people put their name on a piece of paper and place it into a container to be drawn.  It would depend if they fold it and how and also when they put it in the container since they may not be mixed well before being drawn.  I've actually seen this happen in real life where some last minute entry won because they were not mixed well and they just drew her name from the top. – David  May 18 '15 at 11:51            @David "Imagine you buy a ticket in a lottery, where a fraction p of the tickets will win." <-> "You didn't say a fixed fraction will win." Please elaborate. – Alexander  May 18 '15 at 12:18            @David: I'm using a very simple lottery model, where all tickets are sold, and then a fraction $p$ is drawn as winning lots. Obviously if I know another ticket that wins, that will decrease the chances that my ticket too is among the winners (in an extreme example there is only one winning ticket, and knowing another ticket wins ensures tha mine won't; but even if there are say 2 wins out of 100, then $\frac1{99}$ is worse than $p=\frac2{100}$). I don't know what kind of lottery you are thinking of that would not see my chances diminished by knowing a winner that is not my ticket. – Marc van Leeuwen  May 18 '15 at 12:55             @David: Re-reading what you wrote, I really cannot see what you are worrying about, you must have a strange idea of a lottery. It is not about writing anything on tickets, or putting them in a container, and there cannot be "identical" tickets. Tickets are simply a fixed known collection, say numbers $1$ to $n$, and when all are sold then some $k$ of these numbers are "drawn" (from a separate copy of those numbers) to be winning numbers. The chance of winning with one ticket is $p=\frac kn$. Also  I don't see what complaining about biased-ness in real-world lotteries has to do with this. – Marc van Leeuwen  May 18 '15 at 13:10         |  show 3 more comments            up vote  1  down vote      put the first card back in the deck; now you've only drawn one card. the chance it's queen 4/52     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 17:57       Thanos Tintinidis   257 1 5              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Can I convince you of this statement:  If I draw two cards, the probability that the first card is a queen is the same as the probability that the second card is a queen.  If you believe this, then your question has the same probability as the following the situation:  What is the probability that, if I draw two cards, the first card is a queen?  It is clear now that the second card pull in this case has no effect on the first, just as how the first card pull has no effect on the second in your case.

You have two goats and a car, if you open two doors, what is the chance that there is a goat behind the second door?  What is the chance it is a car? 2/3 and 1/3 respectively.  After you open the first door, and find that it is a car, you can say that there is zero chance that there is a car behind the second door.  But at that point, they are no longer independent events, which is why in the Monty Hall problem you always switch.  In this case you are effectively saying that the second card is a queen, and you are doing this before you know what the first card was . The chance that that is correct is 1/13.  It (the chance you were correct) will remain 1 in 13 until either the second card is revealed or the position of all queens have been determined, at which point it is not a matter of probability.  In both cases the odds of you having identified the card is unchanged, what changes is the current odds of that card being a queen (ie is this one of the 1 in 13 times where you were correct).  This is where people go wrong with the Monty Hall problem, they confuse the current odds of the car being behind the door with the odds that they correctly identified the door with the car.  In this instance the confusion is between having identified the card vs the card actually being.  Here's another way of looking at it.  Your odds of correctly predicting card 2 is 1 in 13.  So take 4 decks of cards, divide them into 13 rows by   suit (throwing away the 3 extra suits).  Then pick a value for the 2nd card in each row.  Now start randomly revealing cards until each row has been determined -- do you expect this random reveal to result in you having correctly guessed more than the expected 1 row?  Is it any different from just revealing the 2nd card of each row?  Now, suppose that someone who knows what the cards are does the reveal, revealing each card  until there are only 2 cards left per row -- when you do the final reveal for each row, how many rows would you expect to have guessed correctly?  Your chance of predicting the card in advance is 1 in 13 for each row, and it remains 1 in 13 -- revealing cards doesn't change the odds of your having guessed correctly. Your guess is in the past and is now fixed, forever unchanging .  Either it was right or it wasn't.   What changes (assuming random reveal) is my current odds of guessing whether you were right or not .  As with the related Deal Or No Deal game, I get additional information with each random reveal.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 5 '17 at 12:30             answered May 18 '15 at 15:04       jmoreno   341 1 6              2      You start by saying that this is basically the Monty Hall problem, and then you explain that the Monty Hall problem is different from this.

Determine the probability $q$ of NOT getting a Queen of Spades?  The probability that the first card is not a Queen of Spades is $51/52$.  Now the deck has 51 cards. What is the probability that the second card is not a Queen of Spades?  Then $q=\frac{51}{52}\cdot ? \cdot ?$ and the answer to your question is $1-q$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Sep 29 '16 at 8:10             answered Sep 29 '16 at 8:02       Robert Z   72.3k 8 51 111                  @Jerry Lu Can you take it form here? – Robert Z  Sep 29 '16 at 8:12        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Just ask yourself the right questions.  As you note, the probability of drawing the Queen of Spades first is $\frac{1}{52}$.  The next question is: what is the probability of not drawing the Queen of Spades, and then drawing her next? It is $\frac{51}{52}\frac{1}{51}$. I leave it to you to do the calculation.  The next question is: what is the probability of not drawing the Queen of Spades, then not drawing the Queen of Spades, and then drawing her next? It is $\frac{51}{52}\frac{50}{51}\frac{1}{50}$. I leave it to you to do the calculation.  The answer to your question is therefore $\frac{1}{52}+\frac{1}{52}+\frac{1}{52}$.  (I think, though I am sure someone will correct me if I am wrong, that this is the principle of linearity of expectation at work. The expected number of Queens of Spades drawn in $n$ drawings is $n$ times the expected number of Queens of Spades drawn in one drawing - and this is true whether or not you put each card back into the pack after drawing it).     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 29 '16 at 8:10       Martin Kochanski   1,879 1 9              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Now, you have your four cases, in three of them (a2), (b1), (b2), there is at least one queen, the probability for each of them is the product of the first fraction and the second fraction, for example, the scenario a1 has this probability:  (52-4)/52  *  (51-4)/51 = 0.851 (approximate value)  If you have done everything right, you will also find that the sum of all possibilities is equal to 1.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 8 '16 at 4:25       user289661   217 1 12              add a comment |       Not the answer you're looking for?

It is randomly divided into two parts of 26 cards each. A card is selected from the first set, and it is found to be the Queen of Hearts. The Queen of Hearts is then placed into the second set and a card is randomly picked from that set. What is the probability that the selected card is a Queen?  Hint: define events F 0 , F 1 , F 2 , F 3 such that F i corresponds to the event that there are i queens initially placed in the second set.    probability     share | cite | improve this question     asked Oct 9 '12 at 22:46       user33195   1              add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  3  down vote      There's no need to distinguish those events. The remaining three queens are uniformly distributed among $51$ cards, so the probability of each of the cards originally in the second set to be a queen is $3/51=1/17$. You have a $1$ in $27$ chance of drawing the queen of hearts and a $26$ in $27$ chance of drawing one of the other cards, whose probability to be a queen is $1$ in $17$, so the probability is  $$
\frac1{27}+\frac{26}{27}\cdot\frac1{17}=\frac{17+26}{17\cdot27}=\frac{43}{459}\approx0.09368\;.
$$  As a rough check, there should be approximately $5/2$ queens in the second set now on average (not exactly because it contains slightly more than half of the unknown cards), so the probability of drawing one should be approximately $5/(2\cdot27)=5/54\approx0.09259$, which works out nicely.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 9 '12 at 22:59             answered Oct 9 '12 at 22:54       joriki   155k 9 171 318                  +1 Nice sanity check. – Michael Joyce  Oct 10 '12 at 2:35        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Based on your hint, can you compute 
$$
\mathbb{P}(Q|F_i),
$$
for $i=0,1,2,3$ and where $Q$ is the event "drawing a Queen in the second pack." Then $\mathbb{P}(Q)$ is just the sum of the conditionnal probabilities abovetimes the probabilities of each $F_i$.  Edit  Just to clarify my comment, you need to be careful when making a hand of $26$ cards that has no queen, $1$ queen, etc. Normally you would divide by $\binom{52}{26}$, but knowing that you have the Queen of heart in the other pack changes things. The term in the sum would be
$$
\mathbb{P}(Q|F_0)\mathbb{P}(F_0)=\frac{1}{27}\times \frac{\overbrace{\binom{48}{26}}^{26 \text{ cards that are not queens}}\times\overbrace{\binom{3}{0}}^{\text{   $0$ queen from the $3$}}}{\binom{51}{26}}

For each of the other three Queens, if it is in the second set (with probability $26/51$), then it will be drawn with probability $1/27$; otherwise it cannot be drawn.  The total probability is therefore
$$
P_Q = \frac{1}{27}+3\cdot\frac{26}{51}\cdot\frac{1}{27}=\frac{129}{1377}=\frac{43}{459}.
$$
Note that the same method can be used to calculate the probability of drawing some other rank, say a King.  For each of the four Kings, if it is in the second set (with probability $26/51$), then it will be drawn with probability $1/27$; the probability of drawing a King is then
$$
P_K = 4\cdot \frac{26}{51}\cdot\frac{1}{27}=\frac{104}{1377}.
$$
As a nice sanity check, note that
$$
P_Q + 12P_K = \frac{129 + 12\cdot 104}{1377}=1,$$
as is should, since the twelve non-Queen ranks are all equally probable, and you must draw something when you draw from the second set.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 10 '12 at 2:38             answered Oct 10 '12 at 2:33       mjqxxxx   28.1k 2 37 78              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Two things: * the GMAT will *never* ask questions about standard decks of cards, since people who play bridge or poker would have a substantial (and unfair) advantage over people who do not; * the GMAT will *never* use notation like '52C2' in an answer choice. That's not even a standard notation in general mathematics; it's more a convenient shorthand to use in internet forums. GMAT answer choices will always be written either as numbers, or using factorials So that makes me wonder what the source is for these questions, and whether it contains a lot of other irrelevant material. In any case, there are 4 Kings and 4 Queens in a standard deck. We need our first card to be one of these 8; there is an 8/52 probability our first card is from this group. Then when we pick the second card, we will be picking from 51 cards in total, and there will be 4 left which are of the type we need (if we picked a King first, we need one of the four Queens and vice versa), so there is a 4/51 probability the second card is the right type, and the answer is (8/52)(4/51). That is equal to answer choice B, though you'd never see anything that looks like answer choice B on the GMAT. It's a bit absurd to write '4C1' in that answer choice anyway, since '4C1' is just equal to 4. _________________  GMAT Tutor in Toronto If you are looking for online GMAT math tutoring, or if you are interested in buying my advanced Quant books and problem sets, please contact me at ianstewartgmat at gmail.com                         amit2k9      VP           Status: There is always something new !!

Two things: * the GMAT will *never* ask questions about standard decks of cards, since people who play bridge or poker would have a substantial (and unfair) advantage over people who do not; * the GMAT will *never* use notation like '52C2' in an answer choice. That's not even a standard notation in general mathematics; it's more a convenient shorthand to use in internet forums. GMAT answer choices will always be written either as numbers, or using factorials So that makes me wonder what the source is for these questions, and whether it contains a lot of other irrelevant material. In any case, there are 4 Kings and 4 Queens in a standard deck. We need our first card to be one of these 8; there is an 8/52 probability our first card is from this group. Then when we pick the second card, we will be picking from 51 cards in total, and there will be 4 left which are of the type we need (if we picked a King first, we need one of the four Queens and vice versa), so there is a 4/51 probability the second card is the right type, and the answer is (8/52)(4/51). That is equal to answer choice B, though you'd never see anything that looks like answer choice B on the GMAT. It's a bit absurd to write '4C1' in that answer choice anyway, since '4C1' is just equal to 4. _________________  GMAT Tutor in Toronto If you are looking for online GMAT math tutoring, or if you are interested in buying my advanced Quant books and problem sets, please contact me at ianstewartgmat at gmail.com                         amit2k9      VP           Status: There is always something new !!

Ask New Question   DV Harris , Magician at Magic by Darryl Answered Dec 12, 2016 · Author has 543 answers and 337.9k answer views Good Day Mr. Cook, I am so sorry, but I am a magician, not a mathematician. This type of information is of little use to the working performer. The answer is likely much more complex than I am thinking, and perhaps be directed to someone like Persi Diaconis. The short answer is with 52 cards in a standard deck, the odds of choosing any one specific cards is one in 52. It seems to me that opening the parameters to select one of a kind e.g., any of the kings, from a standard deck is 4 in 52. I guess the odds of picking a different specific value, i.e., Queens, afterwards is 4 in 51. Jacks would be 4 in 50. There is likely some other factor involved that bigger brains than mine can help direct you. 2.2k Views · Answer requested by  Thomas Cook promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

There are 52 cards total in the deck. The probability of getting a queen first would be [math]\frac{4}{52}[/math] , but since we want to know the probability of getting a king after that assuming the queen wasn’t replaced, all we need to do is multiply it out: P(king | queen not replaced) = [math]\frac{4}{52} * \frac{4}{51} = \frac{16}{2652}[/math] We get [math]\frac{4}{51}[/math] for the second fraction because there are still 4 kings in the deck, but since the queen wasn’t put back in the pile, it reduces the number of cards in the deck by one, giving us 51.

Ask New Question   Suren Basov , PhD Economics, Boston University (2001) Answered Feb 4, 2018 First, the probability of drawing a king at the first draw is 4/52=1/13. Conditionally on a king being drawn on the first draw, the probability of drawing a queen at the second draw is 4/51. Therefore, probability of drawing sequence KQ is 1/13*(4/51)=4/663. If you care about the order, then your answer is 4/663, which is approximately 0.6%. If you do not care about the order, then you should consider both events KQ and QK a success, in which case your probability is twice this value, i.e. 8/663, which is approximately 1.2%. 188 Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  ABDULMALIK DANMALIKI promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

There are just (2)(4^2) = 32 ways (permutations) of drawing a king and queen together.

Update Cancel Answer Wiki 1 Answer   Mohammed Ateeq , Intern at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Limited Answered Dec 16, 2017 First card will be drawn out of a group of 8 cards (i.e. 4 kings and 4 queens). Probability of first card is 8/52. The probability of second card is 4/51, because you have to pick one card out of 4 cards of the other type (pick one queen if one king was already picked in first draw or vice versa) out of 51 remaining cards. So the total probability is (8/52)*(4/51). 208 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by UC Berkeley Extension Want to learn basic statistic concepts?

Undo Answer Wiki 2 Answers   Brad Martsberger Answered Sep 13, 2016 Your first answer [math]\frac{4}{52} * \frac{4}{51} * \frac{4}{50}[/math] is the probability of getting first a King, then a Queen, then a Jack. Each factor in the product represents drawing a particular card. Your second answer [math]\frac{4c1 * 4c1 * 4c1}{52c3}[/math] is the number of ways of drawing the cards in any order. The numerator is the total number of ways of selecting a King, Queen, and Jack from the deck and the denominator is the total number of ways of ordering the entire deck. To make these answers line up, we have to include in the first answer the possibility that the cards could come in any order. There are 6 ways they could come (KQJ, KJQ, QKJ, QJK, JKQ, JQK). If you multiply your first result by 6, it will match your second result. 2.3k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below Out of a deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of getting one king and one queen?

If you spread the deck out faces up, unless someone's removed either all the kings or all the queens, I'd say that your chances of finding one of each would be very good. But, if you mean by randomly choosing two of them without replacement, that's different. [math]\qquad P=\cfrac{8}{52}\cdot\cfrac{4}{51}=\cfrac{32}{2652}=\cfrac{8}{663}\approx1.2066\%[/math] On the first draw, to be consistent with the goal, there are 8 cards of the 52 that that can be drawn. On the second draw, whether the first was a king or a queen, there are 4 cards of the remaining 51 that can be drawn to complete the goal. 851 Views   Harry Strand , Have been playing cards for over half a century. Answered Oct 22, 2017 · Author has 662 answers and 100.1k answer views Thanks for the question John, Don't know why you would need to know this, unless it is a homework problem. I will assume that you mean if you draw two and only two cards without replacement. The chance of getting your first card to be a King or a Queen would be 8/52. The chance of your second card being one you need would be 4/51. Now just multiply them together to get your answer. You must do some of the work here! 348 Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  John Lund   Dmitriy Genzel , PhD in CS Answered Apr 30, 2016 · Author has 1.9k answers and 8.4m answer views If you draw two cards? In any order or in that order? If you draw two cards in this order, first you get a king: there are 4 out of 52, and then a queen, there are 4 out of 51 (since the king is already out). So that's [math]\frac{4*4}{52*51} = 0.006[/math] . If you mean in any order, then of course the answer it twice this, because there are two possible orders with this same probability. 1.5k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Each suit consists of ace, king, queen, jack, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three and deuce.  13in all.  A single card is chosen at random.  Find the odds against its being a red queen?  How many cards will I have to draw to be absolutely certain that I have drawn three black cards       Tabyia,  I'm going to find the odds against drawing a jack.  There are 4 jacks in the deck of 52 cards so the probability of of drawing a jack is 4/52 = 1/13. Hence the probability of not drawing a jack is 1 - (1/13) = 12/13. Therefore, in the long run, if you select a card many times you expect that, on the average, 12 of every 13 times you don't draw a jack and 1 of every 13 times you do draw a jack. Thus the odds against selecting a jack is 12:1. (This is read as 12 to 1.)  Use the same procedure to find the odds against drawing a red queen.

In common usage, the word probability is used to mean the 
	chance that a particular event (or set of events) will 
	occur expressed on a linear scale from 0 (impossibility) to 1 (certainty), 
	also expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100%.  In this lesson we 
	will discuss theoretical probability and empirical probability. An Experiment is an occurrence for which the outcome is 
	uncertain. For example, tossing a coin. A Sample Space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment 
	and is usually denoted with a 
	capital S . For instance, the sample space for tossing a quarter is  S = { H, T } , 
	where H symbolizes "lands heads up" and  T stands for "lands tails up." An Event is a  subset of the sample space.  We denote 
	an event by capital E . For example, the subset E = { H } is the event of a tossed quarter landing 
	heads up and the subset E = { T } is the event of a tossed quarter landing 
	tails up. The probability of an event  E occurring is denoted 
	by P(E) . We will discuss Theoretical and Empirical Probability .  Theoretical Probability Theoretical probability applies to situations in which the sample space only 
	contains equally likely outcomes all of which are known, like in the 
	quarter-tossing experiment above.  Heads up and tails up are equally 
	likely and we know that it will be either one or the other.  
	Theoretical probability applies to many games of chance, including roulette, 
	cards, dice rolling, and lotteries.  Computing Theoretical Probability  Example 1: A quarter is tossed.  It is equally likely to land heads up or tails 
	up.  The probability of the quarter landing heads up 
is  The probability of the quarter landing tails up 
is  NOTE:  The sum of the theoretical probabilities of all possible 
outcomes in the sample space equals 1.  Example 2: You are 
dealt one card from a standard 52-card deck.  Find the probability of being 
dealt a.  a 
queen b.  a 
diamond c.  a 
queen of diamonds d.  a 
black card e.  a 
black king  Please note that a standard 52-card deck has 13 
spades, 13 hearts, 13 diamonds, and 13 clubs!   Since we are told that the 
deck contains 52 cards, the number of outcomes in the sample space  S is , which will be used as the denominator of each 
probability fraction. a.  Let's find the 
probability 
of being dealt a queen.  There are four queens in the deck.  See 
picture above.  Therefore, this event can occur in 4 different ways, that 
is, . The probability of 
being dealt a queen is  b.  Let's find the 
probability 
of being dealt a diamond.  There are thirteen diamonds in the deck.  
See picture above.  Therefore, this event can occur in 13 different ways, 
that is, . The probability of 
being dealt a diamond is c.  Let's 
find the probability of being dealt a queen of diamonds.  There is only one card 
in the deck that is a queen of diamonds .  See picture above.  
Therefore, this event can occur in exactly 1 way, that is, . The 
probability of being dealt a queen of diamonds is d.  Let's find the 
probability 
of being dealt a black card.  There are twenty-six black cards in the deck.  
See picture above.  Therefore, this event can occur in 26 different ways, 
that is, . The probability of 
being dealt a black card is  e.  Let's find the 
probability of being dealt a black king.  There are two black kings in the deck.  
See picture above.  Therefore, this event can occur in 2 different ways, 
that is, . The probability of 
being dealt a black king is   Empirical Probability  Empirical probability applies to situations in which we observe how 
	frequently an even occurs.   Computing Empirical Probability  Example 3: The U.S. 
Census Bureau claims that there are 59.2 million individuals over age 18 in the 
U.S. who have never been married.  Find the empirical probability of 
selecting a never married person from the U.S. population of 225.8 million.  The 
empirical probability of selecting a never married person from the U.S. population 
is approximately 0.26.

How to fix it   I don't own this page   The page owner blocked this page from Google in a suboptimal way, so we couldn't create a good page description. If you know the site owners, let them know that "robots.txt is blocking Google and can't create a site description in search results".     I own this page   You are seeing this result because the page is blocked by a robots.txt file entry , which tells Google not to crawl your page. You can take either of these two steps:   Fix the page description, or  Remove the page entirely from Google search results.   To fix the page description  If you want a proper description to appear in search results for your page, you must enable Google to read the page. If you don't want the page to appear in search results at all, see the next section "Remove the page entirely from search results."  The reason Google can't read the page is that it has a special file (called robots.txt) blocking the page. Here's how to remove the blockage:   If you are using a content management system for your website (for example, if your site is on Wix, Joomla, or Drupal), search for "robots.txt" in your host's documentation to learn how to unblock your page or site to Google.  If you are managing your own site pages directly , learn more about robots.txt here . You'll need to unblock your site or page to Googlebot.   To remove the page from search results  If you intended to hide your page entirely from Google Search results, follow these steps:   Remove the robots.txt rule that blocks the page to search engines. Your page is still appearing in search (though without a description) because the page is blocked by a robots.txt file. You must first unblock Google access to that page (which sounds counterintuitive, but that's what you must do). Learn about robots.txt here .  Block search engines from indexing the page. Implement one of the following three methods to permanently block the page from search results:  Remove the page entirely from your site.  Require a user login to access the page.  Use "noindex" on your page .    Remove the page from Google Search results using the remove outdated content tool . Copy the URL from search results into the tool. If you do this without following any of the previous steps, the page can reappear in search.            Was this article helpful? How can we improve it?

( self.learnmath ) submitted 4 years ago  * by [deleted] I'm having a lot of trouble this week in my Probability & Statistics class so I'm trying to go back through the book and do every problem from the chapter we just finished. I apologize in advance for my lack of LaTeX formatting knowledge.  The current one I'm stuck on is as follows:   What is the probability that a 13-card hand dealt from a deck of 52 cards will contain  (a) the Queen of spades,
(b) five spades and 8 cards from other suits,
(c) five spades, five hearts, two diamonds, and the Ace of clubs?   I'm only concerned with (a) right now:
My thinking is that I'd multiply the probability of choosing the Queen of spades (1/52) by the number of choices of the other cards in the hand (51 C 12) and divide that product by the total number of possibilities of all 13-card hands (52 C 13). This results in an answer of P= 0.00481 which seems reasonable, but I'm not sure.  If that works, then for (b) I'd multiply the probability of getting a spade (1/4) by itself 5 times for (1/4) 5 signifying 5 favorable outcomes. Multiply (1/4) 5 by the probability number of possibilities of choosing 8 other random cards (47 C 8), multiply that by the probability of NOT choosing a spade eight times (3/4) 8 and divide the whole product by (52 C 13) again.  It follows that for (c) I'd multiply the probability of drawing five spades (1/4) 5 by the probability of drawing five hearts (1/4) 5 and by the probability of drawing two diamonds (1/4) 2 and by the probability of drawing the Ace of clubs (1/52) and divide the whole product by (52 C 13).  EDIT: My work for (b) and (c) results in 4.84138E-8 and 1.8051E-21 so those definitely aren't correct.

Create an account [–] picado  1 point 2 points 3 points  4 years ago  (5 children) (a)  Almost, except it's C(51,12)/C(52,13), there's no factor of 1/52 at the start.  You're counting all the deals with AS, which is the same as what the other 12 are, then dividing that by all deals.  That's going to be 1/4. In general with a k card deal it's k/52. A bunch of ways to see that, one would be the odds of not getting an AS would be 51/52 on the first card, 50/51 on the second, etc.  (51/52)(50/51)(49/50)...((52-k)/(52-k+1)) = (52-k)/52 = 1 - k/52   permalink embed save give gold [–] Servaphetic  1 point 2 points 3 points  4 years ago  (0 children) This can also be thought of as (C(1,1)) (C(51,12))/(C(52,13)) (which might be similar to examples OP should've seen in class + might help with the extra questions).   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 years ago  (3 children)  You're counting all the deals with AS, which is the same as what the other 12 are, then dividing that by all deals.   I'm not sure I follow. I see that C(51,12)/C(52,13) is 1/4 but I guess I don't understand the reasoning.  I just assume that I have the favorable card I'm looking for and then find the number of possibilities of the rest of the k-1 cards in the hand being selected from the remaining 51 cards, and then divide that by the total number of possibilities of 13-card hands from 52 cards?  I can take that on faith but then I have no idea what to do for the (b) and (c) since those definitely aren't coming out correctly.  For (b), I don't get reasonable answers when I factor in the probabilities of drawing 5 spades and then 8 cards from other suits (1/4) 5 * (3/4) 8. Maybe it should be C(13,4) * C(39, 8) / C(52,13)? That yields 0.06927 which seems possible.  Following that same thinking for (c), I have C(13,5) C(39,8) (1/31)/C(52,13) where (1/31) is the probability of drawing the Ace of clubs when the other 12 cards aren't it. That yields 0.00402 which seems further outside the realm of possibility but I don't know enough to make that judgment.   permalink embed save parent [–] picado  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 years ago  (2 children) You're mixing two ways of looking at it. One is counting, where you're asking how many deals have the property you want. The other is picking, going step by step by probability. They get the same answer, but you can't mix and match.  I'll give you another picking way. On the first card, probability is 1/52 -- your start before. Now on the second, it's (51/52)(1/51). That's a (51/52) probability that you didn't already pick it on the first, times a (1/51) that you get it this time. On the third, (51/52)(50/51)(1/50).  (1/52)+(51/52)(1/51)+(51/52)(50/51)(1/50)+..... = (1/52)+(1/52)+(1/52)+.....  dealing k cards, that's k/52.  You could also think of that as, there's 1/52 chance it's the first card. There's a 1/52 chance it's the second card. Etc. And all those probabilities are exclusive, so you can add them.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 years ago  (1 child) Alright, I think I understand that now, I appreciate the help!  How do I approach these other two problems where multiple probabilities are involved?  For (b), I've tried going the wholly counting method route and using [(1/4) 5 * (3/4) 8] * 5! * 8!/C(52,13) and all manner of other weird-looking calculations. Nothing seems to give me a reasonable answer.  Picking isn't working well either, C(52,5) C(47,8)/C(52,13) didn't work, nor did C(52,5) C(39,8)/C(52,13), where C(39,8) is the total number of choices of 8 cards from the 39 non-spades.  I'm missing the necessary intuition here.   permalink embed save parent [–] zyxophoj  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 years ago  (0 children)  [(1/4) 5 * (3/4) 8] * 5! * 8!/C(52,13)   There are some things wrong here.  The probability of picking 5 spades isn't (1/4) 5. This is because once you pull one spade out, the rest of the deck contains 51 cards and 12 spades.  So the probability of picking a second is 12/51, not 13/52.  Similarly, 11/50, 10/49 and 9/48 for the rest.  (Perhaps the easiest way to get this is to think about the probability of getting all spades in a hand of 14 cards - it's not (1/4) 14 :D )  (3/4) 8 has exactly the same problem, although if you've done the spades first, there are now 47 cards..  So really, this should be:  (13/52)(12/51)...(9/48) * (39/47)(38/46)...(32/40), which we could rewrite as (13! 39! 39!)/(8! 31! 52!) (ugh)  Then you multiply by 5! and 8! .. why? It looks like you're trying to take care of the order issues, but this is backwards.  Look at (13/52)(12/51)(11/51)(10/49)(9/48) - that's the probability of getting any spade as your first card times the probability of getting any other spade as the second card...etc.  It is the probability of getting 5 spades as the first 5 cards in any order .  So if this is just a probability calculation, you don't need to do anything.  (13/52)..(9/48) * (39/47) ... (32/40) is the probability of getting 5 spades as the first 5 cards plus 8 not-spades as the next 8 cards. But since the spades can be in any position, that's not right.  In how many ways can the 5 spades be placed?  That's just C(13,5)  So the answer is:  (13! 39! 39!)/(8! 31! 52!) * 13!/(5! 8!)  (39! 39! 13! 13!)/(5! 8! 8! 31! 52!)  = (39! 13!)/(5! 8! 8! 31!)/C(52,13)  = [ C(13,5) C(39,8) ]/C(52,13)  ...and this is the other way of doing it.  Pick 5 spades out of 13 spades, 8 not-spades out of 39 not-spades, divide by the total number of possibilities: 13 cards out of 52.   nor did C(52,5)C(39,8)/C(52,13)   You were pretty close with this one, but you seem to think there are C(52,5) ways to pick 5 spades.

You may not be psychic, but you can still have the power of probability on your side. In this activity you'll investigate the probabilities of drawing specific types of cards from a deck. You'll discover how math can help you avoid the dreaded phrase, "Go fish!"   Background When you draw a card from a deck, you have a certain chance of getting a specific type of card, such as a spade or face card, or one particular card, such as the queen of hearts. Consider the game "Go Fish" with a regular card deck. The goal is to get the most four-of-a-kind sets by asking your opponent for matching cards or by drawing them from the deck. To win, you can rely on chance or you can increase your probability of getting matching cards, but how?  By understanding how chance is related to math, you can play with a winning strategy. For example, if you have three kings and one queen in your hand and it's your turn to ask for a card, which one should you ask your opponent for? You might think you should ask for a king, but it's actually better to take a queen! Why? Because you have a better chance of getting it. There are four kings and four queens in the deck, and with three kings and one queen in your hand, there's one king and three queens left. This gives you only one chance to get a king, but three chances to get a queen out of the remaining cards.   Materials •     Standard deck of playing cards •     Piece of paper •     Pencil or pen •     Calculator   Preparation •     Count the cards in the deck and make sure it is complete. (There should be 54 cards total.) Take out the two jokers. Shuffle the deck three times and set aside. •     Pick four types of cards to investigate, such as a color, suit, number or face card, and a specific one. For example, you could investigate red cards, spades, kings and the queen of hearts. •     Draw a table to in which to record your data. Make a column for each card type you'll investigate. In the first row write how many of that type of card are in the deck. For example, there are 26 red cards in a deck, 13 spades, four kings and one queen of hearts. Make 10 rows below this one for the 10 trials you will be doing.   Procedure •     Decide which type of card you will investigate first. Draw cards from the top of the deck and flip them over one at a time, counting as you go, and stop when you see that type of card. How many cards did you draw until you reached that card? Write down the answer in your table. •     Shuffle the deck again and repeat this process, flipping over the cards and looking for the same type of card. How many cards did it take this time? Write down the answer in your table. Repeat this for a total of 10 times for one type of card. •     Repeat this process for each of the four types of cards you picked to investigate. This means that you will have looked for each type of card a total of 10 times. •     Calculate the average number of cards you drew to reach each type of card. Label the last row in your table "Averages" and write them in this row. • Which types of cards were the easiest to draw? Which were the most difficult? How do you think the chances of drawing a card relate to the total number of that card type in the deck? • Based on what you saw in this activity, how do you think probability can help you choose the right strategy in a card game? • Extra: A more advanced way of showing the results of your experiment would be to make histograms, which are a type of graph to show distributions. Try making a separate histogram for each type of card you tested by graphing the number of cards drawn for each trial separately in a bar graph. When all of the bars are lined up next to each other, what does the overall shape of the distribution look like? • Extra: The probability of drawing a particular type of card also depends on the number of cards drawn each time. Try doing this activity again but draw samples of three, five or seven cards at a time. Do your chances improve as more cards are taken? • Extra: Probabilities can change your strategies for playing a card game. Can you design an experiment to show how probabilities can help you choose cards and win "Go Fish"? What about other popular card games? Can you invent your own game based on probabilities?   Observations and results Did it take fewer draws to reach a certain color than it took to reach a certain suit or kind of card? Did it take even more draws to reach a specific card?  Mathematicians measure probability by counting and using some very basic math, like addition and division. For example, you can add up the number of spades in a complete deck (13) and divide this by the total number of cards in the deck (52) to get the probability of randomly drawing a spade: 13 in 52, or 25 percent. If you were investigating red cards, kings or the queen of hearts, the odds of randomly drawing one of these from a complete deck are 50 percent (26 in 52); about 7.7 percent (four in 52); or about 1.9 percent (one in 52), respectively. This is why, on average (when done over enough trials), it is easier to draw a red card than a spade, a spade than a king, and a king than the queen of hearts. As you draw cards from a deck, the odds of finding your card change. For example, if you are looking for a spade and do not get it on your first draw, there are still 13 spades in the deck but the deck now holds only 51 cards, so your odds of drawing a spade on the second draw are 13 in 51, or about 25.5 percent. This may not seem like much of an improvement, but with every draw the odds continue to increase.

We were to assume that drawing cards are independent events. We were asked what the probability that the second card drawn is a queen if we take two from the deck. The answer given was 4/52, which seems counter-intuitive to me. How is the probability still 4/52 if there was a card drawn before it? What if the first card drawn was a queen?    probability     share | cite | improve this question     asked May 18 '15 at 4:37       Ampage Green   394 1 4 10              5      If you are assuming that the drawing of cards are independent events, then it must be a drawing with replacement. – nathan.j.mcdougall  May 18 '15 at 4:39         55      It's a red herring.  The first and second cards are not independent, but it doesn't matter because you don't care about the first card at all.  Taking two cards and looking only at the second is just a fancy way of drawing one card from the deck. – Robert Israel  May 18 '15 at 4:48        8      "What if the first card drawn was a queen?" -- and what if the first card wasn't a queen? Now calculate the probability that either (first card is queen and second card  is queen) or (first card is not queen and second card is queen). Not that this calculation helps with the intuition, but it should give you the correct answer. – Steve Jessop  May 18 '15 at 9:39         2      Let $E_1,E_2,E_3,\dots,E_{11},E_{12},E_{13}$ be the events: second card drawn is A, 2, 3, . . ., jack, queen, king. As those $13$ events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, their probabilities add up to one: $P(E_1)+P(E_2)+\cdots+P(E_{12})+P(E_{13})=1$. Now, if you can only manage to convince yourself that those probabilities are all equal, you can deduce that $P(E_{12})=\frac1{13}.$ Well, which do you think is more likely, getting a queen or getting a jack on the second draw? – bof  May 18 '15 at 9:39         7      As with the Monty Hall problem, it's useful to extend the logic to the extreme. What if you take 51 cards and then the last card? What's the chance that the last card is a queen? In general, what's the chance p(N) that the N'th card is a queen? Obviously after 52 cards you must have had 4 queens to the chances better add up to 4.0. If the chance p(N) would decrease with N, p(1) would be the biggest and p(52) the smallest, so p(0) must be greater than 1/13 ! – MSalters  May 18 '15 at 15:38        |  show 5 more comments          15 Answers 15     active  oldest  votes            up vote  63  down vote  accepted      There are two cases here:  Case 1: First card chosen is a queen  $$\frac{4}{52}*\frac{3}{51}=\frac{1}{221}$$  Case 2: First card chosen is not a queen.  $$\frac{48}{52}*\frac{4}{51}=\frac{16}{221}$$  Adding both the cases, we get $\frac{17}{221}$ = $\frac{4}{52}$ = $\frac{1}{13}$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 18 '15 at 5:02       marwalix   12.7k 1 21 36        answered May 18 '15 at 4:41       A.J.

I'm presuming you mean "the probability that the first card is a queen", but it isn't clear.  Furthermore, you state "Your probability (of whatever) is the same as ...", but that feels like begging the question. Why are they the same. – jamesdlin  May 18 '15 at 8:00        4      "Your probability" here means the probability the asker was asking about, namely the probability that when two cards are drawn from the deck in sequence, the second is a queen. The point of this answer is to get the reader to understand that in the absence of any information about the first card drawn, the second card drawn has an equal chance of being any card in the deck, just as in a shuffled deck the second card in the deck has an equal chance of being any card. – Hammerite  May 18 '15 at 11:06        3      This is a good way of looking at it. The probability of any card in the deck being a queen is 4/52. The probability over a high enough number of runs doesn't change after drawing any number of other cards first. If you add the probabilities of all the cards in the deck you get 4 which is obviously correct because there are four queens in the pack! What is confusing is that when you draw a card and look at it, you forget that there was the other possibility. – CJ Dennis  May 18 '15 at 12:11        add a comment |             up vote  32  down vote      A slightly more intuitive way of looking at this:  The probability that the second card is a queen should be the same as the probability that the second card is an ace, and the same as the probability that the second card is a 2 etc. There are $ 13 $ possibilities for the card number/letter, so the answer is $ \frac{1}{13} $     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 12:45       Esteemator   1,075 7 12              3      This is the cleverest answer I have seen to this question.

Off the beaten path, and brilliant. – Amrinder Arora  May 18 '15 at 17:42        2      I don't consider this intuitive at all.  If the first card is an ace, then it is less likely that the 2nd card is an ace versus any other card. – Tony Ennis  May 18 '15 at 22:55        1      @TonyEnnis Look at this: there's same number of aces (namely four) as queens, and shuffling makes no preference to one or the other. So the probability of getting each is the same. Similary the probability of getting any chosen value (4, 10 or King alike) at any pre-selected position (be it second or eleventh, or first or fifty-second) is the same. So for 13 possible values it is... what Cliff said. – CiaPan  May 19 '15 at 8:44        1      @Tony - If the first card is an ace, then it is less likely that the 2nd card is an ace. From a card player's perspective, that's true. But, what happens when the first card is not an ace? Then, it is more likely that the second card is an ace. 1/13th of the time the probability will go down, while 12/13ths of the time the probability will go up. In the end, the numbers cancel out, and we're back to 1/13th. A.J.'s answer has the actual values. – J.R.

You're interested in the probability that card B is a queen.  Now consider a different experiment: draw a pair of cards as before, but this time call the first one card B, and the second one card A. I claim that these two experiments are identical. The reason is that for any two cards X,Y, the probability to draw X then Y is the same as the probability to draw Y then X.  The second experiment makes it clear that the probability that card B is a queen is 4/52, since there are 4 queens out of 52 cards.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 5:14       Yuval Filmus   46.7k 3 67 140                  This is good.

Let's try a more feeling-based approach:   Take a deck of cards  Shuffle the cards  Flip over the second card of the deck and check if it is a queen, while leaving the first card on the deck   Perhaps you can see how the chance is the exact same ($\frac{4}{52}$) if you had picked the top card instead of the second to top. Chance, after all, does not play favorites between the two cards.  Then, consider the following set of actions:   Take a deck of cards  Shuffle the cards  Draw the first card  Draw the second card and check if it is a queen   Now, you should be able to see that the chances for the two cases are the exact same. After you shuffle the deck, it doesn't matter if you draw two cards and check the second or you just check the second card without looking at the first; if the second card is a queen, it's a queen, if it's not, it's not.  The flip side of the feeling-based approach is the math to back it up. Let's start with the simple case: you have 52 cards, and want a queen on the second draw. (This has also been done by other answers, but I'll repeat it here.)  You draw a queen on the second draw if:   You draw a queen on the first draw and one on the second
$$\frac{4}{52}*\frac{3}{51}=\frac{12}{2652}=\frac{1}{221}$$  You draw something other than a queen on the first draw and a queen on the second
$$\frac{48}{52}*\frac{4}{51}=\frac{192}{2652}=\frac{16}{221}$$   So in total, the chance is:  $$\frac{1}{221}+\frac{16}{221}=\frac{17}{221}=\frac{4}{52}$$  Now, let's up the ante a little bit. Rather than wanting to know something about queens in a complete deck, I want to know about the more general case. I have a pile of $n$ shuffled cards. In that pile, I know there are $p$ cards that I "like". What I want to know is: what is the chance I draw a card I like.  For the first card, it's simple. The chance simply is $\frac{p}{n}$.  For the second card, we once again have two options:   I like both the first and second card
$$\frac{p}{n}*\frac{p-1}{n-1}=\frac{p^2-p}{n^2-n}$$  I like the second card, but not the first
$$\frac{n - p}{n}*\frac{p}{n-1}=\frac{pn-p^2}{n^2-n}$$   Adding the two, you get:  $$\frac{p^2-p}{n^2-n}+\frac{pn-p^2}{n^2-n}=\frac{p^2+pn-p^2-p}{n^2-n}=\frac{pn-p}{n^2-n}$$  Moving things around a bit more:  $$\frac{pn-p}{n^2-n}=\frac{p(n-1)}{n(n-1)}=\frac{p}{n}$$  Which is the same as the chances for the first card. So, now I can say that no matter the deck size or the amount of cards that represent "success", it doesn't matter if I look to the first or second card to determine success. (Of course, if I look at the second card, it's important that I don't care what the first card is at all.)  I could actually repeat the experiment for each different card in the deck, and then I could draw the conclusion that in general: it doesn't matter if I look at the first or second card, the chances for the card to be a specific one are equal.  The next step could be to proof that the the other cards (third, fourth, etc) have the same chance as well, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.  Disclaimer: my proof probably isn't elegant, optimal or nice, but I do believe it to be correct.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '15 at 15:17             answered May 18 '15 at 15:21       Jasper   181 3                  As pointed out by user CiaPan, a simpler way to proceed after "Moving things around a bit more:" is $\dfrac{pn-p}{n^2 - n} = \dfrac{p(n-1)}{n(n-1)} = \dfrac{p}{n}$. – epimorphic  May 19 '15 at 13:38             To CiaPan: Simplifications are probably best communicated in the comments, given the prohibition against "drastic" edits to non-CW posts authored by others and given that one of the purposes of comments is to "suggest improvements".

If we observed that the first card drawn was a queen, then that would give us a lowered probability of the second card being a queen of $3/51$. However, this is not the same probability as the one asked of in the problem, but the conditional probability given the first card being a queen.  If we instead had had the first card not be a queen, then the conditional probability would have been heightened to $4/51$. The prior probability could then be calculated using the probability of both cases as $$\frac{4}{52}\cdot\frac{3}{51}+\frac{48}{52}\cdot\frac{4}{51}=\frac{4}{52}$$  However, the problem can be simplified as what is important isn't the drawing of the card from the deck, but the observation of the value of the card.  As the value of the first card is never considered in the problem, it can simply be considered as not being drawn at all, which brings us to a second point; If instead of drawing two cards from the deck, you simply fanned out the cards and drew the second card from the top, you would still get the same probabilities as if you chose the top card.  In fact, you would get the same probabilities even if you chose the tenth card or even a card at random. There is nothing special about the top card of the deck unless you choose to do something with it.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 19 '15 at 19:00       PassingStranger   171 3              add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      Consider a more complete event:  When drawing all 52 cards, what is the probability that the second card is a queen?  The reason of changing the original question to this is because this is an expanded process, in other words, if you do draw all cards you certainly drop the first two ones. To solve the new problem is not difficult. One way is to consider every card of the 52 has an equal chance be at the second place. So the probability is 4/52.

Perhaps there is replacement and perfect shuffling after every draw then it's 4/52 all the way down the line. – hownowbrowncow  May 18 '15 at 14:27         1      @hownowbrowncow - A.J.'s answer demonstrates that, even if you consider the first card, the overall probability of card #2 being a queen is still the same. – GalacticCowboy  May 18 '15 at 14:31        |  show 1 more comment            up vote  3  down vote      2 things to consider.  What if the problem stated draw all cards and what is the probability that the last card drawn is a queen then what would your answer be? You might think it is close to 0 because in 51 cards drawn, there is a very good chance that all queens would be already drawn by then.  However, the answer should still be 4/52 because there are 4 queens in the deck and each has an equal chance of being the last card drawn just as all the other cards have.  Also, if you notice on TV when they have Texas Hold 'em, they "waste" the top card when drawing community cards (turn, river...) so if that changed the probability, it would likely be disallowed.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 11:46       David   318 8 30              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      Imagine you buy a ticket in a lottery, where a fraction $p$ of the tickets will win. (From the comments I gather that there are some people who are confused by all kinds of newfangled games with different rules, such as being able to compose the number on one's own ticket; I therefore emphasise this is just an old fashioned lottery with a fixed set of tickets established beforehand, all distinct and all sold before the drawing; drawing then determines a subset of the tickets as winners, with the size of that subset being $p$ times the total number of tickets.) What is your chance of winning? It would be hard to argue that it is anything other then $p$.  But now let us add that before buying a ticket, you had to wait in line, and you happen to notice that the person before you also bought a ticket for the same lottery. Of course you don't know whether her ticket will win, but what is the chance that your ticket will win? It is still $p$. But what if her ticket actually wins? Well with that new information your chances will no doubt be less, but you don't have that information. If her ticket actually looses, that will slightly improve your odds, but you don't know that either. In fact you can be sure that there are hundreds of people who also bought tickets, but as long as you know nothing about their results (and you won't until the winning lots are drawn), it will not affect your chances the slightest bit.  The situation you describe is entirely similar to this.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '15 at 12:28             answered May 18 '15 at 10:34       Marc van Leeuwen   83.1k 4 88 200                  Why would my chances of winning a lottery be less if I know the person in front of me in line already won?  Many lotteries share the jackpot if there are multiple winners.  In that case, my winnings will be reduced but not my chance of winning.  Also if that person loses it will not increase my chance of winning at all. The only exception is if I choose the same numbers as some other person in a lottery (such as 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30). Then if I know that person won then my chances of winning are likely affected (depending on the type of lottery).  You didn't say a fixed fraction will win. – David  May 18 '15 at 11:38             It wouldn't be p if the lottery/drawing is biased (which some are).  For example, if people put their name on a piece of paper and place it into a container to be drawn.  It would depend if they fold it and how and also when they put it in the container since they may not be mixed well before being drawn.  I've actually seen this happen in real life where some last minute entry won because they were not mixed well and they just drew her name from the top. – David  May 18 '15 at 11:51            @David "Imagine you buy a ticket in a lottery, where a fraction p of the tickets will win." <-> "You didn't say a fixed fraction will win." Please elaborate. – Alexander  May 18 '15 at 12:18            @David: I'm using a very simple lottery model, where all tickets are sold, and then a fraction $p$ is drawn as winning lots. Obviously if I know another ticket that wins, that will decrease the chances that my ticket too is among the winners (in an extreme example there is only one winning ticket, and knowing another ticket wins ensures tha mine won't; but even if there are say 2 wins out of 100, then $\frac1{99}$ is worse than $p=\frac2{100}$). I don't know what kind of lottery you are thinking of that would not see my chances diminished by knowing a winner that is not my ticket. – Marc van Leeuwen  May 18 '15 at 12:55             @David: Re-reading what you wrote, I really cannot see what you are worrying about, you must have a strange idea of a lottery. It is not about writing anything on tickets, or putting them in a container, and there cannot be "identical" tickets. Tickets are simply a fixed known collection, say numbers $1$ to $n$, and when all are sold then some $k$ of these numbers are "drawn" (from a separate copy of those numbers) to be winning numbers. The chance of winning with one ticket is $p=\frac kn$. Also  I don't see what complaining about biased-ness in real-world lotteries has to do with this. – Marc van Leeuwen  May 18 '15 at 13:10         |  show 3 more comments            up vote  1  down vote      put the first card back in the deck; now you've only drawn one card. the chance it's queen 4/52     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 17:57       Thanos Tintinidis   257 1 5              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Can I convince you of this statement:  If I draw two cards, the probability that the first card is a queen is the same as the probability that the second card is a queen.

You have two goats and a car, if you open two doors, what is the chance that there is a goat behind the second door?  What is the chance it is a car? 2/3 and 1/3 respectively.  After you open the first door, and find that it is a car, you can say that there is zero chance that there is a car behind the second door.  But at that point, they are no longer independent events, which is why in the Monty Hall problem you always switch.  In this case you are effectively saying that the second card is a queen, and you are doing this before you know what the first card was . The chance that that is correct is 1/13.  It (the chance you were correct) will remain 1 in 13 until either the second card is revealed or the position of all queens have been determined, at which point it is not a matter of probability.  In both cases the odds of you having identified the card is unchanged, what changes is the current odds of that card being a queen (ie is this one of the 1 in 13 times where you were correct).  This is where people go wrong with the Monty Hall problem, they confuse the current odds of the car being behind the door with the odds that they correctly identified the door with the car.  In this instance the confusion is between having identified the card vs the card actually being.  Here's another way of looking at it.  Your odds of correctly predicting card 2 is 1 in 13.  So take 4 decks of cards, divide them into 13 rows by   suit (throwing away the 3 extra suits).  Then pick a value for the 2nd card in each row.  Now start randomly revealing cards until each row has been determined -- do you expect this random reveal to result in you having correctly guessed more than the expected 1 row?  Is it any different from just revealing the 2nd card of each row?  Now, suppose that someone who knows what the cards are does the reveal, revealing each card  until there are only 2 cards left per row -- when you do the final reveal for each row, how many rows would you expect to have guessed correctly?  Your chance of predicting the card in advance is 1 in 13 for each row, and it remains 1 in 13 -- revealing cards doesn't change the odds of your having guessed correctly. Your guess is in the past and is now fixed, forever unchanging .  Either it was right or it wasn't.   What changes (assuming random reveal) is my current odds of guessing whether you were right or not .  As with the related Deal Or No Deal game, I get additional information with each random reveal.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 5 '17 at 12:30             answered May 18 '15 at 15:04       jmoreno   341 1 6              2      You start by saying that this is basically the Monty Hall problem, and then you explain that the Monty Hall problem is different from this.

What if you take 51 cards and then the last card? What's the chance that the last card is a queen? In general, what's the chance p(N) that the N'th card is a queen? Obviously after 52 cards you must have had 4 queens to the chances better add up to 4.0. If the chance p(N) would decrease with N, p(1) would be the biggest and p(52) the smallest, so p(0) must be greater than 1/13 ! – MSalters  May 18 '15 at 15:38        |  show 5 more comments          15 Answers 15     active  oldest  votes            up vote  63  down vote  accepted      There are two cases here:  Case 1: First card chosen is a queen  $$\frac{4}{52}*\frac{3}{51}=\frac{1}{221}$$  Case 2: First card chosen is not a queen.  $$\frac{48}{52}*\frac{4}{51}=\frac{16}{221}$$  Adding both the cases, we get $\frac{17}{221}$ = $\frac{4}{52}$ = $\frac{1}{13}$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 18 '15 at 5:02       marwalix   12.7k 1 21 36        answered May 18 '15 at 4:41       A.J.

The probability of any card in the deck being a queen is 4/52. The probability over a high enough number of runs doesn't change after drawing any number of other cards first. If you add the probabilities of all the cards in the deck you get 4 which is obviously correct because there are four queens in the pack! What is confusing is that when you draw a card and look at it, you forget that there was the other possibility. – CJ Dennis  May 18 '15 at 12:11        add a comment |             up vote  32  down vote      A slightly more intuitive way of looking at this:  The probability that the second card is a queen should be the same as the probability that the second card is an ace, and the same as the probability that the second card is a 2 etc. There are $ 13 $ possibilities for the card number/letter, so the answer is $ \frac{1}{13} $     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 12:45       Esteemator   1,075 7 12              3      This is the cleverest answer I have seen to this question.

So for 13 possible values it is... what Cliff said. – CiaPan  May 19 '15 at 8:44        1      @Tony - If the first card is an ace, then it is less likely that the 2nd card is an ace. From a card player's perspective, that's true. But, what happens when the first card is not an ace? Then, it is more likely that the second card is an ace. 1/13th of the time the probability will go down, while 12/13ths of the time the probability will go up. In the end, the numbers cancel out, and we're back to 1/13th. A.J.'s answer has the actual values. – J.R.

You're interested in the probability that card B is a queen.  Now consider a different experiment: draw a pair of cards as before, but this time call the first one card B, and the second one card A. I claim that these two experiments are identical. The reason is that for any two cards X,Y, the probability to draw X then Y is the same as the probability to draw Y then X.  The second experiment makes it clear that the probability that card B is a queen is 4/52, since there are 4 queens out of 52 cards.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 5:14       Yuval Filmus   46.7k 3 67 140                  This is good.

Let's try a more feeling-based approach:   Take a deck of cards  Shuffle the cards  Flip over the second card of the deck and check if it is a queen, while leaving the first card on the deck   Perhaps you can see how the chance is the exact same ($\frac{4}{52}$) if you had picked the top card instead of the second to top. Chance, after all, does not play favorites between the two cards.  Then, consider the following set of actions:   Take a deck of cards  Shuffle the cards  Draw the first card  Draw the second card and check if it is a queen   Now, you should be able to see that the chances for the two cases are the exact same. After you shuffle the deck, it doesn't matter if you draw two cards and check the second or you just check the second card without looking at the first; if the second card is a queen, it's a queen, if it's not, it's not.  The flip side of the feeling-based approach is the math to back it up. Let's start with the simple case: you have 52 cards, and want a queen on the second draw. (This has also been done by other answers, but I'll repeat it here.)  You draw a queen on the second draw if:   You draw a queen on the first draw and one on the second
$$\frac{4}{52}*\frac{3}{51}=\frac{12}{2652}=\frac{1}{221}$$  You draw something other than a queen on the first draw and a queen on the second
$$\frac{48}{52}*\frac{4}{51}=\frac{192}{2652}=\frac{16}{221}$$   So in total, the chance is:  $$\frac{1}{221}+\frac{16}{221}=\frac{17}{221}=\frac{4}{52}$$  Now, let's up the ante a little bit. Rather than wanting to know something about queens in a complete deck, I want to know about the more general case. I have a pile of $n$ shuffled cards. In that pile, I know there are $p$ cards that I "like". What I want to know is: what is the chance I draw a card I like.  For the first card, it's simple. The chance simply is $\frac{p}{n}$.  For the second card, we once again have two options:   I like both the first and second card
$$\frac{p}{n}*\frac{p-1}{n-1}=\frac{p^2-p}{n^2-n}$$  I like the second card, but not the first
$$\frac{n - p}{n}*\frac{p}{n-1}=\frac{pn-p^2}{n^2-n}$$   Adding the two, you get:  $$\frac{p^2-p}{n^2-n}+\frac{pn-p^2}{n^2-n}=\frac{p^2+pn-p^2-p}{n^2-n}=\frac{pn-p}{n^2-n}$$  Moving things around a bit more:  $$\frac{pn-p}{n^2-n}=\frac{p(n-1)}{n(n-1)}=\frac{p}{n}$$  Which is the same as the chances for the first card. So, now I can say that no matter the deck size or the amount of cards that represent "success", it doesn't matter if I look to the first or second card to determine success. (Of course, if I look at the second card, it's important that I don't care what the first card is at all.)  I could actually repeat the experiment for each different card in the deck, and then I could draw the conclusion that in general: it doesn't matter if I look at the first or second card, the chances for the card to be a specific one are equal.  The next step could be to proof that the the other cards (third, fourth, etc) have the same chance as well, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.  Disclaimer: my proof probably isn't elegant, optimal or nice, but I do believe it to be correct.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '15 at 15:17             answered May 18 '15 at 15:21       Jasper   181 3                  As pointed out by user CiaPan, a simpler way to proceed after "Moving things around a bit more:" is $\dfrac{pn-p}{n^2 - n} = \dfrac{p(n-1)}{n(n-1)} = \dfrac{p}{n}$. – epimorphic  May 19 '15 at 13:38             To CiaPan: Simplifications are probably best communicated in the comments, given the prohibition against "drastic" edits to non-CW posts authored by others and given that one of the purposes of comments is to "suggest improvements".

If we observed that the first card drawn was a queen, then that would give us a lowered probability of the second card being a queen of $3/51$. However, this is not the same probability as the one asked of in the problem, but the conditional probability given the first card being a queen.  If we instead had had the first card not be a queen, then the conditional probability would have been heightened to $4/51$. The prior probability could then be calculated using the probability of both cases as $$\frac{4}{52}\cdot\frac{3}{51}+\frac{48}{52}\cdot\frac{4}{51}=\frac{4}{52}$$  However, the problem can be simplified as what is important isn't the drawing of the card from the deck, but the observation of the value of the card.  As the value of the first card is never considered in the problem, it can simply be considered as not being drawn at all, which brings us to a second point; If instead of drawing two cards from the deck, you simply fanned out the cards and drew the second card from the top, you would still get the same probabilities as if you chose the top card.  In fact, you would get the same probabilities even if you chose the tenth card or even a card at random. There is nothing special about the top card of the deck unless you choose to do something with it.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 19 '15 at 19:00       PassingStranger   171 3              add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      Consider a more complete event:  When drawing all 52 cards, what is the probability that the second card is a queen?  The reason of changing the original question to this is because this is an expanded process, in other words, if you do draw all cards you certainly drop the first two ones. To solve the new problem is not difficult. One way is to consider every card of the 52 has an equal chance be at the second place. So the probability is 4/52.  It is equal to the same probability that the first card, the 3rd card or the 27th card etc. is a queen, or any other type of card.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 9:02       Serena973   31 2                  If the first card you draw is a queen than the second has a different probability. – hownowbrowncow  May 18 '15 at 13:06            @hownowbrowncow - how, now? – GalacticCowboy  May 18 '15 at 14:13            @GalacticCowboy because then there would be 3 queens within the deck :D – hownowbrowncow  May 18 '15 at 14:21        1      @David  The author didn't specify that one would replace the drawn card back into the deck and therefore, I would assume, one would not.  Thus changing the probability with each additional drawing of a card (the second draw would also have 51 cards within the deck, btw).  Perhaps there is replacement and perfect shuffling after every draw then it's 4/52 all the way down the line. – hownowbrowncow  May 18 '15 at 14:27         1      @hownowbrowncow - A.J.'s answer demonstrates that, even if you consider the first card, the overall probability of card #2 being a queen is still the same. – GalacticCowboy  May 18 '15 at 14:31        |  show 1 more comment            up vote  3  down vote      2 things to consider.  What if the problem stated draw all cards and what is the probability that the last card drawn is a queen then what would your answer be? You might think it is close to 0 because in 51 cards drawn, there is a very good chance that all queens would be already drawn by then.  However, the answer should still be 4/52 because there are 4 queens in the deck and each has an equal chance of being the last card drawn just as all the other cards have.  Also, if you notice on TV when they have Texas Hold 'em, they "waste" the top card when drawing community cards (turn, river...) so if that changed the probability, it would likely be disallowed.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 11:46       David   318 8 30              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      Imagine you buy a ticket in a lottery, where a fraction $p$ of the tickets will win. (From the comments I gather that there are some people who are confused by all kinds of newfangled games with different rules, such as being able to compose the number on one's own ticket; I therefore emphasise this is just an old fashioned lottery with a fixed set of tickets established beforehand, all distinct and all sold before the drawing; drawing then determines a subset of the tickets as winners, with the size of that subset being $p$ times the total number of tickets.) What is your chance of winning? It would be hard to argue that it is anything other then $p$.  But now let us add that before buying a ticket, you had to wait in line, and you happen to notice that the person before you also bought a ticket for the same lottery. Of course you don't know whether her ticket will win, but what is the chance that your ticket will win? It is still $p$. But what if her ticket actually wins? Well with that new information your chances will no doubt be less, but you don't have that information. If her ticket actually looses, that will slightly improve your odds, but you don't know that either. In fact you can be sure that there are hundreds of people who also bought tickets, but as long as you know nothing about their results (and you won't until the winning lots are drawn), it will not affect your chances the slightest bit.  The situation you describe is entirely similar to this.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '15 at 12:28             answered May 18 '15 at 10:34       Marc van Leeuwen   83.1k 4 88 200                  Why would my chances of winning a lottery be less if I know the person in front of me in line already won?  Many lotteries share the jackpot if there are multiple winners.  In that case, my winnings will be reduced but not my chance of winning.  Also if that person loses it will not increase my chance of winning at all. The only exception is if I choose the same numbers as some other person in a lottery (such as 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30). Then if I know that person won then my chances of winning are likely affected (depending on the type of lottery).  You didn't say a fixed fraction will win. – David  May 18 '15 at 11:38             It wouldn't be p if the lottery/drawing is biased (which some are).  For example, if people put their name on a piece of paper and place it into a container to be drawn.  It would depend if they fold it and how and also when they put it in the container since they may not be mixed well before being drawn.  I've actually seen this happen in real life where some last minute entry won because they were not mixed well and they just drew her name from the top. – David  May 18 '15 at 11:51            @David "Imagine you buy a ticket in a lottery, where a fraction p of the tickets will win." <-> "You didn't say a fixed fraction will win." Please elaborate. – Alexander  May 18 '15 at 12:18            @David: I'm using a very simple lottery model, where all tickets are sold, and then a fraction $p$ is drawn as winning lots. Obviously if I know another ticket that wins, that will decrease the chances that my ticket too is among the winners (in an extreme example there is only one winning ticket, and knowing another ticket wins ensures tha mine won't; but even if there are say 2 wins out of 100, then $\frac1{99}$ is worse than $p=\frac2{100}$). I don't know what kind of lottery you are thinking of that would not see my chances diminished by knowing a winner that is not my ticket. – Marc van Leeuwen  May 18 '15 at 12:55             @David: Re-reading what you wrote, I really cannot see what you are worrying about, you must have a strange idea of a lottery. It is not about writing anything on tickets, or putting them in a container, and there cannot be "identical" tickets. Tickets are simply a fixed known collection, say numbers $1$ to $n$, and when all are sold then some $k$ of these numbers are "drawn" (from a separate copy of those numbers) to be winning numbers. The chance of winning with one ticket is $p=\frac kn$. Also  I don't see what complaining about biased-ness in real-world lotteries has to do with this. – Marc van Leeuwen  May 18 '15 at 13:10         |  show 3 more comments            up vote  1  down vote      put the first card back in the deck; now you've only drawn one card. the chance it's queen 4/52     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 17:57       Thanos Tintinidis   257 1 5              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Can I convince you of this statement:  If I draw two cards, the probability that the first card is a queen is the same as the probability that the second card is a queen.

You have two goats and a car, if you open two doors, what is the chance that there is a goat behind the second door?  What is the chance it is a car? 2/3 and 1/3 respectively.  After you open the first door, and find that it is a car, you can say that there is zero chance that there is a car behind the second door.  But at that point, they are no longer independent events, which is why in the Monty Hall problem you always switch.  In this case you are effectively saying that the second card is a queen, and you are doing this before you know what the first card was . The chance that that is correct is 1/13.  It (the chance you were correct) will remain 1 in 13 until either the second card is revealed or the position of all queens have been determined, at which point it is not a matter of probability.  In both cases the odds of you having identified the card is unchanged, what changes is the current odds of that card being a queen (ie is this one of the 1 in 13 times where you were correct).  This is where people go wrong with the Monty Hall problem, they confuse the current odds of the car being behind the door with the odds that they correctly identified the door with the car.  In this instance the confusion is between having identified the card vs the card actually being.  Here's another way of looking at it.  Your odds of correctly predicting card 2 is 1 in 13.  So take 4 decks of cards, divide them into 13 rows by   suit (throwing away the 3 extra suits).  Then pick a value for the 2nd card in each row.  Now start randomly revealing cards until each row has been determined -- do you expect this random reveal to result in you having correctly guessed more than the expected 1 row?  Is it any different from just revealing the 2nd card of each row?  Now, suppose that someone who knows what the cards are does the reveal, revealing each card  until there are only 2 cards left per row -- when you do the final reveal for each row, how many rows would you expect to have guessed correctly?  Your chance of predicting the card in advance is 1 in 13 for each row, and it remains 1 in 13 -- revealing cards doesn't change the odds of your having guessed correctly. Your guess is in the past and is now fixed, forever unchanging .  Either it was right or it wasn't.   What changes (assuming random reveal) is my current odds of guessing whether you were right or not .  As with the related Deal Or No Deal game, I get additional information with each random reveal.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 5 '17 at 12:30             answered May 18 '15 at 15:04       jmoreno   341 1 6              2      You start by saying that this is basically the Monty Hall problem, and then you explain that the Monty Hall problem is different from this.

As you note, the probability of drawing the Queen of Spades first is $\frac{1}{52}$.  The next question is: what is the probability of not drawing the Queen of Spades, and then drawing her next? It is $\frac{51}{52}\frac{1}{51}$. I leave it to you to do the calculation.  The next question is: what is the probability of not drawing the Queen of Spades, then not drawing the Queen of Spades, and then drawing her next? It is $\frac{51}{52}\frac{50}{51}\frac{1}{50}$. I leave it to you to do the calculation.  The answer to your question is therefore $\frac{1}{52}+\frac{1}{52}+\frac{1}{52}$.  (I think, though I am sure someone will correct me if I am wrong, that this is the principle of linearity of expectation at work. The expected number of Queens of Spades drawn in $n$ drawings is $n$ times the expected number of Queens of Spades drawn in one drawing - and this is true whether or not you put each card back into the pack after drawing it).     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 29 '16 at 8:10       Martin Kochanski   1,879 1 9              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Now, you have your four cases, in three of them (a2), (b1), (b2), there is at least one queen, the probability for each of them is the product of the first fraction and the second fraction, for example, the scenario a1 has this probability:  (52-4)/52  *  (51-4)/51 = 0.851 (approximate value)  If you have done everything right, you will also find that the sum of all possibilities is equal to 1.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 8 '16 at 4:25       user289661   217 1 12              add a comment |       Not the answer you're looking for?

Hint: define events F 0 , F 1 , F 2 , F 3 such that F i corresponds to the event that there are i queens initially placed in the second set.    probability     share | cite | improve this question     asked Oct 9 '12 at 22:46       user33195   1              add a comment |           3 Answers 3     active  oldest  votes            up vote  3  down vote      There's no need to distinguish those events. The remaining three queens are uniformly distributed among $51$ cards, so the probability of each of the cards originally in the second set to be a queen is $3/51=1/17$. You have a $1$ in $27$ chance of drawing the queen of hearts and a $26$ in $27$ chance of drawing one of the other cards, whose probability to be a queen is $1$ in $17$, so the probability is  $$
\frac1{27}+\frac{26}{27}\cdot\frac1{17}=\frac{17+26}{17\cdot27}=\frac{43}{459}\approx0.09368\;.
$$  As a rough check, there should be approximately $5/2$ queens in the second set now on average (not exactly because it contains slightly more than half of the unknown cards), so the probability of drawing one should be approximately $5/(2\cdot27)=5/54\approx0.09259$, which works out nicely.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 9 '12 at 22:59             answered Oct 9 '12 at 22:54       joriki   155k 9 171 318                  +1 Nice sanity check. – Michael Joyce  Oct 10 '12 at 2:35        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Based on your hint, can you compute 
$$
\mathbb{P}(Q|F_i),
$$
for $i=0,1,2,3$ and where $Q$ is the event "drawing a Queen in the second pack." Then $\mathbb{P}(Q)$ is just the sum of the conditionnal probabilities abovetimes the probabilities of each $F_i$.  Edit  Just to clarify my comment, you need to be careful when making a hand of $26$ cards that has no queen, $1$ queen, etc. Normally you would divide by $\binom{52}{26}$, but knowing that you have the Queen of heart in the other pack changes things. The term in the sum would be
$$
\mathbb{P}(Q|F_0)\mathbb{P}(F_0)=\frac{1}{27}\times \frac{\overbrace{\binom{48}{26}}^{26 \text{ cards that are not queens}}\times\overbrace{\binom{3}{0}}^{\text{   $0$ queen from the $3$}}}{\binom{51}{26}}

For each of the other three Queens, if it is in the second set (with probability $26/51$), then it will be drawn with probability $1/27$; otherwise it cannot be drawn.  The total probability is therefore
$$
P_Q = \frac{1}{27}+3\cdot\frac{26}{51}\cdot\frac{1}{27}=\frac{129}{1377}=\frac{43}{459}.
$$
Note that the same method can be used to calculate the probability of drawing some other rank, say a King.  For each of the four Kings, if it is in the second set (with probability $26/51$), then it will be drawn with probability $1/27$; the probability of drawing a King is then
$$
P_K = 4\cdot \frac{26}{51}\cdot\frac{1}{27}=\frac{104}{1377}.
$$
As a nice sanity check, note that
$$
P_Q + 12P_K = \frac{129 + 12\cdot 104}{1377}=1,$$
as is should, since the twelve non-Queen ranks are all equally probable, and you must draw something when you draw from the second set.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Oct 10 '12 at 2:38             answered Oct 10 '12 at 2:33       mjqxxxx   28.1k 2 37 78              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Two things: * the GMAT will *never* ask questions about standard decks of cards, since people who play bridge or poker would have a substantial (and unfair) advantage over people who do not; * the GMAT will *never* use notation like '52C2' in an answer choice. That's not even a standard notation in general mathematics; it's more a convenient shorthand to use in internet forums. GMAT answer choices will always be written either as numbers, or using factorials So that makes me wonder what the source is for these questions, and whether it contains a lot of other irrelevant material. In any case, there are 4 Kings and 4 Queens in a standard deck. We need our first card to be one of these 8; there is an 8/52 probability our first card is from this group. Then when we pick the second card, we will be picking from 51 cards in total, and there will be 4 left which are of the type we need (if we picked a King first, we need one of the four Queens and vice versa), so there is a 4/51 probability the second card is the right type, and the answer is (8/52)(4/51). That is equal to answer choice B, though you'd never see anything that looks like answer choice B on the GMAT. It's a bit absurd to write '4C1' in that answer choice anyway, since '4C1' is just equal to 4. _________________  GMAT Tutor in Toronto If you are looking for online GMAT math tutoring, or if you are interested in buying my advanced Quant books and problem sets, please contact me at ianstewartgmat at gmail.com                         amit2k9      VP           Status: There is always something new !!

Two things: * the GMAT will *never* ask questions about standard decks of cards, since people who play bridge or poker would have a substantial (and unfair) advantage over people who do not; * the GMAT will *never* use notation like '52C2' in an answer choice. That's not even a standard notation in general mathematics; it's more a convenient shorthand to use in internet forums. GMAT answer choices will always be written either as numbers, or using factorials So that makes me wonder what the source is for these questions, and whether it contains a lot of other irrelevant material. In any case, there are 4 Kings and 4 Queens in a standard deck. We need our first card to be one of these 8; there is an 8/52 probability our first card is from this group. Then when we pick the second card, we will be picking from 51 cards in total, and there will be 4 left which are of the type we need (if we picked a King first, we need one of the four Queens and vice versa), so there is a 4/51 probability the second card is the right type, and the answer is (8/52)(4/51). That is equal to answer choice B, though you'd never see anything that looks like answer choice B on the GMAT. It's a bit absurd to write '4C1' in that answer choice anyway, since '4C1' is just equal to 4. _________________  GMAT Tutor in Toronto If you are looking for online GMAT math tutoring, or if you are interested in buying my advanced Quant books and problem sets, please contact me at ianstewartgmat at gmail.com                         amit2k9      VP           Status: There is always something new !!

Ask New Question   DV Harris , Magician at Magic by Darryl Answered Dec 12, 2016 · Author has 543 answers and 337.9k answer views Good Day Mr. Cook, I am so sorry, but I am a magician, not a mathematician. This type of information is of little use to the working performer. The answer is likely much more complex than I am thinking, and perhaps be directed to someone like Persi Diaconis. The short answer is with 52 cards in a standard deck, the odds of choosing any one specific cards is one in 52. It seems to me that opening the parameters to select one of a kind e.g., any of the kings, from a standard deck is 4 in 52. I guess the odds of picking a different specific value, i.e., Queens, afterwards is 4 in 51. Jacks would be 4 in 50. There is likely some other factor involved that bigger brains than mine can help direct you. 2.2k Views · Answer requested by  Thomas Cook promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

There are 52 cards total in the deck. The probability of getting a queen first would be [math]\frac{4}{52}[/math] , but since we want to know the probability of getting a king after that assuming the queen wasn’t replaced, all we need to do is multiply it out: P(king | queen not replaced) = [math]\frac{4}{52} * \frac{4}{51} = \frac{16}{2652}[/math] We get [math]\frac{4}{51}[/math] for the second fraction because there are still 4 kings in the deck, but since the queen wasn’t put back in the pile, it reduces the number of cards in the deck by one, giving us 51.

Ask New Question   Suren Basov , PhD Economics, Boston University (2001) Answered Feb 4, 2018 First, the probability of drawing a king at the first draw is 4/52=1/13. Conditionally on a king being drawn on the first draw, the probability of drawing a queen at the second draw is 4/51. Therefore, probability of drawing sequence KQ is 1/13*(4/51)=4/663. If you care about the order, then your answer is 4/663, which is approximately 0.6%. If you do not care about the order, then you should consider both events KQ and QK a success, in which case your probability is twice this value, i.e. 8/663, which is approximately 1.2%. 188 Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  ABDULMALIK DANMALIKI promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

There are just (2)(4^2) = 32 ways (permutations) of drawing a king and queen together.

Update Cancel Answer Wiki 1 Answer   Mohammed Ateeq , Intern at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Limited Answered Dec 16, 2017 First card will be drawn out of a group of 8 cards (i.e. 4 kings and 4 queens). Probability of first card is 8/52. The probability of second card is 4/51, because you have to pick one card out of 4 cards of the other type (pick one queen if one king was already picked in first draw or vice versa) out of 51 remaining cards. So the total probability is (8/52)*(4/51). 208 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by UC Berkeley Extension Want to learn basic statistic concepts?

Undo Answer Wiki 2 Answers   Brad Martsberger Answered Sep 13, 2016 Your first answer [math]\frac{4}{52} * \frac{4}{51} * \frac{4}{50}[/math] is the probability of getting first a King, then a Queen, then a Jack. Each factor in the product represents drawing a particular card. Your second answer [math]\frac{4c1 * 4c1 * 4c1}{52c3}[/math] is the number of ways of drawing the cards in any order. The numerator is the total number of ways of selecting a King, Queen, and Jack from the deck and the denominator is the total number of ways of ordering the entire deck. To make these answers line up, we have to include in the first answer the possibility that the cards could come in any order. There are 6 ways they could come (KQJ, KJQ, QKJ, QJK, JKQ, JQK). If you multiply your first result by 6, it will match your second result. 2.3k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below Out of a deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of getting one king and one queen?

If you spread the deck out faces up, unless someone's removed either all the kings or all the queens, I'd say that your chances of finding one of each would be very good. But, if you mean by randomly choosing two of them without replacement, that's different. [math]\qquad P=\cfrac{8}{52}\cdot\cfrac{4}{51}=\cfrac{32}{2652}=\cfrac{8}{663}\approx1.2066\%[/math] On the first draw, to be consistent with the goal, there are 8 cards of the 52 that that can be drawn. On the second draw, whether the first was a king or a queen, there are 4 cards of the remaining 51 that can be drawn to complete the goal. 851 Views   Harry Strand , Have been playing cards for over half a century. Answered Oct 22, 2017 · Author has 662 answers and 100.1k answer views Thanks for the question John, Don't know why you would need to know this, unless it is a homework problem. I will assume that you mean if you draw two and only two cards without replacement. The chance of getting your first card to be a King or a Queen would be 8/52. The chance of your second card being one you need would be 4/51. Now just multiply them together to get your answer. You must do some of the work here! 348 Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  John Lund   Dmitriy Genzel , PhD in CS Answered Apr 30, 2016 · Author has 1.9k answers and 8.4m answer views If you draw two cards? In any order or in that order? If you draw two cards in this order, first you get a king: there are 4 out of 52, and then a queen, there are 4 out of 51 (since the king is already out). So that's [math]\frac{4*4}{52*51} = 0.006[/math] . If you mean in any order, then of course the answer it twice this, because there are two possible orders with this same probability. 1.5k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by DigitalOcean Deploy your Python project - free $100/60-day credit.

Each suit consists of ace, king, queen, jack, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three and deuce.  13in all.  A single card is chosen at random.  Find the odds against its being a red queen?  How many cards will I have to draw to be absolutely certain that I have drawn three black cards       Tabyia,  I'm going to find the odds against drawing a jack.  There are 4 jacks in the deck of 52 cards so the probability of of drawing a jack is 4/52 = 1/13. Hence the probability of not drawing a jack is 1 - (1/13) = 12/13. Therefore, in the long run, if you select a card many times you expect that, on the average, 12 of every 13 times you don't draw a jack and 1 of every 13 times you do draw a jack. Thus the odds against selecting a jack is 12:1. (This is read as 12 to 1.)  Use the same procedure to find the odds against drawing a red queen.

In common usage, the word probability is used to mean the 
	chance that a particular event (or set of events) will 
	occur expressed on a linear scale from 0 (impossibility) to 1 (certainty), 
	also expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100%.  In this lesson we 
	will discuss theoretical probability and empirical probability. An Experiment is an occurrence for which the outcome is 
	uncertain. For example, tossing a coin. A Sample Space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment 
	and is usually denoted with a 
	capital S . For instance, the sample space for tossing a quarter is  S = { H, T } , 
	where H symbolizes "lands heads up" and  T stands for "lands tails up." An Event is a  subset of the sample space.  We denote 
	an event by capital E . For example, the subset E = { H } is the event of a tossed quarter landing 
	heads up and the subset E = { T } is the event of a tossed quarter landing 
	tails up. The probability of an event  E occurring is denoted 
	by P(E) . We will discuss Theoretical and Empirical Probability .  Theoretical Probability Theoretical probability applies to situations in which the sample space only 
	contains equally likely outcomes all of which are known, like in the 
	quarter-tossing experiment above.  Heads up and tails up are equally 
	likely and we know that it will be either one or the other.  
	Theoretical probability applies to many games of chance, including roulette, 
	cards, dice rolling, and lotteries.  Computing Theoretical Probability  Example 1: A quarter is tossed.  It is equally likely to land heads up or tails 
	up.  The probability of the quarter landing heads up 
is  The probability of the quarter landing tails up 
is  NOTE:  The sum of the theoretical probabilities of all possible 
outcomes in the sample space equals 1.  Example 2: You are 
dealt one card from a standard 52-card deck.  Find the probability of being 
dealt a.  a 
queen b.  a 
diamond c.  a 
queen of diamonds d.  a 
black card e.  a 
black king  Please note that a standard 52-card deck has 13 
spades, 13 hearts, 13 diamonds, and 13 clubs!   Since we are told that the 
deck contains 52 cards, the number of outcomes in the sample space  S is , which will be used as the denominator of each 
probability fraction. a.  Let's find the 
probability 
of being dealt a queen.  There are four queens in the deck.  See 
picture above.  Therefore, this event can occur in 4 different ways, that 
is, . The probability of 
being dealt a queen is  b.  Let's find the 
probability 
of being dealt a diamond.  There are thirteen diamonds in the deck.  
See picture above.  Therefore, this event can occur in 13 different ways, 
that is, . The probability of 
being dealt a diamond is c.  Let's 
find the probability of being dealt a queen of diamonds.  There is only one card 
in the deck that is a queen of diamonds .  See picture above.  
Therefore, this event can occur in exactly 1 way, that is, . The 
probability of being dealt a queen of diamonds is d.  Let's find the 
probability 
of being dealt a black card.  There are twenty-six black cards in the deck.  
See picture above.  Therefore, this event can occur in 26 different ways, 
that is, . The probability of 
being dealt a black card is  e.  Let's find the 
probability of being dealt a black king.  There are two black kings in the deck.  
See picture above.  Therefore, this event can occur in 2 different ways, 
that is, . The probability of 
being dealt a black king is   Empirical Probability  Empirical probability applies to situations in which we observe how 
	frequently an even occurs.   Computing Empirical Probability  Example 3: The U.S. 
Census Bureau claims that there are 59.2 million individuals over age 18 in the 
U.S. who have never been married.  Find the empirical probability of 
selecting a never married person from the U.S. population of 225.8 million.  The 
empirical probability of selecting a never married person from the U.S. population 
is approximately 0.26.

How to fix it   I don't own this page   The page owner blocked this page from Google in a suboptimal way, so we couldn't create a good page description. If you know the site owners, let them know that "robots.txt is blocking Google and can't create a site description in search results".     I own this page   You are seeing this result because the page is blocked by a robots.txt file entry , which tells Google not to crawl your page. You can take either of these two steps:   Fix the page description, or  Remove the page entirely from Google search results.   To fix the page description  If you want a proper description to appear in search results for your page, you must enable Google to read the page. If you don't want the page to appear in search results at all, see the next section "Remove the page entirely from search results."  The reason Google can't read the page is that it has a special file (called robots.txt) blocking the page. Here's how to remove the blockage:   If you are using a content management system for your website (for example, if your site is on Wix, Joomla, or Drupal), search for "robots.txt" in your host's documentation to learn how to unblock your page or site to Google.  If you are managing your own site pages directly , learn more about robots.txt here . You'll need to unblock your site or page to Googlebot.   To remove the page from search results  If you intended to hide your page entirely from Google Search results, follow these steps:   Remove the robots.txt rule that blocks the page to search engines. Your page is still appearing in search (though without a description) because the page is blocked by a robots.txt file. You must first unblock Google access to that page (which sounds counterintuitive, but that's what you must do). Learn about robots.txt here .  Block search engines from indexing the page. Implement one of the following three methods to permanently block the page from search results:  Remove the page entirely from your site.  Require a user login to access the page.  Use "noindex" on your page .    Remove the page from Google Search results using the remove outdated content tool . Copy the URL from search results into the tool. If you do this without following any of the previous steps, the page can reappear in search.            Was this article helpful? How can we improve it?

( self.learnmath ) submitted 4 years ago  * by [deleted] I'm having a lot of trouble this week in my Probability & Statistics class so I'm trying to go back through the book and do every problem from the chapter we just finished. I apologize in advance for my lack of LaTeX formatting knowledge.  The current one I'm stuck on is as follows:   What is the probability that a 13-card hand dealt from a deck of 52 cards will contain  (a) the Queen of spades,
(b) five spades and 8 cards from other suits,
(c) five spades, five hearts, two diamonds, and the Ace of clubs?   I'm only concerned with (a) right now:
My thinking is that I'd multiply the probability of choosing the Queen of spades (1/52) by the number of choices of the other cards in the hand (51 C 12) and divide that product by the total number of possibilities of all 13-card hands (52 C 13). This results in an answer of P= 0.00481 which seems reasonable, but I'm not sure.  If that works, then for (b) I'd multiply the probability of getting a spade (1/4) by itself 5 times for (1/4) 5 signifying 5 favorable outcomes. Multiply (1/4) 5 by the probability number of possibilities of choosing 8 other random cards (47 C 8), multiply that by the probability of NOT choosing a spade eight times (3/4) 8 and divide the whole product by (52 C 13) again.  It follows that for (c) I'd multiply the probability of drawing five spades (1/4) 5 by the probability of drawing five hearts (1/4) 5 and by the probability of drawing two diamonds (1/4) 2 and by the probability of drawing the Ace of clubs (1/52) and divide the whole product by (52 C 13).  EDIT: My work for (b) and (c) results in 4.84138E-8 and 1.8051E-21 so those definitely aren't correct.

Create an account [–] picado  1 point 2 points 3 points  4 years ago  (5 children) (a)  Almost, except it's C(51,12)/C(52,13), there's no factor of 1/52 at the start.  You're counting all the deals with AS, which is the same as what the other 12 are, then dividing that by all deals.  That's going to be 1/4. In general with a k card deal it's k/52. A bunch of ways to see that, one would be the odds of not getting an AS would be 51/52 on the first card, 50/51 on the second, etc.  (51/52)(50/51)(49/50)...((52-k)/(52-k+1)) = (52-k)/52 = 1 - k/52   permalink embed save give gold [–] Servaphetic  1 point 2 points 3 points  4 years ago  (0 children) This can also be thought of as (C(1,1)) (C(51,12))/(C(52,13)) (which might be similar to examples OP should've seen in class + might help with the extra questions).   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 years ago  (3 children)  You're counting all the deals with AS, which is the same as what the other 12 are, then dividing that by all deals.   I'm not sure I follow. I see that C(51,12)/C(52,13) is 1/4 but I guess I don't understand the reasoning.  I just assume that I have the favorable card I'm looking for and then find the number of possibilities of the rest of the k-1 cards in the hand being selected from the remaining 51 cards, and then divide that by the total number of possibilities of 13-card hands from 52 cards?  I can take that on faith but then I have no idea what to do for the (b) and (c) since those definitely aren't coming out correctly.  For (b), I don't get reasonable answers when I factor in the probabilities of drawing 5 spades and then 8 cards from other suits (1/4) 5 * (3/4) 8. Maybe it should be C(13,4) * C(39, 8) / C(52,13)? That yields 0.06927 which seems possible.  Following that same thinking for (c), I have C(13,5) C(39,8) (1/31)/C(52,13) where (1/31) is the probability of drawing the Ace of clubs when the other 12 cards aren't it. That yields 0.00402 which seems further outside the realm of possibility but I don't know enough to make that judgment.   permalink embed save parent [–] picado  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 years ago  (2 children) You're mixing two ways of looking at it. One is counting, where you're asking how many deals have the property you want. The other is picking, going step by step by probability. They get the same answer, but you can't mix and match.  I'll give you another picking way. On the first card, probability is 1/52 -- your start before. Now on the second, it's (51/52)(1/51). That's a (51/52) probability that you didn't already pick it on the first, times a (1/51) that you get it this time. On the third, (51/52)(50/51)(1/50).  (1/52)+(51/52)(1/51)+(51/52)(50/51)(1/50)+..... = (1/52)+(1/52)+(1/52)+.....  dealing k cards, that's k/52.  You could also think of that as, there's 1/52 chance it's the first card. There's a 1/52 chance it's the second card. Etc. And all those probabilities are exclusive, so you can add them.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] [deleted]  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 years ago  (1 child) Alright, I think I understand that now, I appreciate the help!  How do I approach these other two problems where multiple probabilities are involved?  For (b), I've tried going the wholly counting method route and using [(1/4) 5 * (3/4) 8] * 5! * 8!/C(52,13) and all manner of other weird-looking calculations. Nothing seems to give me a reasonable answer.  Picking isn't working well either, C(52,5) C(47,8)/C(52,13) didn't work, nor did C(52,5) C(39,8)/C(52,13), where C(39,8) is the total number of choices of 8 cards from the 39 non-spades.  I'm missing the necessary intuition here.   permalink embed save parent [–] zyxophoj  0 points 1 point 2 points  4 years ago  (0 children)  [(1/4) 5 * (3/4) 8] * 5! * 8!/C(52,13)   There are some things wrong here.  The probability of picking 5 spades isn't (1/4) 5. This is because once you pull one spade out, the rest of the deck contains 51 cards and 12 spades.  So the probability of picking a second is 12/51, not 13/52.  Similarly, 11/50, 10/49 and 9/48 for the rest.  (Perhaps the easiest way to get this is to think about the probability of getting all spades in a hand of 14 cards - it's not (1/4) 14 :D )  (3/4) 8 has exactly the same problem, although if you've done the spades first, there are now 47 cards..  So really, this should be:  (13/52)(12/51)...(9/48) * (39/47)(38/46)...(32/40), which we could rewrite as (13! 39! 39!)/(8! 31! 52!) (ugh)  Then you multiply by 5! and 8! .. why? It looks like you're trying to take care of the order issues, but this is backwards.  Look at (13/52)(12/51)(11/51)(10/49)(9/48) - that's the probability of getting any spade as your first card times the probability of getting any other spade as the second card...etc.  It is the probability of getting 5 spades as the first 5 cards in any order .  So if this is just a probability calculation, you don't need to do anything.  (13/52)..(9/48) * (39/47) ... (32/40) is the probability of getting 5 spades as the first 5 cards plus 8 not-spades as the next 8 cards. But since the spades can be in any position, that's not right.  In how many ways can the 5 spades be placed?  That's just C(13,5)  So the answer is:  (13! 39! 39!)/(8! 31! 52!) * 13!/(5! 8!)  (39! 39! 13! 13!)/(5! 8! 8! 31! 52!)  = (39! 13!)/(5! 8! 8! 31!)/C(52,13)  = [ C(13,5) C(39,8) ]/C(52,13)  ...and this is the other way of doing it.  Pick 5 spades out of 13 spades, 8 not-spades out of 39 not-spades, divide by the total number of possibilities: 13 cards out of 52.   nor did C(52,5)C(39,8)/C(52,13)   You were pretty close with this one, but you seem to think there are C(52,5) ways to pick 5 spades.

A counting challenge from Science Buddies By Science Buddies on September 27, 2012 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon  Credit: George Retseck Advertisement   Key concepts Mathematics Probability Chance Strategy Cards   Introduction Have you ever been playing cards and wished you could use psychic powers to draw the card you wanted? You may not be psychic, but you can still have the power of probability on your side. In this activity you'll investigate the probabilities of drawing specific types of cards from a deck. You'll discover how math can help you avoid the dreaded phrase, "Go fish!"   Background When you draw a card from a deck, you have a certain chance of getting a specific type of card, such as a spade or face card, or one particular card, such as the queen of hearts. Consider the game "Go Fish" with a regular card deck. The goal is to get the most four-of-a-kind sets by asking your opponent for matching cards or by drawing them from the deck. To win, you can rely on chance or you can increase your probability of getting matching cards, but how?  By understanding how chance is related to math, you can play with a winning strategy. For example, if you have three kings and one queen in your hand and it's your turn to ask for a card, which one should you ask your opponent for? You might think you should ask for a king, but it's actually better to take a queen! Why? Because you have a better chance of getting it. There are four kings and four queens in the deck, and with three kings and one queen in your hand, there's one king and three queens left. This gives you only one chance to get a king, but three chances to get a queen out of the remaining cards.   Materials •     Standard deck of playing cards •     Piece of paper •     Pencil or pen •     Calculator   Preparation •     Count the cards in the deck and make sure it is complete. (There should be 54 cards total.) Take out the two jokers. Shuffle the deck three times and set aside. •     Pick four types of cards to investigate, such as a color, suit, number or face card, and a specific one. For example, you could investigate red cards, spades, kings and the queen of hearts. •     Draw a table to in which to record your data. Make a column for each card type you'll investigate. In the first row write how many of that type of card are in the deck. For example, there are 26 red cards in a deck, 13 spades, four kings and one queen of hearts. Make 10 rows below this one for the 10 trials you will be doing.   Procedure •     Decide which type of card you will investigate first. Draw cards from the top of the deck and flip them over one at a time, counting as you go, and stop when you see that type of card. How many cards did you draw until you reached that card? Write down the answer in your table. •     Shuffle the deck again and repeat this process, flipping over the cards and looking for the same type of card. How many cards did it take this time? Write down the answer in your table. Repeat this for a total of 10 times for one type of card. •     Repeat this process for each of the four types of cards you picked to investigate. This means that you will have looked for each type of card a total of 10 times. •     Calculate the average number of cards you drew to reach each type of card. Label the last row in your table "Averages" and write them in this row. • Which types of cards were the easiest to draw? Which were the most difficult? How do you think the chances of drawing a card relate to the total number of that card type in the deck? • Based on what you saw in this activity, how do you think probability can help you choose the right strategy in a card game? • Extra: A more advanced way of showing the results of your experiment would be to make histograms, which are a type of graph to show distributions. Try making a separate histogram for each type of card you tested by graphing the number of cards drawn for each trial separately in a bar graph. When all of the bars are lined up next to each other, what does the overall shape of the distribution look like? • Extra: The probability of drawing a particular type of card also depends on the number of cards drawn each time. Try doing this activity again but draw samples of three, five or seven cards at a time. Do your chances improve as more cards are taken? • Extra: Probabilities can change your strategies for playing a card game. Can you design an experiment to show how probabilities can help you choose cards and win "Go Fish"? What about other popular card games? Can you invent your own game based on probabilities?   Observations and results Did it take fewer draws to reach a certain color than it took to reach a certain suit or kind of card? Did it take even more draws to reach a specific card?  Mathematicians measure probability by counting and using some very basic math, like addition and division. For example, you can add up the number of spades in a complete deck (13) and divide this by the total number of cards in the deck (52) to get the probability of randomly drawing a spade: 13 in 52, or 25 percent. If you were investigating red cards, kings or the queen of hearts, the odds of randomly drawing one of these from a complete deck are 50 percent (26 in 52); about 7.7 percent (four in 52); or about 1.9 percent (one in 52), respectively. This is why, on average (when done over enough trials), it is easier to draw a red card than a spade, a spade than a king, and a king than the queen of hearts. As you draw cards from a deck, the odds of finding your card change. For example, if you are looking for a spade and do not get it on your first draw, there are still 13 spades in the deck but the deck now holds only 51 cards, so your odds of drawing a spade on the second draw are 13 in 51, or about 25.5 percent. This may not seem like much of an improvement, but with every draw the odds continue to increase.
