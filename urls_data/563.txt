Here are 10 things to consider - for one day only. Until 2016, that is. 1. The leap year's extra day is necessary because of the "messiness" of our Solar System. One Earth year (a complete orbit around the Sun) does not take an exact number of whole days (one complete spin of the Earth on its axis). In fact, it takes 365.2422 days, give or take. 2. Until Julius Caesar came to power, people observed a 355-day calendar - with an extra 22-day month every two years. But it was a convoluted solution to the problem and feast days began sliding into different seasons. So Caesar ordered his astronomer, Sosigenes, to simplify things. Sosigenes opted for the 365-day year with an extra day every four years to scoop up the extra hours. This is how the 29 February was born. It was then fine-tuned by Pope Gregory XIII (see below). 3. Every fourth year is a leap year, as a rule of thumb. But that's not the end of the story. A year that is divisible by 100, but not by 400, is not. So 2000 was a leap year under the Gregorian calendar, as was 1600. But 1700, 1800 and 1900 are not leap years. "It seems a bit arbitrary," says Ian Stewart, emeritus professor of mathematics at Warwick University. But there's a good reason behind it.     "The year is 365 days and a quarter long - but not exactly. If it was exactly, then you could say it was every four years. But it is very slightly less." The answer arrived at by Pope Gregory XIII and his astronomers when they introduced the Gregorian calendar in 1582, was to lose three leap days every 400 years. The maths has hung together ever since. It will need to be rethought in about 10,000 years' time, Stewart warns. But by then mankind might have come up with a new system.  PM's Leap Day  By Eddie Mair Presenter, PM  All this month on PM, listeners have been asked whether they'd be prepared to take advantage of this extra day to do something different.  It transpires there are a lot of people who're ready to use today to take a leap .  There's the apparently mundane... "I resolve to speak Mandarin all day long"… "my partner and I are going to visit some elderly people"... "often meant to take a roof tour of Lincoln Cathedral but never got round to it".  After six years one woman will finally decide the wording for her husband's headstone. Some people are at last scattering the ashes of loved ones having put it off for years.  There's a woman taking up the hula-hoop after more than 50 years.       One woman intends to have some chocolate today - her anorexia has been a problem for years. A man who suffers panic attacks will try to make a bus journey. And a woman in her 60s will get a tattoo.  PM is on BBC Radio Four, Monday to Saturday at 17:00 GMT  PM blog  4. Why is February 29, not February 31, a leap year day? All the other months have 30 or 31 days, but February suffered from the ego of Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus, says Stewart. Under Julius Caesar, February had 30 days, but when Caesar Augustus was emperor he was peeved that his month - August - had only 29 days, whereas the month named after his predecessor Julius - July - had 31. "He pinched a couple of days for August to make it the same as July. And it was poor old February that lost out," says Prof Stewart. 5. The tradition of a woman proposing on a leap year has been attributed to various historical figures. One, although much disputed, was St Bridget in the 5th Century. She is said to have complained to St Patrick that women had to wait too long for their suitors to propose. St Patrick then supposedly gave women a single day in a leap year to pop the question - the last day of the shortest month. Another popular story is that Queen Margaret of Scotland brought in a law setting fines for men who turned down marriage proposals put by women on a leap year. Sceptics have pointed out that Margaret was five years old at the time and living far away in Norway. The tradition is not thought to have become commonplace until the 19th Century. It is believed that the tradition of women proposing on this day goes back to the times when the leap year day was not recognised by English law. Under this theory, if the day had no legal status, it was acceptable to break with the convention of a man proposing. 6. A prayer has been written by a female cleric for people planning a leap year day marriage proposal. The prayer, for 29 February, asks for blessings on the engaged couple. It reminds them that wedding plans should not overtake preparations for a lifetime together. The prayer has been taken from Pocket Prayers of Blessing by the Venerable Jan McFarlane, Archdeacon of Norwich: "God of love, please bless N and N as they prepare for the commitment of marriage. May the plans for the wedding not overtake the more important preparation for their lifetime together. Please bless their family and friends as they prepare for this special day and may your blessing be upon them now and always. Amen." 7. The practice of women proposing in a leap year is different around the world. In Denmark, it is not supposed to be 29 but 24 February, which hails back to the time of Julius Caesar. A refusal to marry by Danish men means they must give the woman 12 pairs of gloves. In Finland, it is not gloves but fabric for a skirt and in Greece, marriage in a leap year is considered unlucky, leading many couples to avoid it. 8. The chance of being born on a leap day is often said to be one in 1,461. Four years is 1,460 days and adding one for the leap year you have 1,461. So, odds of 1/1,461. But Stewart points out that is very slightly out, owing to the loss of the three leap years every 400 years. In any case, babies are more likely to be born at certain times of the year rather than others, due to a range of other factors, he says. Babies born on 29 February are known as "leapers" or "leaplings". 9. Other calendars apart from the Gregorian require leap years. The modern Iranian calendar is a solar calendar with eight leap days inserted into a 33-year cycle. The Indian National Calendar and the Revised Bangla Calendar of Bangladesh arrange their leap years so that the leap day is always close to 29 February in the Gregorian calendar. 10. Explorer Christopher Columbus used the lunar eclipse of 29 February 1504 to his advantage during his final trip to the West Indies. After several months of being stranded with his crew on the island of Jamaica, relations with the indigenous population broke down and they refused to continue helping with food and provisions. Columbus, knowing a lunar eclipse was due, consulted his almanac and then gathered the native chiefs on 29 February. He told that God was to punish them by painting the Moon red. During the eclipse, he said that God would withdraw the punishment if they starting co-operating again. The panicked chiefs agreed and the Moon began emerging from its shadow. Also of a supernatural nature, on 29 February 1692 the first warrants were issued in the Salem witchcraft trials in Massachusetts.

A leap day is added in various solar calendars (calendars based on the Earth's revolution around the Sun ), including the Gregorian calendar standard in most of the world. Lunisolar calendars (whose months are based on the phases of the Moon ) instead add a leap or intercalary month. [1]  In the Gregorian calendar , years that are divisible by 100, but not by 400, do not contain a leap day. Thus, 1700 , 1800 , and 1900 did not contain a leap day; neither will 2100 , 2200 , and 2300 . Conversely, 1600 and 2000 did and 2400 will. Years containing a leap day are called leap years . Years not containing a leap day are called common years . February 29 is the 60th day of the Gregorian calendar, in such a year, with 306 days remaining until the end of the year. In the Chinese calendar , this day will only occur in years of the monkey , dragon , and rat .  A leap day is observed because the Earth 's period of orbital revolution around the Sun takes approximately 6 hours longer than 365 whole days. A leap day compensates for this lag, realigning the calendar with the Earth 's position in the Solar System ; otherwise, seasons would occur later than intended in the calendar year. The Julian calendar used in Christendom until the 16th century added a leap day every four years; but this rule adds too many days (roughly 3 every 400 years), making the equinoxes and solstices shift gradually to earlier dates. By the 16th century the vernal equinox had drifted to March 11 , and the Gregorian calendar was introduced both to shift it back by omitting several days, and to reduce the number of leap years via the "century rule" to keep the equinoxes more or less fixed and the date of Easter consistently close to the vernal equinox .

An extra 24 hours thus accumulates every four years, requiring that an extra calendar day be added to align the calendar with the Sun's apparent position. Without the added day, in future years the seasons would occur later in the calendar, eventually leading to confusion about when to undertake activities dependent on weather, ecology , or hours of daylight.  A solar year is actually slightly shorter than 365 days and 6 hours (365.25 days). As early as the 13th century it was recognized that the year is shorter than the 365.25 days assumed by the Julian calendar : the Earth's orbital period around the Sun was derived from the medieval Alfonsine tables as 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, and 16 seconds (365.2425 days). The currently accepted modern figure is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds. Adding a calendar day every four years, therefore, results in an excess of around 44 minutes for those four years, or about 3 days every 400 years. To compensate for this, three days are removed every 400 years. The Gregorian calendar reform implements this adjustment by making an exception to the general rule that there is a leap year every four years. Instead, a year divisible by 100 is not a leap year unless that year is also divisible by 400 . This means that the years 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years, while the years 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are common years.  Modern (Gregorian) calendar [ edit ]  The Gregorian calendar repeats itself every 400 years, which is exactly 20,871 weeks including 97 leap days (146,097 days). Over this period, February 29 falls on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday 13 times each; 14 times each on Friday and Saturday; and 15 times each on Monday and Wednesday. Excepting when a century mark that is not a multiple of 400 intervenes, consecutive leaps days fall in order Thursday, Tuesday, Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, Monday, and Saturday; then repeating with Thursday again.  Early Roman calendar [ edit ]     Adding a leap day (after 23 February) shifts the commemorations in the 1962 Roman Missal .    Main article: Roman calendar  The calendar of the Roman king Numa Pompilius had only 355 days (even though it was not a lunar calendar) which meant that it would quickly become unsynchronized with the solar year. An earlier Roman solution to this problem was to lengthen the calendar periodically by adding extra days to February, the last month of the year. February consisted of two parts, each with an odd number of days. The first part ended with the Terminalia on the 23rd, which was considered the end of the religious year, and the five remaining days formed the second part. To keep the calendar year roughly aligned with the solar year, a leap month , called Mensis Intercalaris ("intercalary month"), was added from time to time between these two parts of February. The (usual) second part of February was incorporated in the intercalary month as its last five days, with no change either in their dates or the festivals observed on them. This followed naturally, because the days after the Ides (13th) of February (in an ordinary year) or the Ides of Intercalaris (in an intercalary year) both counted down to the Kalends of March (i.e. they were known as "the n th day before the Kalends of March"). The Nones (5th) and Ides of Intercalaris occupied their normal positions.  The third-century writer Censorinus says:   When it was thought necessary to add (every two years) an intercalary month of 22 or 23 days, so that the civil year should correspond to the natural (solar) year, this intercalation was in preference made in February, between Terminalia [23rd] and Regifugium [24th]. [3]   Julian reform [ edit ]  Main article: Julian calendar  The set leap day was introduced in Rome as a part of the Julian reform in the 1st century BC. As before, the intercalation was made after February 23. The day following the Terminalia (February 23) was doubled, forming the " bis sextum "—literally 'twice sixth', since February 24 was 'the sixth day before the Kalends of March' using Roman inclusive counting (March 1 was the Kalends of March and was also the first day of the calendar year). Inclusive counting initially caused the Roman priests to add the extra day every three years instead of four; Augustus was compelled to omit leap years for a few decades to return the calendar to its proper position. Although there were exceptions, the first day of the bis sextum (February 24) was usually regarded as the intercalated or "bissextile" day since the 3rd century AD. [4] February 29 came to be regarded as the leap day when the Roman system of numbering days was replaced by sequential numbering in the late Middle Ages, [ citation needed ] although this has only been formally enacted in Sweden and Finland . In Britain , the extra day added to leap years remains notionally the 24th, although the 29th remains more visible on the calendar. [5]  Born on February 29 [ edit ]  A person born on February 29 may be called a "leapling", a "leaper", or a "leap-year baby". [6] In non-leap years, some leaplings celebrate their birthday on either February 28 or March 1, while others only observe birthdays on the authentic intercalary date, February 29.  Legal status [ edit ]  The effective legal date of a leapling's birthday in non-leap years varies between jurisdictions.  In the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, when a person born on February 29 turns 18 , they are considered to have their birthday on March 1 in the relevant year. [7] [8]  In New Zealand, a person born on February 29 is deemed to have their birthday on February 28 in non-leap years, for the purposes of Driver Licensing under §2(2) of the Land Transport (Driver Licensing) Rule 1999. [9] The net result is that for drivers aged 75, or over 80, their driver licence expires at the end of the last day of February, even though their birthday would otherwise fall on the first day in March in non-leap years. Otherwise, New Zealand legislation is silent on when a person born on 29 February has their birthday, although case law [10] would suggest that age is computed based on the number of years elapsed, from the day after the date of birth, and that the person's birth day then occurs on the last day of the year period. This differs from English common law where a birthday is considered to be the start of the next year, the preceding year ending at midnight on the day preceding the birthday. While a person attains the same age on the same day, it also means that, in New Zealand, if something must be done by the time a person attains a certain age, that thing can be done on the birthday that they attain that age and still be lawful.  In Taiwan (Republic of China) , the legal birthday of a leapling is February 28 in common years:   If a period fixed by weeks, months, and years does not commence from the beginning of a week, month, or year, it ends with the ending of the day which proceeds the day of the last week, month, or year which corresponds to that on which it began to commence. But if there is no corresponding day in the last month, the period ends with the ending of the last day of the last month. [11]   Thus, in England and Wales or in Hong Kong, a person born on February 29 will have legally reached 18 years old on March 1. If they were born in Taiwan they legally become 18 on February 28, a day earlier. In the United States, according to John Reitz, a professor of law at the University of Iowa, there is no "... statute or general rule that has anything to do with leap day." [12] Reitz speculates that "March 1 would likely be considered the legal birthday in non-leap years of someone born on leap day," [12] using the same reasoning as described for the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.  In fiction [ edit ]  There are many instances in children's literature where a person's claim to be only a quarter of their actual age turns out to be based on counting only their leap-year birthdays.  A similar device is used in the plot of Gilbert and Sullivan 's 1879 comic opera  The Pirates of Penzance . As a child, Frederic was apprenticed to a band of pirates until his 21st birthday. Having passed his 21st year, he leaves the pirate band and falls in love. However, since he was born on February 29, his 21st birthday will not arrive until he is eighty-four, so he must leave his fiancée and return to the pirates.

[14] If the man refuses, he then is obliged to give the woman money [15] or buy her a dress. In upper-class societies in Europe, if the man refuses marriage, he then must purchase 12 pairs of gloves for the woman, suggesting that the gloves are to hide the woman's embarrassment of not having an engagement ring. In Ireland, the tradition is supposed to originate from a deal that Saint Bridget struck with Saint Patrick . [16] [17]  In the town of Aurora, Illinois , single women are deputized and may arrest single men, subject to a four-dollar fine, every February 29. [18] [19]  In Greece , it is considered unlucky to marry on a leap day. [20]  References [ edit ]    ^ a  b  Lerner, Ed. K. Lee; Lerner, Brenda W. (2004). "Calendar".

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  February 29th  February (month)  Age of Consent  Leap Years  Birthdays  Age  Law  Survey Question If you're born on February 29th, when do you legally turn one year older? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 3 Answers Quora User Updated Feb 6, 2018 · Author has 1k answers and 634.3k answer views Such a widespread question affecting such a wide range of people, there are probably statutes and regulations under statutes that speak to when February 29 is deemed to have occurred during years which have no February 29 (i.e., non-leap years). Putting aside legality to think precisely and logically, it doesn’t make sense for an individual whose birthday is February 29 to begin celebrating it until the possibility of there being a February 29 during any one given year is absolutely brought to an end through the application of law and the perception of fact. Legislation certainly can be referred to in order to determine which years have a February 29 and which don’t, on an ongoing basis, and it’s pretty unreasonable to expect that a legislature is likely to ever enact, or a court would ever rule, February 29 to be a part of any (legislated) non-leap year. This is not to say it’s absolutely impossible, but it would certainly be a political question that would require extraordinary legislative or judicial action in order to implement extraordinarily—as to non-leap years. And, of course, with a justification that totally escapes reason, at least to me. That said, deemed recognition at law of the occurrence of February 29 during non-leap years, and legislative direction as to when individuals born February 29 may celebrate their birthdays, are two different matters. Therefore, how’s this? “ §1.  Deemed lawful occurrence, during leap years, of birthdays of individuals born February 29 (a) During non-leap years, the birthdays of individuals born on February 29, shall not be deemed to have occurred until the last second of the last minute of the last hour of February 28 has elapsed, according to statutory, regulatory and judicial recognition as to the lapse of time as set forth elsewhere within the law of this jurisdiction. (b) (i) for the purposes set forth in subsection (a) of this section; and, (ii) for the purpose of designating a day during years which do not include the date and day described as February 29 (“année bissextile”), on which individuals whose birthdays occurred and the anniversaries of which would, during leap years, occur, on February 29, may be celebrated, that day may be deemed to be March 1 of that particular year.” 3.7k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below If you are born on February 29 of a leap year, when is your birthday?

Ask New Question   Keith Winstein Answered May 4, 2011 · Upvoted by Quora User , lurker · Author has 373 answers and 1.1m answer views In a leap year, at the start of February 29. Otherwise, probably at the start of March 1. See, e.g., DelVecchio v. Illinois Dept. of Corrections, 8 F.3d 509, 512 (7th Cir. 1993), where a man's sentence for murder hinged on this point: Under Illinois law in 1965, any male who had yet to reach his seventeenth birthday but who was convicted and sentenced as an adult was sent to the Illinois Youth Commission ("IYC") with no minimum mandatory term. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23 §§ 2523-2525 (1963). The IYC then had total discretion: it could release the boy at any time before he turned twenty-one years old, it could release him when he turned twenty-one, or it could send him to an adult penitentiary at age twenty-one at which point the offender would receive a new sentence. Id. By contrast, any male sentenced after he turned seventeen received a normal adult term of years and served his time in a penitentiary. DelVecchio's case landed in the state's attorney's office in early February 1965; DelVecchio was set to turn seventeen on March 1, 1965 (DelVecchio was born February 29, 1948, a leap year). Prosecutors, then, had they delayed sentencing for a few weeks, could have guaranteed that DelVecchio would serve time (and almost certainly more of it) in an adult institution. Here is the choice prosecutors faced: if DelVecchio were sentenced on February 28, 1965, he would go to a youth home and be eligible to be freed the next day; if he were sentenced on March 1, 1965, he would go to an adult penitentiary and receive a minimum mandatory sentence of fourteen years and possibly a sentence as high as fifty years. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1963, ch. 38, par. 9-1. Id. (footnote omitted). 34.2k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date?   Abd Ul-Rahman Lomax , studied at California Institute of Technology Answered Nov 6, 2014 · Author has 1.9k answers and 3.5m answer views Great answer from Keith Winstein. Astronomically, a year is currently 365.25 days, minus a little. So every four years, there is a leap day, and every 100 years, not, and every 400 years, one. 2000 was a leap year, unlike 1900 or 2100, in the Gregorian calendar. However, legally, age is measured in calendar years. We don't look at the time of day of birth. If a child was born before midnight at the end of a day, they are a year old at the beginning of that date. But not the day before. They are that old for the entire year after that, until their next birthday. Legally, if someone is born on February 29, the leap day, they are not yet a year old on the next February 28. They will turn one as soon as the next day starts. I would interpret their "birthday" as being March 1 except in leap years. This is totally routine, I expect. When we go to get a drivers' license, they will look at the year and date. If  the date is not yet the birthday, we are one year less  than the difference in years. Any day after that, we are then the difference in years, old. February 28 is before February 29. February 28 is the last day that one's legal age is a year younger than the difference. So the next day is legally the "birthday."  It makes complete sense. 10.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date?

Click Here for K-3 Themes     The Earth orbits the sun every 365.2422 days (0.2422 days is equal to 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds, roughly 1/4 of a day). Every 365 1/4 days (not exactly 365 days), the Earth returns to the same exact spot in its orbit. That is why we have a leap year roughly every 4 years, to synchronize the seasons with our calendar; if we had a 365-day calendar every year, the seasons would drift around the calendar.   What is a Leap Year?  A leap year is a year that has one extra day in it.  A leap year occurs roughly every four years.   Most years have 365 days, but a leap year has 366 days.  The extra day is added onto the end of the shortest month, February; in a leap year, February has 29 days (instead of its usual 28 days). February 29 is called leap day.  Why Do We Have Leap Years?  A year is defined as the time it takes for the Earth to orbit around the sun once.  It takes the Earth about 365 1/4 days to make one entire orbit around the sun (a day is one rotation around the Earth's axis).  By adding one extra day about every four years, the Earth is in the same point of its orbit at the same time of the calendar year each year. Before a leap-year calendar was used, the seasons drifted around the calendar (the drift is about 1/4 day or 6 hours each year).  For example, over three hundred years, July would go from summer to spring.  Our current calendar is called the Gregorian calendar; this calendar was devised by Aloysius Lilius (an Italian physician) and named for Pope Gregory who decreed in 1582 that it be used in Catholic areas.  This calendar wasn't adopted in Britain and the American Colonies until 1752.  What Years are Leap Years?  Usually, there is a leap year every four years -- but once in a long while, a leap year has to be skipped (this is because the Earth's orbit is 365.242 days, a bit less than 365 1/4). To determine if the year is a leap year:  Non-century years (a century year is a year ending in 00) are leap years if they are divisible by four. For example,  2004, 2008 and 2012 are leap years; 2009, 2010 and 2011 are not. Century years are leap years if they are divisible by 400.  For example, 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years; 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, and 2300 are not.

Leap Day Birthdays  People born on leap day (February 29) can celebrate their birthday on March 1 (or February 28) on non-leap years.  A person born on a leap day is sometimes called a leapling. What percentage of the population is born on leap day? Assuming an equal distribution of birthdays throughout the year, the fraction of people born on leap day is the fraction of people born on one day out of four years, or 1/[(365 x 4 ) + 1] = 1/1,461 = 0.068% (less than one-tenth of a percent of the population).

It's About As Rare As You'd Think By Claire Warner Feb 28 2016 As your Facebook feed has no doubt made you aware, Feb. 29 is just around the corner, and there's one thing on everyone's minds: What are the odds of being born on a leap year? Most people find leaplings, as they're called by local-interest pieces and adoring grandmothers, inexplicably fascinating out of a perception that leap year birthdays are incredibly rare. But popular opinion is rarely 100 percent correct (see: every myth about the menstrual cycle ever). Are your chances of being born on a leap year actually that low? For once, the general public has the right idea, because the odds of a leap year birthday are usually estimated to be one in 1,461 . The statistics behind the number are surprisingly simple: Four years is equal to 1,460 days, and the leap year rounds it up to 1,461. Assuming the odds of being born are the same for every day, your chances of being a leapling turn out to be one in 1,461. That being said, it's not that rare; for example, your odds of being struck by lightning during your lifetime are one in 3,000 , and your chances of becoming POTUS are one in 10,000,000. By comparison, being born on a leap year seems like no biggie. However, as the BBC points out, this may oversimplify things; it's well-known that human births vary based on season and location . A 2014 study found that peak birth months occur earlier in the year the further you get from the equator, and the Centers for Disease Control suggest that August is the most popular birth month in America. So in reality, your chances are probably a little less than the statistic cited above, but there's little specific research on the subject. Leap years are used as a way to reconcile the Earth's imperfect orbit with the Gregorian calendar used in most Western countries. Our calendar has 365 days, but the planet actually takes 365.24 days to go around the Sun. The disparity may not seem like much, but the extra time can (and did) build up over the course of centuries unless you account for it. When Julius Caesar came into power, the calendar was something of a mess, as the priesthood hadn't done a great job of keeping up with the convoluted system of the time. Caesar ordered the astronomer Sosigenes to create a new calendar, and he came up with 365-day system that tacked on an extra day every four years. This was later fine-tuned by Pope Gregorious XIII , and voila! You have the Gregorian calendar we still use today. If you were born on a leap year and find yourself so over all the "technically you're still a kid, har har!" jokes, you know who to blame. Thanks, Pope Gregorious XIII.

An average year length is actually, on average, 365.2425 days not 365.25.  As written on the wikipedia leap year page, "The Gregorian calendar . . . removes three leap days every 400 years, which is the length of its leap cycle. This is done by removing February 29 in the three century years (multiples of 100) that cannot be exactly divided by 400.[3] The years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are common years." – StatsStudent  Feb 29 '16 at 9:09         10      I don't see why you need to consider 2000 years; leap years are on a 400 year cycle, so why not just reduce to "there are 97 leap years in 400 years"? – Philip Kendall  Feb 29 '16 at 12:27        7      Why should we consider such minor influences as "cancelled" leap days in century years not multiples of 400 but on the other hand not factor in external influences, such as almost all births being delayed past or introduced before the 29th of February, just to save the child from the inconvenience (or other reasons)? - At least here in Germany the probability for a birth to occur on any 29th of February is (estimated) nearly zero. – Alexander Kosubek  Feb 29 '16 at 13:02        |  show 15 more comments             up vote  23  down vote      To accurately predict that probability using statistics, it would be helpful to know where the birth took place.  This page http://chmullig.com/2012/06/births-by-day-of-year/ has a graph showing a subset of the number of births per day (multiplying the 29th by 4, which is incorrect, and undesirable for this question, but it also links to the original data and gives a rough indication of what you can expect) in the United States. I would assume that this curve doesn't hold true for other countries, and especially not for other continents. In particular the southern hemisphere and equatorial region may show a substantial derivation from these results - assuming that climate is a determining factor.  Furthermore, there's the issue of "elective birth" (touched upon by the authors of http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e002920.full ) - in poorer regions of the globe, I would expect a different distribution of births, simply because (non-emergency-) cesarian sections or induced birth are rarer than in developed countries. This skews the final distribution of births.  Using the American data, assuming ~71 Million births (rough graphed mean * 366) and 46.000 births on February 29ths, not correcting for the distribution of leap years in the data, because the precise period is not indicated, I arrive at a probability of around ~0.000648. This is slightly below the value one would expect given a flat distribution of births, and thus in line with the general impression give by the graph.  I'll leave a significance test of this rough estimation to a motivated reader. But given that the 29th (though uncorrected - the year 2000 injects a below average bias into the data) scores low even for the already low February standards, I assume a relatively high confidence that the null-hypthosesis of equal distribution can be rejected.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 7:26             answered Feb 29 '16 at 13:17       Rick Moritz   331 1 4                  The data set has Feb 30 and 31 dates of birth.

Any theoretical answer would be flawed without accounting birthday selection phenomena, seasonality etc. These things are impossible to deal with theoretically.  The birthday data is hard to find in US for privacy reasons. There's one anonymous data set here . It's from insurance applications in USA. The difference from other reports, such as a popular often cited NYT article , is that it lists the frequency of births by date, instead of simple ranking of days in a year. The weak point is of course the sampling bias, since it comes from insurance: uninsured people are not included etc.  According to the data there were 325 births in Feb 29 of total 481040. According to the Roy Murphy , the sample spans from 1981 through 1994. It includes 3 leap years of total 14 years. Without any adjustments the probability would be 0.0675% of being born on Feb 29 between 1981 and 1994.  You can adjust the probability by accounting for the frequency of leap years, which is close to 1/4 ( not exactly though ), e.g. by multiplying this number by $14/12$ to arrive to 0.079% estimate. Here, the conditional probability $p$ of being born on Feb 29 in a leap year is linked to the observed frequency $F_o=325$ by the frequency $f_L=3$ of leap years in a sample:
$$F_o=f_L/N\cdot F\cdot p,$$
where $N=14$ is the number of years in a sample, and $F=481040$ is the total frequency of births.  Normally, the probability of leap years is $p_L\approx 1/4$, hence, the long run average probability $P_L$ of being born on Feb 29 is:
$$P_L=p_L\cdot p\approx \frac{p_L\cdot N}{f_L} \frac{F_o}{F} \approx 0.079\%$$  You might be interested in the conditional probability $p$ of being born on Feb 29 given that you were born on leap year:
$$p= \frac{N}{f_L} \frac{F_o}{F}\approx 0.32\%$$  So, the link between $P_L$ and $p$ is based on some couple of assumptions, e.g. that the probability of being born in any given year is uniform, and doesn't change.  Of course, this discussion was US centric. Who knows what are the patterns in other countries.  UPDATE: We automatically assumed that OP is Gregorian calendar. It gets even more interesting if you consider different calendars such as lunar calendar Hijri , where the leap years are every 30 years or so.  UPDATE 2:  What's surprising is that estimated probability $p$ leads to the expected occurrence of birthdays in Feb 29 for this sample: $F\cdot p=1,527$. This is only lower than Jan 1 and Dec 25, which is consistent with NYT's ranking above! They don't describe the source of data, referring to only Amitabh Chandra, Harvard University , but it's either the same or the finding is robust.  Now, how likely it is that very peculiar days in Gregorian calendar: Jan 1, Dec 25 and Deb 29 would come randomly as the most popular birthdays? I say it's highly unlikely a random occurrence. Hence, it's even more interesting to see what's going on in other calendars such as Hijri.  UPDATE 3:  Note that both $P_L,p$ are higher than naive theoretical estimates:  $$\hat p\approx 1/366\approx 0.27%$$
$$\hat P_L\approx p\cdot\frac{366}{365*4+1}\approx 0.068%$$  UPDATE 4:  Ben Millwood made comment that the distribution of births by day of year is non-uniform. Can we test this statement? Using my data set we can run $\chi^2$ test on the theoretical distribution with a null hypothesis that the distribution is uniform. The result is the rejection, i.e. the distribution doesn't seem to be uniform.  The theoretical distribution is built like this. We assume that the birth frequency is uniform across all calendar days, i.e. in 14 years span across $14*365+3$ days. Then we roll up the days into days of year, which is 366. Obviously only 3 leap days were encountered and 14 non-leap days. Below is my MATLAB code and the distribution plot for comparison of theoretical and empiricals.  d=[0101 1482

It makes me wonder about what connection there is, if any, between the frequencies you analyze and the (vaguely defined) probability asked for in the question. – whuber ♦  Feb 29 '16 at 15:55        1      @whuber, the probabilities in my answer are for cases like analysis of insurance applications or some user data. For instance, you have a web site and want to flag problematic user data. You could compare the frequency of Feb 29 birthdays with my probabilities. However, if you are planning a family and asking this question, then my numbers are useless, pretty much. The reason is that they don't account for factors such as when exactly the couple is actually copulating or fertility and period patterns of couples, for instance, which is the main determinant of the birth day date. – Aksakal  Feb 29 '16 at 16:53            Glad to see you did not start with the math before considering other factors, beyond pure stats – TheBlastOne  Mar 1 '16 at 7:02        add a comment |             up vote  8  down vote      The cover to my favorite book ever provides some highly relevant evidence against the assumption of a uniform allocation of births to dates. Specifically that births in the US since 1970 exhibit several trends superimposed on eachother: a long, multi-decade trend, a non-periodic trend, day-of-week trends, day-of-year trends, holiday trends (because procedures like Cesarean section allow one to effectively schedule the birthdate, and doctors often don't do those on holidays). The result is that the probability of being born on a randomly-chosen day in a year is not uniform, and because birth rate varies between years, not all years are equally likely, either. So the answer that just checks how many leap years there are in some interval and reckons from the calendar is making very strong assumptions which have little utility in describing the real world in any reasonable way!  This also provides evidence that Asksal's solution, while a very strong contender, is also incomplete. A small number of leap days will be "contaminated" by all off the effects at play here, so Asksal's estimate is also capturing (quite by accident) the effect of day-of-week and long-term trends along with the Feb. 29 effect. Which effects are and are not appropriate to include are not clearly defined by your question.  And this analysis only has bearing on the US, which has demographic trends which might be quite different from other nations or populations. Japan's birth rate has been declining for decades, for example. China's birth rate is regulated by the state, with some consequences for its nation's gender composition and hence birth rates in subsequent generations.  Likewise, Gelman's analysis only describes several recent decades, and it's not necessarily clear that this is even the era of interest to your question.   For those who get excited about this kind of thing, the material in the cover is discussed at length in the chapter on Gaussian processes.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 20:37       whuber ♦   188k 28 399 739        answered Mar 1 '16 at 13:50       Sycorax   25.5k 5 70 110              2      A brief description of the model used in also available in the blog post here: andrewgelman.com/2012/06/19/… – Sakari Cajanus  Mar 2 '16 at 14:15        add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      February 29th is a date that occurs each year that is a multiple of 4 .  However years that are a multiple of 100 but aren't one of 400, are not considered as leap years (E.g: 1900 is not a leap year while 2000 or 1600 are). Therefore, nowadays, it is the same pattern every 400 years.  So let's do the maths on a [0;400[ interval:  On a 400 years period, there is exactly 4 x 25 = 100 years that are a multiple of 4 . But we have to subtract 3 (years multiple of 100 but not of 400) from 100, and we get 100 - 3 = 97 Now we have to multiply 97 by 366 , 97 x 366 = 35502 (365 x (400-97)) = 110 595 Then we just have to add these two numbers in order to know the total number of days in a 400 years period: 110 595 + 35502 = 146 097 To finish, our probability is the number of February 29th in a 400 years period so 97 given that there is 97 leap years divided by the total number of days of our interval: p = 97 / 146097 ≈ 0,0006639424492 Hope this is right and clear.   share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 29 '16 at 15:23       Jonathan Poid   31 1            7      This is a nice analysis of the chance that a randomly chosen date would be February 29th.  I believe most of the discussion in this thread focuses on the fact that this doesn't actually answer questions about chances of births, which do not really behave like random draws from the set of possible days. – whuber ♦  Feb 29 '16 at 15:28        1      A much easier way is to say that there are 97 leap years per 400 years the way you have already worked out. Calculate the number of days in 400 normal years. 400 * 365 = 146000. Then you need to add the 97 leap days giving 146097. – CJ Dennis  Mar 1 '16 at 7:06        add a comment |         up vote  2  down vote      I believe there are two questions being mixed up here. The one is "What is the probability of any given day being a Feb. 29th?". The second one is (and the one actually asked) "What is the probability of being born on a leap day?"  The approach of simply counting days seems to be misleading as Aksakal is pointing it. Counting days and calculating frequencies of Feb. 29th occuring addresses the question: "What is the probability that any given day is a Feb. 29th?" (Imagine waking up after a coma, no clue what day it is. The probability of it being a Feb. 29th is as pointed out above $p = \frac{97}{146097}\approx 0,00066394$).  Following Aksakal's answer, the probability can just be based on empirical studies of the distribution of births across the days of the year. Different data sets will come to different conclusions (e.g. due to effects of seasonality, long-term trends in birth rates, cultural differences). Aksakal pointed out a study (One comment: to account for the unrepresentative occurence of a leap year in the mentioned data (i.e. $\frac{3}{14}$) compared to the long-term frequency of leap year occurences (i.e. $\frac{97}{400}$) you would have to multiply the frequency of birth on Feb. 29th from the sample by $\frac{97}{400}\cdot\frac{14}{3} = \frac{679}{600} \approx 1.131667$).  Finally, there is a third possible interpretation of the question, which I believe was not intended though: "What is the probability of a specific person being born on a leap day?" Well, for anyone already born that is easy. It is either $0$ or $1$. For anyone not born but already conceived it also can be estimated using empirical studies on the length of pregnancy (see Wikipedia for an overview ). For anyone not conceived yet, see above.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 8:20       mpiktas   27.7k 4 62 121        answered Feb 29 '16 at 16:32       data_enthusiast   34 4              2      Errr, I was ready to vote this up, and then I got to Well, for anyone already born that is easy.

I looked at it and know the outcome (e.g. heads). You are standing next to me, but have not seen the outcome. What is the probability of the coin showing heads (for you, for me, "objectively")? In the example above: for the given (born) person the probability is either 0 or 1 (assuming he knows on which date he is born). If you pick a person at random and you had to guess his birthday, the probability it being a Feb. 29 is than again an empirical question. – data_enthusiast  Mar 3 '16 at 8:53         add a comment |           up vote  1  down vote      I've noticed that most of the answers above work this out by calculating the number of leap days in a particular period. There is a simpler way to get the answer, 100% accurately, by definition:  We use leap years to adjust the regular (365 day) calendar to the mean tropical year (aka mean solar year). The mean tropical year "is the time that the Sun takes to return to the same position in the cycle of seasons, as seen from Earth" (Wikipedia). The tropical year varies slightly, but the mean (average) tropical year is ABOUT 365.24667.  If out leap days are correct, then the chance of a randomly selected day being a leap day, is ((tropical year) - (non-leap-year)) / tropical year  Pluging in the approximate number we have, it's (365.24667-365)/365.24667, or 0.24667/365.24667, or 675 per million (0.0675%).  This, however, is for a randomly selected day. I imagine that this is substantially skewed by parents who would rather not have to explain to their kids, "your actual birthday only comes once per 4 years".     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 1 '16 at 21:51       AMADANON Inc.   111 2              2      I don't think this answers the question being asked, because the leap day, Feb. 29, only exists in particular calendar systems. Those calendar systems have only been in use in particular societies during the recent historical eras. For example, this question is not intelligible to someone who reckons time using the Hebrew calendar, which has no "February" at all! Moreover, even if we assume a calendar with a leap day, it still doesn't resolve the indeterminacy surrounding the probability distribution of births to days. – Sycorax  Mar 1 '16 at 22:25            @user777, thats irrelevant.

Here are 10 things to consider - for one day only. Until 2016, that is. 1. The leap year's extra day is necessary because of the "messiness" of our Solar System. One Earth year (a complete orbit around the Sun) does not take an exact number of whole days (one complete spin of the Earth on its axis). In fact, it takes 365.2422 days, give or take. 2. Until Julius Caesar came to power, people observed a 355-day calendar - with an extra 22-day month every two years. But it was a convoluted solution to the problem and feast days began sliding into different seasons. So Caesar ordered his astronomer, Sosigenes, to simplify things. Sosigenes opted for the 365-day year with an extra day every four years to scoop up the extra hours. This is how the 29 February was born. It was then fine-tuned by Pope Gregory XIII (see below). 3. Every fourth year is a leap year, as a rule of thumb. But that's not the end of the story. A year that is divisible by 100, but not by 400, is not. So 2000 was a leap year under the Gregorian calendar, as was 1600. But 1700, 1800 and 1900 are not leap years. "It seems a bit arbitrary," says Ian Stewart, emeritus professor of mathematics at Warwick University. But there's a good reason behind it.     "The year is 365 days and a quarter long - but not exactly. If it was exactly, then you could say it was every four years. But it is very slightly less." The answer arrived at by Pope Gregory XIII and his astronomers when they introduced the Gregorian calendar in 1582, was to lose three leap days every 400 years. The maths has hung together ever since. It will need to be rethought in about 10,000 years' time, Stewart warns. But by then mankind might have come up with a new system.  PM's Leap Day  By Eddie Mair Presenter, PM  All this month on PM, listeners have been asked whether they'd be prepared to take advantage of this extra day to do something different.  It transpires there are a lot of people who're ready to use today to take a leap .  There's the apparently mundane... "I resolve to speak Mandarin all day long"… "my partner and I are going to visit some elderly people"... "often meant to take a roof tour of Lincoln Cathedral but never got round to it".  After six years one woman will finally decide the wording for her husband's headstone. Some people are at last scattering the ashes of loved ones having put it off for years.  There's a woman taking up the hula-hoop after more than 50 years.       One woman intends to have some chocolate today - her anorexia has been a problem for years. A man who suffers panic attacks will try to make a bus journey. And a woman in her 60s will get a tattoo.  PM is on BBC Radio Four, Monday to Saturday at 17:00 GMT  PM blog  4. Why is February 29, not February 31, a leap year day? All the other months have 30 or 31 days, but February suffered from the ego of Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus, says Stewart. Under Julius Caesar, February had 30 days, but when Caesar Augustus was emperor he was peeved that his month - August - had only 29 days, whereas the month named after his predecessor Julius - July - had 31. "He pinched a couple of days for August to make it the same as July. And it was poor old February that lost out," says Prof Stewart. 5. The tradition of a woman proposing on a leap year has been attributed to various historical figures. One, although much disputed, was St Bridget in the 5th Century. She is said to have complained to St Patrick that women had to wait too long for their suitors to propose. St Patrick then supposedly gave women a single day in a leap year to pop the question - the last day of the shortest month. Another popular story is that Queen Margaret of Scotland brought in a law setting fines for men who turned down marriage proposals put by women on a leap year. Sceptics have pointed out that Margaret was five years old at the time and living far away in Norway. The tradition is not thought to have become commonplace until the 19th Century. It is believed that the tradition of women proposing on this day goes back to the times when the leap year day was not recognised by English law. Under this theory, if the day had no legal status, it was acceptable to break with the convention of a man proposing. 6. A prayer has been written by a female cleric for people planning a leap year day marriage proposal. The prayer, for 29 February, asks for blessings on the engaged couple. It reminds them that wedding plans should not overtake preparations for a lifetime together. The prayer has been taken from Pocket Prayers of Blessing by the Venerable Jan McFarlane, Archdeacon of Norwich: "God of love, please bless N and N as they prepare for the commitment of marriage. May the plans for the wedding not overtake the more important preparation for their lifetime together. Please bless their family and friends as they prepare for this special day and may your blessing be upon them now and always. Amen." 7. The practice of women proposing in a leap year is different around the world. In Denmark, it is not supposed to be 29 but 24 February, which hails back to the time of Julius Caesar. A refusal to marry by Danish men means they must give the woman 12 pairs of gloves. In Finland, it is not gloves but fabric for a skirt and in Greece, marriage in a leap year is considered unlucky, leading many couples to avoid it. 8. The chance of being born on a leap day is often said to be one in 1,461. Four years is 1,460 days and adding one for the leap year you have 1,461. So, odds of 1/1,461. But Stewart points out that is very slightly out, owing to the loss of the three leap years every 400 years. In any case, babies are more likely to be born at certain times of the year rather than others, due to a range of other factors, he says. Babies born on 29 February are known as "leapers" or "leaplings". 9. Other calendars apart from the Gregorian require leap years. The modern Iranian calendar is a solar calendar with eight leap days inserted into a 33-year cycle. The Indian National Calendar and the Revised Bangla Calendar of Bangladesh arrange their leap years so that the leap day is always close to 29 February in the Gregorian calendar. 10. Explorer Christopher Columbus used the lunar eclipse of 29 February 1504 to his advantage during his final trip to the West Indies. After several months of being stranded with his crew on the island of Jamaica, relations with the indigenous population broke down and they refused to continue helping with food and provisions. Columbus, knowing a lunar eclipse was due, consulted his almanac and then gathered the native chiefs on 29 February. He told that God was to punish them by painting the Moon red. During the eclipse, he said that God would withdraw the punishment if they starting co-operating again. The panicked chiefs agreed and the Moon began emerging from its shadow. Also of a supernatural nature, on 29 February 1692 the first warrants were issued in the Salem witchcraft trials in Massachusetts.

Pixabay, Public Domain    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail Once every four years, mothers with scheduled C-sections or induced births will either avoid or embrace their baby having a Feb. 29 birthday, the day of the leap year. For people born on this day, who are often called “leapers” or “leaplings,” the birthday appears like a rabbit out of a hat, then disappears for four more years. Although the calendar spares leapers from the psychological turmoil of getting older each year, it also marginalizes their quadrennial birthdays. One In 1,461 There is no reliable data on exactly how many babies are born on leap day , so experts often assume the odds are just the same as any other day. Because there are 1,460 days in four years plus one day for the leap year, the odds are one in 1,461 . That said, there are an estimated 200,000 leapers in the United States and about five million worldwide. One of the benefits to being born on a leap day is that you get to choose when your birthday is. Some leapers will choose Feb. 28 while others choose March 1 — die hard leapers might choose to celebrate only on the 29th . Perhaps the easiest way to choose is, if a person is born closer to 12 a.m. on Feb. 29, they should celebrate on Feb 28. If they’re born closer to 11:59 p.m. on Feb 29, they should go with March 1. Anyone who is born closer to midday has the option to choose for themselves. Holly Parker , who lectures about the psychology of close relationships at Harvard, believes choosing your birthday is a unique and quirky aspect of being born on the 29th. "There's no other birthday that offers as much freedom," she told Medical Daily . "If a person chooses to celebrate their birthday on March 1, they can literally celebrate their birthday in two different months [March for three years, February for one year]. No one else gets to do that." Theresa Nicolls is 59 years old but will be turning 15 if you only count her leap year birthdays. For over 20 years, she’s been celebrating her birthday on March 1, by accident. “I didn't know I was a leap year baby growing up because when I was born, my attending doctor asked my mom if she would like them to change the time I was born so my birthday would be recorded as March 1. For whatever reason, my mother never told me this until I was in my 20s.” she told Medical Daily . However, “had the doctor and my mom put my real date as February 29th, I would have celebrated on the 29th and on March 1st on non-leap years,” she said. A Mother’s Choice Some mothers-to-be do everything they can to avoid their baby being born on a leap day. After all, there’s a lot to consider — should the baby’s birthdate be changed to Feb. 28 or March 1, and how will a baby cope with being born on Feb. 29? Will having a birthday every four years affect them in any way? The Honor Society of Leap Year Day Babies , founded by 56-year-old Raenell Dawn (soon-to-be 14 in leap years), is a free membership birthday club for people born on Feb. 29. With 10,000 current members, the club helps raise “leap consciousness” by providing an online community for leapers and leaper parents to share their experiences and offer advice on common concerns. "There are those few moms who hate it," Dawn told the  Huffington Post . "They do not want a leap day baby, so we try to help them understand that there's no need to feel this way about the date." Also, speaking to the Huffington Post , Dr. Laura Riley, an OB-GYN at Massachusetts General Hospital, said there were no scheduled deliveries for the last leap day we had, which landed on a Wednesday. For a maternity ward that averages eight deliveries per day, she said the leap day saw no scheduled inductions and no elective repeat C-sections scheduled. Meanwhile Tuesday was completely booked, and on Thursday, only one slot remained. Riley recounted the story of an expecting mother who was overdue, yet refused to induce birth on Feb. 29. This patient preferred to give birth on a different day, even if it meant she’d be cared for by a less familiar doctor. “To her, it was far more important to not have that date.” Riley said. There was no problem with this because the woman had a normal pregnancy. It’s “only in emergency cases of fetal distress or antepartum hemorrhage that doctors insist on an immediate delivery,” Dr. Megha Tuli , an OB-GYN specialist in Uttar Pradesh, India, told Medical Daily . Leaper Struggles A mother’s refusal to have her baby born on a leap day is strongly tied to the fact that her child’s birthdate won’t appear on the calendar every single year. Dawn agrees this is a common issue, especially with regard to inputting birthdays on websites and official government documents. John Reitz, a law professor at the University of Iowa who specializes in administrative law, speculates a leap year baby’s birthday would legally be marked as March 1 because they’d technically be a year old on the day after February 28. This would affect everything from when the baby can legally drive to when they can join the army or buy alcohol, and even when they can start collecting social security benefits. Still, leapers often experience issues related to their insurance and social security. Richard Little , a member of the Honor Society of Leap Year Day Babies, recounted to the organization a scenario in which he tried signing up for early social security at 62 years old. However, when the representative looked through a computer for his birthdate, she said “there’s no such thing.” “I could not be the only person born on that date,” Little replied. “We had to settle on Feb. 28 in order for me to sign up for S.S.” These issues begin to pop up at younger ages, too. Birthdays that carry social weight, like Bar Mitzvahs and Quinceaneras, which are coming-of-age celebrations for boys and girls, respectively, may not be considered as significant if they don’t fall on the actual birthdate. Milestones like 18 or 21 can be just as frustrating. Writing for the Honor Society, Veronica from Texas told the story of a bar’s bouncer, who tore up her ID when she presented it on her 21st birthday, and said it was because there is no 29th of February. (She was subsequently reimbursed for her torn up ID and given a free drink.) In school, leap year kids might not be acknowledged during certain activities. Char Larson, a member of the Honor Society, wrote: “In kindergarten, we were each given a calendar of the month of our birthday and asked to circle our birthdays. I was devastated because mine was not there. [The teacher should have realized this].” These small problems can snowball into full-on feelings of isolation and loneliness, which usually result from other kids' taunts or teasing. Tuli reassured, however, that teasing “does not lead to any long-term effects compared to more serious issues, such as bullying and abuse.” Combating this potential setback isn’t too hard. Parents can create meaning around a leap year birthday by encouraging fun family projects, like arts and crafts, which illustrate the zany reasons a leap year birthday is charming and special, Parker said. A leap year birthday doesn’t have to be a loss; if anything, it’s a great conversation starter that will always spark intrigue due to its exclusivity. While only a few people will be part of the leap year-birthday club, everyone can enjoy the leap year. As Dawn said, “it’s everyone’s extra day. Do something good with it.”  Comment  Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail                     Most Read                Vitality Under the Hood Innovation The Hill The Grapevine Weird Medicine Conditions   About Contact Advertising Privacy Policy Terms Of Service Subscribe  © 2018 Newsweek Media Group All rights reserved.

I talked with 8 of them to find out.   By  Michelle Hackman   Updated Mar  1, 2016,  8:20am EST        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  What’s it like to be a leap year baby? I talked with 8 of them to find out.      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email             What are the odds of being born on leap day? Slim. So slim that leap baby Adam Piekarski decided to get his 7-year-old daughter to do the math with him to prove to her how special he is.  "Everyone that I’ve met that’s been born on a leap year seems special," he said. "I personally think they think differently and they see differently."  Normally, the chance of being born on any given day is 1 in 365. But for leap babies, it's four times that, plus an extra day. That comes out to 1 in 1,461. So only 0.07 percent of the world’s population shares a birthday with Adam — assuming birthdays are uniformly distributed throughout the year.  Adam, who works on an oil pipeline in Ohio, technically has had more birthdays than his daughter. On February 29, he will mark his ninth real birthday. (In more conventional terms, he’s turning 36.)  Adam is one of the Vox followers who responded to my call on Twitter for leap year babies. Over the past week, I spoke with eight of them. I wanted to know about the rituals, inconveniences, and delights that come along with a birthday that vanishes three out of every four years. There are many.  When do leap year babies celebrate their birthdays?  This is an existential question for leap babies. The community is divided into "28thers" and "1sters," as one reader, Phil Haney, told me.  Haney, a writer for Break.com in Los Angeles, is a 1ster. "My mother always told me that I was born ‘the day after the 28th.’" He said. "I wasn't here on the 28th, so it makes more sense to celebrate on March 1."  Shannon Esposito, a fourth-grade teacher outside Chicago, is an avowed 28ther. "I have always, always celebrated on February 28. To me, it’s always been a February birthday," she said. "I am not a March baby!"  Some try to split the difference by celebrating the moment the clock strikes 12 between the two days. Lidia Urbina, a master’s student in Switzerland, says that’s the tactic her friends often say they’ll take – but most years, they just forget.  Others don’t see a reason why they have to pick sides. Alex Clifton, an enrollment counselor in Kentucky, says she cuts her losses by celebrating on both days. (Clifton is turning 6 – or 24 – but she strikes me as wise beyond her years.)  Still others let the date float around the calendar. I got the sense that since leap year babies’ birthdays don’t exist most years, it’s almost as though they feel unmoored from the specific date they actually celebrate.  "I used to try and keep it in February, but most often I celebrated on the weekend," Piekarski told me. "Now I’m grown up with kids, so I try to celebrate within the month."  Is there pressure to have a blowout celebration every four years when the real date rolls around?  Definitely. "It's like the Olympics, a presidential election, and my birthday every four years," Haney said. That puts a lot of pressure on him to go out and do something really big.  Ashley Eden, a staffer for Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Capitol Hill, told me her parents set an over-the-top expectation that was hard to meet. When she turned 4, her first real birthday, her parents rented a pony. She and her friends spent hours taking mini horseback rides through the backyard. For a later birthday, when she was 16, her parents sent a limo to pick her up from school.  "They wanted to make sure I saw it as a cool and special thing, rather than a bummer that I had a birthday every four years," she said.  Another reader, Susan Peck, wrote in with what I can only imagine is a more unique ritual. "I am about to celebrate my 14th actual birthday," she wrote in an email. "I'll be singing the song from Pirates of Penzance: ‘a paradox, a paradox, a most ingenious paradox! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, a paradox!’" ( The Pirates of Penzance is a comic opera written by Gilbert and Sullivan whose main character is also a leap year baby.) This raised many more questions, but Peck did not respond to any of my follow-up inquiries.  But Espasito noted that despite the impulse to "go big," leap day lands on a Monday this year, and she’ll probably end up celebrating the weekend before. She’s looking forward to leap day 2020, though, which lands on a Saturday.  Does everyone make the joke that you’re a quarter of your actual age?  Are you turning 32, or 8? That’s the question leap year babies can’t avoid on their actual birthdays. Eden says she gets a lot of coloring books and crayons on her "real" birthday. People routinely tell Urbina that she looks old for her age (24, or 6.) And Espasito says the joke causes her fourth-grade students endless amusement – "we’re older than our teacher, blah blah blah," she puts it.  "I sometimes feel bad for the people that make the joke because they're trying to be nice, and they really think they are being original," Urbina said. "But it's actually a bit annoying."  Mike Guardabascio, the high school sports editor for the Long Beach Press-Telegram in California, says the joke’s corniness doesn’t discriminate. "You could be talking to the guy down the street, or you could be talking to an astrophysicist," he said. "When you tell someone that you were born on February 29, the immediate  response is, ‘So are you, like, 6 years old?’" (For the record, Guardabascio is turning 8, or 32.)  What happens when leap year babies turn 21?  For all the hype around 21st birthdays, most of the people I interviewed didn’t have much of a problem with the precise date they chose. That meant, again in nearly every case, that these leap day babies all tried their luck on the 28th.  "Before my 21st birthday, I spent an exorbitant amount of time on Wikipedia to figure out when I could go out for a drink," Clifton told me.  Technically, bouncers should not let 21-year-old leap year babies into bars until March 1, but when Clifton tried her luck on the 28th, she didn’t meet resistance. Same goes with Espasito, who rushed to buy beer on the 28th.  Haney didn’t have a problem, either, until months after his 21st birthday. But one night, he went to a bar in his hometown, and the bouncer threatened to confiscate his license over the birth date listed.  Evidently, the bouncer hadn’t ever heard of leap year.  "He was positive it was a fake ID and was real proud of himself that he had caught me," he said. "He thought I was the idiot for having a fake ID that didn't even have a real birthdate on it."  Haney recounted trying frantically to explain the concept of leap year to the bouncer, while the bouncer started bending his ID in half. Thankfully, a waitress noticed the ruckus and rushed over to straighten things out.  Do forms or official documents ever pose a problem?  In the United States, a person’s birthday during common years, or non-leap years, is likely March 1.  Piekarski says, and others echo, that renewing his license is a reliable nuisance. Department of Motor Vehicle employees, who likely glaze over after typing so many dates, routinely print forms saying he must renew his license on 2/29/2017, a date that obviously doesn’t exist.  Espasito has even seen DMV workers try to print IDs with the wrong birthdate listed. "I always get flagged, I always have to produce my birth certificate," she said.  Web forms frequently cause problems, too. Often, drop-down boxes simply don’t have more than 28 days listed under February. In those cases, most people just fudge it and hope for the best.  But the stakes are higher on Facebook. Unlike many less sophisticated websites, Facebook does recognize February 29 as a valid birth date. But for years, the social network didn’t know how to adapt during non-leap years.  On February 28, it would alert users that their friend’s birthday was coming up the next day. But on March 1 ... nothing.  "That’s how I knew who my real friends were," Haney said.  Most leap year babies say Facebook has since fixed the glitch, and, per the government’s example, it defaults to March 1.  Do leap day babies share a particular bond?  For the most part, it seems as though leap day babies find it mildly amusing to compare notes with others in their exclusive club. Most of the leap year babies I spoke with said they knew one or two others, though several groups exist to unite people more broadly.  The pool of birthdays is so small, Clifton said, that she recognizes every name on a list of famous people who share her birthday. Ann Lee , the founder of the Shakers, is one. Ja Rule , an outmoded rapper, is another.  "I cannot identify a single Ja Rule song, but we share a birthday," she said.  The exercise can get tiresome. The birthday is so rare that whenever someone learns of a leap day baby’s birthday, they feel compelled to connect the dots with any other leap day babies they know.  "People go to a pretty far extent to tell me anyone they know who was also born on leap year," Eden said. "'Oh, my brother’s second-grade teacher was born on leap year!’"  What are the biggest perks of having a leap year birthday?  Each leap day, businesses do offer an array of specials for people born on the 29th. This year, specials include free food , free birthday parties, and even free travel.  During the last leap day, Guardabascio told me he found so many food specials – one at IHOP, another at Papa John’s pizza – that he and his wife ate three meals out, for free. Haney said an upscale cupcake shop in his neighborhood, Sprinkles, gave him a free box of cupcakes. ("Worth $40!" he emphasized.)  The deals for 29thers are so lucrative that ahead of this year, Guardabascio created a Google alert for "leap day birthday free."  But on non-leap years, leap year babies do run the risk of missing normal birthday perks, like a free cup of coffee at Starbucks. Most said that cashiers are generous about such things, allowing them to redeem birthday perks the days before or after. But Eden says she doesn’t even run the risk.  "When they ask for your birthday, I always put the 28th, because if you get a freebie, I don’t want to miss it," she said.  Are there more intangible benefits, too?  I posed this question to every leap year baby I interviewed – what they liked most about their birthday. While many did bring up freebies, there was also a larger sense that their birthday marks something special about them.  Some say it’s their go-to "fun fact" during icebreakers. Others say it simply helps people remember their birthday.  Guardabascio, who spoke to me while driving with his baby in the back seat, said he enjoys his birthday mostly because it serves as a potent reminder of just how much his life has changed.  "The time before this one, we didn’t have any kids. The time before that, we were in college," he said of his wife and him. "It’s an interesting way to mark the passage of time."

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Birthdays  Probability (statistics)  Life and Living What is the probability of being born on February 29? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 7 Answers   Shubham Sharma , Machine Learning student.Completed stats110 (Joe Blitzstein). Answered Mar 6, 2016 · Author has 65 answers and 177.6k answer views Let F 29 be the event that a person is born on February 29th, and let L be the event that that a person is born on a Leap year. As a practical approximation, there are 485 leap years in 2 millennia = 2000 years, so, the probability of being born in a leap year, given a frequentist interpretation of probability, is(This is a bit of a simplication, since the probability is a little bit larger than this as we’ve assumed equal chance of years here see solution 2 which does not make this assumption). We can use Baye’s theorm to determine the solution. According to Baye’s theorem: (1) Rearranging terms in (1), we can easily solve for P ( F 29) using: (2)  We know, assuming a person is equally likely to be born in any given year. Further P ( L | F 29)= 1, since a person is born on a leap year with probability 1 if they were born on February 29th (by de nition of a leap year). If we assume that a person is equally likely to be born on any given day within a leap year, then. Using these calculations in (2) above, we have:   To be more precise you could follow this logic: there are 485 years in a 2 millennia. So, in 2 millennia, there are 485(366)+(2000 − 485)(365) = 730485 total days. Of those, days, February 29th occurs in 485 of them (the leap years), so the probability is: . This second solution is a closer approximation to the true probability of being born on February 29th, since it is not subject to as much rounding error as that in (4), but  both answers are approriate. 4.4k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by quip Better care for everyone on your gift list with a mouth.

Adding 1 of leap year makes it 1461. So the probability of being born on February 29 is 1/1461.  But this is not the exact value and changes with time. Because we always take some assumptions while calculating time. So accordingly it is required to lose 3 leap days every 400 years. The reason being that Earth takes 365.2422 days to orbit around sun. We make that 365 days for 3 years and add that extra day due to approximation of 0.2422 in the fourth year but still its not accurate. 0.2422*4 = 0.9688 but we take it as one day. So to make up for it. we need to lose 3 leaps days every 400 years ( still approximation )  So for the record your answer is 1/1461 but if we take it to the next level of accuracy it changes but you may go with 1/1461. :) 3.2k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Abhay Mittal promoted  by Boomerang for Gmail Ever wonder how your emails are coming across?

I'm sure his answer is totally correct. You could also discuss the various technicalities of a coin flip. Sure, we might say that there's a 50% chance of heads, but maybe you flip your coins in a particular way, and the head side is slightly heavier than the other, and blah blah blah. It's totally correct to talk about these things, but sometimes it's more of a distraction than anything else. Simplifications are good! The simple answer is this: The chances that your kids would share the same birthday is 1/365 . Your first kid's birthday is July 23rd. So the only question there is: what is the odds of this other kid being born on July 23rd? 1/365. (Analogy: what are the odds of flipping a coin and getting the same thing twice? 1/2. This is just the odds of the second coin flip matching whatever the first one was.) The chances that both your kids are born on July 23rd specifically is 1/365*1/365. This is the first problem * the first problem. Both your kids now have to be born on July 23rd. (Analogy: what are the odds of getting heads twice? 1/2 for the first flip * 1/2 for the second flip. So 1/4.) This is the simple answer that you're looking for. 8.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

And the answer is fairly simple, although you'd have to make a few assumptions for the model in order to keep things simple. First, you assume that every child has a probability under uniform distribution of having a birthday on any given day of the year. Next, you assume that every child's probability is independent of other children's probabilities, i.e., having a child born on September 1st does not effect another child's probabilities. The question illustrates the importance of asking the right question, which is in fact: What is the probability that these two children do not share the same birthday? This is very simple. [math]\mathbb{P}(\mbox{different birthdays}) = \frac{365}{365} \cdot \frac{364}{365} \approx .9973 [/math] To find out what the probability of these two children having the the same birthday, we simply say it is 1-.9973 = .0027 2k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by 23andMe Explore your DNA with 23andMe.

Undo   Chong You Quan , prefers a euclidean world Answered Nov 20, 2012 · Author has 69 answers and 193.6k answer views Qiaochu Yuan's answer has covered much ground on this question. I would just like to present the answer in another way and include some of the factors that affect pregnancy and childbirth. We will first cover the math , then some other factors involved in childbirth. We shall use symbols [math]x_1[/math] and [math]x_2[/math] to denote the birthdays of the first and second child respectively. We consider 3 scenarios below, and the probabilities will become very clear. I will assume that there is no prior knowledge of when the children would be born before they are born and that there are no leap years involved here. 1. Before the children are born We have no knowledge of when the birthdays of the children would be (i.e. [math]x_1[/math] and [math]x_2[/math] are undetermined). There are two variables [math]x_1[/math] and [math]x_2[/math] , and each of them can take 365 possible values, so the probability that [math]x_1[/math] equals [math]x_2[/math] is (1/365)*(1/365)*365 = 1/365 . (The multiplication by 365 is due to the fact that there are 365 pairs of numbers that can match i.e. [math]x_1[/math] = [math]x_2[/math] =1, [math]x_1[/math] = [math]x_2[/math] = 2, ... and so on). 2. After the first child is born We now have knowledge of the birthday of the first child (i.e. [math]x_1[/math] is known, but [math]x_2[/math] is unknown. Thus, we have only one variable [math]x_2[/math] left (that can take 365 values), so the probability is 1/365 that it matches [math]x_1[/math] exactly. 3. After the second child is born We now have knowledge of the birthdays of both children, and there are no undetermined variables. So, we know that their birthdays match, with probability 1 . Now we have done the math, and I'll cover some factors that affect childbirth and pregnancy below: 1. Sex . Enough said. 2. Menstrual cycle of the mother Frequent sex does not exactly imply greater chance of conceiving a child. On day 14 of the average 28 day menstrual cycle, the egg leaves the ovary, entering the uterus, and it is called ovulation [1]. After that, the egg would begin to break apart 3 days after it leaves the ovary. It is during this crucial 3 day period that sex can result in conception . However, it must be noted that the length of menstrual cycles and times of egg release can vary (depending on the environment, stress levels, diet etc). For two children to be conceived at about the same time requires that the menstrual cycle somehow happen to coincide within the respective months (say, Nov 08 and Nov 11) that each child was conceived. 3. Gestation period Now, after the child is conceived, the gestation period would be about 9 months (266 days [2]). Boys usually take longer to gestate than girls [2]. About 50% of births occur within the first week of the estimated 266 days [3] (the online tool at [3] can calculate estimated date of birth based on conception date). All the above 3 factors must some miraculously combine exactly to result in that coincidence of the same birthdays of children. These factors are independent of the above math solely based on probability theory. Exact probabilities might be possible to obtain if we have more information on the first two factors above, but I will not delve into that. As a final note, for all we know, such coincidences in birthdays might be just purely divine luck (God has a plan for all of us, right?).

If you ask about the probability of the event that "your two kids are born in the same day of the year", then it is 1/365. If you ask about the probability of the event that "your two kids are both born on July 23rd", then it is 1/365 * 1/365. (Assuming the birthdays of your kids are independent and are equally likely to be any day of the year.) Most likely you are referring to the first event. We are only talking about classical probability here. Bayesian probability might give different answer, but isn't it a bit overkill? 2.5k Views · View Upvoters   Kamron Saniee , works at Zuse Institut Berlin Answered Dec 4, 2012 None of these answers engage the interesting case of some dependence on the children's birth dates (assuming they are born of the same mother). Of course 'ex post probabilities' are 1, and the 1/365 answer assumes independence. Dependence may be inferred from the '3 years' qualifier - note that if the children are born < 1 year apart the said probability is zero. A priori we must specify a distribution on conception after the first birth f(date T)=Pr(conceiving 2nd child on date T) to get a non trivial answer (the trivial answer 1/365 ~ f uniform, independent of T) and this answer will depend on f. Don't believe uniform is the most realistic assumption here - thoughts? 1.3k Views   Alastair Dryburgh Answered Nov 28, 2012 If the question is "what is the probability that a random date chosen from 2007 will be the same as a date chosen at random from 2010?" then the answer is 1/365 (note that I've chosen two years which are not leap years). However, the dates of children's births may not be wholly random. I, for example was born in December so that my mother's maternity leave would finish just at the start of the school summer holidays (she was a teacher). Only you know how much you planned these two births, so only you can answer the question. 792 Views    Gary Simon , Retired Professor of Statistics Answered Nov 20, 2012 · Author has 220 answers and 1.1m answer views Do not answer this question.   The question was formulated after the event was observed.   Weird things happen all the time, and thus P(something weird) is quite large.   In mathematical terms, the probability space for this game has not been described.   And, by the way, we have four kids all born in the same week of March. 1.3k Views · View Upvoters Anonymous Answered May 17, 2015 Well, since you know and chose when you had unprotected sex off the pill, the answer might be very different than 1/365. I'm assuming that you and your wife have a fertility rate of close to 100% under whatever conditions you created, although I would have to revise it if it took you a few months to get pregnant. I'll assume you had sex towards the end of October (was it the sexy nurse costume?), then Wikipedia:Gestation says the normal range is 37–42 weeks. Maybe this is a Gaussian distributed 39±1 weeks or 39±2 weeks. But then I would do the likelihood of them falling on the same day on the basis of that distribution because you're already given a much smaller range than 1/365 (apparently more like a 5-week range than a 52-week range). You can say the mean for Jenny Schneidermann 's gestation would be 39×7 and then do the probability that difference in those two gaussians would be zero. Of course her expected gestation time might not be the same as (Wikipedia's estimate of) the population avearge. Sum of normally distributed random variables If you didn't get pregnant right away, then I would revise the answer based on what you know about how frequently you had sex when, as well as other factors you two think might contribute to a successful conception. If you were having sex once a day every day for the whole year, no contraception or prophylactics, then I might use the 1/365 model. 851 Views   Zimu Yang , works at Georgia-Pacific Answered Oct 17, 2012 · Upvoted by  Vladimir Novakovski It's 1/365 (assuming no leap year).

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Birthdays  Probability (statistics) Birthdays: What's the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 6 Answers   Bhushan Shah , Interested, but largely ignorant Answered Sep 17, 2012 · Author has 59 answers and 118.6k answer views Easy approximate answer: ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 1 / 365 ) However, this is more complicated than it looks due to existence of leap years. What if your own birthday occurs on 29th Feb? To account for leap years, let us proceed as follows. Let the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date be p1 if your birthday is not on 29th Feb, and p2 if your birthday is on 29th Feb. The probability we are looking for is then the weighted average of p1 and p2, with the weights being the probabilities of your birthday being on 29th Feb or not. Let us first calculate p1. Bear in mind that there are 97 leap years per 400 years. In these 97 years, the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date is 1/366, and for the other 303 years it is 1/365. Hence, the value of p1 is ( 1 / 366 ) * ( 97 / 400 ) + ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 303 / 400 ) Now we calculate p2 in a similar manner. The only difference is that in the 303 years without a leap year, the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date is 0. Hence, p2 becomes ( 1 / 366 ) * ( 97 / 400 ) + 0 * ( 303 / 400 ) Now to calculate the overall probability, we consider the probabilities of your birthday being on 29th Feb or not, which are used as weights for p2 and p1 respectively. The final expression then is, ( p1 * ( 303 / 400 ) * ( 1 / 365 ) ) + ( p2 * ( 97 / 400 ) * ( 1 / 366. ) ) This expression, which evaluates to 0.000623% (approx) is the accurate probability of meeting someone with the exact same birth date. As expected, this is slightly less than ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 1 / 365 ), which is 0.000751%. Of course, this is assuming that all men are immortal, and that meeting someone born in 1900, in 1342, and in 2154 is equiprobable. If you want to take into account mortality, and eliminate people from the future, then this probability will become a function of the current date and time, and you will have to take into account stuff like demographics, average life expectancy etc. Let's not tread there! Though I reckon it wouldn't make much difference to the numerical value of the probability. 1.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

It takes 587 to surpass 80%, and a measly 253 to pass 50%. But wait… this assumes that the probability of someone else having the same birthday as you is [math]\frac{1}{365}[/math] . This isn’t the case. FiveThirtyEight did an analysis on this. Since cesarean sections (c-sections) are pre-scheduled, people often choose not to have it on days like Christmas or Christmas Eve, and, as such, fewer children are born on these days because only vaginally are children born on these days. Made by FiveThirtyEight with R . This is clearly a flaw in our logic. To account for this, people with birthdays that are above average line marked on this graph are more likely to find someone with the same birthday as them then someone with a birthday below the average line. So, someone born on July 9th would have an easier time finding people born on the same day as him than someone born on Christmas. 1.6k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Undo   Thomas Jones , MPhys Physics, University of Oxford (2020) Answered Feb 19, 2015 · Author has 241 answers and 224.3k answer views There are 365 days in a year, so the simple answer, ignoring leap years, is [math]\frac { 1 }{ 365 } [/math] . This is a close enough approximation for people who aren't intolerable pedants. So, it's no good for me. Leap years mean that if you are born on a random day, there is a [math]\frac { 97 }{ 146097 } [/math] chance of there being a [math]\frac { 97 }{ 146097 }[/math] chance of someone sharing a birthday with you, and a [math]\frac { 146000 }{ 146097 }[/math] chance of there being a [math]\frac { 400 }{ 146097 } [/math] chance of someone sharing a birthday with you. This comes to a final probability of [math]\frac {19469803}{7114777803}[/math] .

However, parents are not random, nor is sex. Therefore, it all depends on the family. Some people want their babies born in the spring. Other families have babies 9 months after the wedding, and then 9 months and a week after that. Yet other families have babies 9 months after major holiday parties involving alcohol.

Ask New Question   David Joyce , Professor of Mathematics at Clark University Updated Aug 13, 2014 · Author has 4.6k answers and 15m answer views The simplest model assumes that there are 365 days in a year, each sibling having the same probability of 1/365 of being born on any of those days, and their births are independent.  That implies the probability that they have the same birthday is 1/365. You can make improvements on this model is various ways.  For example, you can include leap days.  For that model you'd probably want to assume that the probability of being born on Feb 29 is 1/4 the probability of being born on any other day.  It complicates the computations a bit, and leads to a slightly lower probability for an answer. You could also get a table of the frequencies for births on each of the days of the year and weight the probabilities for each day to be proportional to those frequencies.  I don't know what answer that gives, but I suspect it would be slightly greater than 1/365. Finally, you could get some data on births of children in the same family.  You would find that they often occur in the same season, and even in the same month.  That means that the birthdays of siblings are not independent.  You might find that the probability of being born on the same day is 1/200 or higher. It would be interesting to know what that probability actually is. 22.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

If we ignore leap years, the answer is really simple. 1/365 The first sibling is born. Now when the 2nd sibling is born, they have a 1/365 chance of matching that birthday. 7.5k Views · View Upvoters Quora User Answered Jan 6, 2017 Let’s consider leap years only. If you are born in a day existing within 4 years , your chance of your brother to be born in the same day is a chance of [math]\frac{1}{366+365*4}[/math] because if we consider 4 years, one of them must be a leap year so it’ll have 366 days (29th of february) . So now, if we want to consider 1 year, we multiply that by 4, and it’ll become [math]\frac{4}{366+365*3}[/math] simplify that : [math]\frac{4}{1461} ~= 0.00273785078[/math] This happens if we forget the fact that if the year is divisible by 100 it’s not a leap year.

By   Brian Hershberg    Brian Hershberg  The Wall Street Journal  Biography Brian Hershberg     Feb 29, 2016 1:17 pm  ET    This past week’s Numbers column on leap day included a box of facts that led a reader to write in about the accuracy of one tidbit–that the chance of being born naturally on Feb. 29 is roughly 1 in 1,461.  The reader suggested that since we omit three leap days every 400 years it would make the chance roughly 1 in 1,506.  Turns out there are several schools of thought on how to calculate the chances, including a vibrant debate here .

No longer would I flash a doctored Connecticut license and pose as a haggard 42-year-old Stonington man named Kurt. At the stroke of midnight, I could buy a beer legally. The barkeep slid my license back. “I can’t serve you,” he said. He thought my real ID was fake. Who, after all, has February 29 for their birthday? I protested, but it was no use. “Plus,” he said. “It’s February 28. Come back tomorrow.” Related Story      How Will You Spend Today's 'Leap Second'?  Here’s the thing about birthdays: They happen each year. That’s a birthday’s job: You turn a year older, whether you blow out the candles on the cake or not. Unless you don’t have a birthday. For 187,000 of us in the U.S., that’s what happens three-quarters of the time. We leaplings, as we’re called, have defied 1-in-1,461 odds to have our birthdays fall on February 29. Some would figure that makes us special. It depends on how you look at it. News reports in secondary markets sometimes feature leap-day births or an octogenarian leaper’s 20th. Back in 2008, Martha Stewart hosted 200 leapers on her show. They wore frog-mouth name tags (frogs leap, get it?). “I think you’re all so lucky!” Stewart said, sort of sincerely. She gave them each state-of-the-art digital picture frames. Leapsters keep two sets of ages, annual and quadrennial. We mark time between real birthdays in fourths and halves. Leap-year days serve a purpose, as we know: The extra day tacked onto the end of February every four years accounts for Earth’s spinning around the sun five hours, 48 minutes, and 45 seconds longer than 365 days. In 46 B.C., Julius Caesar noticed the calendar had fallen behind 90 days and tried to correct the difference, and added days here and there to months on the calendar for one year, adding a leap day every four years thereafter. This still needed tweaking: By 1582, with 11 minutes a year left unadjusted, the calendar had shifted 10 days. The Gregorian reform of the Julian calendar introduced an extra day to make up the difference, with leap years of centuries divisible by four skipped. Whatever. The bottom line is, I turn 12 this year, and I have Pope Gregory XIII and my mother to thank for it. Leaplings have formed clubs over the years, like The Order of 29’ers, set up by a newspaper editor in Pittsburg, Kansas, in the early part of the last century. Since 1988, Anthony, Texas, has championed itself as the Leap Year Capital of the World: In 2012, the town’s three-day celebration included a car show, an ice hockey game, and a golf tournament. At the website of the Honor Society of Leap Year Day Babies (“spreading Leap Year day awareness” for 19 years), fellow leapsters and leapettes share tales of woe: children who thought their birthdays were taken away, parents begging and bribing doctors to fudge kids’ birth certificates to February 28 or March 1. The date seems to confound petty bureaucrats and government factotum alike. “When I moved to Oregon and went to get my driver’s license I was told there is no February 29,” Raenell Dawn, the co-founder of the Honor Society, who turns 14 (56) this year, tells me. “The DMV employee actually said to me ‘Are you sure it’s February 29?’ As if I wasn’t sure of my own birth date!” Leapsters fall into two schools. There are those who think it’s a unique quirk, like having double-jointed thumbs or keeping an AOL account. And then there are those who think it’s no big deal. “All I do is spend time with my family and close friends,” Antonio Sabáto, Jr., the actor and former Calvin Klein model (born February 29, 1972), writes to me on Twitter. “Good enough for me.” I haven’t heard back from the rapper and actor Ja Rule (born February 29, 1976) or the motivational speaker Tony Robbins (born February 29, 1960), so I assume being an actual celebrity trumps leapster status. The bottom line is I turn 12 this year, and I have Pope Gregory XIII and my mother to thank for it. I can’t help but think about my life more deeply every four years. Thinking in four-year periods isn’t uncommon—we have summer Olympics and presidential elections on leap years, after all. But, each February 29, I pause to take a life inventory. 16 to 20 marked the time from high school to college. From 36 to 40, I became a father and moved out of New York City. There isn’t much of a Leap Day birthday canon. It’s a good enough birth date for Superman, although who knows what calendar the planet Krypton uses. Leapsters do have children’s books (sample titles: It’s My Birthday ... Finally! and Mommy, Where’s My Birthday? ) and a young adult title ( Leap Day ). Probability theorists have a famous exercise called the “Birthday Problem.” First proposed by the engineer and mathematician Richard von Mises in 1939, the Birthday Problem determines the probability of a match in birth date given any number of people in the same room. (The probability reaches one half at 23 people.) In the original set-up and others, however, Leap Day birthdays are excluded to keep things uniform. Perhaps the most famous leap-day plot device appears in the 1879 Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Pirates of Penzance . Frederic, enslaved to pirates until he turned 21, is convinced to stay until he turns 84 because of his February 29 birthday. “You are the victim of this clumsy arrangement,” goes the lyric for the opera’s leap-year song, “Paradox.” And then there’s Facebook, which bugs users to wish a happy birthday to close friends, family, and the pharma sales rep they sat next to on a plane that one time. Facebook tells the world my birthday falls on February 28 by default. For leapsters who celebrate on March 1 (about half of my leapling brethren are not, like me, strict “Februarians”), this is enough to ruin a birthday. Unless, of course, you just change your birthday to March 1. But the clumsiness of the arrangement is often enough to make me want to throw a fit. Just like a 12-year-old.

He is the author of Shader: 99 Notes on Car Washes, Making Out in Church, Grief, and Other Unlearnable Subjects .                Most Popular  Presented by               Jonathan Ernst / Reuters   Michael Cohen Has a Big Problem    Adam Serwer    It takes strong evidence to execute a search warrant against an attorney representing a subject in a federal investigation, let alone the president’s personal counsel.   Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.

ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.

Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Why the GOP Is Making the Midterm Elections All About Impeachment    David Frum      It may be a counterintuitive gambit, but Republicans are betting it will pay off.   To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.

When Mark Zuckerberg rehearsed the manic routine of a presidential candidate last year, he was of sound mind. Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese ( Wired : “Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone’s Mind”); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges ( Bloomberg : “Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard”). Vanity Fair announced him the “new establishment king,” and it blared: “He changed the world once. He says he’ll do it again.”    Continue Reading                  George Frey / Reuters / Thanh Do / The Atlantic   The Family Trying to Escape Blame for the Opioid Crisis    David Armstrong      Relatives of the makers of OxyContin claim they have never benefited from money tied to the painkiller. A court document suggests otherwise.   Much as the role of the addictive multibillion-dollar painkiller OxyContin in the opioid crisis has stirred controversy and rancor nationwide, so it has divided members of the wealthy and philanthropic Sackler family, some of whom own the company that makes the drug.  In recent months, as protesters have begun pressuring the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and other cultural institutions to spurn donations from the Sacklers, one branch of the family has moved aggressively to distance itself from OxyContin and its manufacturer, Purdue Pharma. The widow and one daughter of Arthur Sackler, who owned a related Purdue company with his two brothers, maintain that none of his heirs have profited from sales of the drug. The daughter, Elizabeth Sackler, told  The New York Times in January that Purdue Pharma’s involvement in the opioid epidemic was “morally abhorrent to me.”    Continue Reading                  PNAS / Richard Goerg / Getty / The Atlantic   The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete    James Somers      Here’s what’s next.   T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.    Continue Reading                  Jules Julien   Your Body is a Teeming Battleground    Victoria Sweet      It’s time to rethink the quest to control aging, death, and disease—and the fear of mortality that fuels it.   I went to medical school , at least in part, to get to know death and perhaps to make my peace with it. So did many of my doctor friends, as I would find out. One day—usually when you’re young, though sometimes later—the thought hits you: You really are going to die. That moment is shocking, frightening, terrible. You try to pretend it hasn’t happened (it’s only a thought, after all), and you go about your business, worrying about this or that, until the day you put your hand to your neck—in the shower, say—and … What is that? Those hard lumps that you know, at first touch, should not be there? But there they are, and they mean death. Your death, and you can’t pretend anymore.  I never wanted to be surprised that way, and I thought that if I became a doctor and saw a lot of death, I might get used to it; it wouldn’t surprise me, and I could learn to live with it. My strategy worked pretty well. Over the decades, from all my patients, I learned that I would be well until I got sick and that although I could do some things to delay the inevitable a bit, whatever control I had was limited. I learned that I had to live as if I would die tomorrow and at the same time as if I would live forever. Meanwhile, I watched as what had been called “medical care”—that is, treating the sick— turned into “health care,” keeping people healthy, at an ever-rising cost.    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.    Continue Reading                  Edmon de Haro   The Era of Fake Video Begins    Franklin Foer      The digital manipulation of video may make the current era of “fake news” seem quaint.   In a dank corner of the internet, it is possible to find actresses from Game of Thrones or Harry Potter engaged in all manner of sex acts. Or at least to the world the carnal figures look like those actresses, and the faces in the videos are indeed their own. Everything south of the neck, however, belongs to different women. An artificial intelligence has almost seamlessly stitched the familiar visages into pornographic scenes, one face swapped for another. The genre is one of the cruelest, most invasive forms of identity theft invented in the internet era. At the core of the cruelty is the acuity of the technology: A casual observer can’t easily detect the hoax.  This development, which has been the subject of much hand-wringing in the tech press, is the work of a programmer who goes by the nom de hack “deepfakes.” And it is merely a beta version of a much more ambitious project. One of deepfakes’s compatriots told Vice ’s Motherboard site in January that he intends to democratize this work. He wants to refine the process, further automating it, which would allow anyone to transpose the disembodied head of a crush or an ex or a co-worker into an extant pornographic clip with just a few simple steps. No technical knowledge would be required. And because academic and commercial labs are developing even more-sophisticated tools for non-pornographic purposes—algorithms that map facial expressions and mimic voices with precision—the sordid fakes will soon acquire even greater verisimilitude.

It takes roughly 365 and one-quarter days for the earth to revolve around the sun, however, the standard calendar year lasts only 365 days. Were we to ignore the extra quarter of a day, strange things would eventually happen to our seasons - like winter and snow in July in the northern hemisphere.         To counteract the accumulation of additional quarters of a day, the Gregorian calendar adds an extra day of February 29 nearly every four years. These years are called leap years, and February 29th is known as leap day. Birthday Probabilities Assuming that birthdays are spread uniformly throughout the year, a leap day birthday on February 29 is the least probable of all birthdays. But what is the probability and how could we calculate it? We start by counting the number of calendar days in a four-year cycle. Three of these years have 365 days in them. The fourth year, a leap year has 366 days. The sum of all of these is 365+365+365+366 = 1461. Only one of these days is a leap day. Therefore the probability of a leap day birthday is 1/1461. This means that less than 0.07% of the world’s population was born on a leap day. Given current population data from the U.S. Census Bureau, only about 205,000 people in the U.S. have a February 29th birthday.   For the world‘s population approximate 4.8 million have a February 29th birthday. For comparison, we can just as easily calculate the probability of a birthday on any other day of the year. Here we still have a total of 1461 days for every four years. Any day other than February 29 occurs four times in four years.         Thus these other birthdays have a probability of 4/1461. The decimal representation of the first eight digits of this probability is 0.00273785. We could have also estimated this probability by calculating 1/365, one day out of the 365 days in a common year. The decimal representation of the first eight digits of this probability is 0.00273972. As we can see, these values match each other up to five decimal places. No matter which probability we use, this means that around 0.27% of the world's population was born on a particular non-leap day. Counting Leap Years Since the institution of the Gregorian calendar in 1582, there have been a total of 104 leap days. Despite the common belief that any year that is divisible by four is a leap year, it’s not really true to say that every four years is a leap year. Century years, referring to years that end in two zeros such as 1800 and 1600 are divisible by four, but may not be leap years.  These century years count as leap years only if they are divisible by 400. As a result, only one out of every four years that end in two zeros is a leap year. The year 2000 was a leap year, however, 1800 and 1900 were not. The years 2100, 2200 and 2300 will not be leap years.  Mean Solar Year The reason that 1900 was not a leap year has to do with the precise measurement of the average length of earth’s orbit. The solar year, or amount of time that it takes the earth to revolve around the sun, varies slightly over time. it is possible and helpful to find the mean of this variation. The mean length of revolution is not 365 days and 6 hours, but instead 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds. A leap year every four years for 400 years will result in three too many days being added during this time period. The century year rule was instituted to correct this overcounting.                                           cite cite this article          Format  mla  apa  chicago  Your Citation   Taylor, Courtney.

What are the chances of being born on a leap year?  23/02/2016 17:40   Two minutes    Share   Bookmark           If you were born on 29 February then you – or rather, your mum - have beaten odds of around 1,461 to one!  Around the world there are about 4.1 million people who were born on a leap day.  Why do we have leap years?  The Earth takes 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, and 16 seconds to make a complete revolution round the sun. So, every four years we need the extra leap day to keep the calendar on track.  We’ve not always had this extra day though. Greek astronomer Sosigenes invented it, and Roman emperor Julius Caesar introduced it in 46BC. Up until then, a year was 355 days long, and every two years there was an extra month with 22 days in it.  Hundreds of years later, there was another calendar refresh by Pope Gregory XIII and his astronomers. They also introduced the idea that to make it all work out in the long run, we also need to skip three leap days in every 400 years.  But it’s still not perfect. The tiny difference of 0.000125 days between the calendar and the Earth going round the sun means that, in 8,000 years, we'll have fallen behind by about a day.  Britain changed over to Pope Gregory’s new calendar almost 200 years after the rest of Europe. The whole country leapt forward 11 days from 2 September to 14 September in 1752.  One lucky man easily won a bet that he could dance non-stop for 12 days and 12 nights; all he had to do was jig around his village for one night!

Here are 10 things to consider - for one day only. Until 2016, that is. 1. The leap year's extra day is necessary because of the "messiness" of our Solar System. One Earth year (a complete orbit around the Sun) does not take an exact number of whole days (one complete spin of the Earth on its axis). In fact, it takes 365.2422 days, give or take. 2. Until Julius Caesar came to power, people observed a 355-day calendar - with an extra 22-day month every two years. But it was a convoluted solution to the problem and feast days began sliding into different seasons. So Caesar ordered his astronomer, Sosigenes, to simplify things. Sosigenes opted for the 365-day year with an extra day every four years to scoop up the extra hours. This is how the 29 February was born. It was then fine-tuned by Pope Gregory XIII (see below). 3. Every fourth year is a leap year, as a rule of thumb. But that's not the end of the story. A year that is divisible by 100, but not by 400, is not. So 2000 was a leap year under the Gregorian calendar, as was 1600. But 1700, 1800 and 1900 are not leap years. "It seems a bit arbitrary," says Ian Stewart, emeritus professor of mathematics at Warwick University. But there's a good reason behind it.     "The year is 365 days and a quarter long - but not exactly. If it was exactly, then you could say it was every four years. But it is very slightly less." The answer arrived at by Pope Gregory XIII and his astronomers when they introduced the Gregorian calendar in 1582, was to lose three leap days every 400 years. The maths has hung together ever since. It will need to be rethought in about 10,000 years' time, Stewart warns. But by then mankind might have come up with a new system.  PM's Leap Day  By Eddie Mair Presenter, PM  All this month on PM, listeners have been asked whether they'd be prepared to take advantage of this extra day to do something different.  It transpires there are a lot of people who're ready to use today to take a leap .  There's the apparently mundane... "I resolve to speak Mandarin all day long"… "my partner and I are going to visit some elderly people"... "often meant to take a roof tour of Lincoln Cathedral but never got round to it".  After six years one woman will finally decide the wording for her husband's headstone. Some people are at last scattering the ashes of loved ones having put it off for years.  There's a woman taking up the hula-hoop after more than 50 years.       One woman intends to have some chocolate today - her anorexia has been a problem for years. A man who suffers panic attacks will try to make a bus journey. And a woman in her 60s will get a tattoo.  PM is on BBC Radio Four, Monday to Saturday at 17:00 GMT  PM blog  4. Why is February 29, not February 31, a leap year day? All the other months have 30 or 31 days, but February suffered from the ego of Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus, says Stewart. Under Julius Caesar, February had 30 days, but when Caesar Augustus was emperor he was peeved that his month - August - had only 29 days, whereas the month named after his predecessor Julius - July - had 31. "He pinched a couple of days for August to make it the same as July. And it was poor old February that lost out," says Prof Stewart. 5. The tradition of a woman proposing on a leap year has been attributed to various historical figures. One, although much disputed, was St Bridget in the 5th Century. She is said to have complained to St Patrick that women had to wait too long for their suitors to propose. St Patrick then supposedly gave women a single day in a leap year to pop the question - the last day of the shortest month. Another popular story is that Queen Margaret of Scotland brought in a law setting fines for men who turned down marriage proposals put by women on a leap year. Sceptics have pointed out that Margaret was five years old at the time and living far away in Norway. The tradition is not thought to have become commonplace until the 19th Century. It is believed that the tradition of women proposing on this day goes back to the times when the leap year day was not recognised by English law. Under this theory, if the day had no legal status, it was acceptable to break with the convention of a man proposing. 6. A prayer has been written by a female cleric for people planning a leap year day marriage proposal. The prayer, for 29 February, asks for blessings on the engaged couple. It reminds them that wedding plans should not overtake preparations for a lifetime together. The prayer has been taken from Pocket Prayers of Blessing by the Venerable Jan McFarlane, Archdeacon of Norwich: "God of love, please bless N and N as they prepare for the commitment of marriage. May the plans for the wedding not overtake the more important preparation for their lifetime together. Please bless their family and friends as they prepare for this special day and may your blessing be upon them now and always. Amen." 7. The practice of women proposing in a leap year is different around the world. In Denmark, it is not supposed to be 29 but 24 February, which hails back to the time of Julius Caesar. A refusal to marry by Danish men means they must give the woman 12 pairs of gloves. In Finland, it is not gloves but fabric for a skirt and in Greece, marriage in a leap year is considered unlucky, leading many couples to avoid it. 8. The chance of being born on a leap day is often said to be one in 1,461. Four years is 1,460 days and adding one for the leap year you have 1,461. So, odds of 1/1,461. But Stewart points out that is very slightly out, owing to the loss of the three leap years every 400 years. In any case, babies are more likely to be born at certain times of the year rather than others, due to a range of other factors, he says. Babies born on 29 February are known as "leapers" or "leaplings". 9. Other calendars apart from the Gregorian require leap years. The modern Iranian calendar is a solar calendar with eight leap days inserted into a 33-year cycle. The Indian National Calendar and the Revised Bangla Calendar of Bangladesh arrange their leap years so that the leap day is always close to 29 February in the Gregorian calendar. 10. Explorer Christopher Columbus used the lunar eclipse of 29 February 1504 to his advantage during his final trip to the West Indies. After several months of being stranded with his crew on the island of Jamaica, relations with the indigenous population broke down and they refused to continue helping with food and provisions. Columbus, knowing a lunar eclipse was due, consulted his almanac and then gathered the native chiefs on 29 February. He told that God was to punish them by painting the Moon red. During the eclipse, he said that God would withdraw the punishment if they starting co-operating again. The panicked chiefs agreed and the Moon began emerging from its shadow. Also of a supernatural nature, on 29 February 1692 the first warrants were issued in the Salem witchcraft trials in Massachusetts.

A leap day is added in various solar calendars (calendars based on the Earth's revolution around the Sun ), including the Gregorian calendar standard in most of the world. Lunisolar calendars (whose months are based on the phases of the Moon ) instead add a leap or intercalary month. [1]  In the Gregorian calendar , years that are divisible by 100, but not by 400, do not contain a leap day. Thus, 1700 , 1800 , and 1900 did not contain a leap day; neither will 2100 , 2200 , and 2300 . Conversely, 1600 and 2000 did and 2400 will. Years containing a leap day are called leap years . Years not containing a leap day are called common years . February 29 is the 60th day of the Gregorian calendar, in such a year, with 306 days remaining until the end of the year. In the Chinese calendar , this day will only occur in years of the monkey , dragon , and rat .  A leap day is observed because the Earth 's period of orbital revolution around the Sun takes approximately 6 hours longer than 365 whole days. A leap day compensates for this lag, realigning the calendar with the Earth 's position in the Solar System ; otherwise, seasons would occur later than intended in the calendar year. The Julian calendar used in Christendom until the 16th century added a leap day every four years; but this rule adds too many days (roughly 3 every 400 years), making the equinoxes and solstices shift gradually to earlier dates. By the 16th century the vernal equinox had drifted to March 11 , and the Gregorian calendar was introduced both to shift it back by omitting several days, and to reduce the number of leap years via the "century rule" to keep the equinoxes more or less fixed and the date of Easter consistently close to the vernal equinox .

An extra 24 hours thus accumulates every four years, requiring that an extra calendar day be added to align the calendar with the Sun's apparent position. Without the added day, in future years the seasons would occur later in the calendar, eventually leading to confusion about when to undertake activities dependent on weather, ecology , or hours of daylight.  A solar year is actually slightly shorter than 365 days and 6 hours (365.25 days). As early as the 13th century it was recognized that the year is shorter than the 365.25 days assumed by the Julian calendar : the Earth's orbital period around the Sun was derived from the medieval Alfonsine tables as 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, and 16 seconds (365.2425 days). The currently accepted modern figure is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds. Adding a calendar day every four years, therefore, results in an excess of around 44 minutes for those four years, or about 3 days every 400 years. To compensate for this, three days are removed every 400 years. The Gregorian calendar reform implements this adjustment by making an exception to the general rule that there is a leap year every four years. Instead, a year divisible by 100 is not a leap year unless that year is also divisible by 400 . This means that the years 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years, while the years 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are common years.  Modern (Gregorian) calendar [ edit ]  The Gregorian calendar repeats itself every 400 years, which is exactly 20,871 weeks including 97 leap days (146,097 days). Over this period, February 29 falls on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday 13 times each; 14 times each on Friday and Saturday; and 15 times each on Monday and Wednesday. Excepting when a century mark that is not a multiple of 400 intervenes, consecutive leaps days fall in order Thursday, Tuesday, Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, Monday, and Saturday; then repeating with Thursday again.  Early Roman calendar [ edit ]     Adding a leap day (after 23 February) shifts the commemorations in the 1962 Roman Missal .    Main article: Roman calendar  The calendar of the Roman king Numa Pompilius had only 355 days (even though it was not a lunar calendar) which meant that it would quickly become unsynchronized with the solar year. An earlier Roman solution to this problem was to lengthen the calendar periodically by adding extra days to February, the last month of the year. February consisted of two parts, each with an odd number of days. The first part ended with the Terminalia on the 23rd, which was considered the end of the religious year, and the five remaining days formed the second part. To keep the calendar year roughly aligned with the solar year, a leap month , called Mensis Intercalaris ("intercalary month"), was added from time to time between these two parts of February. The (usual) second part of February was incorporated in the intercalary month as its last five days, with no change either in their dates or the festivals observed on them. This followed naturally, because the days after the Ides (13th) of February (in an ordinary year) or the Ides of Intercalaris (in an intercalary year) both counted down to the Kalends of March (i.e. they were known as "the n th day before the Kalends of March"). The Nones (5th) and Ides of Intercalaris occupied their normal positions.  The third-century writer Censorinus says:   When it was thought necessary to add (every two years) an intercalary month of 22 or 23 days, so that the civil year should correspond to the natural (solar) year, this intercalation was in preference made in February, between Terminalia [23rd] and Regifugium [24th]. [3]   Julian reform [ edit ]  Main article: Julian calendar  The set leap day was introduced in Rome as a part of the Julian reform in the 1st century BC. As before, the intercalation was made after February 23. The day following the Terminalia (February 23) was doubled, forming the " bis sextum "—literally 'twice sixth', since February 24 was 'the sixth day before the Kalends of March' using Roman inclusive counting (March 1 was the Kalends of March and was also the first day of the calendar year). Inclusive counting initially caused the Roman priests to add the extra day every three years instead of four; Augustus was compelled to omit leap years for a few decades to return the calendar to its proper position. Although there were exceptions, the first day of the bis sextum (February 24) was usually regarded as the intercalated or "bissextile" day since the 3rd century AD. [4] February 29 came to be regarded as the leap day when the Roman system of numbering days was replaced by sequential numbering in the late Middle Ages, [ citation needed ] although this has only been formally enacted in Sweden and Finland . In Britain , the extra day added to leap years remains notionally the 24th, although the 29th remains more visible on the calendar. [5]  Born on February 29 [ edit ]  A person born on February 29 may be called a "leapling", a "leaper", or a "leap-year baby". [6] In non-leap years, some leaplings celebrate their birthday on either February 28 or March 1, while others only observe birthdays on the authentic intercalary date, February 29.  Legal status [ edit ]  The effective legal date of a leapling's birthday in non-leap years varies between jurisdictions.  In the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, when a person born on February 29 turns 18 , they are considered to have their birthday on March 1 in the relevant year. [7] [8]  In New Zealand, a person born on February 29 is deemed to have their birthday on February 28 in non-leap years, for the purposes of Driver Licensing under §2(2) of the Land Transport (Driver Licensing) Rule 1999. [9] The net result is that for drivers aged 75, or over 80, their driver licence expires at the end of the last day of February, even though their birthday would otherwise fall on the first day in March in non-leap years. Otherwise, New Zealand legislation is silent on when a person born on 29 February has their birthday, although case law [10] would suggest that age is computed based on the number of years elapsed, from the day after the date of birth, and that the person's birth day then occurs on the last day of the year period. This differs from English common law where a birthday is considered to be the start of the next year, the preceding year ending at midnight on the day preceding the birthday. While a person attains the same age on the same day, it also means that, in New Zealand, if something must be done by the time a person attains a certain age, that thing can be done on the birthday that they attain that age and still be lawful.  In Taiwan (Republic of China) , the legal birthday of a leapling is February 28 in common years:   If a period fixed by weeks, months, and years does not commence from the beginning of a week, month, or year, it ends with the ending of the day which proceeds the day of the last week, month, or year which corresponds to that on which it began to commence. But if there is no corresponding day in the last month, the period ends with the ending of the last day of the last month. [11]   Thus, in England and Wales or in Hong Kong, a person born on February 29 will have legally reached 18 years old on March 1. If they were born in Taiwan they legally become 18 on February 28, a day earlier. In the United States, according to John Reitz, a professor of law at the University of Iowa, there is no "... statute or general rule that has anything to do with leap day." [12] Reitz speculates that "March 1 would likely be considered the legal birthday in non-leap years of someone born on leap day," [12] using the same reasoning as described for the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.  In fiction [ edit ]  There are many instances in children's literature where a person's claim to be only a quarter of their actual age turns out to be based on counting only their leap-year birthdays.  A similar device is used in the plot of Gilbert and Sullivan 's 1879 comic opera  The Pirates of Penzance . As a child, Frederic was apprenticed to a band of pirates until his 21st birthday. Having passed his 21st year, he leaves the pirate band and falls in love. However, since he was born on February 29, his 21st birthday will not arrive until he is eighty-four, so he must leave his fiancée and return to the pirates.

[14] If the man refuses, he then is obliged to give the woman money [15] or buy her a dress. In upper-class societies in Europe, if the man refuses marriage, he then must purchase 12 pairs of gloves for the woman, suggesting that the gloves are to hide the woman's embarrassment of not having an engagement ring. In Ireland, the tradition is supposed to originate from a deal that Saint Bridget struck with Saint Patrick . [16] [17]  In the town of Aurora, Illinois , single women are deputized and may arrest single men, subject to a four-dollar fine, every February 29.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  February 29th  February (month)  Age of Consent  Leap Years  Birthdays  Age  Law  Survey Question If you're born on February 29th, when do you legally turn one year older? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 3 Answers Quora User Updated Feb 6, 2018 · Author has 1k answers and 634.3k answer views Such a widespread question affecting such a wide range of people, there are probably statutes and regulations under statutes that speak to when February 29 is deemed to have occurred during years which have no February 29 (i.e., non-leap years). Putting aside legality to think precisely and logically, it doesn’t make sense for an individual whose birthday is February 29 to begin celebrating it until the possibility of there being a February 29 during any one given year is absolutely brought to an end through the application of law and the perception of fact. Legislation certainly can be referred to in order to determine which years have a February 29 and which don’t, on an ongoing basis, and it’s pretty unreasonable to expect that a legislature is likely to ever enact, or a court would ever rule, February 29 to be a part of any (legislated) non-leap year. This is not to say it’s absolutely impossible, but it would certainly be a political question that would require extraordinary legislative or judicial action in order to implement extraordinarily—as to non-leap years. And, of course, with a justification that totally escapes reason, at least to me. That said, deemed recognition at law of the occurrence of February 29 during non-leap years, and legislative direction as to when individuals born February 29 may celebrate their birthdays, are two different matters. Therefore, how’s this? “ §1.  Deemed lawful occurrence, during leap years, of birthdays of individuals born February 29 (a) During non-leap years, the birthdays of individuals born on February 29, shall not be deemed to have occurred until the last second of the last minute of the last hour of February 28 has elapsed, according to statutory, regulatory and judicial recognition as to the lapse of time as set forth elsewhere within the law of this jurisdiction. (b) (i) for the purposes set forth in subsection (a) of this section; and, (ii) for the purpose of designating a day during years which do not include the date and day described as February 29 (“année bissextile”), on which individuals whose birthdays occurred and the anniversaries of which would, during leap years, occur, on February 29, may be celebrated, that day may be deemed to be March 1 of that particular year.” 3.7k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below If you are born on February 29 of a leap year, when is your birthday?

Ask New Question   Keith Winstein Answered May 4, 2011 · Upvoted by Quora User , lurker · Author has 373 answers and 1.1m answer views In a leap year, at the start of February 29. Otherwise, probably at the start of March 1. See, e.g., DelVecchio v. Illinois Dept. of Corrections, 8 F.3d 509, 512 (7th Cir. 1993), where a man's sentence for murder hinged on this point: Under Illinois law in 1965, any male who had yet to reach his seventeenth birthday but who was convicted and sentenced as an adult was sent to the Illinois Youth Commission ("IYC") with no minimum mandatory term. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23 §§ 2523-2525 (1963). The IYC then had total discretion: it could release the boy at any time before he turned twenty-one years old, it could release him when he turned twenty-one, or it could send him to an adult penitentiary at age twenty-one at which point the offender would receive a new sentence. Id. By contrast, any male sentenced after he turned seventeen received a normal adult term of years and served his time in a penitentiary. DelVecchio's case landed in the state's attorney's office in early February 1965; DelVecchio was set to turn seventeen on March 1, 1965 (DelVecchio was born February 29, 1948, a leap year). Prosecutors, then, had they delayed sentencing for a few weeks, could have guaranteed that DelVecchio would serve time (and almost certainly more of it) in an adult institution. Here is the choice prosecutors faced: if DelVecchio were sentenced on February 28, 1965, he would go to a youth home and be eligible to be freed the next day; if he were sentenced on March 1, 1965, he would go to an adult penitentiary and receive a minimum mandatory sentence of fourteen years and possibly a sentence as high as fifty years. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1963, ch. 38, par. 9-1. Id. (footnote omitted). 34.2k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date?   Abd Ul-Rahman Lomax , studied at California Institute of Technology Answered Nov 6, 2014 · Author has 1.9k answers and 3.5m answer views Great answer from Keith Winstein. Astronomically, a year is currently 365.25 days, minus a little. So every four years, there is a leap day, and every 100 years, not, and every 400 years, one. 2000 was a leap year, unlike 1900 or 2100, in the Gregorian calendar. However, legally, age is measured in calendar years. We don't look at the time of day of birth. If a child was born before midnight at the end of a day, they are a year old at the beginning of that date. But not the day before. They are that old for the entire year after that, until their next birthday. Legally, if someone is born on February 29, the leap day, they are not yet a year old on the next February 28. They will turn one as soon as the next day starts. I would interpret their "birthday" as being March 1 except in leap years. This is totally routine, I expect. When we go to get a drivers' license, they will look at the year and date. If  the date is not yet the birthday, we are one year less  than the difference in years. Any day after that, we are then the difference in years, old. February 28 is before February 29. February 28 is the last day that one's legal age is a year younger than the difference. So the next day is legally the "birthday."  It makes complete sense. 10.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date?

Click Here for K-3 Themes     The Earth orbits the sun every 365.2422 days (0.2422 days is equal to 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds, roughly 1/4 of a day). Every 365 1/4 days (not exactly 365 days), the Earth returns to the same exact spot in its orbit. That is why we have a leap year roughly every 4 years, to synchronize the seasons with our calendar; if we had a 365-day calendar every year, the seasons would drift around the calendar.   What is a Leap Year?  A leap year is a year that has one extra day in it.  A leap year occurs roughly every four years.   Most years have 365 days, but a leap year has 366 days.  The extra day is added onto the end of the shortest month, February; in a leap year, February has 29 days (instead of its usual 28 days). February 29 is called leap day.  Why Do We Have Leap Years?  A year is defined as the time it takes for the Earth to orbit around the sun once.  It takes the Earth about 365 1/4 days to make one entire orbit around the sun (a day is one rotation around the Earth's axis).  By adding one extra day about every four years, the Earth is in the same point of its orbit at the same time of the calendar year each year. Before a leap-year calendar was used, the seasons drifted around the calendar (the drift is about 1/4 day or 6 hours each year).  For example, over three hundred years, July would go from summer to spring.  Our current calendar is called the Gregorian calendar; this calendar was devised by Aloysius Lilius (an Italian physician) and named for Pope Gregory who decreed in 1582 that it be used in Catholic areas.  This calendar wasn't adopted in Britain and the American Colonies until 1752.  What Years are Leap Years?  Usually, there is a leap year every four years -- but once in a long while, a leap year has to be skipped (this is because the Earth's orbit is 365.242 days, a bit less than 365 1/4). To determine if the year is a leap year:  Non-century years (a century year is a year ending in 00) are leap years if they are divisible by four. For example,  2004, 2008 and 2012 are leap years; 2009, 2010 and 2011 are not. Century years are leap years if they are divisible by 400.  For example, 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years; 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, and 2300 are not.

Leap Day Birthdays  People born on leap day (February 29) can celebrate their birthday on March 1 (or February 28) on non-leap years.  A person born on a leap day is sometimes called a leapling. What percentage of the population is born on leap day? Assuming an equal distribution of birthdays throughout the year, the fraction of people born on leap day is the fraction of people born on one day out of four years, or 1/[(365 x 4 ) + 1] = 1/1,461 = 0.068% (less than one-tenth of a percent of the population).  Calendar Rhyme (Two versions)    Thirty days hath September, April, June, and November, All the rest have thirty-one, Excepting February alone, And it has twenty-eight days time, But in leap years, February has twenty-nine. Thirty days hath September, April, June, and November, All the rest have thirty-one, Excepting February alone, And that has twenty-eight days clear, And twenty-nine in each leap-year.

It's About As Rare As You'd Think By Claire Warner Feb 28 2016 As your Facebook feed has no doubt made you aware, Feb. 29 is just around the corner, and there's one thing on everyone's minds: What are the odds of being born on a leap year? Most people find leaplings, as they're called by local-interest pieces and adoring grandmothers, inexplicably fascinating out of a perception that leap year birthdays are incredibly rare. But popular opinion is rarely 100 percent correct (see: every myth about the menstrual cycle ever). Are your chances of being born on a leap year actually that low? For once, the general public has the right idea, because the odds of a leap year birthday are usually estimated to be one in 1,461 . The statistics behind the number are surprisingly simple: Four years is equal to 1,460 days, and the leap year rounds it up to 1,461. Assuming the odds of being born are the same for every day, your chances of being a leapling turn out to be one in 1,461. That being said, it's not that rare; for example, your odds of being struck by lightning during your lifetime are one in 3,000 , and your chances of becoming POTUS are one in 10,000,000. By comparison, being born on a leap year seems like no biggie. However, as the BBC points out, this may oversimplify things; it's well-known that human births vary based on season and location . A 2014 study found that peak birth months occur earlier in the year the further you get from the equator, and the Centers for Disease Control suggest that August is the most popular birth month in America. So in reality, your chances are probably a little less than the statistic cited above, but there's little specific research on the subject. Leap years are used as a way to reconcile the Earth's imperfect orbit with the Gregorian calendar used in most Western countries. Our calendar has 365 days, but the planet actually takes 365.24 days to go around the Sun. The disparity may not seem like much, but the extra time can (and did) build up over the course of centuries unless you account for it. When Julius Caesar came into power, the calendar was something of a mess, as the priesthood hadn't done a great job of keeping up with the convoluted system of the time. Caesar ordered the astronomer Sosigenes to create a new calendar, and he came up with 365-day system that tacked on an extra day every four years. This was later fine-tuned by Pope Gregorious XIII , and voila! You have the Gregorian calendar we still use today. If you were born on a leap year and find yourself so over all the "technically you're still a kid, har har!" jokes, you know who to blame. Thanks, Pope Gregorious XIII.

So, in 2 millennia, there are $485(366) + (2000-485)(365)= 730485$ total days.  Of those days, February 29 occurs in 485 of them (the leap years), so the probability is $485/730485=0.0006639424$"     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Feb 29 '16 at 18:11             answered Feb 29 '16 at 7:35       StatsStudent   4,112 3 18 35              9      Why it cant be calculated  as 1/(Number of days in 4 years) = 1/1461 = 0.00068 ? – Siddhesh  Feb 29 '16 at 8:42         20      @Siddhesh There is a rule regarding the centuries.

An average year length is actually, on average, 365.2425 days not 365.25.  As written on the wikipedia leap year page, "The Gregorian calendar . . . removes three leap days every 400 years, which is the length of its leap cycle. This is done by removing February 29 in the three century years (multiples of 100) that cannot be exactly divided by 400.[3] The years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are common years." – StatsStudent  Feb 29 '16 at 9:09         10      I don't see why you need to consider 2000 years; leap years are on a 400 year cycle, so why not just reduce to "there are 97 leap years in 400 years"? – Philip Kendall  Feb 29 '16 at 12:27        7      Why should we consider such minor influences as "cancelled" leap days in century years not multiples of 400 but on the other hand not factor in external influences, such as almost all births being delayed past or introduced before the 29th of February, just to save the child from the inconvenience (or other reasons)? - At least here in Germany the probability for a birth to occur on any 29th of February is (estimated) nearly zero. – Alexander Kosubek  Feb 29 '16 at 13:02        |  show 15 more comments             up vote  23  down vote      To accurately predict that probability using statistics, it would be helpful to know where the birth took place.  This page http://chmullig.com/2012/06/births-by-day-of-year/ has a graph showing a subset of the number of births per day (multiplying the 29th by 4, which is incorrect, and undesirable for this question, but it also links to the original data and gives a rough indication of what you can expect) in the United States. I would assume that this curve doesn't hold true for other countries, and especially not for other continents. In particular the southern hemisphere and equatorial region may show a substantial derivation from these results - assuming that climate is a determining factor.  Furthermore, there's the issue of "elective birth" (touched upon by the authors of http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/8/e002920.full ) - in poorer regions of the globe, I would expect a different distribution of births, simply because (non-emergency-) cesarian sections or induced birth are rarer than in developed countries. This skews the final distribution of births.  Using the American data, assuming ~71 Million births (rough graphed mean * 366) and 46.000 births on February 29ths, not correcting for the distribution of leap years in the data, because the precise period is not indicated, I arrive at a probability of around ~0.000648. This is slightly below the value one would expect given a flat distribution of births, and thus in line with the general impression give by the graph.  I'll leave a significance test of this rough estimation to a motivated reader. But given that the 29th (though uncorrected - the year 2000 injects a below average bias into the data) scores low even for the already low February standards, I assume a relatively high confidence that the null-hypthosesis of equal distribution can be rejected.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 7:26             answered Feb 29 '16 at 13:17       Rick Moritz   331 1 4                  The data set has Feb 30 and 31 dates of birth.

Any theoretical answer would be flawed without accounting birthday selection phenomena, seasonality etc. These things are impossible to deal with theoretically.  The birthday data is hard to find in US for privacy reasons. There's one anonymous data set here . It's from insurance applications in USA. The difference from other reports, such as a popular often cited NYT article , is that it lists the frequency of births by date, instead of simple ranking of days in a year. The weak point is of course the sampling bias, since it comes from insurance: uninsured people are not included etc.  According to the data there were 325 births in Feb 29 of total 481040. According to the Roy Murphy , the sample spans from 1981 through 1994. It includes 3 leap years of total 14 years. Without any adjustments the probability would be 0.0675% of being born on Feb 29 between 1981 and 1994.  You can adjust the probability by accounting for the frequency of leap years, which is close to 1/4 ( not exactly though ), e.g. by multiplying this number by $14/12$ to arrive to 0.079% estimate. Here, the conditional probability $p$ of being born on Feb 29 in a leap year is linked to the observed frequency $F_o=325$ by the frequency $f_L=3$ of leap years in a sample:
$$F_o=f_L/N\cdot F\cdot p,$$
where $N=14$ is the number of years in a sample, and $F=481040$ is the total frequency of births.  Normally, the probability of leap years is $p_L\approx 1/4$, hence, the long run average probability $P_L$ of being born on Feb 29 is:
$$P_L=p_L\cdot p\approx \frac{p_L\cdot N}{f_L} \frac{F_o}{F} \approx 0.079\%$$  You might be interested in the conditional probability $p$ of being born on Feb 29 given that you were born on leap year:
$$p= \frac{N}{f_L} \frac{F_o}{F}\approx 0.32\%$$  So, the link between $P_L$ and $p$ is based on some couple of assumptions, e.g. that the probability of being born in any given year is uniform, and doesn't change.  Of course, this discussion was US centric. Who knows what are the patterns in other countries.  UPDATE: We automatically assumed that OP is Gregorian calendar. It gets even more interesting if you consider different calendars such as lunar calendar Hijri , where the leap years are every 30 years or so.  UPDATE 2:  What's surprising is that estimated probability $p$ leads to the expected occurrence of birthdays in Feb 29 for this sample: $F\cdot p=1,527$. This is only lower than Jan 1 and Dec 25, which is consistent with NYT's ranking above! They don't describe the source of data, referring to only Amitabh Chandra, Harvard University , but it's either the same or the finding is robust.  Now, how likely it is that very peculiar days in Gregorian calendar: Jan 1, Dec 25 and Deb 29 would come randomly as the most popular birthdays? I say it's highly unlikely a random occurrence. Hence, it's even more interesting to see what's going on in other calendars such as Hijri.  UPDATE 3:  Note that both $P_L,p$ are higher than naive theoretical estimates:  $$\hat p\approx 1/366\approx 0.27%$$
$$\hat P_L\approx p\cdot\frac{366}{365*4+1}\approx 0.068%$$  UPDATE 4:  Ben Millwood made comment that the distribution of births by day of year is non-uniform. Can we test this statement? Using my data set we can run $\chi^2$ test on the theoretical distribution with a null hypothesis that the distribution is uniform. The result is the rejection, i.e. the distribution doesn't seem to be uniform.  The theoretical distribution is built like this. We assume that the birth frequency is uniform across all calendar days, i.e. in 14 years span across $14*365+3$ days. Then we roll up the days into days of year, which is 366. Obviously only 3 leap days were encountered and 14 non-leap days. Below is my MATLAB code and the distribution plot for comparison of theoretical and empiricals.  d=[0101 1482

It makes me wonder about what connection there is, if any, between the frequencies you analyze and the (vaguely defined) probability asked for in the question. – whuber ♦  Feb 29 '16 at 15:55        1      @whuber, the probabilities in my answer are for cases like analysis of insurance applications or some user data. For instance, you have a web site and want to flag problematic user data. You could compare the frequency of Feb 29 birthdays with my probabilities. However, if you are planning a family and asking this question, then my numbers are useless, pretty much. The reason is that they don't account for factors such as when exactly the couple is actually copulating or fertility and period patterns of couples, for instance, which is the main determinant of the birth day date. – Aksakal  Feb 29 '16 at 16:53            Glad to see you did not start with the math before considering other factors, beyond pure stats – TheBlastOne  Mar 1 '16 at 7:02        add a comment |             up vote  8  down vote      The cover to my favorite book ever provides some highly relevant evidence against the assumption of a uniform allocation of births to dates. Specifically that births in the US since 1970 exhibit several trends superimposed on eachother: a long, multi-decade trend, a non-periodic trend, day-of-week trends, day-of-year trends, holiday trends (because procedures like Cesarean section allow one to effectively schedule the birthdate, and doctors often don't do those on holidays). The result is that the probability of being born on a randomly-chosen day in a year is not uniform, and because birth rate varies between years, not all years are equally likely, either. So the answer that just checks how many leap years there are in some interval and reckons from the calendar is making very strong assumptions which have little utility in describing the real world in any reasonable way!  This also provides evidence that Asksal's solution, while a very strong contender, is also incomplete. A small number of leap days will be "contaminated" by all off the effects at play here, so Asksal's estimate is also capturing (quite by accident) the effect of day-of-week and long-term trends along with the Feb. 29 effect. Which effects are and are not appropriate to include are not clearly defined by your question.  And this analysis only has bearing on the US, which has demographic trends which might be quite different from other nations or populations. Japan's birth rate has been declining for decades, for example. China's birth rate is regulated by the state, with some consequences for its nation's gender composition and hence birth rates in subsequent generations.  Likewise, Gelman's analysis only describes several recent decades, and it's not necessarily clear that this is even the era of interest to your question.   For those who get excited about this kind of thing, the material in the cover is discussed at length in the chapter on Gaussian processes.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 20:37       whuber ♦   188k 28 399 739        answered Mar 1 '16 at 13:50       Sycorax   25.5k 5 70 110              2      A brief description of the model used in also available in the blog post here: andrewgelman.com/2012/06/19/… – Sakari Cajanus  Mar 2 '16 at 14:15        add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      February 29th is a date that occurs each year that is a multiple of 4 .  However years that are a multiple of 100 but aren't one of 400, are not considered as leap years (E.g: 1900 is not a leap year while 2000 or 1600 are). Therefore, nowadays, it is the same pattern every 400 years.  So let's do the maths on a [0;400[ interval:  On a 400 years period, there is exactly 4 x 25 = 100 years that are a multiple of 4 . But we have to subtract 3 (years multiple of 100 but not of 400) from 100, and we get 100 - 3 = 97 Now we have to multiply 97 by 366 , 97 x 366 = 35502 (365 x (400-97)) = 110 595 Then we just have to add these two numbers in order to know the total number of days in a 400 years period: 110 595 + 35502 = 146 097 To finish, our probability is the number of February 29th in a 400 years period so 97 given that there is 97 leap years divided by the total number of days of our interval: p = 97 / 146097 ≈ 0,0006639424492 Hope this is right and clear.   share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 29 '16 at 15:23       Jonathan Poid   31 1            7      This is a nice analysis of the chance that a randomly chosen date would be February 29th.  I believe most of the discussion in this thread focuses on the fact that this doesn't actually answer questions about chances of births, which do not really behave like random draws from the set of possible days. – whuber ♦  Feb 29 '16 at 15:28        1      A much easier way is to say that there are 97 leap years per 400 years the way you have already worked out. Calculate the number of days in 400 normal years. 400 * 365 = 146000. Then you need to add the 97 leap days giving 146097. – CJ Dennis  Mar 1 '16 at 7:06        add a comment |         up vote  2  down vote      I believe there are two questions being mixed up here. The one is "What is the probability of any given day being a Feb. 29th?". The second one is (and the one actually asked) "What is the probability of being born on a leap day?"  The approach of simply counting days seems to be misleading as Aksakal is pointing it. Counting days and calculating frequencies of Feb. 29th occuring addresses the question: "What is the probability that any given day is a Feb. 29th?" (Imagine waking up after a coma, no clue what day it is. The probability of it being a Feb. 29th is as pointed out above $p = \frac{97}{146097}\approx 0,00066394$).  Following Aksakal's answer, the probability can just be based on empirical studies of the distribution of births across the days of the year. Different data sets will come to different conclusions (e.g. due to effects of seasonality, long-term trends in birth rates, cultural differences). Aksakal pointed out a study (One comment: to account for the unrepresentative occurence of a leap year in the mentioned data (i.e. $\frac{3}{14}$) compared to the long-term frequency of leap year occurences (i.e. $\frac{97}{400}$) you would have to multiply the frequency of birth on Feb. 29th from the sample by $\frac{97}{400}\cdot\frac{14}{3} = \frac{679}{600} \approx 1.131667$).  Finally, there is a third possible interpretation of the question, which I believe was not intended though: "What is the probability of a specific person being born on a leap day?" Well, for anyone already born that is easy. It is either $0$ or $1$. For anyone not born but already conceived it also can be estimated using empirical studies on the length of pregnancy (see Wikipedia for an overview ). For anyone not conceived yet, see above.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 1 '16 at 8:20       mpiktas   27.7k 4 62 121        answered Feb 29 '16 at 16:32       data_enthusiast   34 4              2      Errr, I was ready to vote this up, and then I got to Well, for anyone already born that is easy.

I looked at it and know the outcome (e.g. heads). You are standing next to me, but have not seen the outcome. What is the probability of the coin showing heads (for you, for me, "objectively")? In the example above: for the given (born) person the probability is either 0 or 1 (assuming he knows on which date he is born). If you pick a person at random and you had to guess his birthday, the probability it being a Feb. 29 is than again an empirical question. – data_enthusiast  Mar 3 '16 at 8:53         add a comment |           up vote  1  down vote      I've noticed that most of the answers above work this out by calculating the number of leap days in a particular period. There is a simpler way to get the answer, 100% accurately, by definition:  We use leap years to adjust the regular (365 day) calendar to the mean tropical year (aka mean solar year). The mean tropical year "is the time that the Sun takes to return to the same position in the cycle of seasons, as seen from Earth" (Wikipedia). The tropical year varies slightly, but the mean (average) tropical year is ABOUT 365.24667.  If out leap days are correct, then the chance of a randomly selected day being a leap day, is ((tropical year) - (non-leap-year)) / tropical year  Pluging in the approximate number we have, it's (365.24667-365)/365.24667, or 0.24667/365.24667, or 675 per million (0.0675%).  This, however, is for a randomly selected day. I imagine that this is substantially skewed by parents who would rather not have to explain to their kids, "your actual birthday only comes once per 4 years".     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 1 '16 at 21:51       AMADANON Inc.   111 2              2      I don't think this answers the question being asked, because the leap day, Feb. 29, only exists in particular calendar systems. Those calendar systems have only been in use in particular societies during the recent historical eras. For example, this question is not intelligible to someone who reckons time using the Hebrew calendar, which has no "February" at all! Moreover, even if we assume a calendar with a leap day, it still doesn't resolve the indeterminacy surrounding the probability distribution of births to days. – Sycorax  Mar 1 '16 at 22:25            @user777, thats irrelevant. If you belong to a culture that doesn't recognize leap day, there would still be individuals that are born on our leap day. – Octopus  Mar 2 '16 at 17:59            @Octopus Not if they were born before October, 1582, the month that the Gregorian calendar was introduced.

The point is the Gregorian calendar exists today and it can be used to place every single day in history, whether or not they observed it at that time. – Octopus  Mar 2 '16 at 18:27            @Octopus How do you know that's the point? – Sycorax  Mar 2 '16 at 18:43         add a comment |           up vote  -4  down vote      I asked my sister, whose bithday is February 29, and she said, "The result of my own empirical study was that it is 1.00, obviously."     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 2 '16 at 20:57       Michael Kupietz   99                  Well, it seems that wasn't appreciated.

Here are 10 things to consider - for one day only. Until 2016, that is. 1. The leap year's extra day is necessary because of the "messiness" of our Solar System. One Earth year (a complete orbit around the Sun) does not take an exact number of whole days (one complete spin of the Earth on its axis). In fact, it takes 365.2422 days, give or take. 2. Until Julius Caesar came to power, people observed a 355-day calendar - with an extra 22-day month every two years. But it was a convoluted solution to the problem and feast days began sliding into different seasons. So Caesar ordered his astronomer, Sosigenes, to simplify things. Sosigenes opted for the 365-day year with an extra day every four years to scoop up the extra hours. This is how the 29 February was born. It was then fine-tuned by Pope Gregory XIII (see below). 3. Every fourth year is a leap year, as a rule of thumb. But that's not the end of the story. A year that is divisible by 100, but not by 400, is not. So 2000 was a leap year under the Gregorian calendar, as was 1600. But 1700, 1800 and 1900 are not leap years. "It seems a bit arbitrary," says Ian Stewart, emeritus professor of mathematics at Warwick University. But there's a good reason behind it.     "The year is 365 days and a quarter long - but not exactly. If it was exactly, then you could say it was every four years. But it is very slightly less." The answer arrived at by Pope Gregory XIII and his astronomers when they introduced the Gregorian calendar in 1582, was to lose three leap days every 400 years. The maths has hung together ever since. It will need to be rethought in about 10,000 years' time, Stewart warns. But by then mankind might have come up with a new system.  PM's Leap Day  By Eddie Mair Presenter, PM  All this month on PM, listeners have been asked whether they'd be prepared to take advantage of this extra day to do something different.  It transpires there are a lot of people who're ready to use today to take a leap .  There's the apparently mundane... "I resolve to speak Mandarin all day long"… "my partner and I are going to visit some elderly people"... "often meant to take a roof tour of Lincoln Cathedral but never got round to it".  After six years one woman will finally decide the wording for her husband's headstone. Some people are at last scattering the ashes of loved ones having put it off for years.  There's a woman taking up the hula-hoop after more than 50 years.       One woman intends to have some chocolate today - her anorexia has been a problem for years. A man who suffers panic attacks will try to make a bus journey. And a woman in her 60s will get a tattoo.  PM is on BBC Radio Four, Monday to Saturday at 17:00 GMT  PM blog  4. Why is February 29, not February 31, a leap year day? All the other months have 30 or 31 days, but February suffered from the ego of Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus, says Stewart. Under Julius Caesar, February had 30 days, but when Caesar Augustus was emperor he was peeved that his month - August - had only 29 days, whereas the month named after his predecessor Julius - July - had 31. "He pinched a couple of days for August to make it the same as July. And it was poor old February that lost out," says Prof Stewart. 5. The tradition of a woman proposing on a leap year has been attributed to various historical figures. One, although much disputed, was St Bridget in the 5th Century. She is said to have complained to St Patrick that women had to wait too long for their suitors to propose. St Patrick then supposedly gave women a single day in a leap year to pop the question - the last day of the shortest month. Another popular story is that Queen Margaret of Scotland brought in a law setting fines for men who turned down marriage proposals put by women on a leap year. Sceptics have pointed out that Margaret was five years old at the time and living far away in Norway. The tradition is not thought to have become commonplace until the 19th Century. It is believed that the tradition of women proposing on this day goes back to the times when the leap year day was not recognised by English law. Under this theory, if the day had no legal status, it was acceptable to break with the convention of a man proposing. 6. A prayer has been written by a female cleric for people planning a leap year day marriage proposal. The prayer, for 29 February, asks for blessings on the engaged couple. It reminds them that wedding plans should not overtake preparations for a lifetime together. The prayer has been taken from Pocket Prayers of Blessing by the Venerable Jan McFarlane, Archdeacon of Norwich: "God of love, please bless N and N as they prepare for the commitment of marriage. May the plans for the wedding not overtake the more important preparation for their lifetime together. Please bless their family and friends as they prepare for this special day and may your blessing be upon them now and always. Amen." 7. The practice of women proposing in a leap year is different around the world. In Denmark, it is not supposed to be 29 but 24 February, which hails back to the time of Julius Caesar. A refusal to marry by Danish men means they must give the woman 12 pairs of gloves. In Finland, it is not gloves but fabric for a skirt and in Greece, marriage in a leap year is considered unlucky, leading many couples to avoid it. 8. The chance of being born on a leap day is often said to be one in 1,461. Four years is 1,460 days and adding one for the leap year you have 1,461. So, odds of 1/1,461. But Stewart points out that is very slightly out, owing to the loss of the three leap years every 400 years. In any case, babies are more likely to be born at certain times of the year rather than others, due to a range of other factors, he says. Babies born on 29 February are known as "leapers" or "leaplings". 9. Other calendars apart from the Gregorian require leap years. The modern Iranian calendar is a solar calendar with eight leap days inserted into a 33-year cycle. The Indian National Calendar and the Revised Bangla Calendar of Bangladesh arrange their leap years so that the leap day is always close to 29 February in the Gregorian calendar. 10. Explorer Christopher Columbus used the lunar eclipse of 29 February 1504 to his advantage during his final trip to the West Indies. After several months of being stranded with his crew on the island of Jamaica, relations with the indigenous population broke down and they refused to continue helping with food and provisions. Columbus, knowing a lunar eclipse was due, consulted his almanac and then gathered the native chiefs on 29 February. He told that God was to punish them by painting the Moon red. During the eclipse, he said that God would withdraw the punishment if they starting co-operating again. The panicked chiefs agreed and the Moon began emerging from its shadow. Also of a supernatural nature, on 29 February 1692 the first warrants were issued in the Salem witchcraft trials in Massachusetts.

Pixabay, Public Domain    Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail Once every four years, mothers with scheduled C-sections or induced births will either avoid or embrace their baby having a Feb. 29 birthday, the day of the leap year. For people born on this day, who are often called “leapers” or “leaplings,” the birthday appears like a rabbit out of a hat, then disappears for four more years. Although the calendar spares leapers from the psychological turmoil of getting older each year, it also marginalizes their quadrennial birthdays. One In 1,461 There is no reliable data on exactly how many babies are born on leap day , so experts often assume the odds are just the same as any other day. Because there are 1,460 days in four years plus one day for the leap year, the odds are one in 1,461 . That said, there are an estimated 200,000 leapers in the United States and about five million worldwide. One of the benefits to being born on a leap day is that you get to choose when your birthday is. Some leapers will choose Feb. 28 while others choose March 1 — die hard leapers might choose to celebrate only on the 29th . Perhaps the easiest way to choose is, if a person is born closer to 12 a.m. on Feb. 29, they should celebrate on Feb 28. If they’re born closer to 11:59 p.m. on Feb 29, they should go with March 1. Anyone who is born closer to midday has the option to choose for themselves. Holly Parker , who lectures about the psychology of close relationships at Harvard, believes choosing your birthday is a unique and quirky aspect of being born on the 29th. "There's no other birthday that offers as much freedom," she told Medical Daily . "If a person chooses to celebrate their birthday on March 1, they can literally celebrate their birthday in two different months [March for three years, February for one year]. No one else gets to do that." Theresa Nicolls is 59 years old but will be turning 15 if you only count her leap year birthdays. For over 20 years, she’s been celebrating her birthday on March 1, by accident. “I didn't know I was a leap year baby growing up because when I was born, my attending doctor asked my mom if she would like them to change the time I was born so my birthday would be recorded as March 1. For whatever reason, my mother never told me this until I was in my 20s.” she told Medical Daily . However, “had the doctor and my mom put my real date as February 29th, I would have celebrated on the 29th and on March 1st on non-leap years,” she said. A Mother’s Choice Some mothers-to-be do everything they can to avoid their baby being born on a leap day. After all, there’s a lot to consider — should the baby’s birthdate be changed to Feb. 28 or March 1, and how will a baby cope with being born on Feb. 29? Will having a birthday every four years affect them in any way? The Honor Society of Leap Year Day Babies , founded by 56-year-old Raenell Dawn (soon-to-be 14 in leap years), is a free membership birthday club for people born on Feb. 29. With 10,000 current members, the club helps raise “leap consciousness” by providing an online community for leapers and leaper parents to share their experiences and offer advice on common concerns. "There are those few moms who hate it," Dawn told the  Huffington Post . "They do not want a leap day baby, so we try to help them understand that there's no need to feel this way about the date." Also, speaking to the Huffington Post , Dr. Laura Riley, an OB-GYN at Massachusetts General Hospital, said there were no scheduled deliveries for the last leap day we had, which landed on a Wednesday. For a maternity ward that averages eight deliveries per day, she said the leap day saw no scheduled inductions and no elective repeat C-sections scheduled. Meanwhile Tuesday was completely booked, and on Thursday, only one slot remained. Riley recounted the story of an expecting mother who was overdue, yet refused to induce birth on Feb. 29. This patient preferred to give birth on a different day, even if it meant she’d be cared for by a less familiar doctor. “To her, it was far more important to not have that date.” Riley said. There was no problem with this because the woman had a normal pregnancy. It’s “only in emergency cases of fetal distress or antepartum hemorrhage that doctors insist on an immediate delivery,” Dr. Megha Tuli , an OB-GYN specialist in Uttar Pradesh, India, told Medical Daily . Leaper Struggles A mother’s refusal to have her baby born on a leap day is strongly tied to the fact that her child’s birthdate won’t appear on the calendar every single year. Dawn agrees this is a common issue, especially with regard to inputting birthdays on websites and official government documents. John Reitz, a law professor at the University of Iowa who specializes in administrative law, speculates a leap year baby’s birthday would legally be marked as March 1 because they’d technically be a year old on the day after February 28. This would affect everything from when the baby can legally drive to when they can join the army or buy alcohol, and even when they can start collecting social security benefits. Still, leapers often experience issues related to their insurance and social security. Richard Little , a member of the Honor Society of Leap Year Day Babies, recounted to the organization a scenario in which he tried signing up for early social security at 62 years old. However, when the representative looked through a computer for his birthdate, she said “there’s no such thing.” “I could not be the only person born on that date,” Little replied. “We had to settle on Feb. 28 in order for me to sign up for S.S.” These issues begin to pop up at younger ages, too. Birthdays that carry social weight, like Bar Mitzvahs and Quinceaneras, which are coming-of-age celebrations for boys and girls, respectively, may not be considered as significant if they don’t fall on the actual birthdate. Milestones like 18 or 21 can be just as frustrating. Writing for the Honor Society, Veronica from Texas told the story of a bar’s bouncer, who tore up her ID when she presented it on her 21st birthday, and said it was because there is no 29th of February. (She was subsequently reimbursed for her torn up ID and given a free drink.) In school, leap year kids might not be acknowledged during certain activities. Char Larson, a member of the Honor Society, wrote: “In kindergarten, we were each given a calendar of the month of our birthday and asked to circle our birthdays. I was devastated because mine was not there. [The teacher should have realized this].” These small problems can snowball into full-on feelings of isolation and loneliness, which usually result from other kids' taunts or teasing. Tuli reassured, however, that teasing “does not lead to any long-term effects compared to more serious issues, such as bullying and abuse.” Combating this potential setback isn’t too hard. Parents can create meaning around a leap year birthday by encouraging fun family projects, like arts and crafts, which illustrate the zany reasons a leap year birthday is charming and special, Parker said. A leap year birthday doesn’t have to be a loss; if anything, it’s a great conversation starter that will always spark intrigue due to its exclusivity. While only a few people will be part of the leap year-birthday club, everyone can enjoy the leap year. As Dawn said, “it’s everyone’s extra day. Do something good with it.”  Comment  Share  Tweet  Share  E-mail                     Most Read                Vitality Under the Hood Innovation The Hill The Grapevine Weird Medicine Conditions   About Contact Advertising Privacy Policy Terms Of Service Subscribe  © 2018 Newsweek Media Group All rights reserved.

I talked with 8 of them to find out.   By  Michelle Hackman   Updated Mar  1, 2016,  8:20am EST        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  What’s it like to be a leap year baby? I talked with 8 of them to find out.      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email             What are the odds of being born on leap day? Slim. So slim that leap baby Adam Piekarski decided to get his 7-year-old daughter to do the math with him to prove to her how special he is.  "Everyone that I’ve met that’s been born on a leap year seems special," he said. "I personally think they think differently and they see differently."  Normally, the chance of being born on any given day is 1 in 365. But for leap babies, it's four times that, plus an extra day. That comes out to 1 in 1,461. So only 0.07 percent of the world’s population shares a birthday with Adam — assuming birthdays are uniformly distributed throughout the year.  Adam, who works on an oil pipeline in Ohio, technically has had more birthdays than his daughter. On February 29, he will mark his ninth real birthday. (In more conventional terms, he’s turning 36.)  Adam is one of the Vox followers who responded to my call on Twitter for leap year babies. Over the past week, I spoke with eight of them. I wanted to know about the rituals, inconveniences, and delights that come along with a birthday that vanishes three out of every four years. There are many.  When do leap year babies celebrate their birthdays?  This is an existential question for leap babies. The community is divided into "28thers" and "1sters," as one reader, Phil Haney, told me.  Haney, a writer for Break.com in Los Angeles, is a 1ster. "My mother always told me that I was born ‘the day after the 28th.’" He said. "I wasn't here on the 28th, so it makes more sense to celebrate on March 1."  Shannon Esposito, a fourth-grade teacher outside Chicago, is an avowed 28ther. "I have always, always celebrated on February 28. To me, it’s always been a February birthday," she said. "I am not a March baby!"  Some try to split the difference by celebrating the moment the clock strikes 12 between the two days. Lidia Urbina, a master’s student in Switzerland, says that’s the tactic her friends often say they’ll take – but most years, they just forget.  Others don’t see a reason why they have to pick sides. Alex Clifton, an enrollment counselor in Kentucky, says she cuts her losses by celebrating on both days. (Clifton is turning 6 – or 24 – but she strikes me as wise beyond her years.)  Still others let the date float around the calendar. I got the sense that since leap year babies’ birthdays don’t exist most years, it’s almost as though they feel unmoored from the specific date they actually celebrate.  "I used to try and keep it in February, but most often I celebrated on the weekend," Piekarski told me. "Now I’m grown up with kids, so I try to celebrate within the month."  Is there pressure to have a blowout celebration every four years when the real date rolls around?  Definitely. "It's like the Olympics, a presidential election, and my birthday every four years," Haney said. That puts a lot of pressure on him to go out and do something really big.  Ashley Eden, a staffer for Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Capitol Hill, told me her parents set an over-the-top expectation that was hard to meet. When she turned 4, her first real birthday, her parents rented a pony. She and her friends spent hours taking mini horseback rides through the backyard. For a later birthday, when she was 16, her parents sent a limo to pick her up from school.  "They wanted to make sure I saw it as a cool and special thing, rather than a bummer that I had a birthday every four years," she said.  Another reader, Susan Peck, wrote in with what I can only imagine is a more unique ritual. "I am about to celebrate my 14th actual birthday," she wrote in an email. "I'll be singing the song from Pirates of Penzance: ‘a paradox, a paradox, a most ingenious paradox! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, a paradox!’" ( The Pirates of Penzance is a comic opera written by Gilbert and Sullivan whose main character is also a leap year baby.) This raised many more questions, but Peck did not respond to any of my follow-up inquiries.  But Espasito noted that despite the impulse to "go big," leap day lands on a Monday this year, and she’ll probably end up celebrating the weekend before. She’s looking forward to leap day 2020, though, which lands on a Saturday.  Does everyone make the joke that you’re a quarter of your actual age?  Are you turning 32, or 8? That’s the question leap year babies can’t avoid on their actual birthdays. Eden says she gets a lot of coloring books and crayons on her "real" birthday. People routinely tell Urbina that she looks old for her age (24, or 6.) And Espasito says the joke causes her fourth-grade students endless amusement – "we’re older than our teacher, blah blah blah," she puts it.  "I sometimes feel bad for the people that make the joke because they're trying to be nice, and they really think they are being original," Urbina said. "But it's actually a bit annoying."  Mike Guardabascio, the high school sports editor for the Long Beach Press-Telegram in California, says the joke’s corniness doesn’t discriminate. "You could be talking to the guy down the street, or you could be talking to an astrophysicist," he said. "When you tell someone that you were born on February 29, the immediate  response is, ‘So are you, like, 6 years old?’" (For the record, Guardabascio is turning 8, or 32.)  What happens when leap year babies turn 21?  For all the hype around 21st birthdays, most of the people I interviewed didn’t have much of a problem with the precise date they chose. That meant, again in nearly every case, that these leap day babies all tried their luck on the 28th.  "Before my 21st birthday, I spent an exorbitant amount of time on Wikipedia to figure out when I could go out for a drink," Clifton told me.  Technically, bouncers should not let 21-year-old leap year babies into bars until March 1, but when Clifton tried her luck on the 28th, she didn’t meet resistance. Same goes with Espasito, who rushed to buy beer on the 28th.  Haney didn’t have a problem, either, until months after his 21st birthday. But one night, he went to a bar in his hometown, and the bouncer threatened to confiscate his license over the birth date listed.  Evidently, the bouncer hadn’t ever heard of leap year.  "He was positive it was a fake ID and was real proud of himself that he had caught me," he said. "He thought I was the idiot for having a fake ID that didn't even have a real birthdate on it."  Haney recounted trying frantically to explain the concept of leap year to the bouncer, while the bouncer started bending his ID in half. Thankfully, a waitress noticed the ruckus and rushed over to straighten things out.  Do forms or official documents ever pose a problem?  In the United States, a person’s birthday during common years, or non-leap years, is likely March 1.  Piekarski says, and others echo, that renewing his license is a reliable nuisance. Department of Motor Vehicle employees, who likely glaze over after typing so many dates, routinely print forms saying he must renew his license on 2/29/2017, a date that obviously doesn’t exist.  Espasito has even seen DMV workers try to print IDs with the wrong birthdate listed. "I always get flagged, I always have to produce my birth certificate," she said.  Web forms frequently cause problems, too. Often, drop-down boxes simply don’t have more than 28 days listed under February. In those cases, most people just fudge it and hope for the best.  But the stakes are higher on Facebook. Unlike many less sophisticated websites, Facebook does recognize February 29 as a valid birth date. But for years, the social network didn’t know how to adapt during non-leap years.  On February 28, it would alert users that their friend’s birthday was coming up the next day. But on March 1 ... nothing.  "That’s how I knew who my real friends were," Haney said.  Most leap year babies say Facebook has since fixed the glitch, and, per the government’s example, it defaults to March 1.  Do leap day babies share a particular bond?  For the most part, it seems as though leap day babies find it mildly amusing to compare notes with others in their exclusive club. Most of the leap year babies I spoke with said they knew one or two others, though several groups exist to unite people more broadly.  The pool of birthdays is so small, Clifton said, that she recognizes every name on a list of famous people who share her birthday. Ann Lee , the founder of the Shakers, is one. Ja Rule , an outmoded rapper, is another.  "I cannot identify a single Ja Rule song, but we share a birthday," she said.  The exercise can get tiresome. The birthday is so rare that whenever someone learns of a leap day baby’s birthday, they feel compelled to connect the dots with any other leap day babies they know.  "People go to a pretty far extent to tell me anyone they know who was also born on leap year," Eden said. "'Oh, my brother’s second-grade teacher was born on leap year!’"  What are the biggest perks of having a leap year birthday?  Each leap day, businesses do offer an array of specials for people born on the 29th. This year, specials include free food , free birthday parties, and even free travel.  During the last leap day, Guardabascio told me he found so many food specials – one at IHOP, another at Papa John’s pizza – that he and his wife ate three meals out, for free. Haney said an upscale cupcake shop in his neighborhood, Sprinkles, gave him a free box of cupcakes. ("Worth $40!" he emphasized.)  The deals for 29thers are so lucrative that ahead of this year, Guardabascio created a Google alert for "leap day birthday free."  But on non-leap years, leap year babies do run the risk of missing normal birthday perks, like a free cup of coffee at Starbucks. Most said that cashiers are generous about such things, allowing them to redeem birthday perks the days before or after. But Eden says she doesn’t even run the risk.  "When they ask for your birthday, I always put the 28th, because if you get a freebie, I don’t want to miss it," she said.  Are there more intangible benefits, too?  I posed this question to every leap year baby I interviewed – what they liked most about their birthday. While many did bring up freebies, there was also a larger sense that their birthday marks something special about them.  Some say it’s their go-to "fun fact" during icebreakers. Others say it simply helps people remember their birthday.  Guardabascio, who spoke to me while driving with his baby in the back seat, said he enjoys his birthday mostly because it serves as a potent reminder of just how much his life has changed.  "The time before this one, we didn’t have any kids. The time before that, we were in college," he said of his wife and him. "It’s an interesting way to mark the passage of time."

Answered Mar 6, 2016 · Author has 65 answers and 177.6k answer views Let F 29 be the event that a person is born on February 29th, and let L be the event that that a person is born on a Leap year. As a practical approximation, there are 485 leap years in 2 millennia = 2000 years, so, the probability of being born in a leap year, given a frequentist interpretation of probability, is(This is a bit of a simplication, since the probability is a little bit larger than this as we’ve assumed equal chance of years here see solution 2 which does not make this assumption). We can use Baye’s theorm to determine the solution. According to Baye’s theorem: (1) Rearranging terms in (1), we can easily solve for P ( F 29) using: (2)  We know, assuming a person is equally likely to be born in any given year. Further P ( L | F 29)= 1, since a person is born on a leap year with probability 1 if they were born on February 29th (by de nition of a leap year). If we assume that a person is equally likely to be born on any given day within a leap year, then. Using these calculations in (2) above, we have:   To be more precise you could follow this logic: there are 485 years in a 2 millennia. So, in 2 millennia, there are 485(366)+(2000 − 485)(365) = 730485 total days. Of those, days, February 29th occurs in 485 of them (the leap years), so the probability is: . This second solution is a closer approximation to the true probability of being born on February 29th, since it is not subject to as much rounding error as that in (4), but  both answers are approriate. 4.4k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Adding 1 of leap year makes it 1461. So the probability of being born on February 29 is 1/1461.  But this is not the exact value and changes with time. Because we always take some assumptions while calculating time. So accordingly it is required to lose 3 leap days every 400 years. The reason being that Earth takes 365.2422 days to orbit around sun. We make that 365 days for 3 years and add that extra day due to approximation of 0.2422 in the fourth year but still its not accurate. 0.2422*4 = 0.9688 but we take it as one day. So to make up for it. we need to lose 3 leaps days every 400 years ( still approximation )  So for the record your answer is 1/1461 but if we take it to the next level of accuracy it changes but you may go with 1/1461. :) 3.2k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Abhay Mittal promoted  by quip Better care for everyone on your gift list with a mouth.

I'm sure his answer is totally correct. You could also discuss the various technicalities of a coin flip. Sure, we might say that there's a 50% chance of heads, but maybe you flip your coins in a particular way, and the head side is slightly heavier than the other, and blah blah blah. It's totally correct to talk about these things, but sometimes it's more of a distraction than anything else. Simplifications are good! The simple answer is this: The chances that your kids would share the same birthday is 1/365 . Your first kid's birthday is July 23rd. So the only question there is: what is the odds of this other kid being born on July 23rd? 1/365. (Analogy: what are the odds of flipping a coin and getting the same thing twice? 1/2. This is just the odds of the second coin flip matching whatever the first one was.) The chances that both your kids are born on July 23rd specifically is 1/365*1/365. This is the first problem * the first problem. Both your kids now have to be born on July 23rd. (Analogy: what are the odds of getting heads twice? 1/2 for the first flip * 1/2 for the second flip. So 1/4.) This is the simple answer that you're looking for. 8.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

And the answer is fairly simple, although you'd have to make a few assumptions for the model in order to keep things simple. First, you assume that every child has a probability under uniform distribution of having a birthday on any given day of the year. Next, you assume that every child's probability is independent of other children's probabilities, i.e., having a child born on September 1st does not effect another child's probabilities. The question illustrates the importance of asking the right question, which is in fact: What is the probability that these two children do not share the same birthday? This is very simple. [math]\mathbb{P}(\mbox{different birthdays}) = \frac{365}{365} \cdot \frac{364}{365} \approx .9973 [/math] To find out what the probability of these two children having the the same birthday, we simply say it is 1-.9973 = .0027 2k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by IXL Practice that feels like play.

Undo   Chong You Quan , prefers a euclidean world Answered Nov 20, 2012 · Author has 69 answers and 193.6k answer views Qiaochu Yuan's answer has covered much ground on this question. I would just like to present the answer in another way and include some of the factors that affect pregnancy and childbirth. We will first cover the math , then some other factors involved in childbirth. We shall use symbols [math]x_1[/math] and [math]x_2[/math] to denote the birthdays of the first and second child respectively. We consider 3 scenarios below, and the probabilities will become very clear. I will assume that there is no prior knowledge of when the children would be born before they are born and that there are no leap years involved here. 1. Before the children are born We have no knowledge of when the birthdays of the children would be (i.e. [math]x_1[/math] and [math]x_2[/math] are undetermined). There are two variables [math]x_1[/math] and [math]x_2[/math] , and each of them can take 365 possible values, so the probability that [math]x_1[/math] equals [math]x_2[/math] is (1/365)*(1/365)*365 = 1/365 . (The multiplication by 365 is due to the fact that there are 365 pairs of numbers that can match i.e. [math]x_1[/math] = [math]x_2[/math] =1, [math]x_1[/math] = [math]x_2[/math] = 2, ... and so on). 2. After the first child is born We now have knowledge of the birthday of the first child (i.e. [math]x_1[/math] is known, but [math]x_2[/math] is unknown. Thus, we have only one variable [math]x_2[/math] left (that can take 365 values), so the probability is 1/365 that it matches [math]x_1[/math] exactly. 3. After the second child is born We now have knowledge of the birthdays of both children, and there are no undetermined variables. So, we know that their birthdays match, with probability 1 . Now we have done the math, and I'll cover some factors that affect childbirth and pregnancy below: 1. Sex . Enough said. 2. Menstrual cycle of the mother Frequent sex does not exactly imply greater chance of conceiving a child. On day 14 of the average 28 day menstrual cycle, the egg leaves the ovary, entering the uterus, and it is called ovulation [1]. After that, the egg would begin to break apart 3 days after it leaves the ovary. It is during this crucial 3 day period that sex can result in conception . However, it must be noted that the length of menstrual cycles and times of egg release can vary (depending on the environment, stress levels, diet etc). For two children to be conceived at about the same time requires that the menstrual cycle somehow happen to coincide within the respective months (say, Nov 08 and Nov 11) that each child was conceived. 3. Gestation period Now, after the child is conceived, the gestation period would be about 9 months (266 days [2]). Boys usually take longer to gestate than girls [2]. About 50% of births occur within the first week of the estimated 266 days [3] (the online tool at [3] can calculate estimated date of birth based on conception date). All the above 3 factors must some miraculously combine exactly to result in that coincidence of the same birthdays of children. These factors are independent of the above math solely based on probability theory. Exact probabilities might be possible to obtain if we have more information on the first two factors above, but I will not delve into that. As a final note, for all we know, such coincidences in birthdays might be just purely divine luck (God has a plan for all of us, right?).

If you ask about the probability of the event that "your two kids are born in the same day of the year", then it is 1/365. If you ask about the probability of the event that "your two kids are both born on July 23rd", then it is 1/365 * 1/365. (Assuming the birthdays of your kids are independent and are equally likely to be any day of the year.) Most likely you are referring to the first event. We are only talking about classical probability here. Bayesian probability might give different answer, but isn't it a bit overkill? 2.5k Views · View Upvoters   Kamron Saniee , works at Zuse Institut Berlin Answered Dec 4, 2012 None of these answers engage the interesting case of some dependence on the children's birth dates (assuming they are born of the same mother). Of course 'ex post probabilities' are 1, and the 1/365 answer assumes independence. Dependence may be inferred from the '3 years' qualifier - note that if the children are born < 1 year apart the said probability is zero. A priori we must specify a distribution on conception after the first birth f(date T)=Pr(conceiving 2nd child on date T) to get a non trivial answer (the trivial answer 1/365 ~ f uniform, independent of T) and this answer will depend on f. Don't believe uniform is the most realistic assumption here - thoughts? 1.3k Views   Alastair Dryburgh Answered Nov 28, 2012 If the question is "what is the probability that a random date chosen from 2007 will be the same as a date chosen at random from 2010?" then the answer is 1/365 (note that I've chosen two years which are not leap years). However, the dates of children's births may not be wholly random. I, for example was born in December so that my mother's maternity leave would finish just at the start of the school summer holidays (she was a teacher). Only you know how much you planned these two births, so only you can answer the question. 792 Views    Gary Simon , Retired Professor of Statistics Answered Nov 20, 2012 · Author has 220 answers and 1.1m answer views Do not answer this question.   The question was formulated after the event was observed.   Weird things happen all the time, and thus P(something weird) is quite large.   In mathematical terms, the probability space for this game has not been described.   And, by the way, we have four kids all born in the same week of March. 1.3k Views · View Upvoters Anonymous Answered May 17, 2015 Well, since you know and chose when you had unprotected sex off the pill, the answer might be very different than 1/365. I'm assuming that you and your wife have a fertility rate of close to 100% under whatever conditions you created, although I would have to revise it if it took you a few months to get pregnant. I'll assume you had sex towards the end of October (was it the sexy nurse costume?), then Wikipedia:Gestation says the normal range is 37–42 weeks. Maybe this is a Gaussian distributed 39±1 weeks or 39±2 weeks. But then I would do the likelihood of them falling on the same day on the basis of that distribution because you're already given a much smaller range than 1/365 (apparently more like a 5-week range than a 52-week range). You can say the mean for Jenny Schneidermann 's gestation would be 39×7 and then do the probability that difference in those two gaussians would be zero. Of course her expected gestation time might not be the same as (Wikipedia's estimate of) the population avearge. Sum of normally distributed random variables If you didn't get pregnant right away, then I would revise the answer based on what you know about how frequently you had sex when, as well as other factors you two think might contribute to a successful conception. If you were having sex once a day every day for the whole year, no contraception or prophylactics, then I might use the 1/365 model. 851 Views   Zimu Yang , works at Georgia-Pacific Answered Oct 17, 2012 · Upvoted by  Vladimir Novakovski It's 1/365 (assuming no leap year).

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Birthdays  Probability (statistics) Birthdays: What's the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 6 Answers   Bhushan Shah , Interested, but largely ignorant Answered Sep 17, 2012 · Author has 59 answers and 118.6k answer views Easy approximate answer: ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 1 / 365 ) However, this is more complicated than it looks due to existence of leap years. What if your own birthday occurs on 29th Feb? To account for leap years, let us proceed as follows. Let the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date be p1 if your birthday is not on 29th Feb, and p2 if your birthday is on 29th Feb. The probability we are looking for is then the weighted average of p1 and p2, with the weights being the probabilities of your birthday being on 29th Feb or not. Let us first calculate p1. Bear in mind that there are 97 leap years per 400 years. In these 97 years, the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date is 1/366, and for the other 303 years it is 1/365. Hence, the value of p1 is ( 1 / 366 ) * ( 97 / 400 ) + ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 303 / 400 ) Now we calculate p2 in a similar manner. The only difference is that in the 303 years without a leap year, the probability of meeting someone with the same birth date is 0. Hence, p2 becomes ( 1 / 366 ) * ( 97 / 400 ) + 0 * ( 303 / 400 ) Now to calculate the overall probability, we consider the probabilities of your birthday being on 29th Feb or not, which are used as weights for p2 and p1 respectively. The final expression then is, ( p1 * ( 303 / 400 ) * ( 1 / 365 ) ) + ( p2 * ( 97 / 400 ) * ( 1 / 366. ) ) This expression, which evaluates to 0.000623% (approx) is the accurate probability of meeting someone with the exact same birth date. As expected, this is slightly less than ( 1 / 365 ) * ( 1 / 365 ), which is 0.000751%. Of course, this is assuming that all men are immortal, and that meeting someone born in 1900, in 1342, and in 2154 is equiprobable. If you want to take into account mortality, and eliminate people from the future, then this probability will become a function of the current date and time, and you will have to take into account stuff like demographics, average life expectancy etc. Let's not tread there! Though I reckon it wouldn't make much difference to the numerical value of the probability. 1.5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

So the probability that someone doesn’t have the same birthday as you is [math]1-\frac{1}{365}=\frac{364}{365}[/math] . The probability that x people don’t have the same birthday as you is [math](\frac{364}{365})^x[/math] . Let’s define the parameter n as the number of people you meet. So the probability that out of the n number of people you meet, none of them have the same birthday as you is [math](\frac{364}{365})^n[/math] . So the probability that you meet at least 1 person who has the same birthday as you is [math]1-(\frac{364}{365})^n[/math] . As a function of the number of people you’ve met, here is the probability that you have met someone who has the same birthday as you: Interestingly enough, you have to meet 1092 people before the probability that someone has the same birthday as you amongst the people you’ve met is greater than 95%. It takes 587 to surpass 80%, and a measly 253 to pass 50%. But wait… this assumes that the probability of someone else having the same birthday as you is [math]\frac{1}{365}[/math] . This isn’t the case. FiveThirtyEight did an analysis on this. Since cesarean sections (c-sections) are pre-scheduled, people often choose not to have it on days like Christmas or Christmas Eve, and, as such, fewer children are born on these days because only vaginally are children born on these days. Made by FiveThirtyEight with R . This is clearly a flaw in our logic. To account for this, people with birthdays that are above average line marked on this graph are more likely to find someone with the same birthday as them then someone with a birthday below the average line. So, someone born on July 9th would have an easier time finding people born on the same day as him than someone born on Christmas. 1.6k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

Ask New Question   David Joyce , Professor of Mathematics at Clark University Updated Aug 13, 2014 · Author has 4.6k answers and 15m answer views The simplest model assumes that there are 365 days in a year, each sibling having the same probability of 1/365 of being born on any of those days, and their births are independent.  That implies the probability that they have the same birthday is 1/365. You can make improvements on this model is various ways.  For example, you can include leap days.  For that model you'd probably want to assume that the probability of being born on Feb 29 is 1/4 the probability of being born on any other day.  It complicates the computations a bit, and leads to a slightly lower probability for an answer. You could also get a table of the frequencies for births on each of the days of the year and weight the probabilities for each day to be proportional to those frequencies.  I don't know what answer that gives, but I suspect it would be slightly greater than 1/365. Finally, you could get some data on births of children in the same family.  You would find that they often occur in the same season, and even in the same month.  That means that the birthdays of siblings are not independent.  You might find that the probability of being born on the same day is 1/200 or higher. It would be interesting to know what that probability actually is. 22.7k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Undo   Rachel Olson , Two half sisters, one full sister, one full brother Answered Dec 19, 2015 · Author has 62 answers and 89.2k answer views While I cannot give you a scientific answer like David did, I can speak to my own experience. My brother is 20 years old. Born Aug 11th, 1995. I am 22. Born Aug 12th, 1993. My cousin (my father's brother's child) is 13. Born August 13th, 2002. So while we don't have the same birthday my brother was born late at night 11:57P, I was born late at night 10:32 & my cousin was born early in the morning 1:36A. We were within hours of having the same birthday. *Props to Mom & Aunt who remembered exact birth times of us.* 5k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

UPSC General Studies & Mathematics, The University of Texas at Dallas (2006) Answered Oct 10, 2013 · Author has 1.3k answers and 2.1m answer views I'm going to assume that the two birthdays are independent (no "season of love") I'm also going to assume that each day of birth is equally likely (although some research has shown otherwise.) If we ignore leap years, the answer is really simple. 1/365 The first sibling is born. Now when the 2nd sibling is born, they have a 1/365 chance of matching that birthday. 7.5k Views · View Upvoters Quora User Answered Jan 6, 2017 Let’s consider leap years only. If you are born in a day existing within 4 years , your chance of your brother to be born in the same day is a chance of [math]\frac{1}{366+365*4}[/math] because if we consider 4 years, one of them must be a leap year so it’ll have 366 days (29th of february) . So now, if we want to consider 1 year, we multiply that by 4, and it’ll become [math]\frac{4}{366+365*3}[/math] simplify that : [math]\frac{4}{1461} ~= 0.00273785078[/math] This happens if we forget the fact that if the year is divisible by 100 it’s not a leap year.

The reader suggested that since we omit three leap days every 400 years it would make the chance roughly 1 in 1,506.  Turns out there are several schools of thought on how to calculate the chances, including a vibrant debate here .

No longer would I flash a doctored Connecticut license and pose as a haggard 42-year-old Stonington man named Kurt. At the stroke of midnight, I could buy a beer legally. The barkeep slid my license back. “I can’t serve you,” he said. He thought my real ID was fake. Who, after all, has February 29 for their birthday? I protested, but it was no use. “Plus,” he said. “It’s February 28. Come back tomorrow.” Related Story      How Will You Spend Today's 'Leap Second'?  Here’s the thing about birthdays: They happen each year. That’s a birthday’s job: You turn a year older, whether you blow out the candles on the cake or not. Unless you don’t have a birthday. For 187,000 of us in the U.S., that’s what happens three-quarters of the time. We leaplings, as we’re called, have defied 1-in-1,461 odds to have our birthdays fall on February 29. Some would figure that makes us special. It depends on how you look at it. News reports in secondary markets sometimes feature leap-day births or an octogenarian leaper’s 20th. Back in 2008, Martha Stewart hosted 200 leapers on her show. They wore frog-mouth name tags (frogs leap, get it?). “I think you’re all so lucky!” Stewart said, sort of sincerely. She gave them each state-of-the-art digital picture frames. Leapsters keep two sets of ages, annual and quadrennial. We mark time between real birthdays in fourths and halves. Leap-year days serve a purpose, as we know: The extra day tacked onto the end of February every four years accounts for Earth’s spinning around the sun five hours, 48 minutes, and 45 seconds longer than 365 days. In 46 B.C., Julius Caesar noticed the calendar had fallen behind 90 days and tried to correct the difference, and added days here and there to months on the calendar for one year, adding a leap day every four years thereafter. This still needed tweaking: By 1582, with 11 minutes a year left unadjusted, the calendar had shifted 10 days. The Gregorian reform of the Julian calendar introduced an extra day to make up the difference, with leap years of centuries divisible by four skipped. Whatever. The bottom line is, I turn 12 this year, and I have Pope Gregory XIII and my mother to thank for it. Leaplings have formed clubs over the years, like The Order of 29’ers, set up by a newspaper editor in Pittsburg, Kansas, in the early part of the last century. Since 1988, Anthony, Texas, has championed itself as the Leap Year Capital of the World: In 2012, the town’s three-day celebration included a car show, an ice hockey game, and a golf tournament. At the website of the Honor Society of Leap Year Day Babies (“spreading Leap Year day awareness” for 19 years), fellow leapsters and leapettes share tales of woe: children who thought their birthdays were taken away, parents begging and bribing doctors to fudge kids’ birth certificates to February 28 or March 1. The date seems to confound petty bureaucrats and government factotum alike. “When I moved to Oregon and went to get my driver’s license I was told there is no February 29,” Raenell Dawn, the co-founder of the Honor Society, who turns 14 (56) this year, tells me. “The DMV employee actually said to me ‘Are you sure it’s February 29?’ As if I wasn’t sure of my own birth date!” Leapsters fall into two schools. There are those who think it’s a unique quirk, like having double-jointed thumbs or keeping an AOL account. And then there are those who think it’s no big deal. “All I do is spend time with my family and close friends,” Antonio Sabáto, Jr., the actor and former Calvin Klein model (born February 29, 1972), writes to me on Twitter. “Good enough for me.” I haven’t heard back from the rapper and actor Ja Rule (born February 29, 1976) or the motivational speaker Tony Robbins (born February 29, 1960), so I assume being an actual celebrity trumps leapster status. The bottom line is I turn 12 this year, and I have Pope Gregory XIII and my mother to thank for it. I can’t help but think about my life more deeply every four years. Thinking in four-year periods isn’t uncommon—we have summer Olympics and presidential elections on leap years, after all. But, each February 29, I pause to take a life inventory. 16 to 20 marked the time from high school to college. From 36 to 40, I became a father and moved out of New York City. There isn’t much of a Leap Day birthday canon. It’s a good enough birth date for Superman, although who knows what calendar the planet Krypton uses. Leapsters do have children’s books (sample titles: It’s My Birthday ... Finally! and Mommy, Where’s My Birthday? ) and a young adult title ( Leap Day ). Probability theorists have a famous exercise called the “Birthday Problem.” First proposed by the engineer and mathematician Richard von Mises in 1939, the Birthday Problem determines the probability of a match in birth date given any number of people in the same room. (The probability reaches one half at 23 people.) In the original set-up and others, however, Leap Day birthdays are excluded to keep things uniform. Perhaps the most famous leap-day plot device appears in the 1879 Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Pirates of Penzance . Frederic, enslaved to pirates until he turned 21, is convinced to stay until he turns 84 because of his February 29 birthday. “You are the victim of this clumsy arrangement,” goes the lyric for the opera’s leap-year song, “Paradox.” And then there’s Facebook, which bugs users to wish a happy birthday to close friends, family, and the pharma sales rep they sat next to on a plane that one time. Facebook tells the world my birthday falls on February 28 by default. For leapsters who celebrate on March 1 (about half of my leapling brethren are not, like me, strict “Februarians”), this is enough to ruin a birthday. Unless, of course, you just change your birthday to March 1. But the clumsiness of the arrangement is often enough to make me want to throw a fit. Just like a 12-year-old.

Most Popular  Presented by               Jonathan Ernst / Reuters   Michael Cohen Has a Big Problem    Adam Serwer    It takes strong evidence to execute a search warrant against an attorney representing a subject in a federal investigation, let alone the president’s personal counsel.   Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.   Continue Reading                Alana Semuels / The Atlantic   A House You Can Buy, But Never Own    Alana Semuels      African Americans in the same neighborhoods decimated by subprime lending are now being targeted with new predatory loan offerings, a lawsuit argues.   ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.

Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.

When Mark Zuckerberg rehearsed the manic routine of a presidential candidate last year, he was of sound mind. Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese ( Wired : “Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone’s Mind”); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges ( Bloomberg : “Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard”). Vanity Fair announced him the “new establishment king,” and it blared: “He changed the world once. He says he’ll do it again.”    Continue Reading                  George Frey / Reuters / Thanh Do / The Atlantic   The Family Trying to Escape Blame for the Opioid Crisis    David Armstrong      Relatives of the makers of OxyContin claim they have never benefited from money tied to the painkiller. A court document suggests otherwise.   Much as the role of the addictive multibillion-dollar painkiller OxyContin in the opioid crisis has stirred controversy and rancor nationwide, so it has divided members of the wealthy and philanthropic Sackler family, some of whom own the company that makes the drug.  In recent months, as protesters have begun pressuring the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and other cultural institutions to spurn donations from the Sacklers, one branch of the family has moved aggressively to distance itself from OxyContin and its manufacturer, Purdue Pharma. The widow and one daughter of Arthur Sackler, who owned a related Purdue company with his two brothers, maintain that none of his heirs have profited from sales of the drug. The daughter, Elizabeth Sackler, told  The New York Times in January that Purdue Pharma’s involvement in the opioid epidemic was “morally abhorrent to me.”    Continue Reading                  PNAS / Richard Goerg / Getty / The Atlantic   The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete    James Somers      Here’s what’s next.   T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.    Continue Reading                  Jules Julien   Your Body is a Teeming Battleground    Victoria Sweet      It’s time to rethink the quest to control aging, death, and disease—and the fear of mortality that fuels it.   I went to medical school , at least in part, to get to know death and perhaps to make my peace with it. So did many of my doctor friends, as I would find out. One day—usually when you’re young, though sometimes later—the thought hits you: You really are going to die. That moment is shocking, frightening, terrible. You try to pretend it hasn’t happened (it’s only a thought, after all), and you go about your business, worrying about this or that, until the day you put your hand to your neck—in the shower, say—and … What is that? Those hard lumps that you know, at first touch, should not be there? But there they are, and they mean death. Your death, and you can’t pretend anymore.  I never wanted to be surprised that way, and I thought that if I became a doctor and saw a lot of death, I might get used to it; it wouldn’t surprise me, and I could learn to live with it. My strategy worked pretty well. Over the decades, from all my patients, I learned that I would be well until I got sick and that although I could do some things to delay the inevitable a bit, whatever control I had was limited. I learned that I had to live as if I would die tomorrow and at the same time as if I would live forever. Meanwhile, I watched as what had been called “medical care”—that is, treating the sick— turned into “health care,” keeping people healthy, at an ever-rising cost.    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.    Continue Reading                  Edmon de Haro   The Era of Fake Video Begins    Franklin Foer      The digital manipulation of video may make the current era of “fake news” seem quaint.   In a dank corner of the internet, it is possible to find actresses from Game of Thrones or Harry Potter engaged in all manner of sex acts. Or at least to the world the carnal figures look like those actresses, and the faces in the videos are indeed their own. Everything south of the neck, however, belongs to different women. An artificial intelligence has almost seamlessly stitched the familiar visages into pornographic scenes, one face swapped for another. The genre is one of the cruelest, most invasive forms of identity theft invented in the internet era. At the core of the cruelty is the acuity of the technology: A casual observer can’t easily detect the hoax.  This development, which has been the subject of much hand-wringing in the tech press, is the work of a programmer who goes by the nom de hack “deepfakes.” And it is merely a beta version of a much more ambitious project. One of deepfakes’s compatriots told Vice ’s Motherboard site in January that he intends to democratize this work. He wants to refine the process, further automating it, which would allow anyone to transpose the disembodied head of a crush or an ex or a co-worker into an extant pornographic clip with just a few simple steps. No technical knowledge would be required. And because academic and commercial labs are developing even more-sophisticated tools for non-pornographic purposes—algorithms that map facial expressions and mimic voices with precision—the sordid fakes will soon acquire even greater verisimilitude.

It takes roughly 365 and one-quarter days for the earth to revolve around the sun, however, the standard calendar year lasts only 365 days. Were we to ignore the extra quarter of a day, strange things would eventually happen to our seasons - like winter and snow in July in the northern hemisphere.         To counteract the accumulation of additional quarters of a day, the Gregorian calendar adds an extra day of February 29 nearly every four years. These years are called leap years, and February 29th is known as leap day. Birthday Probabilities Assuming that birthdays are spread uniformly throughout the year, a leap day birthday on February 29 is the least probable of all birthdays. But what is the probability and how could we calculate it? We start by counting the number of calendar days in a four-year cycle. Three of these years have 365 days in them. The fourth year, a leap year has 366 days. The sum of all of these is 365+365+365+366 = 1461. Only one of these days is a leap day. Therefore the probability of a leap day birthday is 1/1461. This means that less than 0.07% of the world’s population was born on a leap day. Given current population data from the U.S. Census Bureau, only about 205,000 people in the U.S. have a February 29th birthday.   For the world‘s population approximate 4.8 million have a February 29th birthday. For comparison, we can just as easily calculate the probability of a birthday on any other day of the year. Here we still have a total of 1461 days for every four years. Any day other than February 29 occurs four times in four years.         Thus these other birthdays have a probability of 4/1461. The decimal representation of the first eight digits of this probability is 0.00273785. We could have also estimated this probability by calculating 1/365, one day out of the 365 days in a common year. The decimal representation of the first eight digits of this probability is 0.00273972. As we can see, these values match each other up to five decimal places. No matter which probability we use, this means that around 0.27% of the world's population was born on a particular non-leap day. Counting Leap Years Since the institution of the Gregorian calendar in 1582, there have been a total of 104 leap days. Despite the common belief that any year that is divisible by four is a leap year, it’s not really true to say that every four years is a leap year. Century years, referring to years that end in two zeros such as 1800 and 1600 are divisible by four, but may not be leap years.  These century years count as leap years only if they are divisible by 400. As a result, only one out of every four years that end in two zeros is a leap year. The year 2000 was a leap year, however, 1800 and 1900 were not. The years 2100, 2200 and 2300 will not be leap years.  Mean Solar Year The reason that 1900 was not a leap year has to do with the precise measurement of the average length of earth’s orbit. The solar year, or amount of time that it takes the earth to revolve around the sun, varies slightly over time. it is possible and helpful to find the mean of this variation. The mean length of revolution is not 365 days and 6 hours, but instead 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds. A leap year every four years for 400 years will result in three too many days being added during this time period. The century year rule was instituted to correct this overcounting.                                           cite cite this article          Format  mla  apa  chicago  Your Citation   Taylor, Courtney.

Around the world there are about 4.1 million people who were born on a leap day.  Why do we have leap years?  The Earth takes 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, and 16 seconds to make a complete revolution round the sun. So, every four years we need the extra leap day to keep the calendar on track.  We’ve not always had this extra day though. Greek astronomer Sosigenes invented it, and Roman emperor Julius Caesar introduced it in 46BC. Up until then, a year was 355 days long, and every two years there was an extra month with 22 days in it.  Hundreds of years later, there was another calendar refresh by Pope Gregory XIII and his astronomers. They also introduced the idea that to make it all work out in the long run, we also need to skip three leap days in every 400 years.  But it’s still not perfect. The tiny difference of 0.000125 days between the calendar and the Earth going round the sun means that, in 8,000 years, we'll have fallen behind by about a day.  Britain changed over to Pope Gregory’s new calendar almost 200 years after the rest of Europe. The whole country leapt forward 11 days from 2 September to 14 September in 1752.  One lucky man easily won a bet that he could dance non-stop for 12 days and 12 nights; all he had to do was jig around his village for one night!
