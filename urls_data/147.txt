Net neutrality is somewhat of a misnomer—a better descriptor is “content agnostic.” What net neutrality implies is that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the U.S.—cable companies and telcos like Comcast  (CMCSA) and Verizon  (VZ) —must treat all content equally, regardless of what it is or who owns it. For example, AT&T  (T) is not currently allowed to provide its subscribers faster access to DirecTV, which it owns, and slower access to Netflix  (NFLX) , which it does not own. The end of net neutrality would, in theory, allow ISPs to charge more/less for, or slow down/speed up, different types of content.      Removing net neutrality has generated a huge amount of media coverage in the U.S., mostly casting the debate in terms of an epic story of victims and villains.  The victims are American consumers and businesses. As certain content is priced out of reach, the story goes, the Internet will become less rich, small enterprises will suffer, public schools and universities will see their Internet connections slow to a crawl, the best minds will leave the country in frustration, and everyone will pay more for Spotify and Netflix.  The villains are the ISPs, long reviled for high prices, poor service, and aggressive retention tactics. The ISPs lobbied the government hard for this change, and stand to benefit the most at the expense of long-suffering subscribers. Networking and infrastructure companies are also likely to gain, as the rule change will require upgrades to networking hardware and software.    This is a gripping narrative, but how much of it is actually true? Will the end of net neutrality really make a big difference to the average Internet user? We think not.  First, it is worth pointing out that net neutrality rules are quite new—the law was only enacted in mid-2015—although the concept has been around since the 1990s. Prior to 2015, there was no net neutrality and, well, the Internet worked just fine for most people. Occasionally, an ISP was caught slowing down (throttling) certain sites, but public pressure or legal action tended to keep the ISP honest. There is little reason to believe that a future with no net neutrality regulation will be very different from the past.  Second, the issue with net neutrality is multi-speed Internet service, not web censorship. An ISP might be frustrated that Netflix consumes 35% of its bandwidth at peak hours, but it cannot legally block it, with or without net neutrality. Even with no net neutrality, the most that an ISP could do would be to slow down access to Netflix, and charge people for higher speeds. In reality, this is not likely to happen—the public backlash would be too severe. More likely, the ISPs would discriminate by offering their own preferred content faster and cheaper. Ironically, this is already happening under net neutrality regulation: AT&T, for example, offers DirecTV access as a “zero rating” product, i.e. it does not count toward data caps.      Third, the end of net neutrality rules will lead to a closer link between cost and consumption. While net neutrality may be conceptually appealing, it is not equitable. Is it fair that a few super-users are allowed to clog up networks by downloading movies, playing data-hungry online games, and not paying more for it? Why shouldn’t ISPs be allowed to price data according to volume, type, or speed?  Fourth, ISPs could use any extra revenue generated from high-bandwidth users to subsidize the cost to regular users or improve network infrastructure. If they start to charge more for content, then there will be a lot of pressure from subscribers and regulators to improve service levels in return.              Fifth, the practical difference for most subscribers will be minimal. Most ISPs already charge higher prices for higher speeds, or bundle less attractive services (like TV channels you never watch) with more attractive ones (faster Internet access). The only difference without net neutrality would be that slow speeds could affect some sites more than other sites.  Sixth, net neutrality, however intuitively appealing, is a form of government control. History has taught us that government control and intervention often inhibits progress and innovation. If ISPs are less regulated, one might imagine companies springing up that would provide better, faster, and cheaper service, thus promoting innovation.  Finally, ISPs are unlikely to make any quick moves to change the status quo. Legal challenges to the removal of net neutrality are likely, mid-term elections are coming in 2018, and public opinion of ISPs is already low. Most large ISPs have also pledged not to make any dramatic moves in the event that net neutrality is repealed.      Net neutrality is an attractive concept, and its removal might instinctively rub you the wrong way, but that doesn’t mean it should be kept in its current form. Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix , has stated that net neutrality is “not our primary battle at this point.” If he is not worried, why should the rest of us be?

Here’s what happens next.   The FCC voted in a 3-2 party-line vote to end net neutrality, despite overwhelming bipartisan support for it.

Here’s what happens next.      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email             Video by Liz Scheltens and Mallory Brangan    The Federal Communications Commission has voted to repeal net neutrality , despite overwhelming public support for the regulation, which requires internet service providers like Verizon and Comcast to distribute internet access fairly and equally to everyone, regardless of how much  they pay or where they’re located.  Despite last-minute requests to delay the December 14 vote from some Republican members of Congress, it went through as scheduled, thanks to the support of a much longer list of Republicans who favored the repeal and urged the vote to be held without delay. As had been heavily predicted for months , the vote was split 3-2 along party lines, with the FCC chair Ajit Pai and the other Republican members Michael O’Rielly and Brendan Carr voting for repeal and Democratic commissioners Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel voting to protect it.  The vote to repeal came in spite of overwhelming bipartisan support for net neutrality from the public, as the FCC was clearly determined to move ahead with the repeal. Tensions were high during the hearing — and at one point, in the middle of Pai’s remarks, the room was evacuated for about 10 minutes due to an apparent security threat.    We are being evacuated by security during net neutrality vote at FCC — CeciliaKang (@ceciliakang) December 14, 2017     The implications of the repeal are vast and complicated. If it’s left unchallenged, it will almost certainly fundamentally change how people access and use the internet. But it could be a long time before we start to see the full effects of the FCC’s vote — and there’s even a ghost of a chance that the repeal might be overturned by the US Court of Appeals.  Here’s what you need to know about what could happen next.          Protesters at a 2015 net neutrality rally .  Media Action Grassroots Network    1) What was the FCC actually voting on?  The FCC voted on the Restoring Internet Freedom Order , which concerned the repeal of Title II protection for net neutrality.  Title II is a decades-old regulatory clause that explicitly classifies internet service providers (ISPs) as telecommunications companies, meaning they’re essentially classified as utilities and subject to the same regulations that other telecommunication companies — also classified as utilities — must abide by. That basic regulatory standard is what people are referring to when they talk about net neutrality. Title II was first applied to ISPs in 2015, after a hard-won fight by internet activists.  Placing ISPs under Title II was the only legal way — barring the unlikely introduction and passage  of Congressional legislation instituting complicated new regulatory procedures — in which these companies could be regulated. Now that the FCC has repealed Title II classification for ISPs, the ISPs will essentially be unregulated.  2) Why does it matter if ISPs are regulated or not?  Classifying ISPs as utility companies under Title II meant they had to treat the internet like every other utility — that is, just like gas, water, or phone service — and that they couldn’t cut off service at will or control how much of it any one person received based on how much that person paid for it. The idea was that the internet should be a public service that everyone has a right to use, not a privilege, and that regulating ISPs like utilities would prevent them from hijacking or monopolize that access.  The best argument for the rollback of this Title II protection is that maybe the internet isn’t a public service — maybe it’s just another product, and in a free market system, competition over who gets to sell you that product would ensure accountability and fair treatment among providers, if only due to economic self-interest .   Related  "Net neutrality is the secret sauce that has made the internet awesome"   But there’s a huge problem with that argument, which is that, as far as the internet is concerned, there really isn’t a free and open market . In the United States, competition among ISPs was driven down years ago thanks to the consolidated nature of internet broadband infrastructure, which has typically been owned by major corporations, shutting out local ISP competitors.  That’s why many people don’t really have much choice about which company they pay for internet access — that access has been monopolized by a handful of powerful companies. In fact, nearly 50 million households have only one high-speed ISP in their area.   Related  Net neutrality isn’t the only way to keep the internet fair. It’s just the only way in America.   In other words, these particular utility companies, now unregulated, have free reign to behave like the corporate monopolies they are. Where net neutrality ensured the preservation of what’s been dubbed “the open internet,” its repeal will open the door for ISPs to create “ an internet for the elite .”  3) What will happen to the internet without net neutrality protections in place?  Net neutrality mandated that ISPs display all websites, at the same speed, to all sources of internet traffic. Without net neutrality, all bets are off.  That means ISPs will be free to control what you access on the internet, meaning they will be able to block access to specific websites and pieces of software that interact with the internet.  They might charge you more or less money to access specific “bundles” of certain websites, much as cable television providers do now — but instead of “basic cable,” you might be forced to pay for access to more than a “basic” number of websites, as this popular pro-net neutrality graphic illustrates:          ISPs will also be able to control how quickly you’re served webpages, how quickly you can download and upload things, and in what contexts you can access which websites, depending on how much money you pay them.  They’ll be able to  charge you more to access sites you currently visit for free, cap how much data you’re allowed to use, redirect you from sites you are trying to use to sites they want you to use instead, and block you from being able to access apps, products, and information offered by their competitors or other companies they don’t like.  They can even block you from being able to access information on certain topics, news events, or issues they don’t want you to know about.  Finally, they’ll be able to exert this power not just over individual consumers, but over companies, as well. This could result in the much-discussed “ internet fast lane ” — in which an ISP forces a company like Twitter or BitTorrent to pay more for faster access for readers or users like you to its websites and services. Larger, more powerful companies likely won’t be hurt by this change. Smaller companies and websites almost definitely will be.  We already have a good idea of how these scenarios might play out, because in the era before net neutrality existed, ISPs tried instituting all of them: via jacked-up fees , forced redirection , content-blocking , software-blocking , website-blocking , competitor-blocking and still more competitor-blocking , app-blocking and still more app-blocking , data-capping , and censorship of controversial subjects .  If net neutrality advocates have made it seem like there’s simply no end to the worst-case scenarios that unregulated ISPs might subject us to, it’s because they’ve learned from experience. This history of ISP exploitation is a major reason that advocates for net neutrality fought so hard for it to begin with.  We also know that many ISPs, notably Comcast , already have their eyes on the aforementioned “fast lane,” also known as “paid prioritization.” (Disclaimer: Comcast is an investor in Vox’s parent company, Vox Media, through its NBC-Universal arm.)  And lest you believe that the current FCC is prepared to make sure that such offenses are fully sanctioned and dealt with by the government, think again. FCC chair Pai is a vocal proponent of letting ISPs self-regulate, and seems perfectly content to ignore their contentious and often predatory history.  Not only that, but the FCC is explicitly preventing state consumer protection laws from taking effect regarding net neutrality. That means that once the repeal is final, the rights of states to govern themselves won’t apply to protecting net neutrality. (Though California and Washington each vowed after the vote to try to protect it anyway.)  4) Who will be most affected by the repeal of net neutrality?  Women, minorities, rural communities, and internet developers will feel the fullest effects of this repeal.  The general argument among net neutrality advocates is that without an open internet, members of society who have historically been marginalized and silenced will be in danger of being further marginalized and silenced, or marginalized and silenced once more — particularly women and minorities .  We’ve seen in the past that ISPs can and will censor access to controversial subjects. Without regulation, situations could arise in which underprivileged or disenfranchised individuals and groups have less access to speak up or contact others online.  One worst-case scenario that we haven’t yet seen in America, but which is worth considering given the current heated political climate, is that ISPs could potentially play a role in limiting or marginalizing certain communities during times of urgency — for instance, an ISP might choose to block a mobilizing hashtag like #BlackLivesMatter at the start of an organic protest.  This might seem like a dire prediction, but there’s precedent for it: In 2011, the Egyptian government heavily censored certain websites during the Arab Spring. And in Turkey, under the administration of President Erdogan, the country has become notorious for censoring websites and blocking hashtags, at one point banning Twitter altogether .  Rural areas of the US — where internet access is already scarce due to a lack of ISPs operating there — will be further subjected to corporatization and monopolization of their internet infrastructure.  More than 10 million Americans already lack broadband access, and as the Hill notes in an overview of the potential impact of net neutrality’s repeal, “Good broadband is a small town’s lifeline out of geographic isolation, its connection to business software and services, and its conduit for exporting homegrown ideas and products.” Without regulatory inducements, corporate ISPs will have little incentive to develop infrastructure in such areas.  Another group that will be heavily impacted by net neutrality’s repeal — one that’s often overlooked but extremely crucial — is innovators and developers and people who create stuff for the internet. Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the internet as we know it, recently summed up the repeal’s potential effect on these developers:  If US net neutrality rules are repealed, future innovators will have to first negotiate with each ISP to get their new product onto an internet package. That means no more permissionless space for innovation. ISPs will have the power to decide which websites you can access and at what speed each will load. In other words, they’ll be able to decide which companies succeed online, which voices are heard  —  and which are silenced.  Again, this all sounds pretty dire — but that’s because it is. The people with the most expertise, the most investment in creating a progressive internet, and the strongest ability to advocate for an open internet could be prevented from doing their best work because of a lack of ability to pay for access to an ISP-controlled space.  It’s important to note, too, that because the nature of the repeal is unprecedented, we can’t necessarily predict every group and demographic that could potentially feel its impact.  5) Why did the FCC vote to repeal net neutrality when it had such overwhelming bipartisan support, and when the effects of a repeal seem so dire?  Pretty much everybody supports net neutrality — it’s one of the few bipartisan issues that most of Congress and most American citizens agree on. The glaring exceptions are the giant ISPs who are reigned in by the regulation.  Over the last nine years, Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T have collectively spent over half a billion dollars lobbying the FCC to end regulatory oversight, and especially to block or repeal net neutrality. They found a loyal friend in Pai, who was appointed to the FCC in 2012 by then President Barack Obama, and named chairman by President Donald Trump shortly after Trump took office  in January. Pai previously worked for Verizon and voted against the 2015 net neutrality ruling as a minority member of the FCC, calling it a “massive intrusion in the internet economy.”  So Pai has basically always supported the repeal of net neutrality , despite the overwhelming public support for it. He believes the 2015 ruling was frivolous and unnecessary , and has also argued, in opposition to hard evidence , that investment in the internet shrinks when net neutrality is in effect. With Trump’s full backing, he has made undoing it a priority.  In fact, even though Pai is legally required to seriously consider the voice of the public when he makes decisions, he has made it clear that he never truly intended to consider most of the millions of comments submitted in support of net neutrality through the FCC’s website since it began the repeal process in May. That’s because the vast majority of those comments were duplicates that came through automated third-party advocacy websites. While many of them were likely submitted by spambots using fake or stolen identities and emails to file comments, many more of them were likely submitted by people using the tried-and-true method of sending a form letter to the government to express their opinions. Pai also rejected the form letters out of hand: Once the number of duplicate comments came to light, the FCC declared that it would be rejecting all duplicated comments as well as “opinions” that came without “introducing new facts.”  Essentially, even though nearly 99 percent of the unique comments that the FCC received were pro-net neutrality and anti-repeal, and even though the entire point of a democratic process is to allow people to express their opinions, the FCC chose to dismiss pretty much every opinion that was expressed, because spambots and auto-duplicated opinions were involved. FCC commissioner Rosenworcel, one of the commission’s two minority Democrats, acknowledged this during the December 14 vote to repeal, noting "the cavalier disregard this agency has demonstrated to the public.”  As Dell Cameron at Gizmodo put it , “To be clear, when the FCC says that it is ‘restoring internet freedom,’ it is not talking about your freedom or the freedom of consumers.”  6) What happens now, in the immediate aftermath of the vote?  A flurry of lawsuits from tech companies, internet activists, and think tanks will likely descend upon Washington — starting with a protective filing by internet activists that will appeal the FCC’s vote to prevent the repeal from immediately taking effect.  Mere hours after the FCC vote, the Attorney General of the state of New York announced a multi-state appeal of the ruling , to which a number of other states quickly signed on. The exact number of states participating in the appeal will grow over the coming weeks — technically after a suit is announced, the states (as well as any latecomers to any other lawsuits filed) will have 60 days to join in before the suit closes.  These lawsuits will petition the US Court of Appeals for a review of the FCC’s order. After a filing period of 10 days, all of the lawsuits will eventually be punted collectively to one of the Court of Appeals’ 12 circuit courts, and the ultimate outcome will be largely dependent on which court hears the appeals.  If the repeal does eventually go into effect, the FCC will institute one very thin piece of ISP regulation in place of net neutrality — a version of a 2010 transparency ruling that requires ISPs to inform consumers when the ISPs are deliberately slowing their internet speed. The FCC will be passing off the enforcement of this transparency stipulation to the FTC, in a long-planned and recently formalized agreement that will allow the two commissions “to work together to take targeted action against bad actors.”  7) When will the repeal go into effect?  We simply can’t know at this point. Establishing a workable timeline will depend on a whole heap of factors , such as which circuit court ends up hearing the appeals, whether there is a motion to relocate the appeals to another court, any motions or counter-motions filed on the appeals, and so forth. There’s also the likelihood that net neutrality advocates will ask for stays of the FCC’s ruling so that it can’t take effect while motions are still being heard and appeals are being deliberated.  Additionally, there’s one alternative to the appeals process that’s definitely a longshot, yet still a possibility: Congress could move to pass a joint resolution overturning the repeal and establishing new regulatory oversight. However, given how firmly many Republican politicians have stood behind Pai’s repeal campaign, this seems highly unlikely to happen unless the 2018 midterm elections result in a major upheaval of Congress, and could take years to hash out.  In a nutshell, we don’t know how long will it take to fight the repeal in the court system, so we can’t know when — or if — it will take effect. It’s likely that even if a court overturns the FCC’s decision, that court may only overturn part of it and not the entire thing.  What the final version of a net neutrality repeal might look like, and when it might take effect, are both unknown at this point, with the future of an open internet hanging in the balance.

Congress Will Pay the Price Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg/Getty Images FCC chair Ajit Pai’s plan to repeal net neutrality provisions and reclassify broadband providers from “common carriers” to “information services” is an unprecedented giveaway to big broadband providers and a danger to the internet. The move would mean the FCC would have almost no oversight authority over broadband providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T. WIRED OPINION ABOUT Ryan Singel ( @rsingel ) is media and strategy fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School and the CEO/cofounder of Contextly. For years, those broadband providers have used lawsuits and agency filings to fight FCC oversight and overturn its authority to prevent net neutrality abuses. But never in those companies’ most feverish dreams did they expect an FCC chair would propose to demolish all net neutrality protections and allow ISPs to extract tolls from every business in the country. Even industry analysts who expected the reclassification of broadband providers from Title II common carriers to Title I information services were stunned. Following Pai’s announcement, independent cable analyst Craig Moffett sent out an email to investors entitled "Shock and Awe and Net Neutrality," writing , “We've known since the election that the FCC would reverse Title II. But we never expected this . Yesterday’s FCC Draft Order on Net Neutrality went much further than we ever could've imagined in not only reversing Title II, but in dismantling virtually all of the important tenets of net neutrality itself.” If Congress allows Pai’s plan to pass, all that will be left of FCC oversight of broadband providers is a weak disclosure requirement: If Verizon, for example, wants to block content, charge sites to be viewable on its network, or create paid fast lanes, the company will simply have to tell its subscribers in their contract’s fine print. (Broadband providers won’t have to disclose, and the FCC won’t have control over, the sneakier ways they’ve found to mess with the internet.) Enforcement will be left to the Federal Trade Commission, an agency that’s never enforced open internet rules and has no ability to formulate its own. The FTC won’t even be able to protect consumers against most net neutrality violations after the fact, and nor will it be able to protect consumers against greedy broadband providers. And violations will come if Pai’s plan passes. AT&T's Ed Whitacre summarized broadband providers’ true motivations best back in 2005 : “Why should they be allowed to use my pipes?" he said. "The internet can't be free in that sense, because we and the cable companies have made an investment and for a Google or Yahoo or Vonage or anybody to expect to use these pipes free is nuts.” Verizon echoed that sentiment in 2013 when it sued to challenge the 2010 open internet rules. It told a federal court that as an “information service” it had the right to charge online services like Yelp access fees simply to work on its network and should be able block those sites from Verizon subscribers if Yelp didn’t pay. (Verizon won that case, leading to the 2015 order and the reclassification of broadband providers as “common carriers.”) The 2015 order, replacing the one Verizon had overturned, recognized this as a threat and prohibited ISPs from charging sites and services simply to reach their users. Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, thinks this would be innovative. Now his plan would usher in a radical upending of how the internet has worked in the US since its inception. Every website could have to pay more to simply be online; prices for online services would likely rise as companies start to pay broadband providers to be in fast lanes, while broadband providers would find even sneakier ways to enact tolls on the internet, free of any agency able to set rules to stop them.

Today, small and medium-size businesses rely on a myriad online business services for internal communications, sales, and accounting, to name just a few. Slack, Dropbox, Gusto, Quickbooks, and thousands more would have to pay access charges and fast-lane fees, costs they would likely have to pass to their customers. Non-mainstream media news sources across the political spectrum would no longer be able to afford to compete in the marketplace of ideas. Even churches that now reach their members online with streaming sermons, video libraries, and online video chats, would no longer be protected from blocking or access fees. Americans understand this and are rightly freaking out. Since the order was released, they’ve flooded Congress with more than half a million calls, and that’s only counting calls placed through the site BattleForTheNet.com. The citizen outrage crosses party lines; net neutrality is more popular than both parties combined . A poll this summer found that 77 percent of Americans support the current protections, including 73 percent of Republicans. This is not surprising. History has shown that internet freedom is the new third rail of US politics. In 2012, a bipartisan majority of Congress was dead set on passing SOPA , a law ostensibly intended to stop online copyright infringement but which would have threatened huge swaths of the internet. All conventional wisdom said it was a done deal. Then, freedom-loving people of the internet melted representatives' phone lines after a day of online action in January 2012. Even SOPA’s biggest supporters had to concede the internet killed SOPA. When online bots poisoned the net neutrality comment period, FCC chair Ajit Pai shrugged it off. In 2014, when the FCC set out to replace the struck-down 2010 net neutrality protections, conventional D.C. wisdom suggested that preserving net neutrality by designating broadband companies as common carriers was politically impossible. But millions of Americans proved otherwise. When TV host John Oliver pleaded with viewers to contact the FCC in support of net neutrality, they responded at such volume that the agency’s website crashed. That resulted in a win: limited but well-defined FCC net neutrality rules which, for the first time in FCC history, survived court challenges. Then in March, Congressional Republicans used a little-known legislative tool to repeal FCC rules that required broadband providers to get permission to track their subscribers’ every moves online for advertising purposes. That vote blew up in their faces when Republicans came back to their districts and held town hall meetings, where the politicians’ arguments that they voted to strike down the rule because it didn’t apply to online companies like Google did little to appease voter anger. That’s already likely to be an issue in the 2018 midterms. So far senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) is the only Republican member of Congress who has explicitly criticized Pai’s plan and has come out on the side of the internet. As the appointed head of an independent agency, Pai is technically free to ignore the American public. He’s done just that, saying that he doesn’t care about public sentiment. Pai did nothing when online bots poisoned the net neutrality comment period and posted anti net neutrality submissions using Americans’ names without their permission or knowledge. Instead of taking this corruption of a democratic process seriously, Pai shrugged it off . And while the FCC held multiple public hearings with participation from experts during previous net neutrality actions in 2008, 2010, and 2015, this time around Pai didn’t hold a single one. Voters know Republicans in Congress are the only ones who can stop Pai, and they should keep calling . If enough Republicans tell Pai to stop, he will likely back down. After all, congressional pressure has stopped the FCC before. Members of Congress face a choice: They can side with their constituents, who overwhelmingly want them to defend the greatest communication and innovation platform ever invented, or support one of the most blatant anticonsumer corporate giveaways in modern history. Some lawmakers believe the current FCC protections are the right solution, and others think that Congress should step in with a legislative solution to settle the matter once and for all. But all should agree that Pai’s plan to repeal the protections without a replacement is reckless and unnecessary. There’s no crisis Pai needs to save us from. The only crisis looming is the one that Pai’s plan will create for entrepreneurs, free markets, free speech, and for Republican members of Congress running for reelection who didn’t make the choice to stop Pai when they had the chance.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.            Tweet This     after today's announcement, I think with almost full certainty you can say goodbye to FCC's net neutrality rules.            Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), speaks during an open meeting in Washington, D.C. on Thursday, Nov. 16, 2017. On Tuesday, he announced the proposal to rollback net neutrality rules will be voted on December 14. (Photo: Zach Gibson/Bloomberg      In a short announcement , the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revealed on Tuesday that the proposal "Restoring Internet Freedom Order" was circulated that morning to all the Commissioners for vote on December 14. Ajit Pai, FCC chairman, also announced the proposal will be shared on Wednesday with the public.  This announcement is no surprise , because Ajit Pai for a long time has advocated a light touch approach to regulating Internet Service Providers (ISPs) including telcos (e.g., Verizon, AT&T) and broadband providers (e.g., Comcast, Charter). This is in contrast to the rules implemented by the FCC in the Obama era, which regulated ISPs as utilities. Pai has argued that this heavy-hand regulation is not good for consumers because it discourages ISPs from investing in infrastructure to expand the footprint of broadband internet service, and that it discourages innovation to improve broadband technologies.  Based on Pai's openness about his position, back in March consulting firm Red Chalk Group and I predicted that within one year the net neutrality rules would be rolled back fully (60% probability) or partially (30% probability). The full rollback means the rules are scrapped in their totality, while the partial rollback takes away the classification of ISPs as utilities or "common carriers," but so-called brightline rules would remain that prohibit ISPs from blocking or slowing down legal content, or from prioritizing content from certain content providers for a fee.    We will know the extent of the rollback on Wednesday, when the proposal is revealed, but a full rollback is imminent because Tuesday's announcement states "the FCC would simply require Internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate." Pai then adds, "Notably, my proposal will put the federal government’s most experienced privacy cop, the FTC, back on the beat to protect consumers’ online privacy." This means there will likely be no rules left for the FCC to enforce.  Either way, it is not hard to guess the outcome on the December vote, because three of the five commissioners advocate the rollback. So in a nutshell, expect a full rollback of the net neutrality rules by December 14.   There is a silver lining to those who fear it's the end of a neutral internet. The internet was pretty neutral before net neutrality rules were implemented in 2015. Also, in our March predictions , there are two stages. The first one is  the rollback of the net neutrality rules, which officially starts now that there is a proposal. On a second stage, light touch rules could be enacted by Congress that for example make the brightline rules permanent, because after all, nobody benefits from a wild, wild west when it comes to internet access. We will see on that, but  after today's announcement, I think with almost full certainty you can say goodbye to FCC's net neutrality rules.

The future of how the internet is regulated is about to change            by Seth Fiegerman   @sfiegerman   December 13, 2017: 2:44 PM ET                      Stolen identities, deceased weigh in on net neutrality       The future of how the internet is regulated may be decided this week.  The Republican-led Federal Communications Commission is scheduled to vote Thursday on a controversial plan to repeal Obama-era net neutrality protections. The repeal is expected to pass on a party-line vote.    The rules, approved by the FCC in 2015, were intended to keep the internet open and fair. Internet service providers like Comcast  ( CCVCL ) and Verizon  ( VZ ) were explicitly prohibited from speeding up or slowing down traffic from specific websites and apps.  Under the new proposal, the FCC would do away with rules barring internet providers from blocking or slowing down access to online content. The FCC would also eliminate a rule barring providers from prioritizing their own content.  Ajit Pai, the chairman appointed to run the FCC by President Trump, has been an longtime critic of the net neutrality rules. Last month, he pitched his repeal proposal as a way stop the federal government from "micromanaging the internet."   Pai's plan has been praised by the telecom industry, which argues the earlier regulation was a drag on broadband investment and innovation. But the repeal plan has been loudly criticized by numerous technology companies and consumer advocacy groups.  The concern among net neutrality advocates is that the repeal could give internet providers too much control over how online content is delivered. It may also make it harder for the next generation of online services to compete, if they have to pay up to be placed in a so-called internet fast lane.   Related: Trump's FCC moves quickly to upend internet, media rules    Twitter  ( TWTR ) , Reddit, Kickstarter and other websites posted messages on their sites this week ahead of the vote in support of net neutrality. Protesters mobilized in front of Verizon stores around the country. And some of the creators of the internet penned a letter calling on the FCC to cancel the vote.  On Tuesday, three dozen Democratic Senators made a last-minute plea for Pai to abandon what they called a "reckless plan."  "Your plan gives a broadband provider the ability to significantly alter their subscribers' internet experience," the lawmakers wrote in a letter to Pai . "Once adopted, this proposal will permit that provider to freely block, slow down or manipulate a consumer's access to the internet as long as it discloses those practices."  Even some members of Pai's own party have called on him to rethink his plan. Rep. Mike Coffman, a Republican from Colorado, asked Pai this week to delay the vote and give Congress a chance to weigh in on the issue.     The repeal vote comes more than six months after the FCC kicked off the lengthy process to roll back the net neutrality protections. It received millions of comments during a review period, with the majority supporting the current protections.  There has also been mounting scrutiny in recent weeks over rampant fraudulent comments submitted during the review period. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said last month the FCC had been uncooperative in his office's investigation into the comments.  "The FCC has failed the public," Jessica Rosenworcel, one of two Democratic commissioners at the FCC, wrote on Twitter Wednesday. "The public record it's using to justify the roll back of #NetNeutrality is a corrupted mess and the agency isn't doing anything about it. That's not right."   Related: Trump administration sends mixed messages on big media   Pai hasn't been shy in pushing back at the criticisms. In a speech late last month, Pai suggested that tech companies like Facebook  ( FB ) and Google  ( GOOGL ) are a "bigger actual threat to an open Internet" because they can censor content. He accused Twitter in particular of silencing conservatives.  In the same speech, Pai also went after like musician Cher and actors George Takei, Mark Ruffalo and Alyssa Milano by name for criticizing his proposal to repeal net neutrality.  The net neutrality repeal is just one part of the Pai's deregulatory agenda. Under Pai, the FCC has moved to allow for greater media consolidation and endorsed Congress's move to repeal internet privacy protections earlier this year.  Assuming the FCC votes to repeal net neutrality on Thursday, the issue may end up heading to court next.  "Whenever we do anything big and major, people go to court," a senior FCC official said last month. "I certainly would not rule that out."

By Alasdair Wilkins on November 28, 2017 Filed Under Politics Net neutrality is on life support at the FCC, and in two weeks, it’s expected that the Republican-controlled commission will vote to remove the consumer protections. The proposal circulated before Thanksgiving to end net neutrality goes to a vote when the FCC meets on December 14, with the vote expected to go 3-2 along party lines to approval his new rules. After years of debate, uncertainty, and reversals, that vote in two weeks means the end of net neutrality’s story at the FCC. But that doesn’t mean telecommunications companies like Comcast and AT&T will immediately be able to roll out tiered internet plans and start throttling site speeds. In all likelihood, the next stop for net neutrality will be the courts — and Pai figures to face an uphill battle to get judges to agree with his new rules.telecommunications companies like Comcast and AT&T will immediately be able to roll out tiered internet plans and start throttling site speeds. In all likelihood, the next stop for net neutrality will be the courts — and Pai figures to face an uphill battle to get judges to agree with his new rules. There’s a very simple reason for that: Federal agencies like the FCC can’t change existing rules just because they want to. The fact that a Trump appointee like Pai disagrees philosophically with the Obama-era FCC’s position on net neutrality isn’t in and of itself justification to change the rules. Pai and the FCC have to make a fact-based argument to do away with net neutrality. If they can’t do that, even a court full of Republican judicial appointees would be compelled to strike down the FCC’s decision and preserve net neutrality. Article continues below The revolution will not be televised. It'll be sent to your inbox by us. Sign up for our newsletter: sign up You can find Pai’s rationale right at the top of the text he circulated ahead of the December 14 meeting: “In 2015, the Commission imposed heavy-handed, utility-style regulation on Internet service providers (ISPs),” he writes. “Since then, broadband investment has fallen for two years in a row — the first time that that’s happened outside a recession in the Internet era. And new services have been delayed or scuttled by a regulatory environment that stifles innovation.” Those are Pai’s key facts. Never mind any of the facts that weight against that — like the overwhelming public support for net neutrality or the fact that ISPs don’t actually create almost any of the content they send, which makes the FCC’s 2015 reclassification of telecoms from “information providers” to “common carriers” seem pretty intuitive. Those don’t even need to matter. If Pai’s own stated facts aren’t supportable, then there’s no legal basis for the end of net neutrality. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai Pai has been making his arguments about reduced investment and innovation for a while now, and outside observers have repeatedly countered that his numbers don’t add up. No, seriously, a report this May from the Free Press Action Network was literally titled “Sorry, Chairman Pai: Your Investment Numbers Don’t Add Up.” By any metric — and the report stresses Pai’s preferred metric of total industry investment is actually one of the least precise ways to judge this, but even by that metric — spending has gone up since the 2015 decision. “Altogether, publicly traded ISPs spent approximately 5 percent more on capital investment during the two years after the FCC’s decision than they did in the two years prior. Far from declining or flatlining, aggregate industry investment has been growing,” the report finds. “Total capital spending across the three survey categories of broadband providers was $87.184 billion — more than $553 million higher than it was in 2014.” Is that simple refutation of Pai’s argument the entire ballgame? Maybe not. The FCC has its own figures — which net neutrality advocates have persuasively argued are disingenuous — and it will have lawyers to defend the validity of those numbers in court. The legal battle would likely prove protracted. Lasting clear until, say, January 2021, when it’s possible there will be a new president and, with that, a new FCC chairman. We run into this kind of story most often with the Environmental Protection Agency. Any new rule the agency puts forth — whether more pro-environment in the case of Democratic administrations, or more pro-industry in the case of Republican ones — faces months or even years of legal challenges from anyone with a stake. And in the case of net neutrality and FCC, everyone who uses the internet, plus giant companies like Amazon and Google that have every reason to stand against Pai’s proposal, would have a stake in keeping net neutrality tied up in the courts for as along as possible. The FCC figures to make net neutrality that much more vulnerable after its expected vote on December 14. That’s the end of the battle. It’s likely just the beginning of the war.

You can probably think of at least one experience that had you pulling your hair out. In fact, from year to year, cable companies consistently rank at the very bottom of the American Consumer Satisfaction Index. But if you think things are bad, they’re about to get much worse under the Federal Communications Commission’s plan to turn control of the Internet over to your cable and Internet provider. The Internet as we have always known it is an open platform for content, speech and information. Now the FCC is set to vote Thursday on a proposal by Republican Chairman Ajit Pai to obliterate the rules that keep it that way — and in their place, he offers almost nothing. He’ll wrest control of the Internet from the American people and hand it over to existing Internet service providers (ISPs) like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon, empowering them to generate new profits by restricting access. More: Wozniak & Copps: Ending net neutrality will end the Internet as we know it More: Protect net neutrality and Internet freedom: World Wide Web inventor Under Pai’s plan, ISPs can charge web companies for “fast lanes,” holding those who can pay ransom for better service and leaving little guys who can’t pay in the dust. Meanwhile, none of that money will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower rates. If anything, your rates are likely to increase. If this sounds familiar, it should. It’s exactly what happened to the cable industry years ago, and it’s why you probably hate your cable company. Once upon a time, cable was seen as the insurgent ‘outlaw’ of the 1960’s media scene . The new medium challenged the ironclad control broadcast radio and TV networks had over content and introduced unprecedented competition and choice. But gradually, the old industry incumbents wrested control back, and soon it became the monolithic industry we think of today. Fast forward 20 years, traditional cable companies were the main arbiters of information and entertainment, determining the majority of what consumers got to see in their curated channel line-ups. This created the consolidated market power that meant high prices and relatively few choices we know it as today. Then the Internet came along and broke this business model wide open. Suddenly, viewers at home saw an explosion of creative new content and voted with their clicks, not their wallets. Essential to the Internet’s growth was net neutrality: All (legal) traffic flowed at the same speed over the network, regardless of ownership or content. Cable companies panicked at this threat to their business, so they monopolized on Internet connectivity themselves. If you own the pipes and control the speed for content produced by both you and your competitors, you can simply slow transmission for their content or make them pay more for faster access. More: FCC chairman: Strict regulations stifle competition POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Fortunately, no one wanted to see the big companies turn the Internet into the consolidated high-walled cable industry. So over two decades as the Internet grew up, the FCC made sure that it was protecting net neutrality principles. Republicans and Democrats agreed that some form of cop on the beat was needed to keep the companies in line and the Internet open. Until now. If Pai gets his way, we can all say goodbye to competitive apps and services, and the freedom to choose our own experiences online. Maybe you prefer Netflix content, but if AT&T’s own DirectTV content doesn’t count against your data cap, there’s ample reason to choose that instead. Instead of paying a flat price for access to use any app or service free of charge, companies could start bundling services into "social," "video," and so on. Maybe you prefer Twitter — but instead of a free download, you’ll have to buy access to it in a package with Facebook and Snapchat, to the tune of $4.99. This isn’t hypothetical. Countries without net neutrality already have these business models. Over the past year with the promise of zero accountability on the horizon, the cable ISPs have grown bolder about their plans to cable-ize the Internet. As recently as last week, Comcast, the largest cable-ISP in the country, quietly dropped its promise not to charge for Internet fast lanes . Once Pai goes through with his plan to gut net neutrality, there is little anyone can do right now to stop the cable-ization of the Internet.

Elite Daily Mark Wilson/Getty Images News/Getty Images Will Net Neutrality End? Here's What The Internet Looks Like In A Country Without It By Joseph Milord Nov 22 2017 Share Less than a month from now, on Dec. 14, the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) board of five commissioners will vote on a proposal from its chairman to repeal "Net Neutrality" rules that were put in place by the FCC itself under former President Barack Obama. Critics of the proposal drafted by FCC chairman and Republican Ajit Pai, argue that ending net neutrality would result in internet service providers (ISPs) — like Verizon and Comcast — being able to block or decrease the speed of certain sites. With there being a total of three Republican commissioners on the board of five, however, those critics won't likely make a difference, which means the question is not " will net neutrality end ," but more likely "when." Here's another question on critics' minds, though: What happens when there's no net neutrality ? On Tuesday, Nov. 21, one congressman gave an answer to that question, citing an example from another country. On Twitter, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), shared a tweet that read, "in Portugal, with no net neutrality, internet providers are starting to split the net into packages." Khanna represents a district in California that includes Silicon Valley, the tech capital of America that houses big name companies opposed to ending the Obama-era net neutrality rules. Those companies, like Facebook and Google, also argue that ending net neutrality would allow service providers discriminate against certain services. Khanna's tweet was accompanied with an image that showed how Portuguese telecommunications company MEO (which is akin to T-Mobile and Verizon) offers data to customers in bundles, like a cable company: According to Quartz, the bundles don't block access to other sites , but visiting sites or app's outside of the packages would ultimately cost more. Khanna wrote in another tweet , "the FCC is getting ready to overturn # NetNeutrality. If they succeed, ISPs will be able to split the net into packages. This means that you will no longer be able to pay one price to access any site you want." Those on the sides both for and against repealing net neutrality rules argue that their respective case is best for the little guy. "Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet," FCC Chairman Pai wrote in a statement announcing his proposal . "Instead, the FCC would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate." Pai has also argued that net neutrality rules would open up the field for competition, allowing smaller businesses to invest in providing internet in rural and poor areas, presumably with cheaper service packages. "We are disappointed that the proposal announced today by the FCC fails to maintain the strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone," Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, said in a statement, per the New York Times . "We will work with all stakeholders committed to this principle." Egan's comment points to what is, again, the worst-case-scenario fear for a future without net neutrality, even though ISP companies like Comcast say they will not block or discriminate against different sites, according to the Times . "We do not and will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content — and we will be transparent with our customers about these policies," the company said, per the Times. The New York Times on YouTube Still, those who fear the worst have little reason to trust the word of ISP companies which, as Quartz points out, are among the least trusted businesses in America . Regardless of whether companies do end up blocking or slowing sites, the political reality is that the fate of net neutrality rules staying or going can change on an administration-to-administration basis. In other words, just as easily as a Republican administration means the likely end of Obama-era net neutrality rules, a Democratic administration in the future, which could result in a Democratic chairman at the FCC, could mean the reversal of a net neutrality repeal, and so on.

Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times     The Federal Communications Commission voted Thursday to discard so-called net neutrality rules that prevented broadband providers from slowing sites or demanding payments from them for fast delivery. The decision opens the door for very different consumer experiences on the internet. The rules will go into effect in the coming weeks. Here is a guide to what will happen next: Is my Netflix going to start sputtering? Will my internet service bill go up? Consumers will probably not encounter immediate changes to their internet service. The biggest broadband companies, like Comcast and AT&T, have promised that consumers will not see a change in how they experience the web. And with such a big spotlight on them, the companies will probably be careful about changing service plans, partly to avoid angering customers and attracting lawmakers’ attention. Broadband companies are “likely to proceed cautiously pending final resolution of these legal challenges,” said John Beahn, a regulatory lawyer at Skadden, Arps, who does not have clients with interests in net neutrality. “They recognize the ultimate fate of the regulations is still far from certain at this point.” But significant changes could come over time. For instance, AT&T could decide to charge a company like Etsy or Netflix more to deliver traffic from the website’s servers around the internet. Internet service providers, many of which are also media companies, could create faster lanes of delivery for their own sites, which would make it harder for the content of their rivals to show up in front of consumers. In the past, some providers have even blocked sites, as when AT&T prevented Apple’s FaceTime service from working for some customers of its wireless networks in 2012.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Are there benefits for consumers? To be sure, there are programs that consumers may like. AT&T already offers its customers free streaming of DirecTV, which it owns. Other carriers like T-Mobile offer free streaming of apps like YouTube and Netflix, a practice known as “zero-rating,” which at one time was viewed as a potential net neutrality violation. More programs like that could come along. But it’s hard to see prices going down for internet service because of the end of net neutrality. Many economists say the only way prices could fall is through more competition in the broadband industry, which is now dominated by a handful of companies. What protections do consumers have? The net neutrality rules, passed in 2015 during the Obama administration, were intended to be a protective measure for consumers as more Americans migrated to the internet for communications. The regulations were also meant to make sure new and small companies, as well as media companies, could sell their goods and distribute information without restrictions from broadband companies. Ajit Pai, the current chairman of the F.C.C., said transparency would act as the primary measure against wrongdoing. The agency will require broadband companies to disclose if they are blocking or throttling or setting up fast lanes for certain traffic. Mr. Pai, a Republican nominated to the chairmanship by President Trump, said that the disclosure would give consumers full knowledge of what they would be getting into and that if they didn’t like the practices, they could switch providers.

The F.C.C. said the F.T.C.’s broad antitrust and consumer protection laws were best suited to stop any harmful business practices. The F.T.C. has to monitor nearly every sector of the economy and is most likely to go after alleged bad actors when they are brought forward in a complaint, a costly and time-consuming process. What have the internet service providers said? Comcast, AT&T and the major trade groups for broadband and cable providers say they don’t and will not block or throttle sites. They say they won’t engage in most forms of paid prioritization, the practice of charging sites more for faster delivery of streams and downloads. With legal challenges against the F.C.C. expected, many telecom experts say that the companies will largely to stick to those promises for at least the next year and that any changes to service will be subtle.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Is there any chance the 2015 rules will come back? The net neutrality debate has flared up multiple times over the last decade or so, ending in different places depending on the political party in power. Many Democrats on Capitol Hill have called for passing the Obama-era rules through legislation, instead of leaving the rule making in the hands of the F.C.C. Numerous Republicans have also suggested passing a law, though they generally argue for much lighter restrictions than the 2015 rules. Some Democratic lawmakers have also said they would overturn the F.C.C. action through a congressional review act, which would require a majority vote to abolish new agency rules. Given the Republican control in Washington, and the general gridlock in Washington, any sort of legislative resolution appears unlikely. Most certainly, there will be lawsuits, including by public interest groups such as Public Knowledge and the National Hispanic Media Coalition and by several state attorneys general, including those from New York and Pennsylvania. The suits are expected to be filed after the rules become official, which could be well into January or later. What are the potential legal arguments? Lawsuits will most likely claim, perhaps among other things, that the F.C.C. acted hastily and capriciously by abandoning the rules just two years after they were created. For instance, Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, has said the F.C.C. should have delayed its vote on the ground that the law enforcement office found many public comments on net neutrality were fraudulent. And what about the F.C.C.? What is its main legal defense? It will probably argue that rolling back rules essentially returns the regulatory environment to the way it was before 2015, when there was little evidence of consumer harm. The agency is also likely to argue that it followed all the necessary procedures for making a regulatory change. The plan to overturn net neutrality was first announced in April by Mr. Pai. In a news conference on Thursday, after he had won the vote to overturn the rules, Mr. Pai said he was prepared for the legal challenges, using a tone of defiance and some sarcasm. “I’m shocked, shocked, that people are going to challenge this decision in court,” he said.

Net neutrality is somewhat of a misnomer—a better descriptor is “content agnostic.” What net neutrality implies is that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the U.S.—cable companies and telcos like Comcast  (CMCSA) and Verizon  (VZ) —must treat all content equally, regardless of what it is or who owns it. For example, AT&T  (T) is not currently allowed to provide its subscribers faster access to DirecTV, which it owns, and slower access to Netflix  (NFLX) , which it does not own. The end of net neutrality would, in theory, allow ISPs to charge more/less for, or slow down/speed up, different types of content.      Removing net neutrality has generated a huge amount of media coverage in the U.S., mostly casting the debate in terms of an epic story of victims and villains.  The victims are American consumers and businesses. As certain content is priced out of reach, the story goes, the Internet will become less rich, small enterprises will suffer, public schools and universities will see their Internet connections slow to a crawl, the best minds will leave the country in frustration, and everyone will pay more for Spotify and Netflix.  The villains are the ISPs, long reviled for high prices, poor service, and aggressive retention tactics. The ISPs lobbied the government hard for this change, and stand to benefit the most at the expense of long-suffering subscribers. Networking and infrastructure companies are also likely to gain, as the rule change will require upgrades to networking hardware and software.    This is a gripping narrative, but how much of it is actually true? Will the end of net neutrality really make a big difference to the average Internet user? We think not.  First, it is worth pointing out that net neutrality rules are quite new—the law was only enacted in mid-2015—although the concept has been around since the 1990s. Prior to 2015, there was no net neutrality and, well, the Internet worked just fine for most people. Occasionally, an ISP was caught slowing down (throttling) certain sites, but public pressure or legal action tended to keep the ISP honest. There is little reason to believe that a future with no net neutrality regulation will be very different from the past.  Second, the issue with net neutrality is multi-speed Internet service, not web censorship. An ISP might be frustrated that Netflix consumes 35% of its bandwidth at peak hours, but it cannot legally block it, with or without net neutrality. Even with no net neutrality, the most that an ISP could do would be to slow down access to Netflix, and charge people for higher speeds. In reality, this is not likely to happen—the public backlash would be too severe. More likely, the ISPs would discriminate by offering their own preferred content faster and cheaper. Ironically, this is already happening under net neutrality regulation: AT&T, for example, offers DirecTV access as a “zero rating” product, i.e. it does not count toward data caps.      Third, the end of net neutrality rules will lead to a closer link between cost and consumption. While net neutrality may be conceptually appealing, it is not equitable. Is it fair that a few super-users are allowed to clog up networks by downloading movies, playing data-hungry online games, and not paying more for it? Why shouldn’t ISPs be allowed to price data according to volume, type, or speed?  Fourth, ISPs could use any extra revenue generated from high-bandwidth users to subsidize the cost to regular users or improve network infrastructure. If they start to charge more for content, then there will be a lot of pressure from subscribers and regulators to improve service levels in return.              Fifth, the practical difference for most subscribers will be minimal. Most ISPs already charge higher prices for higher speeds, or bundle less attractive services (like TV channels you never watch) with more attractive ones (faster Internet access). The only difference without net neutrality would be that slow speeds could affect some sites more than other sites.  Sixth, net neutrality, however intuitively appealing, is a form of government control. History has taught us that government control and intervention often inhibits progress and innovation. If ISPs are less regulated, one might imagine companies springing up that would provide better, faster, and cheaper service, thus promoting innovation.  Finally, ISPs are unlikely to make any quick moves to change the status quo. Legal challenges to the removal of net neutrality are likely, mid-term elections are coming in 2018, and public opinion of ISPs is already low. Most large ISPs have also pledged not to make any dramatic moves in the event that net neutrality is repealed.      Net neutrality is an attractive concept, and its removal might instinctively rub you the wrong way, but that doesn’t mean it should be kept in its current form. Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix , has stated that net neutrality is “not our primary battle at this point.” If he is not worried, why should the rest of us be?

Here’s what happens next.   The FCC voted in a 3-2 party-line vote to end net neutrality, despite overwhelming bipartisan support for it.  By  Aja Romano @ajaromano   Updated Dec 14, 2017,  5:52pm EST        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  Net neutrality is now officially on life support. Here’s what happens next.      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email             Video by Liz Scheltens and Mallory Brangan    The Federal Communications Commission has voted to repeal net neutrality , despite overwhelming public support for the regulation, which requires internet service providers like Verizon and Comcast to distribute internet access fairly and equally to everyone, regardless of how much  they pay or where they’re located.  Despite last-minute requests to delay the December 14 vote from some Republican members of Congress, it went through as scheduled, thanks to the support of a much longer list of Republicans who favored the repeal and urged the vote to be held without delay. As had been heavily predicted for months , the vote was split 3-2 along party lines, with the FCC chair Ajit Pai and the other Republican members Michael O’Rielly and Brendan Carr voting for repeal and Democratic commissioners Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel voting to protect it.  The vote to repeal came in spite of overwhelming bipartisan support for net neutrality from the public, as the FCC was clearly determined to move ahead with the repeal. Tensions were high during the hearing — and at one point, in the middle of Pai’s remarks, the room was evacuated for about 10 minutes due to an apparent security threat.    We are being evacuated by security during net neutrality vote at FCC — CeciliaKang (@ceciliakang) December 14, 2017     The implications of the repeal are vast and complicated. If it’s left unchallenged, it will almost certainly fundamentally change how people access and use the internet. But it could be a long time before we start to see the full effects of the FCC’s vote — and there’s even a ghost of a chance that the repeal might be overturned by the US Court of Appeals.  Here’s what you need to know about what could happen next.          Protesters at a 2015 net neutrality rally .  Media Action Grassroots Network    1) What was the FCC actually voting on?  The FCC voted on the Restoring Internet Freedom Order , which concerned the repeal of Title II protection for net neutrality.  Title II is a decades-old regulatory clause that explicitly classifies internet service providers (ISPs) as telecommunications companies, meaning they’re essentially classified as utilities and subject to the same regulations that other telecommunication companies — also classified as utilities — must abide by. That basic regulatory standard is what people are referring to when they talk about net neutrality. Title II was first applied to ISPs in 2015, after a hard-won fight by internet activists.  Placing ISPs under Title II was the only legal way — barring the unlikely introduction and passage  of Congressional legislation instituting complicated new regulatory procedures — in which these companies could be regulated. Now that the FCC has repealed Title II classification for ISPs, the ISPs will essentially be unregulated.  2) Why does it matter if ISPs are regulated or not?  Classifying ISPs as utility companies under Title II meant they had to treat the internet like every other utility — that is, just like gas, water, or phone service — and that they couldn’t cut off service at will or control how much of it any one person received based on how much that person paid for it. The idea was that the internet should be a public service that everyone has a right to use, not a privilege, and that regulating ISPs like utilities would prevent them from hijacking or monopolize that access.  The best argument for the rollback of this Title II protection is that maybe the internet isn’t a public service — maybe it’s just another product, and in a free market system, competition over who gets to sell you that product would ensure accountability and fair treatment among providers, if only due to economic self-interest .   Related  "Net neutrality is the secret sauce that has made the internet awesome"   But there’s a huge problem with that argument, which is that, as far as the internet is concerned, there really isn’t a free and open market . In the United States, competition among ISPs was driven down years ago thanks to the consolidated nature of internet broadband infrastructure, which has typically been owned by major corporations, shutting out local ISP competitors.  That’s why many people don’t really have much choice about which company they pay for internet access — that access has been monopolized by a handful of powerful companies. In fact, nearly 50 million households have only one high-speed ISP in their area.   Related  Net neutrality isn’t the only way to keep the internet fair. It’s just the only way in America.   In other words, these particular utility companies, now unregulated, have free reign to behave like the corporate monopolies they are. Where net neutrality ensured the preservation of what’s been dubbed “the open internet,” its repeal will open the door for ISPs to create “ an internet for the elite .”  3) What will happen to the internet without net neutrality protections in place?  Net neutrality mandated that ISPs display all websites, at the same speed, to all sources of internet traffic. Without net neutrality, all bets are off.  That means ISPs will be free to control what you access on the internet, meaning they will be able to block access to specific websites and pieces of software that interact with the internet.  They might charge you more or less money to access specific “bundles” of certain websites, much as cable television providers do now — but instead of “basic cable,” you might be forced to pay for access to more than a “basic” number of websites, as this popular pro-net neutrality graphic illustrates:          ISPs will also be able to control how quickly you’re served webpages, how quickly you can download and upload things, and in what contexts you can access which websites, depending on how much money you pay them.  They’ll be able to  charge you more to access sites you currently visit for free, cap how much data you’re allowed to use, redirect you from sites you are trying to use to sites they want you to use instead, and block you from being able to access apps, products, and information offered by their competitors or other companies they don’t like.  They can even block you from being able to access information on certain topics, news events, or issues they don’t want you to know about.  Finally, they’ll be able to exert this power not just over individual consumers, but over companies, as well. This could result in the much-discussed “ internet fast lane ” — in which an ISP forces a company like Twitter or BitTorrent to pay more for faster access for readers or users like you to its websites and services. Larger, more powerful companies likely won’t be hurt by this change. Smaller companies and websites almost definitely will be.  We already have a good idea of how these scenarios might play out, because in the era before net neutrality existed, ISPs tried instituting all of them: via jacked-up fees , forced redirection , content-blocking , software-blocking , website-blocking , competitor-blocking and still more competitor-blocking , app-blocking and still more app-blocking , data-capping , and censorship of controversial subjects .  If net neutrality advocates have made it seem like there’s simply no end to the worst-case scenarios that unregulated ISPs might subject us to, it’s because they’ve learned from experience. This history of ISP exploitation is a major reason that advocates for net neutrality fought so hard for it to begin with.  We also know that many ISPs, notably Comcast , already have their eyes on the aforementioned “fast lane,” also known as “paid prioritization.” (Disclaimer: Comcast is an investor in Vox’s parent company, Vox Media, through its NBC-Universal arm.)  And lest you believe that the current FCC is prepared to make sure that such offenses are fully sanctioned and dealt with by the government, think again. FCC chair Pai is a vocal proponent of letting ISPs self-regulate, and seems perfectly content to ignore their contentious and often predatory history.  Not only that, but the FCC is explicitly preventing state consumer protection laws from taking effect regarding net neutrality. That means that once the repeal is final, the rights of states to govern themselves won’t apply to protecting net neutrality. (Though California and Washington each vowed after the vote to try to protect it anyway.)  4) Who will be most affected by the repeal of net neutrality?  Women, minorities, rural communities, and internet developers will feel the fullest effects of this repeal.  The general argument among net neutrality advocates is that without an open internet, members of society who have historically been marginalized and silenced will be in danger of being further marginalized and silenced, or marginalized and silenced once more — particularly women and minorities .  We’ve seen in the past that ISPs can and will censor access to controversial subjects. Without regulation, situations could arise in which underprivileged or disenfranchised individuals and groups have less access to speak up or contact others online.  One worst-case scenario that we haven’t yet seen in America, but which is worth considering given the current heated political climate, is that ISPs could potentially play a role in limiting or marginalizing certain communities during times of urgency — for instance, an ISP might choose to block a mobilizing hashtag like #BlackLivesMatter at the start of an organic protest.  This might seem like a dire prediction, but there’s precedent for it: In 2011, the Egyptian government heavily censored certain websites during the Arab Spring. And in Turkey, under the administration of President Erdogan, the country has become notorious for censoring websites and blocking hashtags, at one point banning Twitter altogether .  Rural areas of the US — where internet access is already scarce due to a lack of ISPs operating there — will be further subjected to corporatization and monopolization of their internet infrastructure.  More than 10 million Americans already lack broadband access, and as the Hill notes in an overview of the potential impact of net neutrality’s repeal, “Good broadband is a small town’s lifeline out of geographic isolation, its connection to business software and services, and its conduit for exporting homegrown ideas and products.” Without regulatory inducements, corporate ISPs will have little incentive to develop infrastructure in such areas.  Another group that will be heavily impacted by net neutrality’s repeal — one that’s often overlooked but extremely crucial — is innovators and developers and people who create stuff for the internet. Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the internet as we know it, recently summed up the repeal’s potential effect on these developers:  If US net neutrality rules are repealed, future innovators will have to first negotiate with each ISP to get their new product onto an internet package. That means no more permissionless space for innovation. ISPs will have the power to decide which websites you can access and at what speed each will load. In other words, they’ll be able to decide which companies succeed online, which voices are heard  —  and which are silenced.  Again, this all sounds pretty dire — but that’s because it is. The people with the most expertise, the most investment in creating a progressive internet, and the strongest ability to advocate for an open internet could be prevented from doing their best work because of a lack of ability to pay for access to an ISP-controlled space.  It’s important to note, too, that because the nature of the repeal is unprecedented, we can’t necessarily predict every group and demographic that could potentially feel its impact.  5) Why did the FCC vote to repeal net neutrality when it had such overwhelming bipartisan support, and when the effects of a repeal seem so dire?  Pretty much everybody supports net neutrality — it’s one of the few bipartisan issues that most of Congress and most American citizens agree on. The glaring exceptions are the giant ISPs who are reigned in by the regulation.  Over the last nine years, Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T have collectively spent over half a billion dollars lobbying the FCC to end regulatory oversight, and especially to block or repeal net neutrality. They found a loyal friend in Pai, who was appointed to the FCC in 2012 by then President Barack Obama, and named chairman by President Donald Trump shortly after Trump took office  in January. Pai previously worked for Verizon and voted against the 2015 net neutrality ruling as a minority member of the FCC, calling it a “massive intrusion in the internet economy.”  So Pai has basically always supported the repeal of net neutrality , despite the overwhelming public support for it. He believes the 2015 ruling was frivolous and unnecessary , and has also argued, in opposition to hard evidence , that investment in the internet shrinks when net neutrality is in effect. With Trump’s full backing, he has made undoing it a priority.  In fact, even though Pai is legally required to seriously consider the voice of the public when he makes decisions, he has made it clear that he never truly intended to consider most of the millions of comments submitted in support of net neutrality through the FCC’s website since it began the repeal process in May. That’s because the vast majority of those comments were duplicates that came through automated third-party advocacy websites. While many of them were likely submitted by spambots using fake or stolen identities and emails to file comments, many more of them were likely submitted by people using the tried-and-true method of sending a form letter to the government to express their opinions. Pai also rejected the form letters out of hand: Once the number of duplicate comments came to light, the FCC declared that it would be rejecting all duplicated comments as well as “opinions” that came without “introducing new facts.”  Essentially, even though nearly 99 percent of the unique comments that the FCC received were pro-net neutrality and anti-repeal, and even though the entire point of a democratic process is to allow people to express their opinions, the FCC chose to dismiss pretty much every opinion that was expressed, because spambots and auto-duplicated opinions were involved. FCC commissioner Rosenworcel, one of the commission’s two minority Democrats, acknowledged this during the December 14 vote to repeal, noting "the cavalier disregard this agency has demonstrated to the public.”  As Dell Cameron at Gizmodo put it , “To be clear, when the FCC says that it is ‘restoring internet freedom,’ it is not talking about your freedom or the freedom of consumers.”  6) What happens now, in the immediate aftermath of the vote?  A flurry of lawsuits from tech companies, internet activists, and think tanks will likely descend upon Washington — starting with a protective filing by internet activists that will appeal the FCC’s vote to prevent the repeal from immediately taking effect.  Mere hours after the FCC vote, the Attorney General of the state of New York announced a multi-state appeal of the ruling , to which a number of other states quickly signed on. The exact number of states participating in the appeal will grow over the coming weeks — technically after a suit is announced, the states (as well as any latecomers to any other lawsuits filed) will have 60 days to join in before the suit closes.  These lawsuits will petition the US Court of Appeals for a review of the FCC’s order. After a filing period of 10 days, all of the lawsuits will eventually be punted collectively to one of the Court of Appeals’ 12 circuit courts, and the ultimate outcome will be largely dependent on which court hears the appeals.  If the repeal does eventually go into effect, the FCC will institute one very thin piece of ISP regulation in place of net neutrality — a version of a 2010 transparency ruling that requires ISPs to inform consumers when the ISPs are deliberately slowing their internet speed. The FCC will be passing off the enforcement of this transparency stipulation to the FTC, in a long-planned and recently formalized agreement that will allow the two commissions “to work together to take targeted action against bad actors.”  7) When will the repeal go into effect?  We simply can’t know at this point. Establishing a workable timeline will depend on a whole heap of factors , such as which circuit court ends up hearing the appeals, whether there is a motion to relocate the appeals to another court, any motions or counter-motions filed on the appeals, and so forth. There’s also the likelihood that net neutrality advocates will ask for stays of the FCC’s ruling so that it can’t take effect while motions are still being heard and appeals are being deliberated.  Additionally, there’s one alternative to the appeals process that’s definitely a longshot, yet still a possibility: Congress could move to pass a joint resolution overturning the repeal and establishing new regulatory oversight. However, given how firmly many Republican politicians have stood behind Pai’s repeal campaign, this seems highly unlikely to happen unless the 2018 midterm elections result in a major upheaval of Congress, and could take years to hash out.  In a nutshell, we don’t know how long will it take to fight the repeal in the court system, so we can’t know when — or if — it will take effect. It’s likely that even if a court overturns the FCC’s decision, that court may only overturn part of it and not the entire thing.  What the final version of a net neutrality repeal might look like, and when it might take effect, are both unknown at this point, with the future of an open internet hanging in the balance.

Congress Will Pay the Price Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg/Getty Images FCC chair Ajit Pai’s plan to repeal net neutrality provisions and reclassify broadband providers from “common carriers” to “information services” is an unprecedented giveaway to big broadband providers and a danger to the internet. The move would mean the FCC would have almost no oversight authority over broadband providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T. WIRED OPINION ABOUT Ryan Singel ( @rsingel ) is media and strategy fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School and the CEO/cofounder of Contextly. For years, those broadband providers have used lawsuits and agency filings to fight FCC oversight and overturn its authority to prevent net neutrality abuses. But never in those companies’ most feverish dreams did they expect an FCC chair would propose to demolish all net neutrality protections and allow ISPs to extract tolls from every business in the country. Even industry analysts who expected the reclassification of broadband providers from Title II common carriers to Title I information services were stunned. Following Pai’s announcement, independent cable analyst Craig Moffett sent out an email to investors entitled "Shock and Awe and Net Neutrality," writing , “We've known since the election that the FCC would reverse Title II. But we never expected this . Yesterday’s FCC Draft Order on Net Neutrality went much further than we ever could've imagined in not only reversing Title II, but in dismantling virtually all of the important tenets of net neutrality itself.” If Congress allows Pai’s plan to pass, all that will be left of FCC oversight of broadband providers is a weak disclosure requirement: If Verizon, for example, wants to block content, charge sites to be viewable on its network, or create paid fast lanes, the company will simply have to tell its subscribers in their contract’s fine print. (Broadband providers won’t have to disclose, and the FCC won’t have control over, the sneakier ways they’ve found to mess with the internet.) Enforcement will be left to the Federal Trade Commission, an agency that’s never enforced open internet rules and has no ability to formulate its own. The FTC won’t even be able to protect consumers against most net neutrality violations after the fact, and nor will it be able to protect consumers against greedy broadband providers. And violations will come if Pai’s plan passes. AT&T's Ed Whitacre summarized broadband providers’ true motivations best back in 2005 : “Why should they be allowed to use my pipes?" he said. "The internet can't be free in that sense, because we and the cable companies have made an investment and for a Google or Yahoo or Vonage or anybody to expect to use these pipes free is nuts.” Verizon echoed that sentiment in 2013 when it sued to challenge the 2010 open internet rules. It told a federal court that as an “information service” it had the right to charge online services like Yelp access fees simply to work on its network and should be able block those sites from Verizon subscribers if Yelp didn’t pay. (Verizon won that case, leading to the 2015 order and the reclassification of broadband providers as “common carriers.”) The 2015 order, replacing the one Verizon had overturned, recognized this as a threat and prohibited ISPs from charging sites and services simply to reach their users. Pai, a former Verizon lawyer, thinks this would be innovative. Now his plan would usher in a radical upending of how the internet has worked in the US since its inception. Every website could have to pay more to simply be online; prices for online services would likely rise as companies start to pay broadband providers to be in fast lanes, while broadband providers would find even sneakier ways to enact tolls on the internet, free of any agency able to set rules to stop them. MORE ON NET NEUTRALITY Klint Finley How to Make Sense of Net Neutrality and Telecom Under Trump Issie Lapowsky Bogus Emails and Bee Movie : Digging Into the FCC's Broken Net Neutrality Comments Susan Crawford Ajit Pai's Shell Game Startups and their potential investors would no longer have certainty that they could compete against incumbents, as they would need lots of money simply to pay each broadband provider for access or to escape the slow lane. Today, small and medium-size businesses rely on a myriad online business services for internal communications, sales, and accounting, to name just a few. Slack, Dropbox, Gusto, Quickbooks, and thousands more would have to pay access charges and fast-lane fees, costs they would likely have to pass to their customers. Non-mainstream media news sources across the political spectrum would no longer be able to afford to compete in the marketplace of ideas. Even churches that now reach their members online with streaming sermons, video libraries, and online video chats, would no longer be protected from blocking or access fees. Americans understand this and are rightly freaking out. Since the order was released, they’ve flooded Congress with more than half a million calls, and that’s only counting calls placed through the site BattleForTheNet.com. The citizen outrage crosses party lines; net neutrality is more popular than both parties combined . A poll this summer found that 77 percent of Americans support the current protections, including 73 percent of Republicans. This is not surprising. History has shown that internet freedom is the new third rail of US politics. In 2012, a bipartisan majority of Congress was dead set on passing SOPA , a law ostensibly intended to stop online copyright infringement but which would have threatened huge swaths of the internet. All conventional wisdom said it was a done deal. Then, freedom-loving people of the internet melted representatives' phone lines after a day of online action in January 2012. Even SOPA’s biggest supporters had to concede the internet killed SOPA. When online bots poisoned the net neutrality comment period, FCC chair Ajit Pai shrugged it off. In 2014, when the FCC set out to replace the struck-down 2010 net neutrality protections, conventional D.C. wisdom suggested that preserving net neutrality by designating broadband companies as common carriers was politically impossible. But millions of Americans proved otherwise. When TV host John Oliver pleaded with viewers to contact the FCC in support of net neutrality, they responded at such volume that the agency’s website crashed. That resulted in a win: limited but well-defined FCC net neutrality rules which, for the first time in FCC history, survived court challenges. Then in March, Congressional Republicans used a little-known legislative tool to repeal FCC rules that required broadband providers to get permission to track their subscribers’ every moves online for advertising purposes. That vote blew up in their faces when Republicans came back to their districts and held town hall meetings, where the politicians’ arguments that they voted to strike down the rule because it didn’t apply to online companies like Google did little to appease voter anger. That’s already likely to be an issue in the 2018 midterms. So far senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) is the only Republican member of Congress who has explicitly criticized Pai’s plan and has come out on the side of the internet. As the appointed head of an independent agency, Pai is technically free to ignore the American public. He’s done just that, saying that he doesn’t care about public sentiment. Pai did nothing when online bots poisoned the net neutrality comment period and posted anti net neutrality submissions using Americans’ names without their permission or knowledge. Instead of taking this corruption of a democratic process seriously, Pai shrugged it off . And while the FCC held multiple public hearings with participation from experts during previous net neutrality actions in 2008, 2010, and 2015, this time around Pai didn’t hold a single one. Voters know Republicans in Congress are the only ones who can stop Pai, and they should keep calling . If enough Republicans tell Pai to stop, he will likely back down. After all, congressional pressure has stopped the FCC before. Members of Congress face a choice: They can side with their constituents, who overwhelmingly want them to defend the greatest communication and innovation platform ever invented, or support one of the most blatant anticonsumer corporate giveaways in modern history. Some lawmakers believe the current FCC protections are the right solution, and others think that Congress should step in with a legislative solution to settle the matter once and for all. But all should agree that Pai’s plan to repeal the protections without a replacement is reckless and unnecessary. There’s no crisis Pai needs to save us from. The only crisis looming is the one that Pai’s plan will create for entrepreneurs, free markets, free speech, and for Republican members of Congress running for reelection who didn’t make the choice to stop Pai when they had the chance.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.            Tweet This     after today's announcement, I think with almost full certainty you can say goodbye to FCC's net neutrality rules.            Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), speaks during an open meeting in Washington, D.C. on Thursday, Nov. 16, 2017. On Tuesday, he announced the proposal to rollback net neutrality rules will be voted on December 14. (Photo: Zach Gibson/Bloomberg      In a short announcement , the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revealed on Tuesday that the proposal "Restoring Internet Freedom Order" was circulated that morning to all the Commissioners for vote on December 14. Ajit Pai, FCC chairman, also announced the proposal will be shared on Wednesday with the public.  This announcement is no surprise , because Ajit Pai for a long time has advocated a light touch approach to regulating Internet Service Providers (ISPs) including telcos (e.g., Verizon, AT&T) and broadband providers (e.g., Comcast, Charter). This is in contrast to the rules implemented by the FCC in the Obama era, which regulated ISPs as utilities. Pai has argued that this heavy-hand regulation is not good for consumers because it discourages ISPs from investing in infrastructure to expand the footprint of broadband internet service, and that it discourages innovation to improve broadband technologies.  Based on Pai's openness about his position, back in March consulting firm Red Chalk Group and I predicted that within one year the net neutrality rules would be rolled back fully (60% probability) or partially (30% probability). The full rollback means the rules are scrapped in their totality, while the partial rollback takes away the classification of ISPs as utilities or "common carriers," but so-called brightline rules would remain that prohibit ISPs from blocking or slowing down legal content, or from prioritizing content from certain content providers for a fee.    We will know the extent of the rollback on Wednesday, when the proposal is revealed, but a full rollback is imminent because Tuesday's announcement states "the FCC would simply require Internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate." Pai then adds, "Notably, my proposal will put the federal government’s most experienced privacy cop, the FTC, back on the beat to protect consumers’ online privacy." This means there will likely be no rules left for the FCC to enforce.  Either way, it is not hard to guess the outcome on the December vote, because three of the five commissioners advocate the rollback. So in a nutshell, expect a full rollback of the net neutrality rules by December 14.   There is a silver lining to those who fear it's the end of a neutral internet. The internet was pretty neutral before net neutrality rules were implemented in 2015. Also, in our March predictions , there are two stages. The first one is  the rollback of the net neutrality rules, which officially starts now that there is a proposal. On a second stage, light touch rules could be enacted by Congress that for example make the brightline rules permanent, because after all, nobody benefits from a wild, wild west when it comes to internet access. We will see on that, but  after today's announcement, I think with almost full certainty you can say goodbye to FCC's net neutrality rules.

The future of how the internet is regulated is about to change            by Seth Fiegerman   @sfiegerman   December 13, 2017: 2:44 PM ET                      Stolen identities, deceased weigh in on net neutrality       The future of how the internet is regulated may be decided this week.  The Republican-led Federal Communications Commission is scheduled to vote Thursday on a controversial plan to repeal Obama-era net neutrality protections. The repeal is expected to pass on a party-line vote.    The rules, approved by the FCC in 2015, were intended to keep the internet open and fair. Internet service providers like Comcast  ( CCVCL ) and Verizon  ( VZ ) were explicitly prohibited from speeding up or slowing down traffic from specific websites and apps.  Under the new proposal, the FCC would do away with rules barring internet providers from blocking or slowing down access to online content. The FCC would also eliminate a rule barring providers from prioritizing their own content.  Ajit Pai, the chairman appointed to run the FCC by President Trump, has been an longtime critic of the net neutrality rules. Last month, he pitched his repeal proposal as a way stop the federal government from "micromanaging the internet."   Pai's plan has been praised by the telecom industry, which argues the earlier regulation was a drag on broadband investment and innovation. But the repeal plan has been loudly criticized by numerous technology companies and consumer advocacy groups.  The concern among net neutrality advocates is that the repeal could give internet providers too much control over how online content is delivered. It may also make it harder for the next generation of online services to compete, if they have to pay up to be placed in a so-called internet fast lane.   Related: Trump's FCC moves quickly to upend internet, media rules    Twitter  ( TWTR ) , Reddit, Kickstarter and other websites posted messages on their sites this week ahead of the vote in support of net neutrality. Protesters mobilized in front of Verizon stores around the country. And some of the creators of the internet penned a letter calling on the FCC to cancel the vote.  On Tuesday, three dozen Democratic Senators made a last-minute plea for Pai to abandon what they called a "reckless plan."  "Your plan gives a broadband provider the ability to significantly alter their subscribers' internet experience," the lawmakers wrote in a letter to Pai . "Once adopted, this proposal will permit that provider to freely block, slow down or manipulate a consumer's access to the internet as long as it discloses those practices."  Even some members of Pai's own party have called on him to rethink his plan. Rep. Mike Coffman, a Republican from Colorado, asked Pai this week to delay the vote and give Congress a chance to weigh in on the issue.     The repeal vote comes more than six months after the FCC kicked off the lengthy process to roll back the net neutrality protections. It received millions of comments during a review period, with the majority supporting the current protections.  There has also been mounting scrutiny in recent weeks over rampant fraudulent comments submitted during the review period. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said last month the FCC had been uncooperative in his office's investigation into the comments.  "The FCC has failed the public," Jessica Rosenworcel, one of two Democratic commissioners at the FCC, wrote on Twitter Wednesday. "The public record it's using to justify the roll back of #NetNeutrality is a corrupted mess and the agency isn't doing anything about it. That's not right."   Related: Trump administration sends mixed messages on big media   Pai hasn't been shy in pushing back at the criticisms. In a speech late last month, Pai suggested that tech companies like Facebook  ( FB ) and Google  ( GOOGL ) are a "bigger actual threat to an open Internet" because they can censor content. He accused Twitter in particular of silencing conservatives.  In the same speech, Pai also went after like musician Cher and actors George Takei, Mark Ruffalo and Alyssa Milano by name for criticizing his proposal to repeal net neutrality.  The net neutrality repeal is just one part of the Pai's deregulatory agenda. Under Pai, the FCC has moved to allow for greater media consolidation and endorsed Congress's move to repeal internet privacy protections earlier this year.  Assuming the FCC votes to repeal net neutrality on Thursday, the issue may end up heading to court next.  "Whenever we do anything big and major, people go to court," a senior FCC official said last month. "I certainly would not rule that out."

By Alasdair Wilkins on November 28, 2017 Filed Under Politics Net neutrality is on life support at the FCC, and in two weeks, it’s expected that the Republican-controlled commission will vote to remove the consumer protections. The proposal circulated before Thanksgiving to end net neutrality goes to a vote when the FCC meets on December 14, with the vote expected to go 3-2 along party lines to approval his new rules. After years of debate, uncertainty, and reversals, that vote in two weeks means the end of net neutrality’s story at the FCC. But that doesn’t mean telecommunications companies like Comcast and AT&T will immediately be able to roll out tiered internet plans and start throttling site speeds. In all likelihood, the next stop for net neutrality will be the courts — and Pai figures to face an uphill battle to get judges to agree with his new rules.telecommunications companies like Comcast and AT&T will immediately be able to roll out tiered internet plans and start throttling site speeds. In all likelihood, the next stop for net neutrality will be the courts — and Pai figures to face an uphill battle to get judges to agree with his new rules. There’s a very simple reason for that: Federal agencies like the FCC can’t change existing rules just because they want to. The fact that a Trump appointee like Pai disagrees philosophically with the Obama-era FCC’s position on net neutrality isn’t in and of itself justification to change the rules. Pai and the FCC have to make a fact-based argument to do away with net neutrality. If they can’t do that, even a court full of Republican judicial appointees would be compelled to strike down the FCC’s decision and preserve net neutrality. Article continues below The revolution will not be televised. It'll be sent to your inbox by us. Sign up for our newsletter: sign up You can find Pai’s rationale right at the top of the text he circulated ahead of the December 14 meeting: “In 2015, the Commission imposed heavy-handed, utility-style regulation on Internet service providers (ISPs),” he writes. “Since then, broadband investment has fallen for two years in a row — the first time that that’s happened outside a recession in the Internet era. And new services have been delayed or scuttled by a regulatory environment that stifles innovation.” Those are Pai’s key facts. Never mind any of the facts that weight against that — like the overwhelming public support for net neutrality or the fact that ISPs don’t actually create almost any of the content they send, which makes the FCC’s 2015 reclassification of telecoms from “information providers” to “common carriers” seem pretty intuitive. Those don’t even need to matter. If Pai’s own stated facts aren’t supportable, then there’s no legal basis for the end of net neutrality. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai Pai has been making his arguments about reduced investment and innovation for a while now, and outside observers have repeatedly countered that his numbers don’t add up. No, seriously, a report this May from the Free Press Action Network was literally titled “Sorry, Chairman Pai: Your Investment Numbers Don’t Add Up.” By any metric — and the report stresses Pai’s preferred metric of total industry investment is actually one of the least precise ways to judge this, but even by that metric — spending has gone up since the 2015 decision. “Altogether, publicly traded ISPs spent approximately 5 percent more on capital investment during the two years after the FCC’s decision than they did in the two years prior. Far from declining or flatlining, aggregate industry investment has been growing,” the report finds. “Total capital spending across the three survey categories of broadband providers was $87.184 billion — more than $553 million higher than it was in 2014.” Is that simple refutation of Pai’s argument the entire ballgame? Maybe not. The FCC has its own figures — which net neutrality advocates have persuasively argued are disingenuous — and it will have lawyers to defend the validity of those numbers in court. The legal battle would likely prove protracted. Lasting clear until, say, January 2021, when it’s possible there will be a new president and, with that, a new FCC chairman. We run into this kind of story most often with the Environmental Protection Agency. Any new rule the agency puts forth — whether more pro-environment in the case of Democratic administrations, or more pro-industry in the case of Republican ones — faces months or even years of legal challenges from anyone with a stake. And in the case of net neutrality and FCC, everyone who uses the internet, plus giant companies like Amazon and Google that have every reason to stand against Pai’s proposal, would have a stake in keeping net neutrality tied up in the courts for as along as possible. The FCC figures to make net neutrality that much more vulnerable after its expected vote on December 14. That’s the end of the battle. It’s likely just the beginning of the war.

You can probably think of at least one experience that had you pulling your hair out. In fact, from year to year, cable companies consistently rank at the very bottom of the American Consumer Satisfaction Index. But if you think things are bad, they’re about to get much worse under the Federal Communications Commission’s plan to turn control of the Internet over to your cable and Internet provider. The Internet as we have always known it is an open platform for content, speech and information. Now the FCC is set to vote Thursday on a proposal by Republican Chairman Ajit Pai to obliterate the rules that keep it that way — and in their place, he offers almost nothing. He’ll wrest control of the Internet from the American people and hand it over to existing Internet service providers (ISPs) like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon, empowering them to generate new profits by restricting access. More: Wozniak & Copps: Ending net neutrality will end the Internet as we know it More: Protect net neutrality and Internet freedom: World Wide Web inventor Under Pai’s plan, ISPs can charge web companies for “fast lanes,” holding those who can pay ransom for better service and leaving little guys who can’t pay in the dust. Meanwhile, none of that money will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower rates. If anything, your rates are likely to increase. If this sounds familiar, it should. It’s exactly what happened to the cable industry years ago, and it’s why you probably hate your cable company. Once upon a time, cable was seen as the insurgent ‘outlaw’ of the 1960’s media scene . The new medium challenged the ironclad control broadcast radio and TV networks had over content and introduced unprecedented competition and choice. But gradually, the old industry incumbents wrested control back, and soon it became the monolithic industry we think of today. Fast forward 20 years, traditional cable companies were the main arbiters of information and entertainment, determining the majority of what consumers got to see in their curated channel line-ups. This created the consolidated market power that meant high prices and relatively few choices we know it as today. Then the Internet came along and broke this business model wide open. Suddenly, viewers at home saw an explosion of creative new content and voted with their clicks, not their wallets. Essential to the Internet’s growth was net neutrality: All (legal) traffic flowed at the same speed over the network, regardless of ownership or content. Cable companies panicked at this threat to their business, so they monopolized on Internet connectivity themselves. If you own the pipes and control the speed for content produced by both you and your competitors, you can simply slow transmission for their content or make them pay more for faster access. More: FCC chairman: Strict regulations stifle competition POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Fortunately, no one wanted to see the big companies turn the Internet into the consolidated high-walled cable industry. So over two decades as the Internet grew up, the FCC made sure that it was protecting net neutrality principles. Republicans and Democrats agreed that some form of cop on the beat was needed to keep the companies in line and the Internet open. Until now. If Pai gets his way, we can all say goodbye to competitive apps and services, and the freedom to choose our own experiences online. Maybe you prefer Netflix content, but if AT&T’s own DirectTV content doesn’t count against your data cap, there’s ample reason to choose that instead. Instead of paying a flat price for access to use any app or service free of charge, companies could start bundling services into "social," "video," and so on. Maybe you prefer Twitter — but instead of a free download, you’ll have to buy access to it in a package with Facebook and Snapchat, to the tune of $4.99. This isn’t hypothetical. Countries without net neutrality already have these business models. Over the past year with the promise of zero accountability on the horizon, the cable ISPs have grown bolder about their plans to cable-ize the Internet. As recently as last week, Comcast, the largest cable-ISP in the country, quietly dropped its promise not to charge for Internet fast lanes . Once Pai goes through with his plan to gut net neutrality, there is little anyone can do right now to stop the cable-ization of the Internet. And soon we’ll all be sighing: "Once upon a time, the Internet was seen as the insurgent 'outlaw' of 21st century media…" Rep. Anna G.

Elite Daily Mark Wilson/Getty Images News/Getty Images Will Net Neutrality End? Here's What The Internet Looks Like In A Country Without It By Joseph Milord Nov 22 2017 Share Less than a month from now, on Dec. 14, the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) board of five commissioners will vote on a proposal from its chairman to repeal "Net Neutrality" rules that were put in place by the FCC itself under former President Barack Obama. Critics of the proposal drafted by FCC chairman and Republican Ajit Pai, argue that ending net neutrality would result in internet service providers (ISPs) — like Verizon and Comcast — being able to block or decrease the speed of certain sites. With there being a total of three Republican commissioners on the board of five, however, those critics won't likely make a difference, which means the question is not " will net neutrality end ," but more likely "when." Here's another question on critics' minds, though: What happens when there's no net neutrality ? On Tuesday, Nov. 21, one congressman gave an answer to that question, citing an example from another country. On Twitter, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), shared a tweet that read, "in Portugal, with no net neutrality, internet providers are starting to split the net into packages." Khanna represents a district in California that includes Silicon Valley, the tech capital of America that houses big name companies opposed to ending the Obama-era net neutrality rules. Those companies, like Facebook and Google, also argue that ending net neutrality would allow service providers discriminate against certain services. Khanna's tweet was accompanied with an image that showed how Portuguese telecommunications company MEO (which is akin to T-Mobile and Verizon) offers data to customers in bundles, like a cable company: According to Quartz, the bundles don't block access to other sites , but visiting sites or app's outside of the packages would ultimately cost more. Khanna wrote in another tweet , "the FCC is getting ready to overturn # NetNeutrality. If they succeed, ISPs will be able to split the net into packages. This means that you will no longer be able to pay one price to access any site you want." Those on the sides both for and against repealing net neutrality rules argue that their respective case is best for the little guy. "Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the internet," FCC Chairman Pai wrote in a statement announcing his proposal . "Instead, the FCC would simply require internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate." Pai has also argued that net neutrality rules would open up the field for competition, allowing smaller businesses to invest in providing internet in rural and poor areas, presumably with cheaper service packages. "We are disappointed that the proposal announced today by the FCC fails to maintain the strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone," Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, said in a statement, per the New York Times . "We will work with all stakeholders committed to this principle." Egan's comment points to what is, again, the worst-case-scenario fear for a future without net neutrality, even though ISP companies like Comcast say they will not block or discriminate against different sites, according to the Times . "We do not and will not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content — and we will be transparent with our customers about these policies," the company said, per the Times. The New York Times on YouTube Still, those who fear the worst have little reason to trust the word of ISP companies which, as Quartz points out, are among the least trusted businesses in America . Regardless of whether companies do end up blocking or slowing sites, the political reality is that the fate of net neutrality rules staying or going can change on an administration-to-administration basis. In other words, just as easily as a Republican administration means the likely end of Obama-era net neutrality rules, a Democratic administration in the future, which could result in a Democratic chairman at the FCC, could mean the reversal of a net neutrality repeal, and so on.

Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times     The Federal Communications Commission voted Thursday to discard so-called net neutrality rules that prevented broadband providers from slowing sites or demanding payments from them for fast delivery. The decision opens the door for very different consumer experiences on the internet. The rules will go into effect in the coming weeks. Here is a guide to what will happen next: Is my Netflix going to start sputtering? Will my internet service bill go up? Consumers will probably not encounter immediate changes to their internet service. The biggest broadband companies, like Comcast and AT&T, have promised that consumers will not see a change in how they experience the web. And with such a big spotlight on them, the companies will probably be careful about changing service plans, partly to avoid angering customers and attracting lawmakers’ attention. Broadband companies are “likely to proceed cautiously pending final resolution of these legal challenges,” said John Beahn, a regulatory lawyer at Skadden, Arps, who does not have clients with interests in net neutrality. “They recognize the ultimate fate of the regulations is still far from certain at this point.” But significant changes could come over time. For instance, AT&T could decide to charge a company like Etsy or Netflix more to deliver traffic from the website’s servers around the internet. Internet service providers, many of which are also media companies, could create faster lanes of delivery for their own sites, which would make it harder for the content of their rivals to show up in front of consumers. In the past, some providers have even blocked sites, as when AT&T prevented Apple’s FaceTime service from working for some customers of its wireless networks in 2012.

Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       Are there benefits for consumers? To be sure, there are programs that consumers may like. AT&T already offers its customers free streaming of DirecTV, which it owns. Other carriers like T-Mobile offer free streaming of apps like YouTube and Netflix, a practice known as “zero-rating,” which at one time was viewed as a potential net neutrality violation. More programs like that could come along. But it’s hard to see prices going down for internet service because of the end of net neutrality. Many economists say the only way prices could fall is through more competition in the broadband industry, which is now dominated by a handful of companies. What protections do consumers have? The net neutrality rules, passed in 2015 during the Obama administration, were intended to be a protective measure for consumers as more Americans migrated to the internet for communications. The regulations were also meant to make sure new and small companies, as well as media companies, could sell their goods and distribute information without restrictions from broadband companies. Ajit Pai, the current chairman of the F.C.C., said transparency would act as the primary measure against wrongdoing. The agency will require broadband companies to disclose if they are blocking or throttling or setting up fast lanes for certain traffic. Mr. Pai, a Republican nominated to the chairmanship by President Trump, said that the disclosure would give consumers full knowledge of what they would be getting into and that if they didn’t like the practices, they could switch providers.

Privacy Policy  Opt out or contact us anytime      As part of the changes approved on Thursday, the F.C.C. handed oversight duties for the broadband carriers to the Federal Trade Commission. The F.C.C. said the F.T.C.’s broad antitrust and consumer protection laws were best suited to stop any harmful business practices. The F.T.C. has to monitor nearly every sector of the economy and is most likely to go after alleged bad actors when they are brought forward in a complaint, a costly and time-consuming process. What have the internet service providers said? Comcast, AT&T and the major trade groups for broadband and cable providers say they don’t and will not block or throttle sites. They say they won’t engage in most forms of paid prioritization, the practice of charging sites more for faster delivery of streams and downloads. With legal challenges against the F.C.C. expected, many telecom experts say that the companies will largely to stick to those promises for at least the next year and that any changes to service will be subtle.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Is there any chance the 2015 rules will come back? The net neutrality debate has flared up multiple times over the last decade or so, ending in different places depending on the political party in power. Many Democrats on Capitol Hill have called for passing the Obama-era rules through legislation, instead of leaving the rule making in the hands of the F.C.C. Numerous Republicans have also suggested passing a law, though they generally argue for much lighter restrictions than the 2015 rules. Some Democratic lawmakers have also said they would overturn the F.C.C. action through a congressional review act, which would require a majority vote to abolish new agency rules. Given the Republican control in Washington, and the general gridlock in Washington, any sort of legislative resolution appears unlikely. Most certainly, there will be lawsuits, including by public interest groups such as Public Knowledge and the National Hispanic Media Coalition and by several state attorneys general, including those from New York and Pennsylvania. The suits are expected to be filed after the rules become official, which could be well into January or later. What are the potential legal arguments? Lawsuits will most likely claim, perhaps among other things, that the F.C.C. acted hastily and capriciously by abandoning the rules just two years after they were created. For instance, Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, has said the F.C.C. should have delayed its vote on the ground that the law enforcement office found many public comments on net neutrality were fraudulent. And what about the F.C.C.? What is its main legal defense? It will probably argue that rolling back rules essentially returns the regulatory environment to the way it was before 2015, when there was little evidence of consumer harm. The agency is also likely to argue that it followed all the necessary procedures for making a regulatory change. The plan to overturn net neutrality was first announced in April by Mr. Pai. In a news conference on Thursday, after he had won the vote to overturn the rules, Mr. Pai said he was prepared for the legal challenges, using a tone of defiance and some sarcasm. “I’m shocked, shocked, that people are going to challenge this decision in court,” he said.
