Video:  Standard Normal Distribution (4:12)  Finding Probabilities for a Normal Random Variable  LO 6.17: Find probabilities associated with a specified normal distribution.  As we saw, the Standard Deviation Rule is very limited in helping us answer probability questions, and basically limited to questions involving values that fall exactly 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations away from the mean. How do we answer probability questions in general? The key is the position of the value relative to the mean, measured in standard deviations.  We can approach the answering of probability questions two possible ways: a table and technology. In the next sections, you will learn how to use the “standard normal table,” and then how the same calculations can be done with technology.  Standardizing Values  The first step to assessing a probability associated with a normal value is to determine the relative value with respect to all the other values taken by that normal variable. This is accomplished by determining how many standard deviations below or above the mean that value is.   EXAMPLE: Foot Length  How many standard deviations below or above the mean male foot length is 13 inches? Since the mean is 11 inches, 13 inches is 2 inches above the mean.   Since a standard deviation is 1.5 inches, this would be 2 / 1.5 = 1.33 standard deviations above the mean. Combining these two steps, we could write:  (13 in. – 11 in.) / (1.5 inches per standard deviation) = (13 – 11) / 1.5 standard deviations = +1.33 standard deviations.    In the language of statistics, we have just found the z-score for a male foot length of 13 inches to be z = +1.33. Or, to put it another way, we have standardized the value of 13.   In general, the standardized value z tells how many standard deviations below or above the mean the original value is, and is calculated as follows:  z-score = (value – mean)/standard deviation  The convention is to denote a value of our normal random variable X with the letter “x.”    Notice that since the standard deviation (sigma, σ) is always positive, for values of x above the mean (mu, μ), z will be positive; for values of x below the mean (mu, μ), z will be negative.  Let’s go back to our foot length example, and answer some more questions.   EXAMPLE: Foot Length  (a) What is the standardized value for a male foot length of 8.5 inches? How does this foot length relate to the mean?  z = (8.5 – 11) / 1.5 = -1.67. This foot length is 1.67 standard deviations below the mean.  (b) A man’s standardized foot length is +2.5. What is his actual foot length in inches?  If z = +2.5, then his foot length is 2.5 standard deviations above the mean. Since the mean is 11, and each standard deviation is 1.5, we get that the man’s foot length is: 11 + 2.5(1.5) = 14.75 inches.   Note that z-scores also allow us to compare values of different normal random variables. Here is an example:  (c) In general, women’s foot length is shorter than men’s. Assume that women’s foot length follows a normal distribution with a mean of 9.5 inches and standard deviation of 1.2. Ross’ foot length is 13.25 inches, and Candace’s foot length is only 11.6 inches. Which of the two has a longer foot relative to his or her gender group?  To answer this question, let’s find the z-score of each of these two normal values, bearing in mind that each of the values comes from a different normal distribution.  Ross: z-score = (13.25 – 11) / 1.5 = 1.5 (Ross’ foot length is 1.5 standard deviations above the mean foot length for men).  Candace: z-score = (11.6 – 9.5) / 1.2 = 1.75 (Candace’s foot length is 1.75 standard deviations above the mean foot length for women).  Note that even though Ross’ foot is longer than Candace’s, Candace’s foot is longer relative to their respective genders.   Comment:   Part (c) above illustrates how z-scores become crucial when you want to compare distributions .    Did I Get This?: Standardized Scores (z-scores)  Finding Probabilities with the Normal Calculator and Table  Now that you have learned to assess the relative value of any normal value by standardizing, the next step is to evaluate probabilities. In other contexts, as mentioned before, we will first take the conventional approach of referring to a normal table , which tells the probability of a normal variable taking a value less than any standardized score z.  Standard Normal Table  Since normal curves are symmetric about their mean, it follows that the curve of z scores must be symmetric about 0. Since the total area under any normal curve is 1, it follows that the areas on either side of z = 0 are both 0.5. Also, according to the Standard Deviation Rule, most of the area under the standardized curve falls between z = -3 and z = +3.   The normal table outlines the precise behavior of the standard normal random variable Z, the number of standard deviations a normal value x is below or above its mean. The normal table provides probabilities that a standardized normal random variable Z would take a value less than or equal to a particular value z*.  These particular values are listed in the form *.* in rows along the left margins of the table, specifying the ones and tenths. The columns fine-tune these values to hundredths, allowing us to look up the probability of being below any standardized value z of the form *.**.  For example, in the part of the table shown below, we can see that for a z-score of -2.81, we would find P(Z < -2.81) = 0.0025.   By construction, the probability P(Z < z*) equals the area under the z curve to the left of that particular value z*.   A quick sketch is often the key to solving normal problems easily and correctly.  Although normal tables are the traditional way to solve these problems, you can also use the normal calculator.  Normal Distribution Calculator: Non-JAVA Version  The image below illustrates the results of using the online calculator to find P(Z < -2.81) and P(Z < 1.15). Notice that the calculator behaves exactly as the table.   It is your choice to use the table or the online calculator but we will usually illustrate with the online calculator.   EXAMPLE: Standard Normal Probabilities  (a) What is the probability of a normal random variable taking a value less than 2.8 standard deviations above its mean?  P(Z < 2.8) = 0.9974 or 99.74%.   (b) What is the probability of a normal random variable taking a value lower than 1.47 standard deviations below its mean?  P(Z < -1.47) = 0.0708, or 7.08%.   (c) What is the probability of a normal random variable taking a value more than 0.75 standard deviations above its mean?  The fact that the problem involves the word “more” rather than “less” should not be overlooked! Our normal calculator provides left-tail probabilities, and adjustments must be made for any other type of problem.  Method 1:  By symmetry of the z curve centered on 0,  P(Z > +0.75) = P(Z < -0.75) = 0.2266.   Method 2:  Because the total area under the normal curve is 1,  P(Z > +0.75) = 1 – P(Z < +0.75) = 1 – 0.7734 = 0.2266.   [ Note: most students prefer to use Method 1, which does not require subtracting 4-digit probabilities from 1.]  (d) What is the probability of a normal random variable taking a value between 1 standard deviation below and 1 standard deviation above its mean?  To find probabilities in between two standard deviations, we must put them in terms of the probabilities below. A sketch is especially helpful here:  P(-1 < Z < +1) = P(Z < +1) – P(Z < -1) = 0.8413 – 0.1587 = 0.6826.   Here are the normal calculator results which would be needed.    Did I Get This?: Standard Normal Probabilities  Comments:   So far, we have used the normal calculator or table to find a probability, given the number (z) of standard deviations below or above the mean. The solution process when using the table involved first locating the given z value of the form *.** in the margins, then finding the corresponding probability of the form 0.**** inside the table as our answer.    Now, in Example 2, a probability will be given and we will be asked to find a z value. The solution process using the table involves first locating the given probability of the form 0.**** inside the table, then finding the corresponding z value of the form *.** as our answer. For the online calculator, the solution is as simply typing in the correct probability and having the calculator solve, in reverse, for the z-score.   Finding Standard Normal Scores  LO 6.18: Given a probability, find scores associated with a specified normal distribution.  It is often good to think about this process as the reverse of finding probabilities. In these problems, we will be given some information about the area in a range and asked to provide the z-score(s) associated with that range. Common types of questions are   Find the standard normal z-score corresponding to the top (or bottom) 8%.  Find the standard normal z-score associated with the 25th percentile.  Find the standard normal z-scores which contain the middle 40%.    EXAMPLE: Given Probabilities – Find Z-Scores  (a) What standard normal z-score is associated with the bottom (or lowest) 1%? The probability is 0.01 that a standardized normal variable takes a value below what particular value of z?  The closest we can come to a probability of 0.01 inside the table is 0.0099, in the z = -2.3 row and 0.03 column: z = -2.33 . In other words, the probability is 0.01 that the value of a normal variable is lower than 2.33 standard deviations below its mean.   Using the online calculator, we simply use the calculator in reverse by typing in 0.01 in the “area” box (outlined in blue) and then click “compute” to see the associated z-score. Remember that, like the table, we always need to provide this calculator with the area to the left of the z-score we are currently trying to find.   (b) What standard normal z-score corresponds to the top (or upper) 15%? The probability is 0.15 that a standardized normal variable takes a value above what particular value of z?  Remember that the calculator and table only provide probabilities of being below a certain value, not above. Once again, we must rely on one of the properties of the normal curve to make an adjustment.  Method 1: According to the table, 0.15 (actually 0.1492) is the probability of being below -1.04. By symmetry, 0.15 must also be the probability of being above +1.04. Using the calculator, we can enter 0.15 exactly and find that the corresponding z-score is actually -1.036 giving a final answer of z = +1.036 or +1.04 if we round to two decimal places which is our preference (this results in no differences for students who use the table or the online calculator).   Method 2: If 0.15 is the probability of being above the value we seek, then 1 – 0.15 = 0.85 must be the probability of being below the value we seek. According to the table, 0.85 (actually 0.8508) is the probability of being below +1.04.   In other words, we have found 0.15 to be the probability that a normal variable takes a value more than 1.04 standard deviations above its mean.  (c) What standard normal z-scores contain the middle 95%? The probability is 0.95 that a normal variable takes a value within how many standard deviations of its mean?  A symmetric area of 0.95 centered at 0 extends to values -z* and +z* such that the remaining (1 – 0.95) / 2 = 0.025 is below -z* and also 0.025 above +z*. The probability is 0.025 that a standardized normal variable is below -1.96. Thus, the probability is 0.95 that a normal variable takes a value within 1.96 standard deviations of its mean. Once again, the Standard Deviation Rule is shown to be just roughly accurate, since it states that the probability is 0.95 that a normal variable takes a value within 2 standard deviations of its mean.     Did I Get This?:  Finding Standard Normal Scores  Although the online calculator can provide results for any probability or z-score, our standard normal table, like most, only provides probabilities for z values between -3.49 and +3.49. The following example demonstrates how to handle cases where z exceeds 3.49 in absolute value.   EXAMPLE: Extreme Probabilities  (a) What is the probability of a normal variable being lower than 5.2 standard deviations below its mean?  There is no need to panic about going “off the edge” of the normal table. We already know from the Standard Deviation Rule that the probability is only about (1 -0 .997) / 2 = 0.0015 that a normal value would be more than 3 standard deviations away from its mean in one direction or the other. The table provides information for z values as extreme as plus or minus 3.49: the probability is only 0.0002 that a normal variable would be lower than 3.49 standard deviations below its mean. Any more standard deviations than that, and we generally say the probability is approximately zero.  In this case, we would say the probability of being lower than 5.2 standard deviations below the mean is approximately zero:  P(Z < -5.2) = 0 (approx.)  (b) What is the probability of the value of a normal variable being higher than 6 standard deviations below its mean?  Since the probability of being lower than 6 standard deviations below the mean is approximately zero, the probability of being higher than 6 standard deviations below the mean must be approximately 1.  P(Z > -6) = 1 (approx.)  (c) What is the probability of a normal variable being less than 8 standard deviations above the mean?  Approximately 1. P(Z < +8) = 1 (approx.)  (d) What is the probability of a normal variable being greater than 3.5 standard deviations above the mean?  Approximately 0. P(Z > +3.5) = 0 (approx.)

The standard normal distribution is centered at zero and the degree to which a given measurement deviates from the mean is given by the standard deviation. For the standard normal distribution, 68% of the observations lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean; 95% lie within two standard deviation of the mean; and 99.9% lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean. To this point, we have been using "X" to denote the variable of interest (e.g., X=BMI, X=height, X=weight). However, when using a standard normal distribution, we will use "Z" to refer to a variable in the context of a standard normal distribution. After standarization, the BMI=30 discussed on the previous page is shown below lying 0.16667 units above the mean of 0 on the standard normal distribution on the right.     ====  Since the area under the standard curve = 1, we can begin to more precisely define the probabilities of specific observation. For any given Z-score we can compute the area under the curve to the left of that Z-score. The table in the frame below shows the probabilities for the standard normal distribution. Examine the table and note that a "Z" score of 0.0 lists a probability of 0.50 or 50%, and a "Z" score of 1, meaning one standard deviation above the mean, lists a probability of 0.8413 or 84%. That is because one standard deviation above and below the mean encompasses about 68% of the area, so one standard deviation above the mean represents half of that of 34%. So, the 50% below the mean plus the 34% above the mean gives us 84%.  Probabilities of the Standard Normal Distribution Z         This table is organized to provide the area under the curve to the left of or less of a specified value or "Z value". In this case, because the mean is zero and the standard deviation is 1, the Z value is the number of standard deviation units away from the mean, and the area is the probability of observing a value less than that particular Z value. Note also that the table shows probabilities to two decimal places of Z. The units place and the first decimal place are shown in the left hand column, and the second decimal place is displayed across the top row.  But let's get back to the question about the probability that the BMI is less than 30, i.e., P(X<30). We can answer this question using the standard normal distribution. The figures below show the distributions of BMI for men aged 60 and the standard normal distribution side-by-side.  Distribution of BMI and Standard Normal Distribution   ====  The area under each curve is one but the scaling of the X axis is different. Note, however, that the areas to the left of the dashed line are the same. The BMI distribution ranges from 11 to 47, while the standardized normal distribution, Z, ranges from -3 to 3. We want to compute P(X < 30). To do this we can determine the Z value that corresponds to X = 30 and then use the standard normal distribution table above to find the probability or area under the curve. The following formula converts an X value into a Z score , also called a standardized score :   where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the variable X.  In order to compute P(X < 30) we convert the X=30 to its corresponding Z score (this is called standardizing ):   Thus, P(X < 30) = P(Z < 0.17). We can then look up the corresponding probability for this Z score from the standard normal distribution table, which shows that P(X < 30) = P(Z < 0.17) = 0.5675. Thus, the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI less than 30 is 56.75%.  Another Example  Using the same distribution for BMI, what is the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI exceeding 35? In other words, what is P(X > 35)? Again we standardize:   We now go to the standard normal distribution table to look up P(Z>1) and for Z=1.00 we find that P(Z<1.00) = 0.8413. Note, however, that the table always gives the probability that Z is less than the specified value, i.e., it gives us P(Z<1)=0.8413.   Therefore, P(Z>1)=1-0.8413=0.1587. Interpretation: Almost 16% of men aged 60 have BMI over 35.  Normal Probability Calculator         Z-Scores with R  As an alternative to looking up normal probabilities in the table or using Excel, we can use R to compute probabilities. For example,  > pnorm(0)  [1] 0.5  A Z-score of 0 (the mean of any distribution) has 50% of the area to the left. What is the probability that a 60 year old man in the population above has a BMI less than 29 (the mean)? The Z-score would be 0, and pnorm(0)=0.5 or 50%.  What is the probability that a 60 year old man will have a BMI less than 30? The Z-score was 0.16667.  > pnorm(0.16667)  [1] 0.5661851  So, the probabilty is 56.6%.  What is the probability that a 60 year old man will have a BMI greater than 35?  35-29=6, which is one standard deviation above the mean. So we can compute the area to the left  > pnorm(1)  [1] 0.8413447  and then subtract the result from 1.0.  1-0.8413447= 0.1586553  So the probability of a 60 year ld man having a BMI greater than 35 is 15.8%.  Or, we can use R to compute the entire thing in a single step as follows:  > 1-pnorm(1)  [1] 0.1586553    Probability for a Range of Values   What is the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI between 30 and 35? Note that this is the same as asking what proportion of men aged 60 have BMI between 30 and 35. Specifically, we want P(30 < X < 35)? We previously computed P(30<X) and P(X<35); how can these two results be used to compute the probability that BMI will be between 30 and 35? Try to formulate and answer on your own before looking at the explanation below.  Answer     Now consider BMI in women. What is the probability that a female aged 60 has BMI less than 30? We use the same approach, but for women aged 60 the mean is 28 and the standard deviation is 7.  Answer     What is the probability that a female aged 60 has BMI exceeding 40? Specifically, what is P(X > 40)?  Answer     return to top | previous page | next page     Content ©2016. All Rights Reserved. Date last modified: July 24, 2016. Wayne W. LaMorte, MD, PhD, MPH Boston University School of Public Health            z score Calculator    The probability of a result x in an experiment consisting of a
large number of equally probable independent trials n is
approximated by the normal probability density function :     where μ, the mean value , is n /2 and
σ,
the standard deviation , is a measure of the breadth of the
curve which, for experiments with two equally probable outcomes
of each trial is:     Since the mean value and standard deviation depend upon the number
of trials in the experiment, comparison between experiments
with differing numbers of trials is facilitated by standardising the result: transforming it
to a distribution with mean value zero and standard deviation
of 1.  A normally distributed experimental result x is thus standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing
by the standard deviation of the experiment:     This z-value or z score expresses the
divergence of the experimental result x from the
most probable result μ as a number of standard
deviations σ
The larger the value of z , the less probable the
experimental result is due to chance.  The probability
can be calculated from the cumulative standard
normal distribution :     Which gives the probability P that an experimental
result with a z value less than or equal to that
observed is due to chance.  Subtracting P from one:     gives Q , the probability that the observed z score is due to chance.  Unfortunately, there is no closed form solution for P , so it
must be evaluated numerically.  This page allows you to calculate the
probability of chance occurrence of a given z , or to
calculate z given a probability Q .  All
calculations are performed with six decimal places of accuracy; the
maximum z accepted is 6.  Note that the probability calculated from the z is an approximation which is valid only for large
values of n , and is therefore only meaningful when
calculated for experiments with a large number of
individual trials.   In order to use this page, your browser must support JavaScript.

Our objective in this lesson is to get by that roadblock and demonstrate that what lies beyond is not really so bad. In fact, the road may be quite smooth once you understand probability and its usefulness for interpreting measurement data.  Probability is important because it helps us understand the chances of making a correct inference or decision on the basis of a limited amount of data. Data is often limited because of cost considerations, therefore, it is very important to interpret that data properly. For example, in evaluating the performance of a new laboratory method by analyzing 40 specimens on a new method and a comparison method, what is the probability, or chance, that the difference observed between methods represents a real measurement error and not just a figment of the noise in the data (random error, imprecision, or scatter). In laboratory quality control, where it is common to make only two or three measurements, what is the probability of detecting medically important errors when using a Levey-Jennings control chart with control limits set as the mean plus and minus 2 SD? What is the chance of a false rejection, i.e., an out-of-control signal even though the method is working properly?  You most likely have already been exposed to the topic of probability in earlier courses. You may have used probability in your genetics class to construct a Punnet square. You may have used probability theory in chemistry to predict the number of isomers for compounds containing asymmetric carbon groups.  Probability  Probability is a number from 0.00 to 1.00 that represents the chance that an event will occur. A probability of 1.00 means the event will always occur. A probability of 0.00 means the event will never occur. It's also common to talk about the chance of occurrence, which is commonly described by percentage figures between 0.0% and 100.0%.  Coin toss examples. What is the chance of tossing a coin and having it land heads up (H)? Mathematically, the chance of H or probability of H on one toss of one fair coin (that has one head and one tail) is equal to the number of heads (H) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (heads plus tails, or H + T): Pr(H) = H/(H+T) or ½ or 0.50. That's why it's fair to toss a coin to decide which football team gets to receive the ball and which has to kick off because both sides have an equal or 50% chance with a single coin toss.  Now, if we tossed five coins, what would be the most likely outcome? The answer is some combination of heads and tails. Intuitively, we know that the chance of tossing 5 coins and having all of them come up heads is quite small. That chance is the product of each of the single episodes: Pr(H) = (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = (1/2) 5 or (0.5) 5 or 0.03125. There is only a probability of about 0.03 or a 3% chance of getting heads on all 5 coins.          With a 5 coin toss, it's likely to see some combinations of heads and tails based on these possible outcomes: 5H+0T, 4H+1T, 3H+2T, 2H+3T, 1H+4T, and 0H+5T. All heads would occur 1/32 times or 0.03 probability, as shown at the right. Similarly, all tails would occur 0.03 of the time. Intuitively, the greatest possibility lies in having some mixture of H and T, possibly 2.5 heads - but that number is not a reality or a real number here. The expected frequency distribution can be seen in the top figure, which shows the distribution of possibilities as fractions of 32nds. The possibilities total to thirty-two 32nds or unity. The area under the curve is greatest between 2 and 4 heads, i.e., that is the highest probability or most likely outcome.  Probability distribution.  The frequency distribution for a 10 coin toss is shown in the second figure. Again, intuitively speaking, the greatest possibility is some mixture of H and T. With a 10 coin toss, achieving half heads or 5 is a real number, and the maximum probability is 0.50, as shown by the peak of the curve.  The distribution of a 20 coin toss is seen in the third figure. Again, the greatest area under the curve indicates some combination of heads and tails. When increasing the number of coins or events, the curves begin to look like normal distribution curves. As the number of events exceeds 30, the graph is considered to approximate a normal curve.        Statistical significance. The importance of this point is that a normal curve can often be used to assess the probability that an event or observed difference occurs by chance or by cause. In interpreting experimental results, it is common to use a probability of 0.05 as the cutoff between a chance occurrence and a cause occurrence. If the probability is greater than 0.05, i.e., Pr>0.05, the conclusion is that no difference exists. If Pr<0.05, then it is often concluded that a statistically significant difference has been observed; in short, that means there is a real difference due to some cause. That's why an understanding of probability is very useful for making inferences or decisions on the basis of experimental data. In the next section, we will see where that 0.05 comes from.   Standard Normal Distribution  The standard normal distribution or the unit normal distribution is a special normal curve made up of z-scores. Remember that a z-score is a standard score (also called the standard Gaussian variable) that is calculated by subtracting the mean from a value and dividing the result by the standard deviation: z = (value - mean)/standard deviation. For example, if the mean were 100 and the value were 110, then the difference between the mean and the value is 10. If the standard deviation were 5, then the difference of 10 has 2 SD's in it, thereby it is equal to 2z.  As discussed in lessons 1 and 2, this is one of those statistical forms that appears repeatedly in laboratory statistics. The formula is used to express the number of standard deviations in the difference between a value and the mean. The values for z range from zero to infinity. The figure shows that the most common z-scores are from 0.00 to 3.00. A z of 0.00 represents the mean and the range of z from +3.00 to - 3.00 encompasses almost all of the area of the distribution. In statistical language, this distribution can be described as N(0,1), which indicates distribution is normal (N) and has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.  Area under a normal curve. The total area under the curve is equal to 1.00 or unity. Half of the area, or 0.50, is on either side of the mean. The area between the mean and -1.00 z is 0.34 and the area between the mean and +1.00 z is 0.34, therefore the mean +/- 1.00z represents 68% of the area under a normal curve. The area between -2.00 z and +2.00 z is 0.47 + 0.47 or approximately 95% of the area under the curve. Between -3.00 z and + 3.00 z is 0.49 + 0.49 or approximately 99% of the area under the curve. (These numbers should seem familiar to laboratorians.) Note also that the use of +/- 2.00 z encompasses 95% of the area or a .95 probability. The remaining 1% or 0.01 probability is left in the tails of the curve. Z-scores can also be listed as decimal fractions of the 1's, 2's, and 3's we have been using thus far. For example, you could have 1.40 z's. Here the decimal fraction is carried out to the hundreths place.  Table of areas under a normal curve. It is often convenient to use a table of areas under a standard normal curve to convert an observed z-score into the area or probability represented by that score. See the table of areas under a standard normal curve which shows the z-score in the left column and the corresponding area in the next column. In actuality, the area represented in the table is only one half of the normal curve, but since the normal curve is symmetrical, the other half can also be estimated from the same table and the 0.50 on the upper half plus the 0.50 in the lower half equals 1.00 or all of the distribution.  As an example use of the table, a z-score of 1.40 is listed as having an area of 0.4192. This indicates that 41.92% of the area is between the mean or center of the distribution and the z-score of 1.40. The area beyond that particular z-score to the tail end of the distribution would be the difference between 0.5000 and the value of 0.4192, or 0.0808 because the table represents one half or 0.5000 of the area of the distribution. Now let's look at the lower half of the distribution down to a z-score of -1.40 (i.e. a negative 1.40). This too represents an area of .4192. At +/- 1.40, you would have .4192 plus .4192 or .9394 of the are under the curve. Sometimes statisticians want to accumulate all of the negative z-score area (the left half of the curve) and add to that some of the postive z-score area. All of the negative area equals .5000 plus some of the positive area, here .4192, added together would give .9142.  Here is an example of how to use the table: to find the area for a z-score of 1.96, find the value of 1.9 in the leftmost column, then find the hundredth figure from the column heading for .06, and read the area below that column, e.g., 0.4750. The area from -1.96 to +1.96 would encompass 2*0.475 or 95% of the area under a normal curve, leaving 5% outside those limits or 5% in the tails. Note that we commonly think of a 95% range as the mean plus or minus 2z or 2 SD, but that's an approximation and the exact z-score should be 1.96.  At 3.00 z, the area under the curve is 0.4987, which leaves an area of approximately 0.0013 outside in the tail. The area from -3.00 to +3.00 encompasses 2*0.4987 or 99.74% of the area, leaving only 0.26% outside. This is why 3 SD control limits have a very low chance of false rejections compared to 2 SD limits.  z-score transformation formula. The concept of the standard normal distribution will become increasingly important because there are many useful applications. If the population mean, µ, and the population standard deviation, , of any normally distributed data are known, the z-scores can be computed through the use of the following z score transformation formula:  z = (X - µ)/s  Again the formula represents the value minus the mean all divided by the standard deviation. The formula defines the difference score (X - µ or X-Xbar or delta, as seen in earlier lessons), according to how many standard deviation units it represents.  Proficiency testing example. One useful application is in proficiency testing (PT), where a laboratory analyzes a series of samples to demonstrate that it can provide correct answers. The results from PT surveys often include z-scores. For example, a glucose test value on a proficiency testing sample is observed to be 275 mg/dl. Other laboratories that analyzed this same sample show a mean value of 260 and a standard deviation of 6.0 mg/dL. In comparison to these values, our laboratory's analysis has a z-score of +2.50, which means that less than 1% of other laboratories got a higher test result (observe that a z-score of +2.50 corresponds to an area of 0.4938, which leaves only 0.0062 or 0.62% of the area in the tail above 2.50). Said another way, there is only a very small chance that the 275 mg/dL glucose value belongs with the rest of the proficiency testing values. Said another way, there is only a 0.0228 probability, or a very small chance, that the 275 glucose really does belong with the other values. Most likely it represents a measurement error by the laboratory.  z-scores vs SDs. Because there is so much confusion concerning this topic, it's worthwhile to review the relation between z-score and standard deviations (SD). The lines between statistical definitions sometimes blur over time.  Remember that the mean and standard deviation are the first statistics that are calculated to describe the variation of measurements or distribution of results. The standard deviation is a term that has the same units as the measurement, therefore it can be used to describe the actual range of measurement results that might be expected.  A z-score can be calculated once the mean and standard deviation are available. The calculated z-score [z-score = (value - mean)/SD] describes where a value is located in the distribution, e.g., a z-score of 0 is at the mean of the distribution and a z-score of 2.0 or beyond is in the tails of the distribution. Notice that SD is in the denominator of the z-score formula, so SD's and z's are not really the same. The z-score is a ratio and therefore is unitless, whereas the SD is expressed in concentration units.  But, we tend to think in terms of ±2SD as if they were ±2z. We use the SD like a z-score by saying that, if a value falls out of the curve >±2SD, then it is different from 95% of the rest of the curve (we probably should have been saying ±2z). When a value lies at >±2z's (SD's), then that value is outside of the 95% area under the curve. So 1.00 - 0.95 = 0.05. That value lies in the 0.05 area of the tails. We often use this probability of 0.05 as an indicator of statistical significance, i.e. when a value falls out >±2SD (or z's), then a statistically significant or real difference has been observed (with Pr < 0.05 that the value is a chance occurrence).  Relationship to t-distribution. In the above PT example, the population mean (µ) and the population standard deviation (s) were known quantities, i.e., the data from all laboratories participating in the proficiency testing survey were included in the calculations, thus the true mean and true standard deviation are known for the whole population. When the population mean and standard deviation are not known, which is a more typical situation, z-scores cannot be calculated. In fact, in most laboratory applications, µ and s are not known. There is, however, another family of distributions - the t-distributions - which can be used when the µ and s are approximated by Xbar and SD.  The t-distributions generally are said to have "heavier tails" as compared to the normal distribution. As the sample size gets larger and larger (N increases to about 30 or 40), these distributions begin to approximate the normal curve and can be used much like the unit normal curve because ±2t accumulates about 95% of the area under the curve. A t-value can be calculated much like a z-value, e.g., tcalc = (observed value - mean)/sXbar, where sXbar represents the standard error of the mean, which we learned about in lesson 5. If tcalc is greater than +/- 2, then a conclusion can be drawn about that particular value. A t-distribution can be used to help in making the decision that the means of two samples are far enough apart to be considered to be different, i.e., the difference is statistically significant, or close enough together to be considered the same, i.e., the difference is not statistically significant. When N is less than 30, it will be necessary to look up a critical t-value from a table.   Self-assessment questions   What is the probability of tossing three fair coins and getting all heads? What's the probability of getting three tails? What's the probability of getting some other combination of heads and tails?  What is a z-score?  For a z-score of 1.65, what is the area of the standard normal curve below that value? What is the area above that value?  How is the standard normal curve useful for data interpretation?  If an observed difference is greater than +/- 2 z, that difference is considered statistically significant at what probability?  Under what conditions do you use a t-distribution rather than a z-distribution?   About the author: Madelon F. Zady  Madelon F.

Now let's look at how we can perform a hypothesis test, first, by using the Z score. We will start with an understanding of Z scores.  A Z score is a number of standard deviations a score is above or below the mean. In the Standard Normal Distribution, the mean is always equal to 0 and the standard deviation is equal to 1.0. The Z scores help us to describe various aspects of the distribution, such as percentile ranks, percentages of scores between points, etc. In short, it allows us to compare any one score to any other score in a distribution, or across distributions because it is standardized based on the distributions mean and standard deviation. Take a look at the following diagrams of the normal distribution. This breaks down the percentage of the distribution falling between the Z scores. This is a constant. Thus we can see that almost, but not quite all of the distribution lies between the Z scores of -3 and 3.  Normal distribution and Z scores:     This 3-part diagram shows the percent of a normal distribution that lies between 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from the mean: between -1 and 1 you can find approximately 68%; between -2 and 2 is approximately 95%; and between -3 and 3 is approximately 99.7% -- practically everything! All normal models follow this pattern, so a common name for this property is the 68-95-99.7 Rule. These percentages also represent the probability of finding a z score in one of these intervals, so this rule can be useful in answering probability questions such as we find in hypothesis testing.  Here is another view of the Standard Normal Distribution. In this diagram the percentages represent the amount of the distribution between consecutive Z scores (-2 and -1, -1 and 0, etc.).   The diagram also illustrates how the Z scores fall on the normal distribution. Each Z score represents a unit of standard deviation away from the mean. To understand this lets look at an IQ distribution with M=100 and SD=12. A Z score of 1 is 12 units away from the mean; a Z score of 2 is 24 units away from the mean and so on. Because the normal distribution is symmetrical about the mean, as you can see by the percentage breakdown, then a Z score of -2 is also 24 units away from the mean.   Now let's look at this in terms of raw scores. If the mean of our distribution is 100, then a Z score of 2 is equal to a raw score of 124. A Z score of -2 is equal to a raw score of 76.  Now we can start to compare individual's scores on this test. A problem we might run into however, is that our raw scores (the scores individuals get on the IQ test) will rarely fall right onto our Z scores. So we will have to know how to convert each raw score into a Z score. And vice-versa, we will need to know how to convert our Z scores into raw scores.  So, what if our friend Carl was one of the individuals in this distribution of IQ scores. He scored a 115 on the test. What is his Z score? Following the information already given, we know that a Z score of 1 is equal to 112 and a Z score of 2 is equal to 124. Therefore we know that Carl's Z score should be between 1 and 2. But to find out the exact Z score we turn to the Z score formula:   Thus:     If Carl scored 115 of the IQ test, his converted Z score is 1.25. This means Carl's IQ is 1.25 standard deviations above the population mean IQ score. Why is this important? Well lets say that our cousin Bob just took the IQ test in another location (part of a different distribution). The mean of that distribution was 105 with a standard deviation equal to 18. Who performed better? We can't just compare them directly because the distributions are different. Hence the standardization of our scores. If Bob scored 118 let's find his Z score.     So even though Bob's raw score was higher, after standardization,we can conclude that Carl scored higher relative to others in his distribution than did Bob.  Let's go the other way now. Going back to our first distribution (M=100, SD=12) we know that another individual had a Z score equal to -0.95. We can find this by solving the Z score formula for x.    This demonstrates that we can use Z scores to gain understanding into an individual's performance. We can also use them to determine where in a distribution a scores falls. To accomplish this we will turn to the following table.         As the title of this table suggests, we can use Z scores to determine how much of a distribution is represented. This particular Z score table, and there are many versions, only gives the area under the normal curve for points between the mean and Z as depicted below.       So, If we have a Z score of 1.25 then the area under the curve from Mean to Z is 39.44%. But remember that we still have the other half of the distribution. Since a normal distribution is symmetrical, that means that 50% lies on both sides of the distribution. So, if we have a Z score of 1.25, that means that it is at the 89.44th percentile (39.44+50). It also means that even though the information is not given, we know that 10.56% is in the area beyond our Z score.    PRACTICE PROBLEM #1  What percentage of scores would fall below a Z score of 2.56?  ANSWER    PRACTICE PROBLEM #2  What percentage of scores would be greater than a Z score of -1.56?  ANSWER    PRACTICE PROBLEM #3  What percentage of scores would fall BETWEEN Z scores of -1.0 and 1.0?  ANSWER        Now let's go backwards from a percentage to the Z score. What if we know that a particular score is at the 85th percentile? Using the Z score table, what could we use as the Z score? The Z score would be 1.03. What if we knew that exactly 2.5% of the distribution was beyond our Z score? What is that Z score? 1.96. (we will see this one again). HINT: remember to draw the distribution. Percentiles range from the 1st percentile towards the 100th percentile     If you didn't guess these, remember that we have to account for the 50% of the distribution in the other half, and that our table only gives us from the mean to Z. So for 85%, we have to subtract 50 to get 35%. We then look for the value closest to 35% (or the value just below it) and move backwards to find our Z score. 1.03, see? For 2.5%, we have to remember that we are looking at the area beyond the Z, therefore we must subtract it from 50. 50 - 2.5= 47.5. Giving us a Z score of 1.96.    PRACTICE PROBLEM 4  What is the Z score for the 15th percentile ?  ANSWER    PRACTICE PROBLEM 5  What is the Z score for the 75th percentile?  ANSWER  You may have asked yourself (several times, in fact) why this matters, or of what use is this information? Well this is how we are going to determine if there is a significant difference between groups. We will do this by setting a critical value, a threshold, using the alpha level and corresponding Z scores in much the same way that we have been practicing. This critical value is going to look at the area beyond the Z score as this will represent the scores that ARE NOT in the typical population.  Of course, this is going to require some additional knowledge; the difference between a 1-tailed hypothesis and a 2-tailed hypothesis. A 1-tailed hypothesis means that we, the researchers, are predicting a specific response. Putting it into our Magistrate example, if we were to predict a DECREASE in the number of deaths after eating citron then we just stated a 1-tailed hypothesis. If we were testing a new pill that changed our IQ, we could make another 1-tailed hypothesis by stating that the drug would INCREASE our IQ. The 1-tailed hypothesis is directional. A 2-tailed hypothesis on the other hand means that we had no specific idea of what would happen. For example, we could be engaging in exploratory research to discover whether our new teaching method increased OR decreased the average performance in our classroom. The 2-tailed hypothesis is non directional.  Let's tie this together by first looking at a scenario using an alpha level of 0.05. If you look at the normal distribution diagram, you see that 0.05% would be in the tails. So conversely 95% of our distribution would be in the main body of the distribution. If we have a 2-tailed hypothesis test, that means that we have to split this 5% among both tails. So for a 2-tailed hypothesis test, if the alpha level is set at 0.05, then moving backwards from 2.5% (the area under the curve, beyond the Z) to a Z score we get +/-1.96. Since it is 2-tailed, we don't know if our score will be on the high or low end of the distribution hence the positive or negative Z score. In any case, this is our critical value. In this case a critical Z score. This means that the probability of an event occurring by chance, using the normal distribution, is 5%. We need our calculated Z score to pass 1.96 (the critical value) to be significantly different than the rest of the population at a level greater than chance.   What if we set the alpha level at 0.01? For a 2-tailed hypothesis test, the z score is +/- 2.58. This should start to make intuitive sense. An alpha level of 0.01 is more conservative than one of 0.05 because we are now saying that there is only a 1% chance of committing Type I error. 2.58 is larger than 1.96, therefore it is more difficult to show significant difference at the 0.01 level because our calculated Z score now has to pass the critical Z score of 2.58.  This of course, was looking at a 2-tailed hypothesis test. What about 1-tailed tests? We still need to find a Z score that corresponds to our alpha level, but now the entire percentage would lie in one tail, on one side of the distribution. An alpha level of 0.05 for a 1-tailed test would therefore be equal to a critical Z score of 1.64. An alpha level of 0.01 for a 1-tailed hypothesis would be equal to a critical Z score of 2.33.       return to top | previous page | next page    standard page Created with SoftChalk    {|�u6:3v���˟�3�9�|*�ϝT���n=Mtb=�Ж��9�̰�b��z�Z�����I� $}��

They never get big again... just smaller and smaller. So if your table of $p$-values for $z$ statistics stops at three, it probably says the $p$-value is 0.000 or something like that (really meaning < 0.001), and you can simply use that to conduct your tests. – Alexis  May 14 '14 at 21:08        add a comment |           4 Answers 4     active  oldest  votes            up vote  4  down vote  accepted      Let me repeat (and correct) what I've said in my comment ad reply to your edit.  You have to transfer from $X$ to $Z$ in order to use a z-score table. Since a z-score table contains a small finite subset of values, you often must settle for an approximation. So you could also settle for $P(Z<-3)\approx 0$ and $P(Z< 3)\approx 1$ (NB: $P(Z>3)\approx 1$ was a typo, sorry.)  As to $P(-1.25<Z<3.75)$, I'll use this z-score table :
$$P(-1.25<Z<3.75)=P(Z<3.75)-P(Z<-1.25)\approx 1-0.1056=0.8944$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 17 '14 at 8:21             answered May 14 '14 at 21:24       Sergio   2,963 5 15              add a comment |              up vote  6  down vote      For $z >0$, the right tail of the standard normal distribution 
(that is, the area to the right of $z$) which is often denoted by 
$Q(z)$ is bounded as follows:  $$\frac{\exp(-z^2/2)}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\left (\frac{1}{z} - \frac{1}{z^3}\right )
\ < \ Q(z) \ < \ \frac{\exp(-z^2/2)}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\left (\frac{1}{z}\right ).$$  See, for example this answer on math.SE for a proof. The bounds blow up/down to $\pm \infty$ as $z \to 0$ but are quite useful in the
regions not covered by typical tables of the cumulative distribution function
of the standard normal random variable. For example,
$$0.0000873 < Q(3.75) < 0.0000940$$ while the actual value is slightly larger than $0.0000884$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:19       Community ♦   1        answered May 14 '14 at 23:20       Dilip Sarwate   26.4k 1 44 129                  I pondered whether to include a calculation based on the series for Mill's ratio ($Q(z)/\phi(z)$) in my answer - I even typed in something under a point "iv)" but then deleted it instead of posting it. Glad to see it here. – Glen_b ♦  May 15 '14 at 4:18         1      Should be one of Mills' ratio or Mills's ratio or Mills ratio: person concerned was John P. Mills whose name appeared on a tabulation he did for Karl Pearson. He didn't invent or discover the ratio and he published nothing else, it seems. – Nick Cox  May 15 '14 at 8:31        1      Connecting this answer with that of @Glen_b, it is interesting that a crude application of Simpson's Rule to the interval $[z, z+2h]$ with $h\approx 3/z$--beyond which the integrand clearly gets very small compared to its value at $z$--yields the approximation $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp(-z^2/2)/z$ with $O(z^{-3})$ error. – whuber ♦  May 15 '14 at 16:06        1      An even cruder approximation is as follows. For $z>0$, the tangent to $\phi(z)$, which has slope $-z\phi(z)$, crosses the horizontal axis at $z+z^{-1}$. For $z>1$, the right triangle whose hypotenuse is the tangent and whose base extends from $z$ to $z+z^{-1}$ lies wholly in the region that we integrate to find $Q(z)$. This triangle has area $\frac{\phi(z)}{2z}$ giving that $$Q(z) > \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{\exp(-z^2/2)}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\left (\frac{1}{z}\right )$$ which is half the upper bound. Crude, but better than the lower bound which has value $0$ at $z=1$ – Dilip Sarwate  May 16 '14 at 20:31         add a comment |             up vote  4  down vote      The standard normal ranges from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.  Your problem appears to be that your table doesn't go further.  Your question should therefore be modified to ask "*How do I deal with the fact that my table doesn't go as high as my $Z$ value?*"  [Note that in your last paragraph, you have become confused. The region you're evaluating probability for is $Z<3.75$ but the boundary value of $Z$ you're trying to look up in the table (the $3.75$) is $>3$, as in your title.]  It seems like not having the value in your table would be a problem, but it's a very small one $-$ since your answer for $P(0<Z<3.75)$ can't be smaller than $P(0<Z<3)\approx 0.4999$ and can't be larger than $P(0<Z<\infty)=0.5$, you shouldn't have much difficulty narrowing the answer down to 3 significant figures of accuracy even so.  Additional accuracy (though I really don't think you need it) can be obtained by many methods. Here are three:  i) finding better tables ( these seem to be of the same form as the ones you're apparently using)  ii) using a package that will evaluate standard normal cdfs for you. I just used R (simply typing pnorm(3.75) to obtain $P(-\infty<Z<3.75)$).  iii) using numerical integration to approximate the area between 3 and 3.75. For example, via Simpson's rule , a single interval (3 points) gives 0.0017 (the correct answer is 0.0013 to 4dp). Alternatively, because the density is convex in this region (indeed, as whuber points out in comments, convex for $Z>1$ and $Z< -1$), the integral will be bounded below by the midpoint rule and above by the trapezoidal rule, which usefully bounds where the answer can lie  But, really, just using the limits provided by 3 and $\infty$ is plenty, I imagine.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 14 '14 at 23:00             answered May 14 '14 at 22:46       Glen_b ♦   193k 21 352 676                  +1.

If you're wondering what the p value is for z = 3.75, you can find it in r with pnorm(3.75) . (You could also use pnorm(85,70,4) .) The result is p =  0.9999116.  If you want an exact p value, I think you're going to have an easier time getting it in R or some other statistical software than by dealing with the quantile function directly...but FWIW, here's that equation :   $$F^{-1}(p)
      = \mu + \sigma\Phi^{-1}(p)
      = \mu + \sigma\sqrt2\,\operatorname{erf}^{-1}(2p - 1), \quad p\in(0,1)$$   In the above, $\rm erf$ refers to the error function .  In light of your comments and edit to the question, I think I should decline to provide more than this as a "hint" in following our policy on self-study questions .     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 16 '17 at 16:02       Community ♦   1        answered May 14 '14 at 20:49       Nick Stauner   10.1k 5 35 77                  i think i'v been learning things the wrong way !  i didn't got your answer, but in class they use this formula to transfer from X to Z Z = (X-μ)/σ ---> (X-MEAN)/STD  am i right ? – Mr.Cat  May 14 '14 at 20:54         1      Basically, yes, that's the way to z -score. FWIW, using a sample mean and standard deviation in place of the population parameters yields t -scores instead. I'm not sure I understood what you were after, but there is nothing particularly difficult about handling z scores larger than 3, except maybe not being able to look up corresponding p values in a textbook table. IMO, it's better to leave the table behind and start calculating statistics anyway. – Nick Stauner  May 14 '14 at 21:02         1      @Mr.Cat, you have to transfer from $X$ to $Z$ in order to use a z-score table.

No doubt you intended them the other way around, but I think I have to mention it so that later readers are aware that $P(Z<3)\approx 1$ and $P(Z>3)\approx 0$ was what you meant. – Glen_b ♦  May 17 '14 at 2:19        |  show 4 more comments           Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

The normal distribution and the Z-score say "ouch," while Shmoop gets to work on finding some probabilities. Sample Problem A dataset is normally distributed, with a mean of 177 and a standard deviation of 48. What is the probability of getting a result of 236 or greater? We like looking at pictures. What good is a scavenger hunt if we don't know what we're supposed to find?  That shaded part under the curve will be the perfect spot for our picnic. It's also the same as the probability we are looking for. We can solve the problem and eat a peanut butter sandwich at the same time. We don't like this distribution, though. It has too many ants on it. We'd rather have the same spot on a standard normal distribution. That means finding the Z-score at 236.  We can reword our question as, "What is the probability of getting a result greater than 1.23 standard deviations above the mean of a standard normal distribution?" Or, to put it in a real fancy, math-y way: Pr( x > 1.23) = ? We like this question a lot more, because someone else has already done the hardest work for us. We don't have to calculate the probability, we just have to track it down in a standard normal table . These things have hundreds of probabilities already calculated. The catch is that they can be a tad confusing to read at times. We'll walk through it nice and easy, don't worry. Here is an example of a standard standard normal table. We highly suggest clicking that link and following along with us. Notice the picture in the upper-right corner: the probabilities in the table are those to the right of Z, or Pr( x > Z). That's exactly what we need, so no complaints from us. To read the table, start on the left side and go down until you find the row next to "1.20." That's part of the Z-score we want to find. The other part is "0.03," and we can find that along the top part of the table. Z 0.02 0.03 0.04 1.10 0.131357 0.129238 0.127143 1.20 0.111233 0.109349 0.107488 1.30 0.093418 0.091759 0.090123 We travel along the row "1.20" and down the column "0.03" until our fingers run into each other. Where they meet is Pr(Z > 1.23), and that equals 0.109349. That equals the shaded-in part of the graph we've been looking for. Now if only this table could help us find our keys. Sample Problem A dataset is normally distributed, with a mean of 342 and a standard deviation of 74. What is the probability of getting a result of 166 or greater? Let's find the Z-score first, then we'll sketch what our probability looks like. Plugging into the Z-score formula we get: We put in our value first, then subtract the mean. Our result this time is a negative Z-score.  This looks like a problem. Our table only has positive values for Z. What a busted piece of junk, only giving us half of what we need. We'd demand a refund, but we found it for free. All is not lost, though. Remember, the normal distribution is symmetric around the mean. The probability above positive Z will be equal to the probability below negative Z.  That means there's a connection between 2.38, the number in the table, and -2.38, the number we need. A math connection, not a love connection, though. It is: Pr( x > 2.38) = Pr( x < -2.38) Watch those greater than and less than signs. It is super easy to mix up what they mean. That's why we're drawing so many graphs; they'll never give us up or let us down. The upshot here is that we don't have what we want yet. Using the standard normal table, we can find that Pr( x < -2.38) = Pr( x > 2.38) = 0.008656. That's the probability of getting a result below -2.38, but we want the probability above -2.38. The final piece of this puzzle is the fact that the total area underneath the curve of a normal distribution equals 1. The total probability of an event has to add up to 1 , so that makes sense. It's useful for us, because it means:  Setting up the problem we have: Pr( x > -2.38) = 1 – Pr( x < -2.38) = 1 – 0.008656 = 0.991344 And that's that. Our result matches what our first graph told us as well. Graphs: they stop us from making dumb mistakes. Sample Problem A dataset is normally distributed, with a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 25. What is the probability of getting a result between 63 and 80? How good of a juggler are you? Because now we have two points to handle at once, and we want the probability between the two of them. We'll start by converting both of the points into Z-scores. Pr(-0.28 < x < 0.40) = ? We have an ice cream sandwich of a problem; we want to get at the good stuff in the middle. Our standard normal table only gives us the area to the right of each Z-score, but we can use a little subtraction wizardry to sort this out.  Finding everything to the right of -0.28 will give us everything we need and some stuff we don't. What would we do with an extra kitchen sink anyway? If we subtract out all of the area to the right of 0.40, that will get rid of all the excess. We guess we can use the sink to cart off all the excess once we're done. Finding the area to the right of -0.28 is tricky, though, just like the last problem. Let's draw out the problem (in a good way) to solve this.  Now we have the problem in a table-friendly form. It'll always use a coaster for its drinks, and it won't stick its feet up on the table either. Pr( x > -0.28) = 1 – Pr( x > 0.28) Find Pr( x > 0.28) by going down the rows of the table to "0.20," then across until you hit column "0.08." = 1 – 0.389739 = 0.610261 Hey hey, don't go and circle this as the answer. We want Pr(-0.28 < x < 0.40), so we still need to subtract out Pr( x > 0.40). At least the area above 0.40 is easy to find on the table. Pr(-0.28 < x < 0.40) = Pr( x > -0.28) – Pr( x > 0.40) = 0.610261 – 0.344578 = 0.265683 There we go, that's our answer. It's not quite as delicious as an ice cream sandwich, but still satisfying to have. The More Things Change, The More They're Different Here's one last word of warning for when we're finding probabilities with normal distributions. The table we gave you isn't the only kind out there. Instead of giving the probabilities to the right of the Z-scores, sometimes they'll give everything to the left . Or the area between 0 and Z . Even using a fancy graphing calculator won't save us from this confusion. So, cut through all that nonsense by always drawing lots of little graphs. If we can see what we're looking for, and what the table gives us, then there will be no problem-o. Plus it lets us practice our unicorn doodles.

Video:  Standard Normal Distribution (4:12)  Finding Probabilities for a Normal Random Variable  LO 6.17: Find probabilities associated with a specified normal distribution.  As we saw, the Standard Deviation Rule is very limited in helping us answer probability questions, and basically limited to questions involving values that fall exactly 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations away from the mean. How do we answer probability questions in general? The key is the position of the value relative to the mean, measured in standard deviations.  We can approach the answering of probability questions two possible ways: a table and technology. In the next sections, you will learn how to use the “standard normal table,” and then how the same calculations can be done with technology.  Standardizing Values  The first step to assessing a probability associated with a normal value is to determine the relative value with respect to all the other values taken by that normal variable. This is accomplished by determining how many standard deviations below or above the mean that value is.   EXAMPLE: Foot Length  How many standard deviations below or above the mean male foot length is 13 inches? Since the mean is 11 inches, 13 inches is 2 inches above the mean.   Since a standard deviation is 1.5 inches, this would be 2 / 1.5 = 1.33 standard deviations above the mean. Combining these two steps, we could write:  (13 in. – 11 in.) / (1.5 inches per standard deviation) = (13 – 11) / 1.5 standard deviations = +1.33 standard deviations.    In the language of statistics, we have just found the z-score for a male foot length of 13 inches to be z = +1.33. Or, to put it another way, we have standardized the value of 13.   In general, the standardized value z tells how many standard deviations below or above the mean the original value is, and is calculated as follows:  z-score = (value – mean)/standard deviation  The convention is to denote a value of our normal random variable X with the letter “x.”    Notice that since the standard deviation (sigma, σ) is always positive, for values of x above the mean (mu, μ), z will be positive; for values of x below the mean (mu, μ), z will be negative.  Let’s go back to our foot length example, and answer some more questions.   EXAMPLE: Foot Length  (a) What is the standardized value for a male foot length of 8.5 inches? How does this foot length relate to the mean?  z = (8.5 – 11) / 1.5 = -1.67. This foot length is 1.67 standard deviations below the mean.  (b) A man’s standardized foot length is +2.5. What is his actual foot length in inches?  If z = +2.5, then his foot length is 2.5 standard deviations above the mean. Since the mean is 11, and each standard deviation is 1.5, we get that the man’s foot length is: 11 + 2.5(1.5) = 14.75 inches.   Note that z-scores also allow us to compare values of different normal random variables. Here is an example:  (c) In general, women’s foot length is shorter than men’s. Assume that women’s foot length follows a normal distribution with a mean of 9.5 inches and standard deviation of 1.2. Ross’ foot length is 13.25 inches, and Candace’s foot length is only 11.6 inches. Which of the two has a longer foot relative to his or her gender group?  To answer this question, let’s find the z-score of each of these two normal values, bearing in mind that each of the values comes from a different normal distribution.  Ross: z-score = (13.25 – 11) / 1.5 = 1.5 (Ross’ foot length is 1.5 standard deviations above the mean foot length for men).  Candace: z-score = (11.6 – 9.5) / 1.2 = 1.75 (Candace’s foot length is 1.75 standard deviations above the mean foot length for women).  Note that even though Ross’ foot is longer than Candace’s, Candace’s foot is longer relative to their respective genders.   Comment:   Part (c) above illustrates how z-scores become crucial when you want to compare distributions .    Did I Get This?: Standardized Scores (z-scores)  Finding Probabilities with the Normal Calculator and Table  Now that you have learned to assess the relative value of any normal value by standardizing, the next step is to evaluate probabilities. In other contexts, as mentioned before, we will first take the conventional approach of referring to a normal table , which tells the probability of a normal variable taking a value less than any standardized score z.  Standard Normal Table  Since normal curves are symmetric about their mean, it follows that the curve of z scores must be symmetric about 0. Since the total area under any normal curve is 1, it follows that the areas on either side of z = 0 are both 0.5. Also, according to the Standard Deviation Rule, most of the area under the standardized curve falls between z = -3 and z = +3.   The normal table outlines the precise behavior of the standard normal random variable Z, the number of standard deviations a normal value x is below or above its mean. The normal table provides probabilities that a standardized normal random variable Z would take a value less than or equal to a particular value z*.  These particular values are listed in the form *.* in rows along the left margins of the table, specifying the ones and tenths. The columns fine-tune these values to hundredths, allowing us to look up the probability of being below any standardized value z of the form *.**.  For example, in the part of the table shown below, we can see that for a z-score of -2.81, we would find P(Z < -2.81) = 0.0025.   By construction, the probability P(Z < z*) equals the area under the z curve to the left of that particular value z*.   A quick sketch is often the key to solving normal problems easily and correctly.  Although normal tables are the traditional way to solve these problems, you can also use the normal calculator.  Normal Distribution Calculator: Non-JAVA Version  The image below illustrates the results of using the online calculator to find P(Z < -2.81) and P(Z < 1.15). Notice that the calculator behaves exactly as the table.   It is your choice to use the table or the online calculator but we will usually illustrate with the online calculator.   EXAMPLE: Standard Normal Probabilities  (a) What is the probability of a normal random variable taking a value less than 2.8 standard deviations above its mean?  P(Z < 2.8) = 0.9974 or 99.74%.   (b) What is the probability of a normal random variable taking a value lower than 1.47 standard deviations below its mean?  P(Z < -1.47) = 0.0708, or 7.08%.   (c) What is the probability of a normal random variable taking a value more than 0.75 standard deviations above its mean?  The fact that the problem involves the word “more” rather than “less” should not be overlooked! Our normal calculator provides left-tail probabilities, and adjustments must be made for any other type of problem.  Method 1:  By symmetry of the z curve centered on 0,  P(Z > +0.75) = P(Z < -0.75) = 0.2266.   Method 2:  Because the total area under the normal curve is 1,  P(Z > +0.75) = 1 – P(Z < +0.75) = 1 – 0.7734 = 0.2266.   [ Note: most students prefer to use Method 1, which does not require subtracting 4-digit probabilities from 1.]  (d) What is the probability of a normal random variable taking a value between 1 standard deviation below and 1 standard deviation above its mean?  To find probabilities in between two standard deviations, we must put them in terms of the probabilities below. A sketch is especially helpful here:  P(-1 < Z < +1) = P(Z < +1) – P(Z < -1) = 0.8413 – 0.1587 = 0.6826.   Here are the normal calculator results which would be needed.    Did I Get This?: Standard Normal Probabilities  Comments:   So far, we have used the normal calculator or table to find a probability, given the number (z) of standard deviations below or above the mean. The solution process when using the table involved first locating the given z value of the form *.** in the margins, then finding the corresponding probability of the form 0.**** inside the table as our answer.    Now, in Example 2, a probability will be given and we will be asked to find a z value. The solution process using the table involves first locating the given probability of the form 0.**** inside the table, then finding the corresponding z value of the form *.** as our answer. For the online calculator, the solution is as simply typing in the correct probability and having the calculator solve, in reverse, for the z-score.   Finding Standard Normal Scores  LO 6.18: Given a probability, find scores associated with a specified normal distribution.  It is often good to think about this process as the reverse of finding probabilities. In these problems, we will be given some information about the area in a range and asked to provide the z-score(s) associated with that range. Common types of questions are   Find the standard normal z-score corresponding to the top (or bottom) 8%.  Find the standard normal z-score associated with the 25th percentile.  Find the standard normal z-scores which contain the middle 40%.    EXAMPLE: Given Probabilities – Find Z-Scores  (a) What standard normal z-score is associated with the bottom (or lowest) 1%? The probability is 0.01 that a standardized normal variable takes a value below what particular value of z?  The closest we can come to a probability of 0.01 inside the table is 0.0099, in the z = -2.3 row and 0.03 column: z = -2.33 . In other words, the probability is 0.01 that the value of a normal variable is lower than 2.33 standard deviations below its mean.   Using the online calculator, we simply use the calculator in reverse by typing in 0.01 in the “area” box (outlined in blue) and then click “compute” to see the associated z-score. Remember that, like the table, we always need to provide this calculator with the area to the left of the z-score we are currently trying to find.   (b) What standard normal z-score corresponds to the top (or upper) 15%? The probability is 0.15 that a standardized normal variable takes a value above what particular value of z?  Remember that the calculator and table only provide probabilities of being below a certain value, not above. Once again, we must rely on one of the properties of the normal curve to make an adjustment.  Method 1: According to the table, 0.15 (actually 0.1492) is the probability of being below -1.04. By symmetry, 0.15 must also be the probability of being above +1.04. Using the calculator, we can enter 0.15 exactly and find that the corresponding z-score is actually -1.036 giving a final answer of z = +1.036 or +1.04 if we round to two decimal places which is our preference (this results in no differences for students who use the table or the online calculator).   Method 2: If 0.15 is the probability of being above the value we seek, then 1 – 0.15 = 0.85 must be the probability of being below the value we seek. According to the table, 0.85 (actually 0.8508) is the probability of being below +1.04.   In other words, we have found 0.15 to be the probability that a normal variable takes a value more than 1.04 standard deviations above its mean.  (c) What standard normal z-scores contain the middle 95%? The probability is 0.95 that a normal variable takes a value within how many standard deviations of its mean?  A symmetric area of 0.95 centered at 0 extends to values -z* and +z* such that the remaining (1 – 0.95) / 2 = 0.025 is below -z* and also 0.025 above +z*. The probability is 0.025 that a standardized normal variable is below -1.96. Thus, the probability is 0.95 that a normal variable takes a value within 1.96 standard deviations of its mean. Once again, the Standard Deviation Rule is shown to be just roughly accurate, since it states that the probability is 0.95 that a normal variable takes a value within 2 standard deviations of its mean.     Did I Get This?:  Finding Standard Normal Scores  Although the online calculator can provide results for any probability or z-score, our standard normal table, like most, only provides probabilities for z values between -3.49 and +3.49. The following example demonstrates how to handle cases where z exceeds 3.49 in absolute value.   EXAMPLE: Extreme Probabilities  (a) What is the probability of a normal variable being lower than 5.2 standard deviations below its mean?  There is no need to panic about going “off the edge” of the normal table. We already know from the Standard Deviation Rule that the probability is only about (1 -0 .997) / 2 = 0.0015 that a normal value would be more than 3 standard deviations away from its mean in one direction or the other. The table provides information for z values as extreme as plus or minus 3.49: the probability is only 0.0002 that a normal variable would be lower than 3.49 standard deviations below its mean. Any more standard deviations than that, and we generally say the probability is approximately zero.  In this case, we would say the probability of being lower than 5.2 standard deviations below the mean is approximately zero:  P(Z < -5.2) = 0 (approx.)  (b) What is the probability of the value of a normal variable being higher than 6 standard deviations below its mean?  Since the probability of being lower than 6 standard deviations below the mean is approximately zero, the probability of being higher than 6 standard deviations below the mean must be approximately 1.  P(Z > -6) = 1 (approx.)  (c) What is the probability of a normal variable being less than 8 standard deviations above the mean?  Approximately 1. P(Z < +8) = 1 (approx.)  (d) What is the probability of a normal variable being greater than 3.5 standard deviations above the mean?  Approximately 0. P(Z > +3.5) = 0 (approx.)

The standard normal distribution is centered at zero and the degree to which a given measurement deviates from the mean is given by the standard deviation. For the standard normal distribution, 68% of the observations lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean; 95% lie within two standard deviation of the mean; and 99.9% lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean. To this point, we have been using "X" to denote the variable of interest (e.g., X=BMI, X=height, X=weight). However, when using a standard normal distribution, we will use "Z" to refer to a variable in the context of a standard normal distribution. After standarization, the BMI=30 discussed on the previous page is shown below lying 0.16667 units above the mean of 0 on the standard normal distribution on the right.     ====  Since the area under the standard curve = 1, we can begin to more precisely define the probabilities of specific observation. For any given Z-score we can compute the area under the curve to the left of that Z-score. The table in the frame below shows the probabilities for the standard normal distribution. Examine the table and note that a "Z" score of 0.0 lists a probability of 0.50 or 50%, and a "Z" score of 1, meaning one standard deviation above the mean, lists a probability of 0.8413 or 84%. That is because one standard deviation above and below the mean encompasses about 68% of the area, so one standard deviation above the mean represents half of that of 34%. So, the 50% below the mean plus the 34% above the mean gives us 84%.  Probabilities of the Standard Normal Distribution Z         This table is organized to provide the area under the curve to the left of or less of a specified value or "Z value". In this case, because the mean is zero and the standard deviation is 1, the Z value is the number of standard deviation units away from the mean, and the area is the probability of observing a value less than that particular Z value. Note also that the table shows probabilities to two decimal places of Z. The units place and the first decimal place are shown in the left hand column, and the second decimal place is displayed across the top row.  But let's get back to the question about the probability that the BMI is less than 30, i.e., P(X<30). We can answer this question using the standard normal distribution. The figures below show the distributions of BMI for men aged 60 and the standard normal distribution side-by-side.  Distribution of BMI and Standard Normal Distribution   ====  The area under each curve is one but the scaling of the X axis is different. Note, however, that the areas to the left of the dashed line are the same. The BMI distribution ranges from 11 to 47, while the standardized normal distribution, Z, ranges from -3 to 3. We want to compute P(X < 30). To do this we can determine the Z value that corresponds to X = 30 and then use the standard normal distribution table above to find the probability or area under the curve. The following formula converts an X value into a Z score , also called a standardized score :   where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the variable X.  In order to compute P(X < 30) we convert the X=30 to its corresponding Z score (this is called standardizing ):   Thus, P(X < 30) = P(Z < 0.17). We can then look up the corresponding probability for this Z score from the standard normal distribution table, which shows that P(X < 30) = P(Z < 0.17) = 0.5675. Thus, the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI less than 30 is 56.75%.  Another Example  Using the same distribution for BMI, what is the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI exceeding 35? In other words, what is P(X > 35)? Again we standardize:   We now go to the standard normal distribution table to look up P(Z>1) and for Z=1.00 we find that P(Z<1.00) = 0.8413. Note, however, that the table always gives the probability that Z is less than the specified value, i.e., it gives us P(Z<1)=0.8413.   Therefore, P(Z>1)=1-0.8413=0.1587. Interpretation: Almost 16% of men aged 60 have BMI over 35.  Normal Probability Calculator         Z-Scores with R  As an alternative to looking up normal probabilities in the table or using Excel, we can use R to compute probabilities. For example,  > pnorm(0)  [1] 0.5  A Z-score of 0 (the mean of any distribution) has 50% of the area to the left. What is the probability that a 60 year old man in the population above has a BMI less than 29 (the mean)? The Z-score would be 0, and pnorm(0)=0.5 or 50%.  What is the probability that a 60 year old man will have a BMI less than 30? The Z-score was 0.16667.  > pnorm(0.16667)  [1] 0.5661851  So, the probabilty is 56.6%.  What is the probability that a 60 year old man will have a BMI greater than 35?  35-29=6, which is one standard deviation above the mean. So we can compute the area to the left  > pnorm(1)  [1] 0.8413447  and then subtract the result from 1.0.  1-0.8413447= 0.1586553  So the probability of a 60 year ld man having a BMI greater than 35 is 15.8%.  Or, we can use R to compute the entire thing in a single step as follows:  > 1-pnorm(1)  [1] 0.1586553    Probability for a Range of Values   What is the probability that a male aged 60 has BMI between 30 and 35? Note that this is the same as asking what proportion of men aged 60 have BMI between 30 and 35. Specifically, we want P(30 < X < 35)? We previously computed P(30<X) and P(X<35); how can these two results be used to compute the probability that BMI will be between 30 and 35? Try to formulate and answer on your own before looking at the explanation below.  Answer     Now consider BMI in women. What is the probability that a female aged 60 has BMI less than 30? We use the same approach, but for women aged 60 the mean is 28 and the standard deviation is 7.  Answer     What is the probability that a female aged 60 has BMI exceeding 40? Specifically, what is P(X > 40)?  Answer     return to top | previous page | next page     Content ©2016. All Rights Reserved. Date last modified: July 24, 2016. Wayne W. LaMorte, MD, PhD, MPH Boston University School of Public Health            z score Calculator    The probability of a result x in an experiment consisting of a
large number of equally probable independent trials n is
approximated by the normal probability density function :     where μ, the mean value , is n /2 and
σ,
the standard deviation , is a measure of the breadth of the
curve which, for experiments with two equally probable outcomes
of each trial is:     Since the mean value and standard deviation depend upon the number
of trials in the experiment, comparison between experiments
with differing numbers of trials is facilitated by standardising the result: transforming it
to a distribution with mean value zero and standard deviation
of 1.  A normally distributed experimental result x is thus standardised by subtracting the mean and dividing
by the standard deviation of the experiment:     This z-value or z score expresses the
divergence of the experimental result x from the
most probable result μ as a number of standard
deviations σ
The larger the value of z , the less probable the
experimental result is due to chance.  The probability
can be calculated from the cumulative standard
normal distribution :     Which gives the probability P that an experimental
result with a z value less than or equal to that
observed is due to chance.  Subtracting P from one:     gives Q , the probability that the observed z score is due to chance.  Unfortunately, there is no closed form solution for P , so it
must be evaluated numerically.  This page allows you to calculate the
probability of chance occurrence of a given z , or to
calculate z given a probability Q .  All
calculations are performed with six decimal places of accuracy; the
maximum z accepted is 6.  Note that the probability calculated from the z is an approximation which is valid only for large
values of n , and is therefore only meaningful when
calculated for experiments with a large number of
individual trials.   In order to use this page, your browser must support JavaScript.

Our objective in this lesson is to get by that roadblock and demonstrate that what lies beyond is not really so bad. In fact, the road may be quite smooth once you understand probability and its usefulness for interpreting measurement data.  Probability is important because it helps us understand the chances of making a correct inference or decision on the basis of a limited amount of data. Data is often limited because of cost considerations, therefore, it is very important to interpret that data properly. For example, in evaluating the performance of a new laboratory method by analyzing 40 specimens on a new method and a comparison method, what is the probability, or chance, that the difference observed between methods represents a real measurement error and not just a figment of the noise in the data (random error, imprecision, or scatter). In laboratory quality control, where it is common to make only two or three measurements, what is the probability of detecting medically important errors when using a Levey-Jennings control chart with control limits set as the mean plus and minus 2 SD? What is the chance of a false rejection, i.e., an out-of-control signal even though the method is working properly?  You most likely have already been exposed to the topic of probability in earlier courses. You may have used probability in your genetics class to construct a Punnet square. You may have used probability theory in chemistry to predict the number of isomers for compounds containing asymmetric carbon groups.  Probability  Probability is a number from 0.00 to 1.00 that represents the chance that an event will occur. A probability of 1.00 means the event will always occur. A probability of 0.00 means the event will never occur. It's also common to talk about the chance of occurrence, which is commonly described by percentage figures between 0.0% and 100.0%.  Coin toss examples. What is the chance of tossing a coin and having it land heads up (H)? Mathematically, the chance of H or probability of H on one toss of one fair coin (that has one head and one tail) is equal to the number of heads (H) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (heads plus tails, or H + T): Pr(H) = H/(H+T) or ½ or 0.50. That's why it's fair to toss a coin to decide which football team gets to receive the ball and which has to kick off because both sides have an equal or 50% chance with a single coin toss.  Now, if we tossed five coins, what would be the most likely outcome? The answer is some combination of heads and tails. Intuitively, we know that the chance of tossing 5 coins and having all of them come up heads is quite small. That chance is the product of each of the single episodes: Pr(H) = (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = (1/2) 5 or (0.5) 5 or 0.03125. There is only a probability of about 0.03 or a 3% chance of getting heads on all 5 coins.          With a 5 coin toss, it's likely to see some combinations of heads and tails based on these possible outcomes: 5H+0T, 4H+1T, 3H+2T, 2H+3T, 1H+4T, and 0H+5T. All heads would occur 1/32 times or 0.03 probability, as shown at the right. Similarly, all tails would occur 0.03 of the time. Intuitively, the greatest possibility lies in having some mixture of H and T, possibly 2.5 heads - but that number is not a reality or a real number here. The expected frequency distribution can be seen in the top figure, which shows the distribution of possibilities as fractions of 32nds. The possibilities total to thirty-two 32nds or unity. The area under the curve is greatest between 2 and 4 heads, i.e., that is the highest probability or most likely outcome.  Probability distribution.  The frequency distribution for a 10 coin toss is shown in the second figure. Again, intuitively speaking, the greatest possibility is some mixture of H and T. With a 10 coin toss, achieving half heads or 5 is a real number, and the maximum probability is 0.50, as shown by the peak of the curve.  The distribution of a 20 coin toss is seen in the third figure. Again, the greatest area under the curve indicates some combination of heads and tails. When increasing the number of coins or events, the curves begin to look like normal distribution curves. As the number of events exceeds 30, the graph is considered to approximate a normal curve.        Statistical significance. The importance of this point is that a normal curve can often be used to assess the probability that an event or observed difference occurs by chance or by cause. In interpreting experimental results, it is common to use a probability of 0.05 as the cutoff between a chance occurrence and a cause occurrence. If the probability is greater than 0.05, i.e., Pr>0.05, the conclusion is that no difference exists. If Pr<0.05, then it is often concluded that a statistically significant difference has been observed; in short, that means there is a real difference due to some cause. That's why an understanding of probability is very useful for making inferences or decisions on the basis of experimental data. In the next section, we will see where that 0.05 comes from.   Standard Normal Distribution  The standard normal distribution or the unit normal distribution is a special normal curve made up of z-scores. Remember that a z-score is a standard score (also called the standard Gaussian variable) that is calculated by subtracting the mean from a value and dividing the result by the standard deviation: z = (value - mean)/standard deviation. For example, if the mean were 100 and the value were 110, then the difference between the mean and the value is 10. If the standard deviation were 5, then the difference of 10 has 2 SD's in it, thereby it is equal to 2z.  As discussed in lessons 1 and 2, this is one of those statistical forms that appears repeatedly in laboratory statistics. The formula is used to express the number of standard deviations in the difference between a value and the mean. The values for z range from zero to infinity. The figure shows that the most common z-scores are from 0.00 to 3.00. A z of 0.00 represents the mean and the range of z from +3.00 to - 3.00 encompasses almost all of the area of the distribution. In statistical language, this distribution can be described as N(0,1), which indicates distribution is normal (N) and has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.  Area under a normal curve. The total area under the curve is equal to 1.00 or unity. Half of the area, or 0.50, is on either side of the mean. The area between the mean and -1.00 z is 0.34 and the area between the mean and +1.00 z is 0.34, therefore the mean +/- 1.00z represents 68% of the area under a normal curve. The area between -2.00 z and +2.00 z is 0.47 + 0.47 or approximately 95% of the area under the curve. Between -3.00 z and + 3.00 z is 0.49 + 0.49 or approximately 99% of the area under the curve. (These numbers should seem familiar to laboratorians.) Note also that the use of +/- 2.00 z encompasses 95% of the area or a .95 probability. The remaining 1% or 0.01 probability is left in the tails of the curve. Z-scores can also be listed as decimal fractions of the 1's, 2's, and 3's we have been using thus far. For example, you could have 1.40 z's. Here the decimal fraction is carried out to the hundreths place.  Table of areas under a normal curve. It is often convenient to use a table of areas under a standard normal curve to convert an observed z-score into the area or probability represented by that score. See the table of areas under a standard normal curve which shows the z-score in the left column and the corresponding area in the next column. In actuality, the area represented in the table is only one half of the normal curve, but since the normal curve is symmetrical, the other half can also be estimated from the same table and the 0.50 on the upper half plus the 0.50 in the lower half equals 1.00 or all of the distribution.  As an example use of the table, a z-score of 1.40 is listed as having an area of 0.4192. This indicates that 41.92% of the area is between the mean or center of the distribution and the z-score of 1.40. The area beyond that particular z-score to the tail end of the distribution would be the difference between 0.5000 and the value of 0.4192, or 0.0808 because the table represents one half or 0.5000 of the area of the distribution. Now let's look at the lower half of the distribution down to a z-score of -1.40 (i.e. a negative 1.40). This too represents an area of .4192. At +/- 1.40, you would have .4192 plus .4192 or .9394 of the are under the curve. Sometimes statisticians want to accumulate all of the negative z-score area (the left half of the curve) and add to that some of the postive z-score area. All of the negative area equals .5000 plus some of the positive area, here .4192, added together would give .9142.  Here is an example of how to use the table: to find the area for a z-score of 1.96, find the value of 1.9 in the leftmost column, then find the hundredth figure from the column heading for .06, and read the area below that column, e.g., 0.4750. The area from -1.96 to +1.96 would encompass 2*0.475 or 95% of the area under a normal curve, leaving 5% outside those limits or 5% in the tails. Note that we commonly think of a 95% range as the mean plus or minus 2z or 2 SD, but that's an approximation and the exact z-score should be 1.96.  At 3.00 z, the area under the curve is 0.4987, which leaves an area of approximately 0.0013 outside in the tail. The area from -3.00 to +3.00 encompasses 2*0.4987 or 99.74% of the area, leaving only 0.26% outside. This is why 3 SD control limits have a very low chance of false rejections compared to 2 SD limits.  z-score transformation formula. The concept of the standard normal distribution will become increasingly important because there are many useful applications. If the population mean, µ, and the population standard deviation, , of any normally distributed data are known, the z-scores can be computed through the use of the following z score transformation formula:  z = (X - µ)/s  Again the formula represents the value minus the mean all divided by the standard deviation. The formula defines the difference score (X - µ or X-Xbar or delta, as seen in earlier lessons), according to how many standard deviation units it represents.  Proficiency testing example. One useful application is in proficiency testing (PT), where a laboratory analyzes a series of samples to demonstrate that it can provide correct answers. The results from PT surveys often include z-scores. For example, a glucose test value on a proficiency testing sample is observed to be 275 mg/dl. Other laboratories that analyzed this same sample show a mean value of 260 and a standard deviation of 6.0 mg/dL. In comparison to these values, our laboratory's analysis has a z-score of +2.50, which means that less than 1% of other laboratories got a higher test result (observe that a z-score of +2.50 corresponds to an area of 0.4938, which leaves only 0.0062 or 0.62% of the area in the tail above 2.50). Said another way, there is only a very small chance that the 275 mg/dL glucose value belongs with the rest of the proficiency testing values. Said another way, there is only a 0.0228 probability, or a very small chance, that the 275 glucose really does belong with the other values. Most likely it represents a measurement error by the laboratory.  z-scores vs SDs. Because there is so much confusion concerning this topic, it's worthwhile to review the relation between z-score and standard deviations (SD). The lines between statistical definitions sometimes blur over time.  Remember that the mean and standard deviation are the first statistics that are calculated to describe the variation of measurements or distribution of results. The standard deviation is a term that has the same units as the measurement, therefore it can be used to describe the actual range of measurement results that might be expected.  A z-score can be calculated once the mean and standard deviation are available. The calculated z-score [z-score = (value - mean)/SD] describes where a value is located in the distribution, e.g., a z-score of 0 is at the mean of the distribution and a z-score of 2.0 or beyond is in the tails of the distribution. Notice that SD is in the denominator of the z-score formula, so SD's and z's are not really the same. The z-score is a ratio and therefore is unitless, whereas the SD is expressed in concentration units.  But, we tend to think in terms of ±2SD as if they were ±2z. We use the SD like a z-score by saying that, if a value falls out of the curve >±2SD, then it is different from 95% of the rest of the curve (we probably should have been saying ±2z). When a value lies at >±2z's (SD's), then that value is outside of the 95% area under the curve. So 1.00 - 0.95 = 0.05. That value lies in the 0.05 area of the tails. We often use this probability of 0.05 as an indicator of statistical significance, i.e. when a value falls out >±2SD (or z's), then a statistically significant or real difference has been observed (with Pr < 0.05 that the value is a chance occurrence).  Relationship to t-distribution. In the above PT example, the population mean (µ) and the population standard deviation (s) were known quantities, i.e., the data from all laboratories participating in the proficiency testing survey were included in the calculations, thus the true mean and true standard deviation are known for the whole population. When the population mean and standard deviation are not known, which is a more typical situation, z-scores cannot be calculated. In fact, in most laboratory applications, µ and s are not known. There is, however, another family of distributions - the t-distributions - which can be used when the µ and s are approximated by Xbar and SD.  The t-distributions generally are said to have "heavier tails" as compared to the normal distribution. As the sample size gets larger and larger (N increases to about 30 or 40), these distributions begin to approximate the normal curve and can be used much like the unit normal curve because ±2t accumulates about 95% of the area under the curve. A t-value can be calculated much like a z-value, e.g., tcalc = (observed value - mean)/sXbar, where sXbar represents the standard error of the mean, which we learned about in lesson 5. If tcalc is greater than +/- 2, then a conclusion can be drawn about that particular value. A t-distribution can be used to help in making the decision that the means of two samples are far enough apart to be considered to be different, i.e., the difference is statistically significant, or close enough together to be considered the same, i.e., the difference is not statistically significant. When N is less than 30, it will be necessary to look up a critical t-value from a table.   Self-assessment questions   What is the probability of tossing three fair coins and getting all heads? What's the probability of getting three tails? What's the probability of getting some other combination of heads and tails?  What is a z-score?  For a z-score of 1.65, what is the area of the standard normal curve below that value? What is the area above that value?  How is the standard normal curve useful for data interpretation?  If an observed difference is greater than +/- 2 z, that difference is considered statistically significant at what probability?  Under what conditions do you use a t-distribution rather than a z-distribution?   About the author: Madelon F. Zady  Madelon F.

Now let's look at how we can perform a hypothesis test, first, by using the Z score. We will start with an understanding of Z scores.  A Z score is a number of standard deviations a score is above or below the mean. In the Standard Normal Distribution, the mean is always equal to 0 and the standard deviation is equal to 1.0. The Z scores help us to describe various aspects of the distribution, such as percentile ranks, percentages of scores between points, etc. In short, it allows us to compare any one score to any other score in a distribution, or across distributions because it is standardized based on the distributions mean and standard deviation. Take a look at the following diagrams of the normal distribution. This breaks down the percentage of the distribution falling between the Z scores. This is a constant. Thus we can see that almost, but not quite all of the distribution lies between the Z scores of -3 and 3.  Normal distribution and Z scores:     This 3-part diagram shows the percent of a normal distribution that lies between 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from the mean: between -1 and 1 you can find approximately 68%; between -2 and 2 is approximately 95%; and between -3 and 3 is approximately 99.7% -- practically everything! All normal models follow this pattern, so a common name for this property is the 68-95-99.7 Rule. These percentages also represent the probability of finding a z score in one of these intervals, so this rule can be useful in answering probability questions such as we find in hypothesis testing.  Here is another view of the Standard Normal Distribution. In this diagram the percentages represent the amount of the distribution between consecutive Z scores (-2 and -1, -1 and 0, etc.).   The diagram also illustrates how the Z scores fall on the normal distribution. Each Z score represents a unit of standard deviation away from the mean. To understand this lets look at an IQ distribution with M=100 and SD=12. A Z score of 1 is 12 units away from the mean; a Z score of 2 is 24 units away from the mean and so on. Because the normal distribution is symmetrical about the mean, as you can see by the percentage breakdown, then a Z score of -2 is also 24 units away from the mean.   Now let's look at this in terms of raw scores. If the mean of our distribution is 100, then a Z score of 2 is equal to a raw score of 124. A Z score of -2 is equal to a raw score of 76.  Now we can start to compare individual's scores on this test. A problem we might run into however, is that our raw scores (the scores individuals get on the IQ test) will rarely fall right onto our Z scores. So we will have to know how to convert each raw score into a Z score. And vice-versa, we will need to know how to convert our Z scores into raw scores.  So, what if our friend Carl was one of the individuals in this distribution of IQ scores. He scored a 115 on the test. What is his Z score? Following the information already given, we know that a Z score of 1 is equal to 112 and a Z score of 2 is equal to 124. Therefore we know that Carl's Z score should be between 1 and 2. But to find out the exact Z score we turn to the Z score formula:   Thus:     If Carl scored 115 of the IQ test, his converted Z score is 1.25. This means Carl's IQ is 1.25 standard deviations above the population mean IQ score. Why is this important? Well lets say that our cousin Bob just took the IQ test in another location (part of a different distribution). The mean of that distribution was 105 with a standard deviation equal to 18. Who performed better? We can't just compare them directly because the distributions are different. Hence the standardization of our scores. If Bob scored 118 let's find his Z score.     So even though Bob's raw score was higher, after standardization,we can conclude that Carl scored higher relative to others in his distribution than did Bob.  Let's go the other way now. Going back to our first distribution (M=100, SD=12) we know that another individual had a Z score equal to -0.95. We can find this by solving the Z score formula for x.    This demonstrates that we can use Z scores to gain understanding into an individual's performance. We can also use them to determine where in a distribution a scores falls. To accomplish this we will turn to the following table.         As the title of this table suggests, we can use Z scores to determine how much of a distribution is represented. This particular Z score table, and there are many versions, only gives the area under the normal curve for points between the mean and Z as depicted below.       So, If we have a Z score of 1.25 then the area under the curve from Mean to Z is 39.44%. But remember that we still have the other half of the distribution. Since a normal distribution is symmetrical, that means that 50% lies on both sides of the distribution. So, if we have a Z score of 1.25, that means that it is at the 89.44th percentile (39.44+50). It also means that even though the information is not given, we know that 10.56% is in the area beyond our Z score.    PRACTICE PROBLEM #1  What percentage of scores would fall below a Z score of 2.56?  ANSWER    PRACTICE PROBLEM #2  What percentage of scores would be greater than a Z score of -1.56?  ANSWER    PRACTICE PROBLEM #3  What percentage of scores would fall BETWEEN Z scores of -1.0 and 1.0?  ANSWER        Now let's go backwards from a percentage to the Z score. What if we know that a particular score is at the 85th percentile? Using the Z score table, what could we use as the Z score? The Z score would be 1.03. What if we knew that exactly 2.5% of the distribution was beyond our Z score? What is that Z score? 1.96. (we will see this one again). HINT: remember to draw the distribution. Percentiles range from the 1st percentile towards the 100th percentile     If you didn't guess these, remember that we have to account for the 50% of the distribution in the other half, and that our table only gives us from the mean to Z. So for 85%, we have to subtract 50 to get 35%. We then look for the value closest to 35% (or the value just below it) and move backwards to find our Z score. 1.03, see? For 2.5%, we have to remember that we are looking at the area beyond the Z, therefore we must subtract it from 50. 50 - 2.5= 47.5. Giving us a Z score of 1.96.    PRACTICE PROBLEM 4  What is the Z score for the 15th percentile ?  ANSWER    PRACTICE PROBLEM 5  What is the Z score for the 75th percentile?  ANSWER  You may have asked yourself (several times, in fact) why this matters, or of what use is this information? Well this is how we are going to determine if there is a significant difference between groups. We will do this by setting a critical value, a threshold, using the alpha level and corresponding Z scores in much the same way that we have been practicing. This critical value is going to look at the area beyond the Z score as this will represent the scores that ARE NOT in the typical population.  Of course, this is going to require some additional knowledge; the difference between a 1-tailed hypothesis and a 2-tailed hypothesis. A 1-tailed hypothesis means that we, the researchers, are predicting a specific response. Putting it into our Magistrate example, if we were to predict a DECREASE in the number of deaths after eating citron then we just stated a 1-tailed hypothesis. If we were testing a new pill that changed our IQ, we could make another 1-tailed hypothesis by stating that the drug would INCREASE our IQ. The 1-tailed hypothesis is directional. A 2-tailed hypothesis on the other hand means that we had no specific idea of what would happen. For example, we could be engaging in exploratory research to discover whether our new teaching method increased OR decreased the average performance in our classroom. The 2-tailed hypothesis is non directional.  Let's tie this together by first looking at a scenario using an alpha level of 0.05. If you look at the normal distribution diagram, you see that 0.05% would be in the tails. So conversely 95% of our distribution would be in the main body of the distribution. If we have a 2-tailed hypothesis test, that means that we have to split this 5% among both tails. So for a 2-tailed hypothesis test, if the alpha level is set at 0.05, then moving backwards from 2.5% (the area under the curve, beyond the Z) to a Z score we get +/-1.96. Since it is 2-tailed, we don't know if our score will be on the high or low end of the distribution hence the positive or negative Z score. In any case, this is our critical value. In this case a critical Z score. This means that the probability of an event occurring by chance, using the normal distribution, is 5%. We need our calculated Z score to pass 1.96 (the critical value) to be significantly different than the rest of the population at a level greater than chance.   What if we set the alpha level at 0.01? For a 2-tailed hypothesis test, the z score is +/- 2.58. This should start to make intuitive sense. An alpha level of 0.01 is more conservative than one of 0.05 because we are now saying that there is only a 1% chance of committing Type I error. 2.58 is larger than 1.96, therefore it is more difficult to show significant difference at the 0.01 level because our calculated Z score now has to pass the critical Z score of 2.58.  This of course, was looking at a 2-tailed hypothesis test. What about 1-tailed tests? We still need to find a Z score that corresponds to our alpha level, but now the entire percentage would lie in one tail, on one side of the distribution. An alpha level of 0.05 for a 1-tailed test would therefore be equal to a critical Z score of 1.64. An alpha level of 0.01 for a 1-tailed hypothesis would be equal to a critical Z score of 2.33.       return to top | previous page | next page    standard page Created with SoftChalk    {|�u6:3v���˟�3�9�|*�ϝT���n=Mtb=�Ж��9�̰�b��z�Z�����I� $}��

I know that z-score ranges form -3 to 3  Consider this one ...  mean = 70, standard deviation = 4  I need to find $P(65 < X < 85)$.  Transforming to standard normal gives $P(-1.25 < Z < 3.75)$  How to deal with the $3.75$?  Edit *Actually it's not greater than 3, $z < 3.75$. I meant smaller than, sorry.

They never get big again... just smaller and smaller. So if your table of $p$-values for $z$ statistics stops at three, it probably says the $p$-value is 0.000 or something like that (really meaning < 0.001), and you can simply use that to conduct your tests. – Alexis  May 14 '14 at 21:08        add a comment |           4 Answers 4     active  oldest  votes            up vote  4  down vote  accepted      Let me repeat (and correct) what I've said in my comment ad reply to your edit.  You have to transfer from $X$ to $Z$ in order to use a z-score table. Since a z-score table contains a small finite subset of values, you often must settle for an approximation. So you could also settle for $P(Z<-3)\approx 0$ and $P(Z< 3)\approx 1$ (NB: $P(Z>3)\approx 1$ was a typo, sorry.)  As to $P(-1.25<Z<3.75)$, I'll use this z-score table :
$$P(-1.25<Z<3.75)=P(Z<3.75)-P(Z<-1.25)\approx 1-0.1056=0.8944$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 17 '14 at 8:21             answered May 14 '14 at 21:24       Sergio   2,963 5 15              add a comment |              up vote  6  down vote      For $z >0$, the right tail of the standard normal distribution 
(that is, the area to the right of $z$) which is often denoted by 
$Q(z)$ is bounded as follows:  $$\frac{\exp(-z^2/2)}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\left (\frac{1}{z} - \frac{1}{z^3}\right )
\ < \ Q(z) \ < \ \frac{\exp(-z^2/2)}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\left (\frac{1}{z}\right ).$$  See, for example this answer on math.SE for a proof. The bounds blow up/down to $\pm \infty$ as $z \to 0$ but are quite useful in the
regions not covered by typical tables of the cumulative distribution function
of the standard normal random variable. For example,
$$0.0000873 < Q(3.75) < 0.0000940$$ while the actual value is slightly larger than $0.0000884$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:19       Community ♦   1        answered May 14 '14 at 23:20       Dilip Sarwate   26.4k 1 44 129                  I pondered whether to include a calculation based on the series for Mill's ratio ($Q(z)/\phi(z)$) in my answer - I even typed in something under a point "iv)" but then deleted it instead of posting it.

Mills whose name appeared on a tabulation he did for Karl Pearson. He didn't invent or discover the ratio and he published nothing else, it seems. – Nick Cox  May 15 '14 at 8:31        1      Connecting this answer with that of @Glen_b, it is interesting that a crude application of Simpson's Rule to the interval $[z, z+2h]$ with $h\approx 3/z$--beyond which the integrand clearly gets very small compared to its value at $z$--yields the approximation $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp(-z^2/2)/z$ with $O(z^{-3})$ error. – whuber ♦  May 15 '14 at 16:06        1      An even cruder approximation is as follows. For $z>0$, the tangent to $\phi(z)$, which has slope $-z\phi(z)$, crosses the horizontal axis at $z+z^{-1}$. For $z>1$, the right triangle whose hypotenuse is the tangent and whose base extends from $z$ to $z+z^{-1}$ lies wholly in the region that we integrate to find $Q(z)$. This triangle has area $\frac{\phi(z)}{2z}$ giving that $$Q(z) > \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{\exp(-z^2/2)}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\left (\frac{1}{z}\right )$$ which is half the upper bound. Crude, but better than the lower bound which has value $0$ at $z=1$ – Dilip Sarwate  May 16 '14 at 20:31         add a comment |             up vote  4  down vote      The standard normal ranges from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.  Your problem appears to be that your table doesn't go further.  Your question should therefore be modified to ask "*How do I deal with the fact that my table doesn't go as high as my $Z$ value?*"  [Note that in your last paragraph, you have become confused. The region you're evaluating probability for is $Z<3.75$ but the boundary value of $Z$ you're trying to look up in the table (the $3.75$) is $>3$, as in your title.]  It seems like not having the value in your table would be a problem, but it's a very small one $-$ since your answer for $P(0<Z<3.75)$ can't be smaller than $P(0<Z<3)\approx 0.4999$ and can't be larger than $P(0<Z<\infty)=0.5$, you shouldn't have much difficulty narrowing the answer down to 3 significant figures of accuracy even so.  Additional accuracy (though I really don't think you need it) can be obtained by many methods. Here are three:  i) finding better tables ( these seem to be of the same form as the ones you're apparently using)  ii) using a package that will evaluate standard normal cdfs for you. I just used R (simply typing pnorm(3.75) to obtain $P(-\infty<Z<3.75)$).  iii) using numerical integration to approximate the area between 3 and 3.75. For example, via Simpson's rule , a single interval (3 points) gives 0.0017 (the correct answer is 0.0013 to 4dp). Alternatively, because the density is convex in this region (indeed, as whuber points out in comments, convex for $Z>1$ and $Z< -1$), the integral will be bounded below by the midpoint rule and above by the trapezoidal rule, which usefully bounds where the answer can lie  But, really, just using the limits provided by 3 and $\infty$ is plenty, I imagine.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 14 '14 at 23:00             answered May 14 '14 at 22:46       Glen_b ♦   193k 21 352 676                  +1. To head off a possible unintended reading of this answer, note that the density is not convex everywhere--only for $|Z|\gt 1$. – whuber ♦  May 14 '14 at 22:53         1      @whuber quite right - I intended to type "convex in this region" but somehow it didn't end up in the text. I will fix that, thanks. – Glen_b ♦  May 14 '14 at 22:57        add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      The z (i.e., normal) distribution is not bounded. $\mathcal N(\mu=70,\sigma=4)$ is not standard normal either – that refers to $\mathcal N(0,1)$ . If you're wondering what the p value is for z = 3.75, you can find it in r with pnorm(3.75) . (You could also use pnorm(85,70,4) .) The result is p =  0.9999116.  If you want an exact p value, I think you're going to have an easier time getting it in R or some other statistical software than by dealing with the quantile function directly...but FWIW, here's that equation :   $$F^{-1}(p)
      = \mu + \sigma\Phi^{-1}(p)
      = \mu + \sigma\sqrt2\,\operatorname{erf}^{-1}(2p - 1), \quad p\in(0,1)$$   In the above, $\rm erf$ refers to the error function .  In light of your comments and edit to the question, I think I should decline to provide more than this as a "hint" in following our policy on self-study questions .     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 16 '17 at 16:02       Community ♦   1        answered May 14 '14 at 20:49       Nick Stauner   10.1k 5 35 77                  i think i'v been learning things the wrong way !  i didn't got your answer, but in class they use this formula to transfer from X to Z Z = (X-μ)/σ ---> (X-MEAN)/STD  am i right ? – Mr.Cat  May 14 '14 at 20:54         1      Basically, yes, that's the way to z -score. FWIW, using a sample mean and standard deviation in place of the population parameters yields t -scores instead. I'm not sure I understood what you were after, but there is nothing particularly difficult about handling z scores larger than 3, except maybe not being able to look up corresponding p values in a textbook table. IMO, it's better to leave the table behind and start calculating statistics anyway. – Nick Stauner  May 14 '14 at 21:02         1      @Mr.Cat, you have to transfer from $X$ to $Z$ in order to use a z-score table. Since a z-score table contains a small finite subset of values, you often must settle for an approximation. So you could also settle for $P(Z<3)\approx 0$ and $P(Z>3)\approx 1$. – Sergio  May 14 '14 at 21:02             @NickStauner i think i'll look for a another way to solve this .. and thanks for the help .. also thanks for letting me know that i'm learning shit at stat class! – Mr.Cat  May 14 '14 at 21:09        1      @Sergio your inequalities contain typographical errors (they both go the wrong way). No doubt you intended them the other way around, but I think I have to mention it so that later readers are aware that $P(Z<3)\approx 1$ and $P(Z>3)\approx 0$ was what you meant. – Glen_b ♦  May 17 '14 at 2:19        |  show 4 more comments           Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

The normal distribution and the Z-score say "ouch," while Shmoop gets to work on finding some probabilities. Sample Problem A dataset is normally distributed, with a mean of 177 and a standard deviation of 48. What is the probability of getting a result of 236 or greater? We like looking at pictures. What good is a scavenger hunt if we don't know what we're supposed to find?  That shaded part under the curve will be the perfect spot for our picnic. It's also the same as the probability we are looking for. We can solve the problem and eat a peanut butter sandwich at the same time. We don't like this distribution, though. It has too many ants on it. We'd rather have the same spot on a standard normal distribution. That means finding the Z-score at 236.  We can reword our question as, "What is the probability of getting a result greater than 1.23 standard deviations above the mean of a standard normal distribution?" Or, to put it in a real fancy, math-y way: Pr( x > 1.23) = ? We like this question a lot more, because someone else has already done the hardest work for us. We don't have to calculate the probability, we just have to track it down in a standard normal table . These things have hundreds of probabilities already calculated. The catch is that they can be a tad confusing to read at times. We'll walk through it nice and easy, don't worry. Here is an example of a standard standard normal table. We highly suggest clicking that link and following along with us. Notice the picture in the upper-right corner: the probabilities in the table are those to the right of Z, or Pr( x > Z). That's exactly what we need, so no complaints from us. To read the table, start on the left side and go down until you find the row next to "1.20." That's part of the Z-score we want to find. The other part is "0.03," and we can find that along the top part of the table. Z 0.02 0.03 0.04 1.10 0.131357 0.129238 0.127143 1.20 0.111233 0.109349 0.107488 1.30 0.093418 0.091759 0.090123 We travel along the row "1.20" and down the column "0.03" until our fingers run into each other. Where they meet is Pr(Z > 1.23), and that equals 0.109349. That equals the shaded-in part of the graph we've been looking for. Now if only this table could help us find our keys. Sample Problem A dataset is normally distributed, with a mean of 342 and a standard deviation of 74. What is the probability of getting a result of 166 or greater? Let's find the Z-score first, then we'll sketch what our probability looks like. Plugging into the Z-score formula we get: We put in our value first, then subtract the mean. Our result this time is a negative Z-score.  This looks like a problem. Our table only has positive values for Z. What a busted piece of junk, only giving us half of what we need. We'd demand a refund, but we found it for free. All is not lost, though. Remember, the normal distribution is symmetric around the mean. The probability above positive Z will be equal to the probability below negative Z.  That means there's a connection between 2.38, the number in the table, and -2.38, the number we need. A math connection, not a love connection, though. It is: Pr( x > 2.38) = Pr( x < -2.38) Watch those greater than and less than signs. It is super easy to mix up what they mean. That's why we're drawing so many graphs; they'll never give us up or let us down. The upshot here is that we don't have what we want yet. Using the standard normal table, we can find that Pr( x < -2.38) = Pr( x > 2.38) = 0.008656. That's the probability of getting a result below -2.38, but we want the probability above -2.38. The final piece of this puzzle is the fact that the total area underneath the curve of a normal distribution equals 1. The total probability of an event has to add up to 1 , so that makes sense. It's useful for us, because it means:  Setting up the problem we have: Pr( x > -2.38) = 1 – Pr( x < -2.38) = 1 – 0.008656 = 0.991344 And that's that. Our result matches what our first graph told us as well. Graphs: they stop us from making dumb mistakes. Sample Problem A dataset is normally distributed, with a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 25. What is the probability of getting a result between 63 and 80? How good of a juggler are you? Because now we have two points to handle at once, and we want the probability between the two of them. We'll start by converting both of the points into Z-scores. Pr(-0.28 < x < 0.40) = ? We have an ice cream sandwich of a problem; we want to get at the good stuff in the middle. Our standard normal table only gives us the area to the right of each Z-score, but we can use a little subtraction wizardry to sort this out.  Finding everything to the right of -0.28 will give us everything we need and some stuff we don't. What would we do with an extra kitchen sink anyway? If we subtract out all of the area to the right of 0.40, that will get rid of all the excess. We guess we can use the sink to cart off all the excess once we're done. Finding the area to the right of -0.28 is tricky, though, just like the last problem. Let's draw out the problem (in a good way) to solve this.  Now we have the problem in a table-friendly form. It'll always use a coaster for its drinks, and it won't stick its feet up on the table either. Pr( x > -0.28) = 1 – Pr( x > 0.28) Find Pr( x > 0.28) by going down the rows of the table to "0.20," then across until you hit column "0.08." = 1 – 0.389739 = 0.610261 Hey hey, don't go and circle this as the answer. We want Pr(-0.28 < x < 0.40), so we still need to subtract out Pr( x > 0.40). At least the area above 0.40 is easy to find on the table. Pr(-0.28 < x < 0.40) = Pr( x > -0.28) – Pr( x > 0.40) = 0.610261 – 0.344578 = 0.265683 There we go, that's our answer. It's not quite as delicious as an ice cream sandwich, but still satisfying to have. The More Things Change, The More They're Different Here's one last word of warning for when we're finding probabilities with normal distributions. The table we gave you isn't the only kind out there. Instead of giving the probabilities to the right of the Z-scores, sometimes they'll give everything to the left . Or the area between 0 and Z . Even using a fancy graphing calculator won't save us from this confusion. So, cut through all that nonsense by always drawing lots of little graphs. If we can see what we're looking for, and what the table gives us, then there will be no problem-o. Plus it lets us practice our unicorn doodles.
