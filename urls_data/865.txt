(Stephen B. Morton/Associated Press)   If defense wins championships, five teams still playing have a good chance of winning the Super Bowl. The Jacksonville Jaguars, Minnesota Vikings, Philadelphia Eagles, New Orleans Saints and Pittsburgh Steelers all have a top-10 defense per Football Outsiders’ Defense-adjusted Value Over Average, which measures a team’s efficiency by comparing success on every play to the league average based on situation and opponent.  The Jaguars’ league-low 68.5 passer rating against puts them in prime position to move forward. Since 2002, 11 teams have qualified for the playoffs while leading the league in this category; only two of those 11 (the 2005 Chicago Bears and 2006 Baltimore Ravens) failed to make it to the conference championship game. Five of them made Super Bowl appearances, with four winning the championship. The only outlier: the 2015 Carolina Panthers.  But defense is only half of the equation. Using the win rates that fuel our weekly power rankings, which take into account a team’s actual record and what its record should be based on points scored and allowed — also known as its Pythagorean win percentage — and simulating the playoffs 5,000 times, the New England Patriots and Eagles  have the best chances of winning Super Bowl LII. Yes, even after accounting for Nick Foles.     Team  Win Super Bowl LII  Super Bowl odds    New England Patriots  28%  4-to-1    Philadelphia Eagles  26%  4-to-1    Minnesota Vikings  19%  5-to-1    Pittsburgh Steelers  14%  7-to-1    Jacksonville Jaguars  6%  16-to-1    New Orleans Saints  5%  19-to-1    Atlanta Falcons  2%  52-to-1    Tennessee Titans  1%  109-to-1     Atlanta Falcons (-3) at Philadelphia Eagles  Winner: Eagles, 67 percent  Pick: Eagles +3  No, backup quarterback Nick Foles is not as good as Carson Wentz — that’s obvious — but the Eagles defense is still the same one that was the fifth-best per DVOA and the second-best defensive unit per the game charters at Pro Football Focus. The Eagles defense will also be a much-tougher test for the Falcons than the Los Angeles Rams were in their first-round game.  [ Eagles are historic underdogs against Falcons but deserve more respect as NFC’s No. 1 seed ]  Philadelphia surrendered 7.7 fewer points per game than expected based on the down, distance and field position of each opposing play against. The Rams, by comparison, allowed 5.1 fewer points per game than expected. The Eagles also stuffed 28 percent of rushers at or behind the line of scrimmage, 10 percentage points better than the Rams.  Tennessee Titans at New England Patriots (-13.5)  Winner: Patriots, 82 percent  Pick: Titans +13.5  What more can be said of New England’s offense? Quarterback Tom Brady finished the regular season as the third-most valuable quarterback per ESPN’s Total Quarterback Rating and was instrumental in the Patriots scoring a league-leading 2.6 points per drive, nearly a point per drive more than the league average (1.8) and the 12th-best scoring efficiency since 2002, the year the NFL expanded to 32 teams.  [ Amid amplified scrutiny and advanced age, Tom Brady has yet to buckle ]  Tennessee’s pass defense ranked 24th per opponent-adjusted DVOA and allowed the second-highest passer rating to quarterbacks when they targeted a running back out of the backfield (106.2).  Jacksonville Jaguars at Pittsburgh Steelers (-7)  Winner: Jaguars, 52 percent  Pick: Jaguars +7  Jacksonville quarterback Blake Bortles was underwhelming in Sunday’s 10-3 AFC first-round win over the Buffalo Bills. He completed 12 of 23 passes for 87 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. He actually was more productive on the ground (10 carries for 88 yards) than he was through the air.  But the Jaguars’ playoff hopes will live and die by how their defense plays and, right now, there is no team better at stopping the pass. Including the playoffs, Jacksonville is allowing a league-low 68.5 passer rating, with a defensive front that sacks the quarterback on 9.1 percent of pass attempts after adjusting for down, distance and opponent, the second-best mark in the NFL this season.  When the Steelers’ Ben Roethlisberger is under pressure, he is much less effective: His passer rating drops from 103.5 to 62.1, roughly the difference between Drew Brees (103.9) and DeShone Kizer (60.5, this season’s worst rating).  New Orleans Saints at Minnesota Vikings (-4.5)  Winner: Vikings, 66 percent  Pick: Vikings -4.5  If I asked you during the preseason where Case Keenum would rank in QBR, do you think you would have had him anywhere close to the No. 2 spot behind Carson Wentz and ahead of Brady? Me neither, but here we are.  Give credit to Coach Mike Zimmer and offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur for putting Keenum in a position to succeed. The Vikings had Keenum run play-action 29 percent of the time, just a fraction of a percentage point lower than the Rams’ Jared Goff for the highest rate in the NFL, which helped boost his passer rating from 92.8 to 111.8 on those attempts.  And even if he slips a little against New Orleans, Minnesota’s defense will be able to pick up the slack. It has allowed 8.9 fewer points per game than expected, the second-best mark behind the Jaguars (12.8) and the 16th-best effort since 2002.

January 22, 2018 at 6:00 pm       Filed Under: Eagles vs Patriots , Eagles vs Vikings , Local TV     PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — All season long we’ve been talking about the odds of making it to the big game since Carson Wentz went down. Those odds haven’t been great to say the least. But in two weeks it will be Eagles, Patriots for the Lombardi trophy.  Heading to the Super Bowl against Tom Brady and the Patriots the Eagles are still–statistically speaking–the underdogs.  “Right now it looks like they have about a 35 percent chance of winning the Super Bowl,” said George Diemer, with Temple’s School of Sport, Tourism and Hospitality Management.  Eagles Fan Who Collided With Pole In Subway Is OK  That means the Patriots at 65 percent, statistically at least the favorites at taking home another Vince Lombardi trophy.  But Diemer says the odds are out on February 4.  “Anything can happen in one game. If you’re an NFL fan and you’ve watched enough games in enough years, you can definitely say any given Sunday,” said Diemer.

Before the season, it was inevitable that they'd make it back to the Super Bowl. When they went to Pittsburgh with the AFC's top seed on the line , it was inevitable that they'd beat the Steelers . When ESPN dropped that bombshell story about the internal strife consuming the Patriots' facility, it was inevitable that they'd respond by never losing again. When they faced the Titans in their first playoff game, it was inevitable that they'd destroy their inferior foe . When they trailed the Jaguars by 10 points in the fourth quarter of the AFC title game, it was inevitable that Tom Brady would bring them back from the brink.  The Super Bowl is inevitable. When the Patriots face the Eagles with the Lombardi Trophy on the line, their victory is inevitable. The Patriots are 4.5-point favorites. They're going up against a Nick Foles-quarterbacked offense. Brady has as many Super Bowl starts as the entire Eagles' roster combined.  Rob Gronkowski is healthy. Carson Wentz still isn't. So which side of the Super Bowl line do you need to be all over? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of Patriots-Eagles you need to jump on, plus what X-factor determines the outcome, all from a Vegas legend who's 9-3 on Eagles' games. For me, this game boils down to one question: Can the Eagles consistently hit and harass Brady and as a result, make him human? Let's start with first part of the question: Can the Eagles hit and harass Brady? Definitely.    According to PFF, the Eagles have generated pressure at a stupidly high rate of 41.9 percent even though they've blitzed only 22.6 percent of the time (league average is 29.3 percent). The rush comes from everywhere. Defensive end Brandon Graham leads the team with 9.5 sacks, defensive ends Chris Long and Derek Barnett each have five sacks apiece while defensive end Vinny Curry has grabbed three sacks. Defensive tackle Fletcher Cox has registered 5.5 sacks. In their divisional round win over the Falcons , the Eagles pressured Matt Ryan 41.5 percent of the time. In their dominant NFC title game win over the Vikings , they sacked Case Keenum only once, but pressured him on almost half of his dropbacks (24 of 50), according to PFF. There's no question the Eagles have the players to get after Brady. But the answer to the second part of the question -- can they make Brady human? -- is probably a no. Brady is at his worst under pressure, but he's not bad. According to PFF, Brady owns the league's highest passer rating under pressure (95.5) in the regular season and the playoffs. Against a team with one of the best pass-rushes in football (the Jaguars finished the regular season with the second-most sacks), Brady led a double-digit fourth-quarter comeback. Even against pressure, Brady's still Brady. Bad OL, 40 years of age, doesn't matter. pic.twitter.com/dSxlUjKxcb — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018 You shouldn't be able to do this against pressure at the age of 40. That's how great of a season Tom Brady has had. pic.twitter.com/lvbOqh4mnd — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018 REPEAT: NO PRESSURE YOU PUT ON BRADY 99.9% OF THE TIME WILL MATTER pic.twitter.com/uPEvHqQWc8 — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018 The Eagles' best hope is to draw up elaborate blitzes that get to Brady, who has been at his worst this season when he's blitzed. According to PFF, Brady has an 84.0 passer rating against the blitz. But, again, it's not like Brady's some awful quarterback who crumbles against extra pass-rushers. More often than not, Brady burns the blitz because he sees it coming and already knows where the opening is in the defense.     You can't suicide blitz Brady because he'll anticipate it with the blink of an eye and beat you every time you do it to him. pic.twitter.com/Mq1dautZvG — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018   The Patriots are going to negate the Eagles' ability to get pressure by getting rid of the ball quickly to their armada of pass-catching running backs ( James White and Dion Lewis lead the way), Gronk (the most unstoppable pass-catching threat maybe ever), and reliable pass-catchers like Danny Amendola ( who is money in the playoffs, by the way ). And when Brady does get time in the pocket, he'll eviscerate a good, but not great secondary because he has the downfield threats in Gronk and Brandin Cooks (16.6 yards per catch) to do it. The point being, this Patriots offense is an unstoppable juggernaut with Brady playing the way that he is. As Broncos pass-rusher Von Miller put it, Brady "knows voodoo." This might sound overly simplistic, but I'm taking the Patriots to win because they have Brady and the Eagles have Nick Foles . The difference between them is too significant for me to ignore, especially when you factor in that Bill Belichick, the greatest coach in the history of the sport, had two weeks to gameplan for the Eagles' RPO-heavy offense. The Eagles are a great story. Getting to this point without Wentz is truly admirable. But the Patriots aren't the Falcons or the Vikings. They're a team that's in their eighth Super Bowl since 2001. They're the greatest dynasty in the history of team sports. It'll take a perfect, flawless game for the Eagles to even hang around with the Patriots. And then even if they do that, they'll still have to find a way to beat the Patriots in a close game, which is suicide. Consider how the Giants -- the only team to beat Brady in the Super Bowl -- have gotten it done: By playing flawless defense and getting crazy, impossible catches in the biggest moments of the game. The Eagles can play good defense, but even that alone won't be enough to beat the Patriots. They'll also need the bounces to bounce their way.    In that sense, the Patriots are the much safer bet. They don't need luck to win. They just need Brady to be Brady and Foles to be Foles. Before the season, I picked the Patriots to win the Super Bowl: At this point, picking against the Patriots is like betting against a Jon-Daenerys alliance. The Patriots might've lost one of their dragons ( Julian Edelman ), but Tom Brady can still ride Rob Gronkowski and Brandin Cooks all the way to the Super Bowl. Of course, it helps that they have the best mastermind in the business, Bill Belichick, running the show. The Patriots have been the best team in football for the past 15 or so years and they went out and got better this year. I can't pick against them. I can't turn away from them now.

The New England Patriots? Not so much. MORE ON THE EAGLES 10 surprise players who helped the Eagles get to the Super Bowl Eagles land in Minnesota to begin Super Bowl week What they're saying about Eagles: Super Bowl streaks, SNL jokes and Tecmo Bowl simulations Brady: Eagles D is 'as good as we’ve faced all year' Courtesy of Bovada.lv, we took a look back at the Super Bowl odds for each team as they progressed throughout the season. The Pats' journey is straightforward. They are the defending Super Bowl Champions, with perhaps the best player in NFL history at quarterback, so they were favored to win it all, almost wire-to-wire. The Eagles' season was much different, as it took some time for the Birds to make believers of the oddsmakers, as the graphic in our cover photo shows. In the middle of the season, they briefly overtook the Pats as the favorites, which the Pats took back while the Eagles were on their bye. Obviously, near the end of the season, the Eagles' odds took a tumble when Carson Wentz was lost for the season. Here were the updated Super Bowl odds each week for the Eagles and Patriots as the season progressed:    Super Bowl odds  Eagles  Patriots    February  19 (50/1)  1 (5/1)    March  19 (50/1)  1 (4/1)    May  20 (50/1)  1 (7/2)    Week 1  16 (40/1)  1 (13/4)    Week 2  12 (33/1)  1 (9/2)    Week 3  16 (40/1)  1 (4/1)    Week 4  11 (33/1)  1 (7/2)    Week 5  10 (22/1)  1 (5/1)    Week 6  4 (10/1)  1 (9/2)    Week 7  4 (8/1)  1 (4/1)    Week 8  2 (7/1)  1 (13/4)    Week 9  2 (6/1)  1 (7/2)    Week 10  1 (4/1)  2 (9/2)    Week 11  2 (5/1)  1 (7/2)    Week 12  2 (15/4)  1 (11/4)    Week 13  2 (7/2)  1 (5/2)    Week 14  3 (6/1)  1 (12/5)    Week 15  4 (10/1)  1 (11/4)    Week 16  4 (10/1)  1 (12/5)    Week 17  5 (10/1)  1 (5/2)    Wild card  6 (12/1)  1 (11/5)    Divisional  6 (14/1)  1 (2/1)    Conference  2 (5/1)  1 (11/10)    The Eagles went from 50/1 long shots to NFC Champs. In the Super Bowl the Eagles are underdogs, as usual, as the Pats are favored by 4.5. Follow Jimmy on Twitter: @JimmyKempski . Like Jimmy on Facebook .

A team that had toiled in relative mediocrity for years, suddenly the best team in the NFC. With sophomore sensation Carson Wentz performing at an MVP level, everything was roses in the City of Brotherly Love. Then Wentz went down. However, the Eagles have changed on the fly. Changing from the expected NFC champions to underdogs , the team strolled to Super Bowl 52 and a date with the New England Patriots. Once again, the Eagles find themselves as underdogs, opening at +6 at many sportsbooks . However, the Eagles are still one of the best teams in football – and I argue the best. If you need convincing, here are three reasons why the Philadelphia Eagles will win Super Bowl 52. Foles Is Actually Good (For The Eagles Offense) More than a few Eagles fans and pundits threw the baby out with the bathwater when Carson Wentz got hurt. After all, the last time we saw significant starting time from backup quarterback Nick Foles was a train wreck of a season with the then St. Louis Rams in 2015. However, people did not look beyond the numbers. Let’s face it: Jeff Fisher’s offense with the Rams was genuinely one of the worst things in modern football history. He was completely clueless about how to develop his scheme around his talent. And Foles has talent. I’m not saying he is ever going to reach the heights of his ridiculous Pro Bowl season under Chip Kelly but that offense understood Foles. Unlike many backups in the league, Foles wants to heave the ball. The sixth-year quarterback has a cannon and loves showing it off. He could not have found a better home than Doug Pederson’s aggressive offense. Foles has thrown seven touchdowns this season. Those seven scores have gone for an average of 21 yards per catch. That explosive playmaking should worry a Patriots secondary that ranked in the bottom third in the NFL in passing yards allowed and yards per completion. Foles is going to take his shots. He’s not going to hit all of them but he is going to complete enough of those big plays to give the Eagles the offense they need to beat the Patriots. Third-Down Offense One of the major factors to beating the Patriots is keeping Tom Brady off the field. Yeah, it sounds trite but the less time arguably the greatest quarterback in history is on the field, the better for the Eagles. Luckily, their offense has proven adept at moving the chains. The reason why is because of Philly’s fantastic third-down offense. The Eagles ranked third in the NFL in third-down conversion percentage during the regular season (43.6 percent) but have been nearly unstoppable in the playoffs, going a ridiculous 16-for-27 (59.3 percent). The Eagles went 10-for-14 while averaging 10.6 yards per play on third down against the Minnesota Vikings. To put it into perspective, the Eagles went 10-for-14 while averaging 10.6 yards per play on third down against the Minnesota Vikings – a team that owned the best third-down defense in history . Yes, the Patriots have been good on third-down defense during the postseason but opposition plays a significant part. The Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans ranked 19th and 21st  in the NFL in third-down conversion during the regular season – two of the bottom three to make the playoffs. The Eagles can – and will – succeed on third down. Third-down success equals longer drives, which equals less Brady, which equals victory for the Eagles. The Eagles Have The Best Defensive Line In Football But what happens when Brady is on the field? Well, the 40-year-old will need to compete against the best defensive line in football. Sure, a lot of people wanted to anoint “Sacksonville” the best but the Eagles’ depth and versatility make them the most dangerous defensive front in the league. The defensive line allowed the fewest rushing yards in the NFL and the least amount of time to opposing quarterbacks in the pocket – while their constant pressure helped Philly record the fourth-most takeaways during the regular season. What is even more impressive? The depth along the front four. Only one defensive lineman (Brandon Graham) played at least 60 percent of the team’s snaps during the regular season. That depth has kept the likes of Fletcher Cox and Vinny Curry fresh for the playoffs where defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz can set them loose on opposing offenses. This will be absolutely vital, as pressuring Brady is the key to beating the Patriots offense. Since Brady returned from his season-opening four-game suspension last season, the Patriots are 20-2 when Brady is sacked two or fewer times. For comparison’s sake, the Pats are 8-3 in that same span when Brady is sacked three or more times. Though that is still a great winning percentage, it drops from 91 percent to 72.7 percent when the defense can get after Brady. The Patriots offense has spent all season winning the war of attrition in the trenches, getting better as games go on. However, the Eagles’ fresh defensive front mixed with their depth means Philly will be bullying its way into the backfield during the Super Bowl. Despite these convincing points, Gilles Gallant disagrees and thinks the New England Patriots will win Super Bowl 52. You can check out his argument here. bet on super bowl lii here!

(Stephen B. Morton/Associated Press)   If defense wins championships, five teams still playing have a good chance of winning the Super Bowl. The Jacksonville Jaguars, Minnesota Vikings, Philadelphia Eagles, New Orleans Saints and Pittsburgh Steelers all have a top-10 defense per Football Outsiders’ Defense-adjusted Value Over Average, which measures a team’s efficiency by comparing success on every play to the league average based on situation and opponent.  The Jaguars’ league-low 68.5 passer rating against puts them in prime position to move forward. Since 2002, 11 teams have qualified for the playoffs while leading the league in this category; only two of those 11 (the 2005 Chicago Bears and 2006 Baltimore Ravens) failed to make it to the conference championship game. Five of them made Super Bowl appearances, with four winning the championship. The only outlier: the 2015 Carolina Panthers.  But defense is only half of the equation. Using the win rates that fuel our weekly power rankings, which take into account a team’s actual record and what its record should be based on points scored and allowed — also known as its Pythagorean win percentage — and simulating the playoffs 5,000 times, the New England Patriots and Eagles  have the best chances of winning Super Bowl LII. Yes, even after accounting for Nick Foles.     Team  Win Super Bowl LII  Super Bowl odds    New England Patriots  28%  4-to-1    Philadelphia Eagles  26%  4-to-1    Minnesota Vikings  19%  5-to-1    Pittsburgh Steelers  14%  7-to-1    Jacksonville Jaguars  6%  16-to-1    New Orleans Saints  5%  19-to-1    Atlanta Falcons  2%  52-to-1    Tennessee Titans  1%  109-to-1     Atlanta Falcons (-3) at Philadelphia Eagles  Winner: Eagles, 67 percent  Pick: Eagles +3  No, backup quarterback Nick Foles is not as good as Carson Wentz — that’s obvious — but the Eagles defense is still the same one that was the fifth-best per DVOA and the second-best defensive unit per the game charters at Pro Football Focus. The Eagles defense will also be a much-tougher test for the Falcons than the Los Angeles Rams were in their first-round game.  [ Eagles are historic underdogs against Falcons but deserve more respect as NFC’s No. 1 seed ]  Philadelphia surrendered 7.7 fewer points per game than expected based on the down, distance and field position of each opposing play against. The Rams, by comparison, allowed 5.1 fewer points per game than expected. The Eagles also stuffed 28 percent of rushers at or behind the line of scrimmage, 10 percentage points better than the Rams.  Tennessee Titans at New England Patriots (-13.5)  Winner: Patriots, 82 percent  Pick: Titans +13.5  What more can be said of New England’s offense? Quarterback Tom Brady finished the regular season as the third-most valuable quarterback per ESPN’s Total Quarterback Rating and was instrumental in the Patriots scoring a league-leading 2.6 points per drive, nearly a point per drive more than the league average (1.8) and the 12th-best scoring efficiency since 2002, the year the NFL expanded to 32 teams.  [ Amid amplified scrutiny and advanced age, Tom Brady has yet to buckle ]  Tennessee’s pass defense ranked 24th per opponent-adjusted DVOA and allowed the second-highest passer rating to quarterbacks when they targeted a running back out of the backfield (106.2).  Jacksonville Jaguars at Pittsburgh Steelers (-7)  Winner: Jaguars, 52 percent  Pick: Jaguars +7  Jacksonville quarterback Blake Bortles was underwhelming in Sunday’s 10-3 AFC first-round win over the Buffalo Bills. He completed 12 of 23 passes for 87 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. He actually was more productive on the ground (10 carries for 88 yards) than he was through the air.  But the Jaguars’ playoff hopes will live and die by how their defense plays and, right now, there is no team better at stopping the pass. Including the playoffs, Jacksonville is allowing a league-low 68.5 passer rating, with a defensive front that sacks the quarterback on 9.1 percent of pass attempts after adjusting for down, distance and opponent, the second-best mark in the NFL this season.  When the Steelers’ Ben Roethlisberger is under pressure, he is much less effective: His passer rating drops from 103.5 to 62.1, roughly the difference between Drew Brees (103.9) and DeShone Kizer (60.5, this season’s worst rating).  New Orleans Saints at Minnesota Vikings (-4.5)  Winner: Vikings, 66 percent  Pick: Vikings -4.5  If I asked you during the preseason where Case Keenum would rank in QBR, do you think you would have had him anywhere close to the No. 2 spot behind Carson Wentz and ahead of Brady? Me neither, but here we are.  Give credit to Coach Mike Zimmer and offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur for putting Keenum in a position to succeed. The Vikings had Keenum run play-action 29 percent of the time, just a fraction of a percentage point lower than the Rams’ Jared Goff for the highest rate in the NFL, which helped boost his passer rating from 92.8 to 111.8 on those attempts.  And even if he slips a little against New Orleans, Minnesota’s defense will be able to pick up the slack. It has allowed 8.9 fewer points per game than expected, the second-best mark behind the Jaguars (12.8) and the 16th-best effort since 2002.

Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo      The 2018 NFC Championship Game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Minnesota Vikings will kick off at Lincoln Financial Field later today. After the final whistle blows, one of these franchises will advance and have an opportunity to claim their first ever title in Super Bowl LII. The stakes are clearly high for this contest and that’s why it should be one of the more exciting conference championship matchups in recent history.  Oddsmakers are giving the Vikings a slight edge, installing them as a three-point favorite on the road. The Eagles are using that line—and all the commentators picking against them—as bulletin board material. The team’s 15-10 win over the Atlanta Falcons last week was fueled by perceived disrespect, as some players donned now-famous dog masks and walked around their home field after the Divisional Round, reveling in their upset against the No. 6 seed. Minnesota is quite fortunate to even be laying points in this game, needing a “Minneapolis Miracle” touchdown from Stefon Diggs to escape with victory in the waning moments of their showdown with the New Orleans Saints this past Sunday.  Will the Vikings live up to the bookmakers’ expectations and handle their business against the Eagles to become the first team to ever play in a home Super Bowl, or will Philadelphia’s players don the dog masks again and celebrate an NFC Championship Game win on their home turf? Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com is back with another lean on this matchup that you will not want to miss.

These foes have met on the field 26 times in total, with three of those matchups occurring in the postseason. The all-time series is deadlocked at 13 wins apiece, although Philly holds a decisive, 3-0 advantage in the playoffs.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.                    Hannah Foslien/Getty Images      The 2018 NFC Championship Game will feature the Philadelphia Eagles and Minnesota Vikings, the conference’s top two seeds. These teams capitalized on their Wild Card bye week, coming out fresh and winning in the Divisional Round. Not many expected either club to be competing Super Bowl this year, but both vastly exceeded expectations during the 2017 campaign and made a run to the NFL’s final four.  Despite being the No. 1 seed and having home field advantage, Philadelphia opened at most Vegas shops as a slight, three-point underdog to the Vikings. The Eagles will use this line as more bulletin board material, as getting points at home against the Atlanta Falcons fueled their 15-10 win against the No. 6 seed on Saturday.  Minnesota deserved the right to be favored, however, after edging past the high-powered New Orleans Saints, 29-24, on Sunday evening. The defense kept a Saints offense that averaged 28 points per game during the regular season to zero first half points and then survived a three-touchdown onslaught from future Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees. The Vikings lost the lead after a New Orleans field goal with only a few minutes left, but won on an incredible, 61-yard, desperation walk-off touchdown connection from signal-caller Case Keenum to wideout Stefon Diggs. The Saints badly blew the coverage on the heave and missed a tackle that would have ended the game in their favor, opening the door for Minnesota to win its first ever Super Bowl.

They will play the Eagles next week in the NFC Championship game! pic.twitter.com/tY4UJnNk21  — NFL Stats (@NFL_Stats) January 15, 2018   It was an impressive feat and now the Vikings are one game closer to being the first organization to ever partake in a Super Bowl hosted in their home stadium. Before they can do that, they’ll need to escape Philly with a victory, something only one team has done this year. Here’s a look at the complete schedule, start time, TV info, opening line and more for both conference championship games:   2018 NFL Championship Game Odds and Viewing Guide  Odds updated 1/19 at 11 a.m. ET      Time (ET)  Matchup (TV)  Seeding  Odds  Total    Sunday, Jan. 21    3:05 p.m.  Jacksonville Jaguars at New England Patriots (CBS)  AFC No. 3 at AFC No. 1  NE -7  46    6:40 p.m.  Minnesota Vikings at Philadelphia Eagles (FOX)  NFC No. 2 at NFC No. 1  MIN -3  39.5      NFL Odds via BetDSI.eu Sportsbook    The Eagles haven’t exactly thrived offensively since Nick Foles took over under center for the injured Carson Wentz, but that hasn’t stopped the club from winning. Foles is 3-1 as a starter, with his only loss coming in a meaningless regular season finale against the Dallas Cowboys. The sixth-year man out of Arizona has only thrown for one touchdown in the three games since torching a shameful New York Giants defense for 237 yards and four scores in Week 15. Philadelphia’s offense has averaged a mere 11.3 points in that span, but the defense has picked up the slack when it matters most.  Atlanta came into the Divisional Round on the back of a convincing 26-13 road victory versus the Los Angeles Rams, but the Dirty Birds offense stalled out in the City of Brotherly Love. The Falcons generated only 281 yards and 10 points on Saturday, their lowest totals in both categories since a 14-9 loss to Minnesota in Week 13. Philadelphia’s best chance to win was keeping the Falcons from scoring more than a couple of touchdowns—Atlanta lost every game (0-7 including the playoffs) that it failed to reach 20 points—and dominate time of possession (the Eagles held the ball for over 32 minutes), two things it accomplished in the low-scoring affair. Those keys to victory will not change this week against the Vikings in the NFC Championship.  Eagles head coach Doug Pederson said that his players are sick of hearing that they aren't good enough to win in the playoffs and being made underdogs by the sportsbooks, as per ESPN :   When did Carson Wentz go down? Since that point, no one's given us a chance. I understand Carson's a great player, but every week our guys are hearing the same thing. Now, all of a sudden, we're not good enough? We're 13-3, best record in football, home-field advantage throughout. The guys are gonna motivate themselves based on what they've heard for the last month. It really doesn't matter what you guys talk about, because [our] locker room is united. I'll go to bat for every one of those guys; I'll go to war for every one of those guys in that dressing room.

Bettors must correctly select a team to win an event that takes place a later time. The money wagered will be tied up until there is an outcome and bettors will receive fixed odds when they place the wager. The future odds are normally updated on a weekly basis and wagers can be placed throughout the season.  To figure out your Win Amount, take the odds and multiply by the amount wagered. Ex. Green Bay (8/1) to win the NFC Championship. The Packers are listed as an 8/1 betting choice to win the NFC Championship. If you wager $100 on Green Bay to win the NFC and they capture the championship, then you would win $800 (8 Ã· 1 x 100). You would collect $900, which includes your win and stake ($100).

At least one of the teams in the 2018 Super Bowl matchup will be viewed as a Cinderella story given preseason outlooks.  The Jaguars, who went 3-13 last season, certainly would qualify. Their upset win over the Steelers in the divisional round of the playoffs has them where nobody expected them to be — playing in the AFC championship game against a team that, well, virtually everybody expected to see this far into January. New England is playing in its seventh consecutive conference title game, a testament to the organization's dominance.   Meanwhile, the NFC championship game features two dominant defenses. And even though Case Keenum and Nick Foles have received attention as unlikely QBs playing in a conference title game, what the Vikings and Eagles have done to reach this point resembles a common Super Bowl blueprint: limit mistakes and lean on defense.

Here are Sporting News' picks and predictions.  Vinnie Iyer: Vikings  When a team gets a play like the " Minneapolis Miracle " to survive and advance in the NFL playoffs, you can’t help but think it’s a team of destiny. For starters, Case Keenum’s narrative is a little like Kurt Warner’s in terms of a higher-powered, feel-good story. You also can’t ignore the fact that they will be the first team positioned to play a Super Bowl on its home field.  Just the ability to stay and practice at home during the week will be huge in preparing for whoever they face in the Super Bowl. Defense wins championships, and Minnesota has plenty of it on every level. — V.I.   David Steele: Patriots  The last two times the Patriots reached the Super Bowl, they found themselves deep in holes they weren't accustomed to, against teams with the credentials, will and momentum to finish the job. The Patriots won both times. In 2015, they overcame the Seahawks, a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit and a hopeless situation against their own goal line. Last year, it was the Falcons and 28-3.  The Vikings, who are the favorites to advance out of the NFC, have the NFL’s best defense, an outstanding coach, energy from the miraculous Saints win, a road win against the NFC’s top seed and the buzz of the first-ever Super Bowl home-field advantage. They’re just not the Patriots. — D.S.   Tadd Haislop: Patriots  Few have taken the Jaguars, Eagles and Vikings seriously during their respective runs this season. That's part of the reason they have made it so far, and it's why the Patriots will handle their business — New England won't overlook Jacksonville in the AFC title game the way Pittsburgh did in the divisional round. And it'll have the same attitude against its Super Bowl opponent.  Given the Patriots' season-opening loss to the Chiefs on national TV and their shaky start to the season defensively, it's easy to forget this is a team some thought had a legitimate chance to go undefeated in 2017. The defending Super Bowl champion only got stronger with offseason additions, and Tom Brady, even at age 40, is still playing at an All-Pro level. Trust Bill Belichick's team to do its job. — T.H.

(Stephen B. Morton/Associated Press)   If defense wins championships, five teams still playing have a good chance of winning the Super Bowl. The Jacksonville Jaguars, Minnesota Vikings, Philadelphia Eagles, New Orleans Saints and Pittsburgh Steelers all have a top-10 defense per Football Outsiders’ Defense-adjusted Value Over Average, which measures a team’s efficiency by comparing success on every play to the league average based on situation and opponent.  The Jaguars’ league-low 68.5 passer rating against puts them in prime position to move forward. Since 2002, 11 teams have qualified for the playoffs while leading the league in this category; only two of those 11 (the 2005 Chicago Bears and 2006 Baltimore Ravens) failed to make it to the conference championship game. Five of them made Super Bowl appearances, with four winning the championship. The only outlier: the 2015 Carolina Panthers.  But defense is only half of the equation. Using the win rates that fuel our weekly power rankings, which take into account a team’s actual record and what its record should be based on points scored and allowed — also known as its Pythagorean win percentage — and simulating the playoffs 5,000 times, the New England Patriots and Eagles  have the best chances of winning Super Bowl LII. Yes, even after accounting for Nick Foles.     Team  Win Super Bowl LII  Super Bowl odds    New England Patriots  28%  4-to-1    Philadelphia Eagles  26%  4-to-1    Minnesota Vikings  19%  5-to-1    Pittsburgh Steelers  14%  7-to-1    Jacksonville Jaguars  6%  16-to-1    New Orleans Saints  5%  19-to-1    Atlanta Falcons  2%  52-to-1    Tennessee Titans  1%  109-to-1     Atlanta Falcons (-3) at Philadelphia Eagles  Winner: Eagles, 67 percent  Pick: Eagles +3  No, backup quarterback Nick Foles is not as good as Carson Wentz — that’s obvious — but the Eagles defense is still the same one that was the fifth-best per DVOA and the second-best defensive unit per the game charters at Pro Football Focus. The Eagles defense will also be a much-tougher test for the Falcons than the Los Angeles Rams were in their first-round game.  [ Eagles are historic underdogs against Falcons but deserve more respect as NFC’s No. 1 seed ]  Philadelphia surrendered 7.7 fewer points per game than expected based on the down, distance and field position of each opposing play against. The Rams, by comparison, allowed 5.1 fewer points per game than expected. The Eagles also stuffed 28 percent of rushers at or behind the line of scrimmage, 10 percentage points better than the Rams.  Tennessee Titans at New England Patriots (-13.5)  Winner: Patriots, 82 percent  Pick: Titans +13.5  What more can be said of New England’s offense? Quarterback Tom Brady finished the regular season as the third-most valuable quarterback per ESPN’s Total Quarterback Rating and was instrumental in the Patriots scoring a league-leading 2.6 points per drive, nearly a point per drive more than the league average (1.8) and the 12th-best scoring efficiency since 2002, the year the NFL expanded to 32 teams.  [ Amid amplified scrutiny and advanced age, Tom Brady has yet to buckle ]  Tennessee’s pass defense ranked 24th per opponent-adjusted DVOA and allowed the second-highest passer rating to quarterbacks when they targeted a running back out of the backfield (106.2).  Jacksonville Jaguars at Pittsburgh Steelers (-7)  Winner: Jaguars, 52 percent  Pick: Jaguars +7  Jacksonville quarterback Blake Bortles was underwhelming in Sunday’s 10-3 AFC first-round win over the Buffalo Bills. He completed 12 of 23 passes for 87 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. He actually was more productive on the ground (10 carries for 88 yards) than he was through the air.  But the Jaguars’ playoff hopes will live and die by how their defense plays and, right now, there is no team better at stopping the pass. Including the playoffs, Jacksonville is allowing a league-low 68.5 passer rating, with a defensive front that sacks the quarterback on 9.1 percent of pass attempts after adjusting for down, distance and opponent, the second-best mark in the NFL this season.  When the Steelers’ Ben Roethlisberger is under pressure, he is much less effective: His passer rating drops from 103.5 to 62.1, roughly the difference between Drew Brees (103.9) and DeShone Kizer (60.5, this season’s worst rating).  New Orleans Saints at Minnesota Vikings (-4.5)  Winner: Vikings, 66 percent  Pick: Vikings -4.5  If I asked you during the preseason where Case Keenum would rank in QBR, do you think you would have had him anywhere close to the No. 2 spot behind Carson Wentz and ahead of Brady? Me neither, but here we are.  Give credit to Coach Mike Zimmer and offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur for putting Keenum in a position to succeed. The Vikings had Keenum run play-action 29 percent of the time, just a fraction of a percentage point lower than the Rams’ Jared Goff for the highest rate in the NFL, which helped boost his passer rating from 92.8 to 111.8 on those attempts.  And even if he slips a little against New Orleans, Minnesota’s defense will be able to pick up the slack. It has allowed 8.9 fewer points per game than expected, the second-best mark behind the Jaguars (12.8) and the 16th-best effort since 2002.

January 22, 2018 at 6:00 pm       Filed Under: Eagles vs Patriots , Eagles vs Vikings , Local TV     PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — All season long we’ve been talking about the odds of making it to the big game since Carson Wentz went down. Those odds haven’t been great to say the least. But in two weeks it will be Eagles, Patriots for the Lombardi trophy.  Heading to the Super Bowl against Tom Brady and the Patriots the Eagles are still–statistically speaking–the underdogs.  “Right now it looks like they have about a 35 percent chance of winning the Super Bowl,” said George Diemer, with Temple’s School of Sport, Tourism and Hospitality Management.  Eagles Fan Who Collided With Pole In Subway Is OK  That means the Patriots at 65 percent, statistically at least the favorites at taking home another Vince Lombardi trophy.  But Diemer says the odds are out on February 4.  “Anything can happen in one game. If you’re an NFL fan and you’ve watched enough games in enough years, you can definitely say any given Sunday,” said Diemer.

Before the season, it was inevitable that they'd make it back to the Super Bowl. When they went to Pittsburgh with the AFC's top seed on the line , it was inevitable that they'd beat the Steelers . When ESPN dropped that bombshell story about the internal strife consuming the Patriots' facility, it was inevitable that they'd respond by never losing again. When they faced the Titans in their first playoff game, it was inevitable that they'd destroy their inferior foe . When they trailed the Jaguars by 10 points in the fourth quarter of the AFC title game, it was inevitable that Tom Brady would bring them back from the brink.  The Super Bowl is inevitable. When the Patriots face the Eagles with the Lombardi Trophy on the line, their victory is inevitable. The Patriots are 4.5-point favorites. They're going up against a Nick Foles-quarterbacked offense. Brady has as many Super Bowl starts as the entire Eagles' roster combined.  Rob Gronkowski is healthy. Carson Wentz still isn't. So which side of the Super Bowl line do you need to be all over? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of Patriots-Eagles you need to jump on, plus what X-factor determines the outcome, all from a Vegas legend who's 9-3 on Eagles' games. For me, this game boils down to one question: Can the Eagles consistently hit and harass Brady and as a result, make him human? Let's start with first part of the question: Can the Eagles hit and harass Brady? Definitely.    According to PFF, the Eagles have generated pressure at a stupidly high rate of 41.9 percent even though they've blitzed only 22.6 percent of the time (league average is 29.3 percent). The rush comes from everywhere. Defensive end Brandon Graham leads the team with 9.5 sacks, defensive ends Chris Long and Derek Barnett each have five sacks apiece while defensive end Vinny Curry has grabbed three sacks. Defensive tackle Fletcher Cox has registered 5.5 sacks. In their divisional round win over the Falcons , the Eagles pressured Matt Ryan 41.5 percent of the time. In their dominant NFC title game win over the Vikings , they sacked Case Keenum only once, but pressured him on almost half of his dropbacks (24 of 50), according to PFF. There's no question the Eagles have the players to get after Brady. But the answer to the second part of the question -- can they make Brady human? -- is probably a no. Brady is at his worst under pressure, but he's not bad. According to PFF, Brady owns the league's highest passer rating under pressure (95.5) in the regular season and the playoffs. Against a team with one of the best pass-rushes in football (the Jaguars finished the regular season with the second-most sacks), Brady led a double-digit fourth-quarter comeback. Even against pressure, Brady's still Brady. Bad OL, 40 years of age, doesn't matter. pic.twitter.com/dSxlUjKxcb — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018 You shouldn't be able to do this against pressure at the age of 40. That's how great of a season Tom Brady has had. pic.twitter.com/lvbOqh4mnd — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018 REPEAT: NO PRESSURE YOU PUT ON BRADY 99.9% OF THE TIME WILL MATTER pic.twitter.com/uPEvHqQWc8 — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018 The Eagles' best hope is to draw up elaborate blitzes that get to Brady, who has been at his worst this season when he's blitzed. According to PFF, Brady has an 84.0 passer rating against the blitz. But, again, it's not like Brady's some awful quarterback who crumbles against extra pass-rushers. More often than not, Brady burns the blitz because he sees it coming and already knows where the opening is in the defense.     You can't suicide blitz Brady because he'll anticipate it with the blink of an eye and beat you every time you do it to him. pic.twitter.com/Mq1dautZvG — Jonathan Kinsley (@Brickwallblitz) February 2, 2018   The Patriots are going to negate the Eagles' ability to get pressure by getting rid of the ball quickly to their armada of pass-catching running backs ( James White and Dion Lewis lead the way), Gronk (the most unstoppable pass-catching threat maybe ever), and reliable pass-catchers like Danny Amendola ( who is money in the playoffs, by the way ). And when Brady does get time in the pocket, he'll eviscerate a good, but not great secondary because he has the downfield threats in Gronk and Brandin Cooks (16.6 yards per catch) to do it. The point being, this Patriots offense is an unstoppable juggernaut with Brady playing the way that he is. As Broncos pass-rusher Von Miller put it, Brady "knows voodoo." This might sound overly simplistic, but I'm taking the Patriots to win because they have Brady and the Eagles have Nick Foles . The difference between them is too significant for me to ignore, especially when you factor in that Bill Belichick, the greatest coach in the history of the sport, had two weeks to gameplan for the Eagles' RPO-heavy offense. The Eagles are a great story. Getting to this point without Wentz is truly admirable. But the Patriots aren't the Falcons or the Vikings. They're a team that's in their eighth Super Bowl since 2001. They're the greatest dynasty in the history of team sports. It'll take a perfect, flawless game for the Eagles to even hang around with the Patriots. And then even if they do that, they'll still have to find a way to beat the Patriots in a close game, which is suicide. Consider how the Giants -- the only team to beat Brady in the Super Bowl -- have gotten it done: By playing flawless defense and getting crazy, impossible catches in the biggest moments of the game. The Eagles can play good defense, but even that alone won't be enough to beat the Patriots. They'll also need the bounces to bounce their way.    In that sense, the Patriots are the much safer bet. They don't need luck to win. They just need Brady to be Brady and Foles to be Foles. Before the season, I picked the Patriots to win the Super Bowl: At this point, picking against the Patriots is like betting against a Jon-Daenerys alliance. The Patriots might've lost one of their dragons ( Julian Edelman ), but Tom Brady can still ride Rob Gronkowski and Brandin Cooks all the way to the Super Bowl. Of course, it helps that they have the best mastermind in the business, Bill Belichick, running the show. The Patriots have been the best team in football for the past 15 or so years and they went out and got better this year. I can't pick against them. I can't turn away from them now.

The New England Patriots? Not so much. MORE ON THE EAGLES 10 surprise players who helped the Eagles get to the Super Bowl Eagles land in Minnesota to begin Super Bowl week What they're saying about Eagles: Super Bowl streaks, SNL jokes and Tecmo Bowl simulations Brady: Eagles D is 'as good as we’ve faced all year' Courtesy of Bovada.lv, we took a look back at the Super Bowl odds for each team as they progressed throughout the season. The Pats' journey is straightforward. They are the defending Super Bowl Champions, with perhaps the best player in NFL history at quarterback, so they were favored to win it all, almost wire-to-wire. The Eagles' season was much different, as it took some time for the Birds to make believers of the oddsmakers, as the graphic in our cover photo shows. In the middle of the season, they briefly overtook the Pats as the favorites, which the Pats took back while the Eagles were on their bye. Obviously, near the end of the season, the Eagles' odds took a tumble when Carson Wentz was lost for the season. Here were the updated Super Bowl odds each week for the Eagles and Patriots as the season progressed:    Super Bowl odds  Eagles  Patriots    February  19 (50/1)  1 (5/1)    March  19 (50/1)  1 (4/1)    May  20 (50/1)  1 (7/2)    Week 1  16 (40/1)  1 (13/4)    Week 2  12 (33/1)  1 (9/2)    Week 3  16 (40/1)  1 (4/1)    Week 4  11 (33/1)  1 (7/2)    Week 5  10 (22/1)  1 (5/1)    Week 6  4 (10/1)  1 (9/2)    Week 7  4 (8/1)  1 (4/1)    Week 8  2 (7/1)  1 (13/4)    Week 9  2 (6/1)  1 (7/2)    Week 10  1 (4/1)  2 (9/2)    Week 11  2 (5/1)  1 (7/2)    Week 12  2 (15/4)  1 (11/4)    Week 13  2 (7/2)  1 (5/2)    Week 14  3 (6/1)  1 (12/5)    Week 15  4 (10/1)  1 (11/4)    Week 16  4 (10/1)  1 (12/5)    Week 17  5 (10/1)  1 (5/2)    Wild card  6 (12/1)  1 (11/5)    Divisional  6 (14/1)  1 (2/1)    Conference  2 (5/1)  1 (11/10)    The Eagles went from 50/1 long shots to NFC Champs. In the Super Bowl the Eagles are underdogs, as usual, as the Pats are favored by 4.5. Follow Jimmy on Twitter: @JimmyKempski . Like Jimmy on Facebook .

A team that had toiled in relative mediocrity for years, suddenly the best team in the NFC. With sophomore sensation Carson Wentz performing at an MVP level, everything was roses in the City of Brotherly Love. Then Wentz went down. However, the Eagles have changed on the fly. Changing from the expected NFC champions to underdogs , the team strolled to Super Bowl 52 and a date with the New England Patriots. Once again, the Eagles find themselves as underdogs, opening at +6 at many sportsbooks . However, the Eagles are still one of the best teams in football – and I argue the best. If you need convincing, here are three reasons why the Philadelphia Eagles will win Super Bowl 52. Foles Is Actually Good (For The Eagles Offense) More than a few Eagles fans and pundits threw the baby out with the bathwater when Carson Wentz got hurt. After all, the last time we saw significant starting time from backup quarterback Nick Foles was a train wreck of a season with the then St. Louis Rams in 2015. However, people did not look beyond the numbers. Let’s face it: Jeff Fisher’s offense with the Rams was genuinely one of the worst things in modern football history. He was completely clueless about how to develop his scheme around his talent. And Foles has talent. I’m not saying he is ever going to reach the heights of his ridiculous Pro Bowl season under Chip Kelly but that offense understood Foles. Unlike many backups in the league, Foles wants to heave the ball. The sixth-year quarterback has a cannon and loves showing it off. He could not have found a better home than Doug Pederson’s aggressive offense. Foles has thrown seven touchdowns this season. Those seven scores have gone for an average of 21 yards per catch. That explosive playmaking should worry a Patriots secondary that ranked in the bottom third in the NFL in passing yards allowed and yards per completion. Foles is going to take his shots. He’s not going to hit all of them but he is going to complete enough of those big plays to give the Eagles the offense they need to beat the Patriots. Third-Down Offense One of the major factors to beating the Patriots is keeping Tom Brady off the field. Yeah, it sounds trite but the less time arguably the greatest quarterback in history is on the field, the better for the Eagles. Luckily, their offense has proven adept at moving the chains. The reason why is because of Philly’s fantastic third-down offense. The Eagles ranked third in the NFL in third-down conversion percentage during the regular season (43.6 percent) but have been nearly unstoppable in the playoffs, going a ridiculous 16-for-27 (59.3 percent). The Eagles went 10-for-14 while averaging 10.6 yards per play on third down against the Minnesota Vikings. To put it into perspective, the Eagles went 10-for-14 while averaging 10.6 yards per play on third down against the Minnesota Vikings – a team that owned the best third-down defense in history . Yes, the Patriots have been good on third-down defense during the postseason but opposition plays a significant part. The Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans ranked 19th and 21st  in the NFL in third-down conversion during the regular season – two of the bottom three to make the playoffs. The Eagles can – and will – succeed on third down. Third-down success equals longer drives, which equals less Brady, which equals victory for the Eagles. The Eagles Have The Best Defensive Line In Football But what happens when Brady is on the field? Well, the 40-year-old will need to compete against the best defensive line in football. Sure, a lot of people wanted to anoint “Sacksonville” the best but the Eagles’ depth and versatility make them the most dangerous defensive front in the league. The defensive line allowed the fewest rushing yards in the NFL and the least amount of time to opposing quarterbacks in the pocket – while their constant pressure helped Philly record the fourth-most takeaways during the regular season. What is even more impressive? The depth along the front four. Only one defensive lineman (Brandon Graham) played at least 60 percent of the team’s snaps during the regular season. That depth has kept the likes of Fletcher Cox and Vinny Curry fresh for the playoffs where defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz can set them loose on opposing offenses. This will be absolutely vital, as pressuring Brady is the key to beating the Patriots offense. Since Brady returned from his season-opening four-game suspension last season, the Patriots are 20-2 when Brady is sacked two or fewer times. For comparison’s sake, the Pats are 8-3 in that same span when Brady is sacked three or more times. Though that is still a great winning percentage, it drops from 91 percent to 72.7 percent when the defense can get after Brady. The Patriots offense has spent all season winning the war of attrition in the trenches, getting better as games go on. However, the Eagles’ fresh defensive front mixed with their depth means Philly will be bullying its way into the backfield during the Super Bowl. Despite these convincing points, Gilles Gallant disagrees and thinks the New England Patriots will win Super Bowl 52. You can check out his argument here. bet on super bowl lii here!

(Stephen B. Morton/Associated Press)   If defense wins championships, five teams still playing have a good chance of winning the Super Bowl. The Jacksonville Jaguars, Minnesota Vikings, Philadelphia Eagles, New Orleans Saints and Pittsburgh Steelers all have a top-10 defense per Football Outsiders’ Defense-adjusted Value Over Average, which measures a team’s efficiency by comparing success on every play to the league average based on situation and opponent.  The Jaguars’ league-low 68.5 passer rating against puts them in prime position to move forward. Since 2002, 11 teams have qualified for the playoffs while leading the league in this category; only two of those 11 (the 2005 Chicago Bears and 2006 Baltimore Ravens) failed to make it to the conference championship game. Five of them made Super Bowl appearances, with four winning the championship. The only outlier: the 2015 Carolina Panthers.  But defense is only half of the equation. Using the win rates that fuel our weekly power rankings, which take into account a team’s actual record and what its record should be based on points scored and allowed — also known as its Pythagorean win percentage — and simulating the playoffs 5,000 times, the New England Patriots and Eagles  have the best chances of winning Super Bowl LII. Yes, even after accounting for Nick Foles.     Team  Win Super Bowl LII  Super Bowl odds    New England Patriots  28%  4-to-1    Philadelphia Eagles  26%  4-to-1    Minnesota Vikings  19%  5-to-1    Pittsburgh Steelers  14%  7-to-1    Jacksonville Jaguars  6%  16-to-1    New Orleans Saints  5%  19-to-1    Atlanta Falcons  2%  52-to-1    Tennessee Titans  1%  109-to-1     Atlanta Falcons (-3) at Philadelphia Eagles  Winner: Eagles, 67 percent  Pick: Eagles +3  No, backup quarterback Nick Foles is not as good as Carson Wentz — that’s obvious — but the Eagles defense is still the same one that was the fifth-best per DVOA and the second-best defensive unit per the game charters at Pro Football Focus. The Eagles defense will also be a much-tougher test for the Falcons than the Los Angeles Rams were in their first-round game.  [ Eagles are historic underdogs against Falcons but deserve more respect as NFC’s No. 1 seed ]  Philadelphia surrendered 7.7 fewer points per game than expected based on the down, distance and field position of each opposing play against. The Rams, by comparison, allowed 5.1 fewer points per game than expected. The Eagles also stuffed 28 percent of rushers at or behind the line of scrimmage, 10 percentage points better than the Rams.  Tennessee Titans at New England Patriots (-13.5)  Winner: Patriots, 82 percent  Pick: Titans +13.5  What more can be said of New England’s offense? Quarterback Tom Brady finished the regular season as the third-most valuable quarterback per ESPN’s Total Quarterback Rating and was instrumental in the Patriots scoring a league-leading 2.6 points per drive, nearly a point per drive more than the league average (1.8) and the 12th-best scoring efficiency since 2002, the year the NFL expanded to 32 teams.  [ Amid amplified scrutiny and advanced age, Tom Brady has yet to buckle ]  Tennessee’s pass defense ranked 24th per opponent-adjusted DVOA and allowed the second-highest passer rating to quarterbacks when they targeted a running back out of the backfield (106.2).  Jacksonville Jaguars at Pittsburgh Steelers (-7)  Winner: Jaguars, 52 percent  Pick: Jaguars +7  Jacksonville quarterback Blake Bortles was underwhelming in Sunday’s 10-3 AFC first-round win over the Buffalo Bills. He completed 12 of 23 passes for 87 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. He actually was more productive on the ground (10 carries for 88 yards) than he was through the air.  But the Jaguars’ playoff hopes will live and die by how their defense plays and, right now, there is no team better at stopping the pass. Including the playoffs, Jacksonville is allowing a league-low 68.5 passer rating, with a defensive front that sacks the quarterback on 9.1 percent of pass attempts after adjusting for down, distance and opponent, the second-best mark in the NFL this season.  When the Steelers’ Ben Roethlisberger is under pressure, he is much less effective: His passer rating drops from 103.5 to 62.1, roughly the difference between Drew Brees (103.9) and DeShone Kizer (60.5, this season’s worst rating).  New Orleans Saints at Minnesota Vikings (-4.5)  Winner: Vikings, 66 percent  Pick: Vikings -4.5  If I asked you during the preseason where Case Keenum would rank in QBR, do you think you would have had him anywhere close to the No. 2 spot behind Carson Wentz and ahead of Brady? Me neither, but here we are.  Give credit to Coach Mike Zimmer and offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur for putting Keenum in a position to succeed. The Vikings had Keenum run play-action 29 percent of the time, just a fraction of a percentage point lower than the Rams’ Jared Goff for the highest rate in the NFL, which helped boost his passer rating from 92.8 to 111.8 on those attempts.  And even if he slips a little against New Orleans, Minnesota’s defense will be able to pick up the slack. It has allowed 8.9 fewer points per game than expected, the second-best mark behind the Jaguars (12.8) and the 16th-best effort since 2002.

Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo      The 2018 NFC Championship Game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Minnesota Vikings will kick off at Lincoln Financial Field later today. After the final whistle blows, one of these franchises will advance and have an opportunity to claim their first ever title in Super Bowl LII. The stakes are clearly high for this contest and that’s why it should be one of the more exciting conference championship matchups in recent history.  Oddsmakers are giving the Vikings a slight edge, installing them as a three-point favorite on the road. The Eagles are using that line—and all the commentators picking against them—as bulletin board material. The team’s 15-10 win over the Atlanta Falcons last week was fueled by perceived disrespect, as some players donned now-famous dog masks and walked around their home field after the Divisional Round, reveling in their upset against the No. 6 seed. Minnesota is quite fortunate to even be laying points in this game, needing a “Minneapolis Miracle” touchdown from Stefon Diggs to escape with victory in the waning moments of their showdown with the New Orleans Saints this past Sunday.  Will the Vikings live up to the bookmakers’ expectations and handle their business against the Eagles to become the first team to ever play in a home Super Bowl, or will Philadelphia’s players don the dog masks again and celebrate an NFC Championship Game win on their home turf? Jon Price of SportsInformationTraders.com is back with another lean on this matchup that you will not want to miss.

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.                    Hannah Foslien/Getty Images      The 2018 NFC Championship Game will feature the Philadelphia Eagles and Minnesota Vikings, the conference’s top two seeds. These teams capitalized on their Wild Card bye week, coming out fresh and winning in the Divisional Round. Not many expected either club to be competing Super Bowl this year, but both vastly exceeded expectations during the 2017 campaign and made a run to the NFL’s final four.  Despite being the No. 1 seed and having home field advantage, Philadelphia opened at most Vegas shops as a slight, three-point underdog to the Vikings. The Eagles will use this line as more bulletin board material, as getting points at home against the Atlanta Falcons fueled their 15-10 win against the No. 6 seed on Saturday.  Minnesota deserved the right to be favored, however, after edging past the high-powered New Orleans Saints, 29-24, on Sunday evening. The defense kept a Saints offense that averaged 28 points per game during the regular season to zero first half points and then survived a three-touchdown onslaught from future Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees. The Vikings lost the lead after a New Orleans field goal with only a few minutes left, but won on an incredible, 61-yard, desperation walk-off touchdown connection from signal-caller Case Keenum to wideout Stefon Diggs. The Saints badly blew the coverage on the heave and missed a tackle that would have ended the game in their favor, opening the door for Minnesota to win its first ever Super Bowl.

They will play the Eagles next week in the NFC Championship game! pic.twitter.com/tY4UJnNk21  — NFL Stats (@NFL_Stats) January 15, 2018   It was an impressive feat and now the Vikings are one game closer to being the first organization to ever partake in a Super Bowl hosted in their home stadium. Before they can do that, they’ll need to escape Philly with a victory, something only one team has done this year. Here’s a look at the complete schedule, start time, TV info, opening line and more for both conference championship games:   2018 NFL Championship Game Odds and Viewing Guide  Odds updated 1/19 at 11 a.m. ET      Time (ET)  Matchup (TV)  Seeding  Odds  Total    Sunday, Jan. 21    3:05 p.m.  Jacksonville Jaguars at New England Patriots (CBS)  AFC No. 3 at AFC No. 1  NE -7  46    6:40 p.m.  Minnesota Vikings at Philadelphia Eagles (FOX)  NFC No. 2 at NFC No. 1  MIN -3  39.5      NFL Odds via BetDSI.eu Sportsbook    The Eagles haven’t exactly thrived offensively since Nick Foles took over under center for the injured Carson Wentz, but that hasn’t stopped the club from winning. Foles is 3-1 as a starter, with his only loss coming in a meaningless regular season finale against the Dallas Cowboys. The sixth-year man out of Arizona has only thrown for one touchdown in the three games since torching a shameful New York Giants defense for 237 yards and four scores in Week 15. Philadelphia’s offense has averaged a mere 11.3 points in that span, but the defense has picked up the slack when it matters most.  Atlanta came into the Divisional Round on the back of a convincing 26-13 road victory versus the Los Angeles Rams, but the Dirty Birds offense stalled out in the City of Brotherly Love. The Falcons generated only 281 yards and 10 points on Saturday, their lowest totals in both categories since a 14-9 loss to Minnesota in Week 13. Philadelphia’s best chance to win was keeping the Falcons from scoring more than a couple of touchdowns—Atlanta lost every game (0-7 including the playoffs) that it failed to reach 20 points—and dominate time of possession (the Eagles held the ball for over 32 minutes), two things it accomplished in the low-scoring affair. Those keys to victory will not change this week against the Vikings in the NFC Championship.  Eagles head coach Doug Pederson said that his players are sick of hearing that they aren't good enough to win in the playoffs and being made underdogs by the sportsbooks, as per ESPN :   When did Carson Wentz go down? Since that point, no one's given us a chance. I understand Carson's a great player, but every week our guys are hearing the same thing. Now, all of a sudden, we're not good enough? We're 13-3, best record in football, home-field advantage throughout. The guys are gonna motivate themselves based on what they've heard for the last month.

Bettors must correctly select a team to win an event that takes place a later time. The money wagered will be tied up until there is an outcome and bettors will receive fixed odds when they place the wager. The future odds are normally updated on a weekly basis and wagers can be placed throughout the season.  To figure out your Win Amount, take the odds and multiply by the amount wagered. Ex. Green Bay (8/1) to win the NFC Championship. The Packers are listed as an 8/1 betting choice to win the NFC Championship. If you wager $100 on Green Bay to win the NFC and they capture the championship, then you would win $800 (8 Ã· 1 x 100). You would collect $900, which includes your win and stake ($100).

Tadd Haislop      @TaddHaislop          Published on Jan. 21, 2018    Jan. 21, 2018           Watch NFL NFL with fuboTV    One thing is certain as the NFL schedule approaches Super Bowl 52 , set to be played Sunday, Feb. 4, at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis: The teams that end up in the big game will have earned it. At least one of the teams in the 2018 Super Bowl matchup will be viewed as a Cinderella story given preseason outlooks.  The Jaguars, who went 3-13 last season, certainly would qualify. Their upset win over the Steelers in the divisional round of the playoffs has them where nobody expected them to be — playing in the AFC championship game against a team that, well, virtually everybody expected to see this far into January. New England is playing in its seventh consecutive conference title game, a testament to the organization's dominance.   Meanwhile, the NFC championship game features two dominant defenses. And even though Case Keenum and Nick Foles have received attention as unlikely QBs playing in a conference title game, what the Vikings and Eagles have done to reach this point resembles a common Super Bowl blueprint: limit mistakes and lean on defense.  PICKS: AFC championship | NFC championship  Here's a look at the Vegas odds and SN's picks to win Super Bowl 52 heading into the conference championship games.  Super Bowl 52 betting guide  Here are the latest odds to win Super Bowl 52 , according to Vegas Insider, as well as the odds of each exact outcome:  Odds to win Super Bowl 52    New England Patriots  1/1    Minnesota Vikings  7/4    Philadelphia Eagles  7/1    Jacksonville Jaguars  9/1    Odds on exact outcome of Super Bowl 52    New England Patriots defeat Minnesota Vikings  2/1    New England Patriots defeat Philadelphia Eagles  7/2    Minnesota Vikings defeat New England Patriots  3/1    Minnesota Vikings defeat Jacksonville Jaguars  6/1    Philadelphia Eagles defeat New England Patriots  10/1    Philadelphia Eagles defeat Jacksonville Jaguars  20/1    Jacksonville Jaguars defeat Minnesota Vikings  16/1    Jacksonville Jaguars defeat Philadelphia Eagles  20/1    Early Super Bowl 52 line  AFC -2.5, according to Bovada . Teams TBD.  MATCHUP BREAKDOWNS: AFC championship | NFC championship  Super Bowl 2018: Picks, predictions  Between the Patriots, Jaguars, Eagles and Vikings, who will reach — and win — Super Bowl 52? Here are Sporting News' picks and predictions.  Vinnie Iyer: Vikings  When a team gets a play like the " Minneapolis Miracle " to survive and advance in the NFL playoffs, you can’t help but think it’s a team of destiny. For starters, Case Keenum’s narrative is a little like Kurt Warner’s in terms of a higher-powered, feel-good story. You also can’t ignore the fact that they will be the first team positioned to play a Super Bowl on its home field.  Just the ability to stay and practice at home during the week will be huge in preparing for whoever they face in the Super Bowl. Defense wins championships, and Minnesota has plenty of it on every level. — V.I.   David Steele: Patriots  The last two times the Patriots reached the Super Bowl, they found themselves deep in holes they weren't accustomed to, against teams with the credentials, will and momentum to finish the job. The Patriots won both times. In 2015, they overcame the Seahawks, a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit and a hopeless situation against their own goal line. Last year, it was the Falcons and 28-3.  The Vikings, who are the favorites to advance out of the NFC, have the NFL’s best defense, an outstanding coach, energy from the miraculous Saints win, a road win against the NFC’s top seed and the buzz of the first-ever Super Bowl home-field advantage. They’re just not the Patriots. — D.S.   Tadd Haislop: Patriots  Few have taken the Jaguars, Eagles and Vikings seriously during their respective runs this season. That's part of the reason they have made it so far, and it's why the Patriots will handle their business — New England won't overlook Jacksonville in the AFC title game the way Pittsburgh did in the divisional round. And it'll have the same attitude against its Super Bowl opponent.  Given the Patriots' season-opening loss to the Chiefs on national TV and their shaky start to the season defensively, it's easy to forget this is a team some thought had a legitimate chance to go undefeated in 2017. The defending Super Bowl champion only got stronger with offseason additions, and Tom Brady, even at age 40, is still playing at an All-Pro level. Trust Bill Belichick's team to do its job. — T.H.
