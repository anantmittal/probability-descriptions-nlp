The unfortunate half-million were all those around the world who were slain in 2012. The average person thus had roughly a one in 16,000 chance of being bumped off that year. But as the UN’s figures make clear, there is no such thing as an average person. How can you shorten your odds of making it through 2014? First, don’t live in the Americas or Africa, where murder rates (one in 6,100 and one in 8,000 respectively) are more than four times as high as the rest of the world. Western Europe and East Asia are the safest regions. And the safest countries? Liechtenstein recorded no murders at all in 2012, but its population could fit in a football stadium. Among those countries whose populations number in millions, the safest is Singapore, which clocked up just 11 murders in 2012, or one killing per 480,000 people. In Honduras, the world’s most violent country, one in every 1,100 residents was killed. Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

Your chance of being murdered will be barely a quarter what it would be were you a man. In fact, steer clear of men altogether: nearly half of all female murder-victims are killed by their partner or another (usually male) family member. But note that the gender imbalance is less pronounced in the rich world, probably because there is less banditry, a mainly male pursuit. In Japan and South Korea slightly over half of all murder victims are female. Then, sit back and grow older. From the age of 30 onwards, murder rates fall steadily in most places. But not everywhere. Europeans are more at risk in middle age than in youth. European women cannot let their guard down even in retirement: those aged over 60 are more likely to be murdered than those aged 15-29. The UN speculates that this may be because they are more likely to have partners, and those partners are more likely to drink. Other studies have found that alcohol featured in half of murders in Australia, Finland and Sweden, making it a more common factor than any weapon. And if you are killed? The chances are no one will be convicted. Worldwide only 43% of murders result in someone being put behind bars. This, too, varies hugely: whereas Europe’s police solve eight out of ten murders and those in Asia clear up nearly half, three-quarters of killers in the Americas escape justice (a smaller share in North America; a higher one elsewhere in the region). As long as that continues, there is little reason to think that the region’s fearsome murder rate will be tamed.

This risk assessment is designed to give guidance and insight to educators, adults and concerned students regarding individuals in school who may have tendencies to assault others (get into fights or strike others). Individuals already involved with non-sexual assaults in the criminal justice system or referred for counseling in non-weapon assaults had many similar characteristics.  This test uses these combinations of significant risk factors and repetitive behaviors to produce intervention strategies wherever there are matching behaviors in the assessment. This test does not predict behavior (assault) but when a combination of behaviors and characteristics match the behaviors and characteristics of individuals who have already been incarcerated for assault or referred for counseling for assault -- the test response will make recommendations to lower specific risk factors.  There may also be links showing research links to aid you further.   This test is NOT designed to replace a trained school or mental health counselor. Responses to the test depend on the quality and completeness of the input. Remember - inaccurate or incomplete information input will result in inaccurate output.  The test responses may give suggestions for intervention or mitigation of problems.  Students (individuals) who score high share most of the behaviors and risk factors of students who have ALREADY gotten into fights or hit other people (assault and battery or aggravated assault).  This test uses warning indicators or factors from others who have already assaulted other students, teachers or peers.  Please use any recommendations provided by the test as a proactive tool to provide support and services to students. Some individuals may rise above high risk factors and never threaten or assault another individual .  The following Assault Risk Factors Assessment was developed through a School Based Partnership Grant .  The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, School Security, Metropolitan Juvenile Courts and Oasis Center, Inc. designed this test with funding and in cooperation with the National Institute of Justice - COPS Office.  The Metropolitan Police Department, Metropolitan Public Schools, Metropolitan Juvenile Court, National Institute of Justice, and the Oasis Center Incorporated are not responsible for the actions of any individuals taking this test. Use this tool as a triage method for students needing help -- and help those who may be marginally at risk. This assessment only uses risk factors (behaviors/characteristics) for non-weapon, non-sexual assaults and is normalized for Nashville, Davidson County at this time.   Only use this tool as an aid to reduce risk factors for assaults and find resources to intervene with students who have a significant number of risk factors similar to others who have already committed simple or aggravated assault.   Take the Assault Intervention - Risk Reduction Assessment and answer as many questions as possible.  You will be trying to find out if the person you are assessing has a pattern of risk factors similar to others who have ALREADY assaulted other people. This assessment will suggest what constitutes a risk factor and ways to reduce these risk factors.  Be thorough and try to be as honest as possible. Try to avoid bias in your test or the results will not be helpful. Many people will find that they do not have enough facts to complete an evaluation. Don't make snap judgments about this youth as you may only see how they are responding to your perception of them .  Have you spent more than five minutes with them? Look at the alternatives and helpful information in the test response. This test was developed on School Based Partnership Grant Methodology 98SBWX0127 .  Let's take the test.    Who are you?

What Are the Odds of Being Murdered?     Crime  /  Society             Flip through the channels on television on any ordinary weekday evening and you’ll be presented with a variety of entertainment options, many of which feature murder, in documentary or drama form. Murder, or intentional homicide, persistently occupies a place at the center of the popular imagination. Yet, for all its popularity, for all its pervasiveness in primetime television, local news or even bestseller lists, murder is a relatively rare occurrence.   The Odds of Being Murdered in Context  The odds of being murdered are relatively low when compared to other possible causes of death. In its Final Data report of U.S. deaths for 2010, the CDC reported assault (homicide) dropped off of the list of the 15 leading causes of death, becoming 16th, following “pneumonitis due to solids and liquids.”  Based on the data from the CDC report, deaths due to homicide accounted for less than 1% of all U.S. deaths, with the odds of being murdered in a given year at 1 in 18,989 . On the other hand, heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S., accounted for 24% of all U.S. deaths, with the odds of dying of heart disease at 1 in 517.  Murder and Place: Location, Communities, and Socioeconomics  The odds of being murdered vary significantly on the basis of location. However, it must be noted that careful analysis of the data reveals that “location” is most appropriately understood as referring not only to geography but also to other ways of defining place, including community type and socioeconomic conditions.  When murder rates are discussed from the perspective of location, people often ask which places—specific regions, states, counties, cities, or areas—have the highest and lowest homicide rates. Detailed data on the numbers of murders occurring annually can be found in the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports (UCR). Moreover, when cities or communities are grouped together or categorized by community type—rural, suburban or urban—an apparent trend emerges. Rural communities and suburban communities have lower average homicide rates than do urban communities (Schwartz 2010).  Cities, and more broadly, community types, are home to distinctive sets of socioeconomic conditions that form the backdrop of the murders that occur. Socioeconomic context is an important variable to consider when discussing the odds of being murdered. An individual’s socioeconomic context can be defined broadly as the aggregate combination of education, income, and occupation of the people who comprise his or her social sphere. Individuals who are a part of poverty-stricken socioeconomic contexts face greater odds of being murdered while individuals belonging to more affluent socioeconomic contexts have lower odds of being murdered.  Murder and Demographics  Besides location in general and socioeconomic context in particular, there are demographic characteristics that are relevant to an individual’s odds of being murdered, including sex, race and age. Males are more likely to be murdered than females. Individuals of African-American descent are more likely to be murdered than members of any other racial group. Individuals between the ages of 18 and 24 are at the greatest risk of being murdered. Additionally, individuals are most likely to be murdered by someone they know, and not a stranger.  It is also noteworthy that murder victim characteristics mirror those of murder perpetrators. The exception to this general pattern is the fact that females are usually murdered by males and less frequently by females (Schwartz 2010). In other words, an individual is most likely to be murdered by someone who has the same demographic traits, within his own socioeconomic context. More often than not, males are murdered by males, blacks are most often murdered by blacks and young adults are most often murdered by young adults.  However, murder and violence are tied not only to individual demographic traits, but also intrinsically to community level characteristics as well, as “communities are often segregated by SES, race, and ethnicity,” the American Psychological Association (APA) asserts. The APA goes on to explain that “community level risk factors for violence include increased levels of unemployment, poverty, and transiency; decreased levels of economic opportunities and community participation; poor housing conditions; and a lack of access to services.”  Murder, Relationships, and Crime  Murder is often precipitated by one of two additional factors as well: either an interpersonal relationship characterized by a history of confrontation or abuse or an active attempt to commit another crime.  Less than 30% of murders occur as a result of an active attempt to commit a felony, such as a robbery.  Murders involving a male victim and a male perpetrator most frequently occur during the course of or following a confrontation, an argument that in many cases originated because of a perceived slight, challenge or insult on the part of a male friend or acquaintance. Schwartz, Anderson and Messerschmidt each offer similar descriptions of this particular male murder motive, which Schwartz summarizes:  Whereas middle- and upper- class males may have a myriad of opportunities to “do masculinity,” lower class males living in concentrated urban poverty may, over time and as an adaptation to persistent economic strain, place stronger collective emphasis on more achievable goals than financial success, such as respect and prestige conferred to those with a street reputation (Anderson 1999; Messerschmidt 2004).  The murder of female victims is most often perpetrated within the framework of an intimate relationship. Usually, homicides against women are carried out by their male partners, at what turns out to be the end of a trajectory of escalating abuse or dominance (Schwartz 2010).

The study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics also concluded that about six million Americans, roughly 3 percent of those over 12, would become a victim of robbery, rape or other assault in a given year. The report said that over their lifetimes, black men have a 1-in-21 chance of being murdered; white men have a 1-in-131 chance; white women a 1-in-369 chance and black women a 1-in-104 chance. The assessment of murder risk was based on an analysis of reports submitted by coroners and medical examiners to the National Center for Crime Statistics in 1982. The other findings were based in part on research conducted over five years by the National Crime Survey, which conducts interviews twice a year with some 125,000 randomly selected people.

Five people were shot, one fatally, during the drive-by, in which gunmen fired more than 20 rounds.  Scott Olson/Getty Images     A team of scientists has confirmed something your parents probably warned you about as a teenager — that hanging out with the wrong crowd can be dangerous.  A study by two Yale University sociologists titled Network Exposure and Homicide Victimization in an African American Community found that some accepted metrics of vulnerability to becoming a homicide victim — such as race, membership in a gang or physical proximity to a murder victim, are less important than one's social network.  In other words, it's all about whom you know.  "[Victimization] is not simply a function of spatial proximity or of individual risk factors such as age, race, gender or gang affiliation, but also of how people are connected, the structure of the overall network, the types of behaviors occurring in the network and an individual's position in the overall structure," the authors write in the paper published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health .  Andrew Papachristos and Christopher Wildeman studied homicide and police records from 2006 to 2011 to look at 3,718 high-risk individuals living in a 6-square-mile area of Chicago with some of the city's highest murder rates. They modeled the odds of someone's becoming a gunshot homicide victim by individual characteristics, including network position and indirect exposure to homicide.     Just to be clear: the social networks the authors are talking about have nothing to do with Facebook or Twitter, at least as far as this study is concerned.  Papachristos and Wildeman concluded that "Network exposure to homicide was strongly associated with victimization: the closer one is to a homicide victim, the greater the risk of victimization."  The authors determined that 41 percent of all homicides involved just 4 percent of a neighborhood's population.  "[Homicide] is socially contagious, and associating with people engaged in risky behaviors — like carrying a firearm and engaging in criminal activities — increases the probability of victimization," Papachristos and Wildeman said.  Within the network, simply being identified as a gang member by police didn't significantly increase the chances of being a victim, they said.  The authors found that for each degree of separation from a homicide victim, one's odds of also being murdered went down by 57 percent.  "Generally, you can't catch a bullet from just anyone," Papachristos, a Chicago native, tells The Chicago Sun-Times . "Your relationship with the people involved matters. It's not unlike needle sharing or unprotected sex in the spread of HIV."  The newspaper quotes Chicago Police Department spokesman Adam Collins as saying the department was "using variations of Dr. Papachristos' research to ensure we reach out to individuals at the greatest risk for violence."    Network Exposure and Homicide Victimization in an African American Community    Papachristos said police departments in California and Connecticut were working on similar strategies to reduce crime.

				  samzenpus on Thursday April 10, 2014 @10:07PM from the protect-ya-neck dept.      ananyo (2519492) writes "A new UN report ( link to data ) details comprehensive country-by-country murder rates . Safest is Singapore, with just one killing per 480,000 people in 2012. In the world's most violent country, Honduras, a man has a 1 in 9 chance of being murdered during his lifetime. The Economist includes an intriguing 'print only interactive' (see the PDF )  and has some tongue-in-cheek tips on how to avoid being slain: 'First, don't live in the Americas or Africa, where murder rates (one in 6,100 and one in 8,000 respectively) are more than four times as high as the rest of the world. Next, be a woman. Your chance of being murdered will be barely a quarter what it would be were you a man. In fact, steer clear of men altogether: nearly half of all female murder-victims are killed by their partner or another (usually male) family member. But note that the gender imbalance is less pronounced in the rich world, probably because there is less banditry, a mainly male pursuit. In Japan and South Korea slightly over half of all murder victims are female. Then, sit back and grow older.

But for all of that, the victim, can live a full and normal life after the fact." No, no they can't. Some women recover okay, but others find themselves with a lifelong trauma that leaves them unable to form healthy relationships, leaves them scared to leave their homes, and then others just outright commit suicide. Pretending it's something that just happens and then that's it, it's over and you carry on as normal is probably one of the most stupid things I've ever seen modded up on Slashdot. I'm not sure if you just have no understanding of rape whatsoever and are completely out of depth on this topic, or if you just phrased your post incredibly poorly and unintentionally trivialised it as a result, but either way you really couldn't be more wrong in the way it's written. The very fact a non-negligible number of victims commit suicide implies that for some of them they'd actually rather be dead than have to deal with the aftermath of being raped. I understand that by definition murder means no ifs, no buts, there's no life afterwards, but for some victims the experience and aftermath of being raped was literally worse than death for them so you cannot just simplistically say that it's not worse than murder. That depends entirely on the victim, and what happened to them - it's so dependent on the case in question. For example, I'd have a hard time buying the idea that the murder of a 70 year old man who lived a full life and who had terminal cancer and only 6 months to live is somehow worse for the victim than a woman that's had to live her life with non-stop memories, clinical depression, and constant reminders of being repeatedly raped by a family member when she was a kid. I know without a doubt which victim I'd rather be. In contrast, a girl who slept with a guy and then changed her mind afterwards and then decided to cry rape, and lived in a country where that is legally acceptable to do so (Hi Sweden), probably wont have the slightest bit of trauma to suffer at all other than maybe a bit of regret about sleeping with "that guy". But these sorts of nuances just aren't born out in the statistics, so you just cannot simply say "Well, rape is not as bad as murder because you can just live a normal life afterwards" - no, just no.

Many developed countries engage in law enforcement activity that Americans would consider the mark of a police state. I've found most of those people, however, find it outrageous that Americans would be so obsessed with perceived freedom that they'd be willing to sacrifice quality of life and overall safety. The difference is that they're focused on prevention whereas American obsess about deterrence via punishment. I'm not arguing they're right necessarily but it's hard to argue when cities in most first world nations are safer than American cities. I was generally oblivious to this until I lived in Taiwan for several years. It was refreshing to be able to go out at 3am and not have to worry about being mugged. Not that there weren't problems, particularly in Southern Taiwan and especially seedy neighborhoods. And sometimes I suspect crime in other countries in under reported. There's a lot of petty crime that I think is not adequately represented. But even then it's nothing compared to how rough things can get in the US. And to think that Japan somehow manages to be on another level. Crime also doesn't tell the whole story. In Taiwan, if you really had to go looking for trouble. Otherwise no one gave you a hard time, even as a foreigner. In America, however, wander into certain neighborhoods with the wrong skin color and it's a near inevitability you'll get harassed. And usually the harassment comes from some punk teenager, which is a bit of a concerning trend. Where I used to live in the US was a borderline neighborhood that straddled the line between okay and bad neighborhoods. A week didn't go by that some asshole didn't make remarks about me, as a white guy, being out for a jog. Inevitably, you learn to avoid trouble areas and I think Americans as a culture do that constantly. The problem is that it's the equivalent to sweeping the problem under the rug. And Americans seem to have a habit of reinterpreting statistics to suit some deluded world view. Take incarceration stats. People look at the numbers and assume there's some grand conspiracy. Doesn't it occur to people that more people are in jail because there's generally more crime? Certainly, the crime statistics corroborate that. Now, the interesting thing I've found, is that American police departments are far more militaristic than anything I've seen overseas. In Taiwan, more than once I've seen a drunk woman slap a police officer and he just stands there and takes it, waiting for her to calm down. In the US they would have tased her and smashed her face into the pavement, assuming someone more gung ho didn't just pump a few rounds into her claiming probable cause. On the other hand, I found the authorities there much more comfortable with continued surveillance. Here, it's all reactionary aggression. The rare police car I see is busy blowing through stop lights supposedly on the way to an incident. In Taiwan, however police presence was more persistent and reliable. Not that cops were personable there, but there was a lot more interaction. The only time people ever see cops in America, other than directing traffic, is when something has gone wrong. No wonder people develop a negative impression. If I had to attribute crime in America with a cause, I think the single largest problem is irresponsible and shit parenting. If that were addressed I think so many other things would start falling into place. There are so many cultural problems endemic to America that you just don't see overseas, at least not to the extent they exist here.

So now in the US those black enclaves have a sky-high murder rate, and the rest of the country has a pretty low one (broadly similar to Europe's). Why? A whole constellation of historical and cultural reasons, many of them traceable back to horrid racism years ago. Should we still blame whitey for the problems? Is it slavery's fault that kids in the ghetto kill each other for silly reasons and don't want to learn to read and write? I dunno. But saying simply "Europe has diversity too" misses the point: the non-white folks in Europe are there because they came there and wanted to be European, for the most part. (This is pretty similar to Asian-Americans, a group with a low crime rate.) That has vastly different cultural effects than hauling people's ancestors over in chains and wrecking their society.

What are they so scared of? Yup, all the (other) people with guns. The comments about gun shops and firing ranges being the "safest" places demonstrates this very well. The gun-owners feel safest when surrounded by guns. However when they are out in the big, nasty, world they feel insecure that other people might have weapons they can't see, so the urge to protect themselves becomes very strong. Obviously, if nobody in the USA had a gun, this level of fear should be reduced, but it's irrational and doesn't work like that. Hence they all keep their guns and that induces more fear - so they feel the need for more and bigger guns, just as a sort of "safety blanket" (as almost none of them are ever fired in the real world) - which, of course, escalates the problem. It's all because they're all so scared of each other.

The unfortunate half-million were all those around the world who were slain in 2012. The average person thus had roughly a one in 16,000 chance of being bumped off that year. But as the UN’s figures make clear, there is no such thing as an average person. How can you shorten your odds of making it through 2014? First, don’t live in the Americas or Africa, where murder rates (one in 6,100 and one in 8,000 respectively) are more than four times as high as the rest of the world. Western Europe and East Asia are the safest regions. And the safest countries? Liechtenstein recorded no murders at all in 2012, but its population could fit in a football stadium. Among those countries whose populations number in millions, the safest is Singapore, which clocked up just 11 murders in 2012, or one killing per 480,000 people. In Honduras, the world’s most violent country, one in every 1,100 residents was killed. Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

Your chance of being murdered will be barely a quarter what it would be were you a man. In fact, steer clear of men altogether: nearly half of all female murder-victims are killed by their partner or another (usually male) family member. But note that the gender imbalance is less pronounced in the rich world, probably because there is less banditry, a mainly male pursuit. In Japan and South Korea slightly over half of all murder victims are female. Then, sit back and grow older. From the age of 30 onwards, murder rates fall steadily in most places. But not everywhere. Europeans are more at risk in middle age than in youth. European women cannot let their guard down even in retirement: those aged over 60 are more likely to be murdered than those aged 15-29. The UN speculates that this may be because they are more likely to have partners, and those partners are more likely to drink. Other studies have found that alcohol featured in half of murders in Australia, Finland and Sweden, making it a more common factor than any weapon. And if you are killed? The chances are no one will be convicted. Worldwide only 43% of murders result in someone being put behind bars. This, too, varies hugely: whereas Europe’s police solve eight out of ten murders and those in Asia clear up nearly half, three-quarters of killers in the Americas escape justice (a smaller share in North America; a higher one elsewhere in the region). As long as that continues, there is little reason to think that the region’s fearsome murder rate will be tamed.

Do you or your spouse have your name and home address printed in a company directory, church directory or other publication?   Do you have your name on your mailbox?    More Security Habits:   I use no voice mail?   Does your voicemail say you are out?   Does your voicemail unemotionally ask for messages?   Do you get two or more hangup calls per week?   Do you have call blocking on your phone service?   Do you regularly use an unlighted entrance?   Do you ever leave your house or apartment empty for an eight hour period more than once a week?   Have you answered a detailed telephone survey or phone credit application in the last year?   Are you a member of a neighborhood watch program?   Do you have your state's abbreviation and owner applied number (OAN) on all your valuables - best with six digits and state ID first?    Other Factors:   Do you have your name or address on your keyring?   Do you leave house keys on your key ring when attendants park your car?   Do you ever leave notes to workmen?   Have you or your family members lost entrance keys in the last year?   Do you live in a corner house or a corner ground floor apartment?   Do you use lights on timers?   Do you leave a radio on during daily absences (audible on the outside of your house)?   Do you leave mail in your car with the address visible?    Site Factors:   Do you live 1000 meters or more from your nearest neighbor?   Do you live out of view of the road?   Do you park outside your home or apartment (not in a garage)?   If you have a remote garage door opener to an attached garage, does the garage door lock on closing?   Do you live in or within a mile of what is considered a high crime area?   Do you live in what is considered a low crime area?   Have any of your neighbors been burglarized in the last six months?        This risk assessment is designed to give guidance and insight to educators, adults and concerned students regarding individuals in school who may have tendencies to assault others (get into fights or strike others). Individuals already involved with non-sexual assaults in the criminal justice system or referred for counseling in non-weapon assaults had many similar characteristics.  This test uses these combinations of significant risk factors and repetitive behaviors to produce intervention strategies wherever there are matching behaviors in the assessment. This test does not predict behavior (assault) but when a combination of behaviors and characteristics match the behaviors and characteristics of individuals who have already been incarcerated for assault or referred for counseling for assault -- the test response will make recommendations to lower specific risk factors.  There may also be links showing research links to aid you further.   This test is NOT designed to replace a trained school or mental health counselor. Responses to the test depend on the quality and completeness of the input. Remember - inaccurate or incomplete information input will result in inaccurate output.  The test responses may give suggestions for intervention or mitigation of problems.  Students (individuals) who score high share most of the behaviors and risk factors of students who have ALREADY gotten into fights or hit other people (assault and battery or aggravated assault).  This test uses warning indicators or factors from others who have already assaulted other students, teachers or peers.  Please use any recommendations provided by the test as a proactive tool to provide support and services to students. Some individuals may rise above high risk factors and never threaten or assault another individual .  The following Assault Risk Factors Assessment was developed through a School Based Partnership Grant .  The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, School Security, Metropolitan Juvenile Courts and Oasis Center, Inc. designed this test with funding and in cooperation with the National Institute of Justice - COPS Office.  The Metropolitan Police Department, Metropolitan Public Schools, Metropolitan Juvenile Court, National Institute of Justice, and the Oasis Center Incorporated are not responsible for the actions of any individuals taking this test. Use this tool as a triage method for students needing help -- and help those who may be marginally at risk. This assessment only uses risk factors (behaviors/characteristics) for non-weapon, non-sexual assaults and is normalized for Nashville, Davidson County at this time.   Only use this tool as an aid to reduce risk factors for assaults and find resources to intervene with students who have a significant number of risk factors similar to others who have already committed simple or aggravated assault.   Take the Assault Intervention - Risk Reduction Assessment and answer as many questions as possible.  You will be trying to find out if the person you are assessing has a pattern of risk factors similar to others who have ALREADY assaulted other people. This assessment will suggest what constitutes a risk factor and ways to reduce these risk factors.  Be thorough and try to be as honest as possible. Try to avoid bias in your test or the results will not be helpful. Many people will find that they do not have enough facts to complete an evaluation. Don't make snap judgments about this youth as you may only see how they are responding to your perception of them .  Have you spent more than five minutes with them?

What Are the Odds of Being Murdered?     Crime  /  Society             Flip through the channels on television on any ordinary weekday evening and you’ll be presented with a variety of entertainment options, many of which feature murder, in documentary or drama form. Murder, or intentional homicide, persistently occupies a place at the center of the popular imagination. Yet, for all its popularity, for all its pervasiveness in primetime television, local news or even bestseller lists, murder is a relatively rare occurrence.   The Odds of Being Murdered in Context  The odds of being murdered are relatively low when compared to other possible causes of death. In its Final Data report of U.S. deaths for 2010, the CDC reported assault (homicide) dropped off of the list of the 15 leading causes of death, becoming 16th, following “pneumonitis due to solids and liquids.”  Based on the data from the CDC report, deaths due to homicide accounted for less than 1% of all U.S. deaths, with the odds of being murdered in a given year at 1 in 18,989 . On the other hand, heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S., accounted for 24% of all U.S. deaths, with the odds of dying of heart disease at 1 in 517.  Murder and Place: Location, Communities, and Socioeconomics  The odds of being murdered vary significantly on the basis of location. However, it must be noted that careful analysis of the data reveals that “location” is most appropriately understood as referring not only to geography but also to other ways of defining place, including community type and socioeconomic conditions.  When murder rates are discussed from the perspective of location, people often ask which places—specific regions, states, counties, cities, or areas—have the highest and lowest homicide rates. Detailed data on the numbers of murders occurring annually can be found in the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports (UCR). Moreover, when cities or communities are grouped together or categorized by community type—rural, suburban or urban—an apparent trend emerges. Rural communities and suburban communities have lower average homicide rates than do urban communities (Schwartz 2010).  Cities, and more broadly, community types, are home to distinctive sets of socioeconomic conditions that form the backdrop of the murders that occur. Socioeconomic context is an important variable to consider when discussing the odds of being murdered. An individual’s socioeconomic context can be defined broadly as the aggregate combination of education, income, and occupation of the people who comprise his or her social sphere. Individuals who are a part of poverty-stricken socioeconomic contexts face greater odds of being murdered while individuals belonging to more affluent socioeconomic contexts have lower odds of being murdered.  Murder and Demographics  Besides location in general and socioeconomic context in particular, there are demographic characteristics that are relevant to an individual’s odds of being murdered, including sex, race and age. Males are more likely to be murdered than females. Individuals of African-American descent are more likely to be murdered than members of any other racial group. Individuals between the ages of 18 and 24 are at the greatest risk of being murdered. Additionally, individuals are most likely to be murdered by someone they know, and not a stranger.  It is also noteworthy that murder victim characteristics mirror those of murder perpetrators. The exception to this general pattern is the fact that females are usually murdered by males and less frequently by females (Schwartz 2010). In other words, an individual is most likely to be murdered by someone who has the same demographic traits, within his own socioeconomic context. More often than not, males are murdered by males, blacks are most often murdered by blacks and young adults are most often murdered by young adults.  However, murder and violence are tied not only to individual demographic traits, but also intrinsically to community level characteristics as well, as “communities are often segregated by SES, race, and ethnicity,” the American Psychological Association (APA) asserts. The APA goes on to explain that “community level risk factors for violence include increased levels of unemployment, poverty, and transiency; decreased levels of economic opportunities and community participation; poor housing conditions; and a lack of access to services.”  Murder, Relationships, and Crime  Murder is often precipitated by one of two additional factors as well: either an interpersonal relationship characterized by a history of confrontation or abuse or an active attempt to commit another crime.  Less than 30% of murders occur as a result of an active attempt to commit a felony, such as a robbery.  Murders involving a male victim and a male perpetrator most frequently occur during the course of or following a confrontation, an argument that in many cases originated because of a perceived slight, challenge or insult on the part of a male friend or acquaintance. Schwartz, Anderson and Messerschmidt each offer similar descriptions of this particular male murder motive, which Schwartz summarizes:  Whereas middle- and upper- class males may have a myriad of opportunities to “do masculinity,” lower class males living in concentrated urban poverty may, over time and as an adaptation to persistent economic strain, place stronger collective emphasis on more achievable goals than financial success, such as respect and prestige conferred to those with a street reputation (Anderson 1999; Messerschmidt 2004).  The murder of female victims is most often perpetrated within the framework of an intimate relationship. Usually, homicides against women are carried out by their male partners, at what turns out to be the end of a trajectory of escalating abuse or dominance (Schwartz 2010).

The study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics also concluded that about six million Americans, roughly 3 percent of those over 12, would become a victim of robbery, rape or other assault in a given year. The report said that over their lifetimes, black men have a 1-in-21 chance of being murdered; white men have a 1-in-131 chance; white women a 1-in-369 chance and black women a 1-in-104 chance. The assessment of murder risk was based on an analysis of reports submitted by coroners and medical examiners to the National Center for Crime Statistics in 1982. The other findings were based in part on research conducted over five years by the National Crime Survey, which conducts interviews twice a year with some 125,000 randomly selected people.

Five people were shot, one fatally, during the drive-by, in which gunmen fired more than 20 rounds.  Scott Olson/Getty Images     A team of scientists has confirmed something your parents probably warned you about as a teenager — that hanging out with the wrong crowd can be dangerous.  A study by two Yale University sociologists titled Network Exposure and Homicide Victimization in an African American Community found that some accepted metrics of vulnerability to becoming a homicide victim — such as race, membership in a gang or physical proximity to a murder victim, are less important than one's social network.  In other words, it's all about whom you know.  "[Victimization] is not simply a function of spatial proximity or of individual risk factors such as age, race, gender or gang affiliation, but also of how people are connected, the structure of the overall network, the types of behaviors occurring in the network and an individual's position in the overall structure," the authors write in the paper published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health .  Andrew Papachristos and Christopher Wildeman studied homicide and police records from 2006 to 2011 to look at 3,718 high-risk individuals living in a 6-square-mile area of Chicago with some of the city's highest murder rates. They modeled the odds of someone's becoming a gunshot homicide victim by individual characteristics, including network position and indirect exposure to homicide.     Just to be clear: the social networks the authors are talking about have nothing to do with Facebook or Twitter, at least as far as this study is concerned.  Papachristos and Wildeman concluded that "Network exposure to homicide was strongly associated with victimization: the closer one is to a homicide victim, the greater the risk of victimization."  The authors determined that 41 percent of all homicides involved just 4 percent of a neighborhood's population.  "[Homicide] is socially contagious, and associating with people engaged in risky behaviors — like carrying a firearm and engaging in criminal activities — increases the probability of victimization," Papachristos and Wildeman said.  Within the network, simply being identified as a gang member by police didn't significantly increase the chances of being a victim, they said.

Safest is Singapore, with just one killing per 480,000 people in 2012. In the world's most violent country, Honduras, a man has a 1 in 9 chance of being murdered during his lifetime. The Economist includes an intriguing 'print only interactive' (see the PDF )  and has some tongue-in-cheek tips on how to avoid being slain: 'First, don't live in the Americas or Africa, where murder rates (one in 6,100 and one in 8,000 respectively) are more than four times as high as the rest of the world. Next, be a woman. Your chance of being murdered will be barely a quarter what it would be were you a man. In fact, steer clear of men altogether: nearly half of all female murder-victims are killed by their partner or another (usually male) family member. But note that the gender imbalance is less pronounced in the rich world, probably because there is less banditry, a mainly male pursuit. In Japan and South Korea slightly over half of all murder victims are female. Then, sit back and grow older. From the age of 30 onwards, murder rates fall steadily in most places.'"                 crime  un  privilege                ←    You may like to read:    →     Heartbleed Coder: Bug In OpenSSL Was an Honest Mistake      Google May Be In Trouble For Firing James Damore  FreeBSD's New Code of Conduct  Trump Fires FBI Director James Comey  Trump Administration Rolls Back Obama-Era Nutrition Standards For School Lunches  Oregon Fines Man For Writing a Complaint Email Stating 'I Am An Engineer'  Submission: UN report reveals odds of being murdered country-by-country      93 Harvard Faculty Members Call On the University To Divest From Fossil Fuels                                            This discussion has been archived.

Life is good then in Singapore. If you think you can have a career in drug dealing, then you would indeed be very, very dumb to try that in Singapore. The result is that the city state is visibly suffering far less from drug abuse issues than nearly any other city. And indeed, neither the government, NOR THE LOCALS, are fond of graffiti. If you want to be an asshole and try it anyway, well you know the risk associated. And yes, even the locals call it a "fine" city as their are fines for a lot of misdemeanors, yet the fine system did change behaviour. As an amusing example, if I am remembering well, you can have a fine for not flushing in a public toilet. This had an effect, you have to keep in mind the poor uncultivated beginnings of Singapore. Currently the behaviour of most everyone is changed, nobody even wonders if they should apply basic hygienic procedures. I agree that whipping is draconian and overkill towards foreigners overstaying their work visum. It is luckily enough of a deterrent to strongly discourage the practice.  In general however it is not at all a fascist police state. I have lived there, I experienced it. I would call the non-democratic government rather a kind of "enlightened despotism", and I (and my fellow expats back then) had to admit that they did a lot of things very, very well indeed.  Interestingly, Singapore in the 1980s was the model for Deng Xiaoping who during a visit noticed how you can have good prosperity and strong government influence together.

But for all of that, the victim, can live a full and normal life after the fact." No, no they can't. Some women recover okay, but others find themselves with a lifelong trauma that leaves them unable to form healthy relationships, leaves them scared to leave their homes, and then others just outright commit suicide. Pretending it's something that just happens and then that's it, it's over and you carry on as normal is probably one of the most stupid things I've ever seen modded up on Slashdot. I'm not sure if you just have no understanding of rape whatsoever and are completely out of depth on this topic, or if you just phrased your post incredibly poorly and unintentionally trivialised it as a result, but either way you really couldn't be more wrong in the way it's written. The very fact a non-negligible number of victims commit suicide implies that for some of them they'd actually rather be dead than have to deal with the aftermath of being raped. I understand that by definition murder means no ifs, no buts, there's no life afterwards, but for some victims the experience and aftermath of being raped was literally worse than death for them so you cannot just simplistically say that it's not worse than murder. That depends entirely on the victim, and what happened to them - it's so dependent on the case in question. For example, I'd have a hard time buying the idea that the murder of a 70 year old man who lived a full life and who had terminal cancer and only 6 months to live is somehow worse for the victim than a woman that's had to live her life with non-stop memories, clinical depression, and constant reminders of being repeatedly raped by a family member when she was a kid. I know without a doubt which victim I'd rather be. In contrast, a girl who slept with a guy and then changed her mind afterwards and then decided to cry rape, and lived in a country where that is legally acceptable to do so (Hi Sweden), probably wont have the slightest bit of trauma to suffer at all other than maybe a bit of regret about sleeping with "that guy".

Many developed countries engage in law enforcement activity that Americans would consider the mark of a police state. I've found most of those people, however, find it outrageous that Americans would be so obsessed with perceived freedom that they'd be willing to sacrifice quality of life and overall safety. The difference is that they're focused on prevention whereas American obsess about deterrence via punishment. I'm not arguing they're right necessarily but it's hard to argue when cities in most first world nations are safer than American cities. I was generally oblivious to this until I lived in Taiwan for several years. It was refreshing to be able to go out at 3am and not have to worry about being mugged. Not that there weren't problems, particularly in Southern Taiwan and especially seedy neighborhoods. And sometimes I suspect crime in other countries in under reported. There's a lot of petty crime that I think is not adequately represented. But even then it's nothing compared to how rough things can get in the US. And to think that Japan somehow manages to be on another level. Crime also doesn't tell the whole story. In Taiwan, if you really had to go looking for trouble. Otherwise no one gave you a hard time, even as a foreigner. In America, however, wander into certain neighborhoods with the wrong skin color and it's a near inevitability you'll get harassed. And usually the harassment comes from some punk teenager, which is a bit of a concerning trend. Where I used to live in the US was a borderline neighborhood that straddled the line between okay and bad neighborhoods. A week didn't go by that some asshole didn't make remarks about me, as a white guy, being out for a jog. Inevitably, you learn to avoid trouble areas and I think Americans as a culture do that constantly. The problem is that it's the equivalent to sweeping the problem under the rug. And Americans seem to have a habit of reinterpreting statistics to suit some deluded world view. Take incarceration stats. People look at the numbers and assume there's some grand conspiracy. Doesn't it occur to people that more people are in jail because there's generally more crime? Certainly, the crime statistics corroborate that. Now, the interesting thing I've found, is that American police departments are far more militaristic than anything I've seen overseas. In Taiwan, more than once I've seen a drunk woman slap a police officer and he just stands there and takes it, waiting for her to calm down. In the US they would have tased her and smashed her face into the pavement, assuming someone more gung ho didn't just pump a few rounds into her claiming probable cause. On the other hand, I found the authorities there much more comfortable with continued surveillance. Here, it's all reactionary aggression. The rare police car I see is busy blowing through stop lights supposedly on the way to an incident. In Taiwan, however police presence was more persistent and reliable. Not that cops were personable there, but there was a lot more interaction. The only time people ever see cops in America, other than directing traffic, is when something has gone wrong. No wonder people develop a negative impression. If I had to attribute crime in America with a cause, I think the single largest problem is irresponsible and shit parenting. If that were addressed I think so many other things would start falling into place. There are so many cultural problems endemic to America that you just don't see overseas, at least not to the extent they exist here.

You also seem to be woefully ill-informed of the diversity in many places in Europe which rivals (or beats) the diversity in many violence-soaked places in the US.  So to recap:  you are making excuses for your country based on nonsense, in some childish attempt to not have to think about the intrinsic issues in the US which makes it one of the most dangerous countries in the developed world.  You do realise you, and those who think like you, are causing harm to the US, right?  As you gladly dismiss any criticism as being European propaganda, ensuring the harm continues unabated, just so you can feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside.  You're clearly an intelligent person, so I have no idea what happened to you to skew your brain this way.

Folks generally don't cross an ocean to then shit on the society they've come to join. Sure enough there's really not that much violence in most immigrant communities in the US. I used to live in the slums of Baltimore, and finally moved to a new apartment in DC. I got to the laundry room and saw a lady in there speaking Spanish to her daughter, and thought "Alrighty, if the immigrants have come here, this is a decent place." I was right. But the highest crime rate in the US is in the black enclaves in the inner cities. That population was never an immigrant community; it's the descendants of former slaves. We (the American whites) did horrible things to them, and then after emancipation continued to do horrible things to them in part of the country while not really doing enough to facilitate the integration of the liberated slaves and their descendants into society. By the time we passed the Civil Rights Act there were endemic social problems in the US black community, to the point that there's a long and very respectful Department of Labor study into them (the Moynihan Report). So now in the US those black enclaves have a sky-high murder rate, and the rest of the country has a pretty low one (broadly similar to Europe's). Why? A whole constellation of historical and cultural reasons, many of them traceable back to horrid racism years ago. Should we still blame whitey for the problems? Is it slavery's fault that kids in the ghetto kill each other for silly reasons and don't want to learn to read and write? I dunno. But saying simply "Europe has diversity too" misses the point: the non-white folks in Europe are there because they came there and wanted to be European, for the most part. (This is pretty similar to Asian-Americans, a group with a low crime rate.) That has vastly different cultural effects than hauling people's ancestors over in chains and wrecking their society.

Agree the US is far more diverse than most non-American's realise but it's diversity was inherited from Europe, not only via the early settlers, but also the gold rush days, and the two world wars.

What are they so scared of? Yup, all the (other) people with guns. The comments about gun shops and firing ranges being the "safest" places demonstrates this very well. The gun-owners feel safest when surrounded by guns. However when they are out in the big, nasty, world they feel insecure that other people might have weapons they can't see, so the urge to protect themselves becomes very strong. Obviously, if nobody in the USA had a gun, this level of fear should be reduced, but it's irrational and doesn't work like that. Hence they all keep their guns and that induces more fear - so they feel the need for more and bigger guns, just as a sort of "safety blanket" (as almost none of them are ever fired in the real world) - which, of course, escalates the problem. It's all because they're all so scared of each other.
