If $A$ and $B$ are independent events, then the probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur is the product of the probabilities of $A$ and $B$.  Let $A$ be the event I am right on my first guess, and let $B$ be the event I am right on my second guess. Then the probability I am right on both guesses is $(1/2)(1/2)$, or equivalently $(1/2)^2$.  Let $A$ be the event I am right on the first two guesses, and let $B$ be the event I am right on the third guess. Then the probability that both $A$ and $B$ happen, i.e. that I am right on the first $3$ guesses, is $(1.2)^2(1.2)=(1/2)^3$.  Let $A$ be the event I am right on the first three guesses, and let $B$ be the event I am right on the fourth guess. Then the probability that both $A$ and $B$ happen, i.e. that I am right on the first $4$ guesses, is $(1.2)^3(1.2)=(1/2)^4$.  We can keep on using the same reasoning, and conclude that the probability of being right for $X$ guesses in a row is $(1/2)^X$.  More generally, if my probability of being right on any guess is $p$, and I make $X$ independent guesses in a row, my probability of being right all $X$ times is $p^X$.  Remark: Your question used the word odds and we used the term probability . These are different but closely related notions. Probability is mathematically more useful, but odds are more directly useful to gamblers.  Roughly speaking, the odds against an event is the ratio of the probability the event happens to the probability it doesn't happen.  Take for example your $X=7$. The probability we guess right $7$ times in a row is $(1/2)^7$, which is $\frac{1}{128}$.  The odds that this happens are $1$ to $127$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 30 '13 at 15:47             answered Jun 30 '13 at 15:34       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779                  Thank you, this answer was also very useful. – user84483  Jun 30 '13 at 16:16        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      This is a geometric random variable described by the geometric distribution , specifically the first one defined in the article.

It goes like this:  double your last...  1st time: 1 in 2   -  (win a single coin toss)
2nd time: 1 in 4   -  (win 2 consecutive coin tosses) . . .etc.
3rd time: 1 in 8
4th time: 1 in 16
5th time: 1 in 32
6th time: 1 in 64 . . . etc . . . 1 in 2 to the nth. If you wanna get complicated with it then if 2 events have the same odds, there's no such thing as "independence" it's all in your head. Just add number of attempts together (nth)<--(this is an exponent). If the odds aren't 50/50 or if there are multiple events multiply the odds together. 1 in 4 should be represented as the fraction 1/4, 2 in 17 as 2/17 and so on... An example would be: "What would the odds of winning both a 1 in 3 bet and a 1 in 6 bet?" 1/3 X 1/6 = 1/18 or just multiply the 3 and 6 to make it easy. If you wanna know the odds of winning one and losing another, you don't do anything different, just flip the losses upside-down (inverse fractions) Make sense? "What are the odds of winning a 1 in 4 bet and a 1 in 6 bet, then losing a 1 in 4 bet?" 1/4 X 1/6 X 4/1(or just 4)= 1/6. I'm not going to bother with probability vs odds syntax since both boil down to the same thing. Just make sure that a preposition is never the word that you end your sentence in.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 9 at 13:57       NOC117   1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Odds ratio   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search   In statistics , the odds ratio ( OR ) [1] [2] [3] is one of three main ways to quantify how strongly the presence or absence of property A is associated with the presence or absence of property B in a given population . If each individual in a population either does or does not have a property "A" (e.g. "high blood pressure"), and also either does or does not have a property "B" (e.g. "moderate alcohol consumption") where both properties are appropriately defined, then a ratio can be formed which quantitatively describes the association between the presence/absence of "A" (high blood pressure) and the presence/absence of "B" (moderate alcohol consumption) for individuals in the population. This ratio is the odds ratio (OR) and can be computed following these steps:   For a given individual that has "B" compute the odds that the same individual has "A"  For a given individual that does not have "B" compute the odds that the same individual has "A"  Divide the odds from step 1 by the odds from step 2 to obtain the odds ratio (OR).   The term "individual" in this usage does not have to refer to a human being, as a statistical population can measure any set of entities, whether living or inanimate.  If the OR is greater than 1, then having "A" is considered to be " associated " with having "B" in the sense that the having of "B" raises (relative to not-having "B") the odds of having "A". Note that this does not establish that B is a contributing cause of "A": it could be that the association is due to a third property, "C", which is a contributing cause of both "A" and "B" ( confounding ). The odds ratio compares the occurrence of the outcome in the presence of a particular exposure, with the occurrence of the outcome in the absence of a particular exposure.  The two other major ways of quantifying association are the risk ratio ("RR") and the absolute risk reduction ("ARR"). In clinical studies and many other settings, the parameter of greatest interest is often actually the RR, which is determined in a way that is similar to the one just described for the OR, except using probabilities instead of odds. Frequently, however, the available data only allows the computation of the OR ; notably, this is so in the case of case-control studies , as explained below. On the other hand, if one of the properties (say, A) is sufficiently rare (the " rare disease assumption "), then the OR of having A given that the individual has B is a good approximation to the corresponding RR (the specification "A given B" is needed because, while the OR treats the two properties symmetrically, the RR and other measures do not).  In a more technical language, the OR is a measure of effect size , describing the strength of association or non- independence between two binary data values. It is used as a descriptive statistic , and plays an important role in logistic regression .

Imagine we suspect that being exposed to something (say, having had a particular sort of injury in childhood) makes one more likely to develop that disease in adulthood. The most informative thing to compute would be the risk ratio, RR. To do this in the ideal case, for all the adults in the population we would need to know whether they (a) had the exposure to the injury as children and (b) whether they developed the disease as adults. From this we would extract the following information: the total number of people exposed to the childhood injury,      N   E    ,    {\displaystyle N_{E},}   out of which      D   E      {\displaystyle D_{E}}   developed the disease and      H   E      {\displaystyle H_{E}}   stayed healthy; and the total number of people not exposed,      N   N    ,    {\displaystyle N_{N},}   out of which      D   N      {\displaystyle D_{N}}   developed the disease and      H   N      {\displaystyle H_{N}}   stayed healthy. Since      N   E    =   D   E    +   H   E      {\displaystyle N_{E}=D_{E}+H_{E}}   and similarly for the      N   N      {\displaystyle N_{N}}   numbers, we only have four independent numbers, which we can organize in a table :      Diseased  Healthy    Exposed       D   E      {\displaystyle D_{E}}         H   E      {\displaystyle H_{E}}      Not exposed       D   N      {\displaystyle D_{N}}         H   N      {\displaystyle H_{N}}       To avoid possible confusion, we emphasize that all these numbers refer to the entire population, and not to some sample of it.  Now the risk of developing the disease given exposure is      D   E     /    N   E      {\displaystyle D_{E}/N_{E}}   (where      N   E    =   D   E    +   H   E      {\displaystyle N_{E}=D_{E}+H_{E}}   ), and of developing the disease given non-exposure is      D   N     /    N   N    .    {\displaystyle D_{N}/N_{N}.}   The risk ratio , RR, is just the ratio of the two,       R  R  =      D   E     /    N   E       D   N     /    N   N        ,    {\displaystyle RR={\frac {D_{E}/N_{E}}{D_{N}/N_{N}}}\,,}     which can be rewritten as     R  R  =      D   E     N   N       D   N     N   E       =      D   E     /    D   N       N   E     /    N   N       .    {\displaystyle RR={\frac {D_{E}N_{N}}{D_{N}N_{E}}}={\frac {D_{E}/D_{N}}{N_{E}/N_{N}}}.}    In contrast, the odds of developing the disease given exposure is      D   E     /    H   E     ,    {\displaystyle D_{E}/H_{E}\,,}   and of developing the disease given non-exposure is      D   N     /    H   N     .    {\displaystyle D_{N}/H_{N}\,.}   The odds ratio , OR, is the ratio of the two,       O  R  =      D   E     /    H   E       D   N     /    H   N        ,    {\displaystyle OR={\frac {D_{E}/H_{E}}{D_{N}/H_{N}}}\,,}     which can be rewritten as     O  R  =      D   E     H   N       D   N     H   E       =      D   E     /    D   N       H   E     /    H   N       .    {\displaystyle OR={\frac {D_{E}H_{N}}{D_{N}H_{E}}}={\frac {D_{E}/D_{N}}{H_{E}/H_{N}}}.}    We may already note that if the disease is rare, then OR ≈ RR. Indeed, for a rare disease, we will have      D   E    ≪   H   E    ,    {\displaystyle D_{E}\ll H_{E},}   and so      D   E    +   H   E    ≈   H   E    ;    {\displaystyle D_{E}+H_{E}\approx H_{E};}   but then      D   E     /   (   D   E    +   H   E    )  ≈   D   E     /    H   E    ,    {\displaystyle D_{E}/(D_{E}+H_{E})\approx D_{E}/H_{E},}   in other words, for the exposed population, the risk of developing the disease is approximately equal to the odds. Analogous reasoning shows that the risk is approximately equal to the odds for the non-exposed population as well; but then the ratio of the risks, which is RR, is approximately equal to the ratio of the odds, which is OR. Or, we could just notice that the rare disease assumption says that      N   E    ≈   H   E      {\displaystyle N_{E}\approx H_{E}}   and      N   N    ≈   H   N    ,    {\displaystyle N_{N}\approx H_{N},}   from which it follows that      N   E     /    N   N    ≈   H   E     /    H   N    ,    {\displaystyle N_{E}/N_{N}\approx H_{E}/H_{N},}   in other words that the denominators in the final expressions for the RR and the OR are approximately the same. The numerators are exactly the same, and so, again, we conclude that OR ≈ RR. Returning to our hypothetical study, the problem we often face is that we may not have the data to estimate these four numbers. For example, we may not have the population-wide data on who did or did not have the childhood injury.  Often we may overcome this problem by employing random sampling of the population: namely, if neither the disease nor the exposure to the injury are too rare in our population, then we can pick (say) a hundred people at random, and find out these four numbers in that sample; assuming the sample is representative enough of the population, then the RR computed for this sample will be a good estimate for the RR for the whole population.  However, some diseases may be so rare that, in all likelihood, even a large random sample may not contain even a single diseased individual (or it may contain some, but too few to be statistically significant). This would make it impossible to compute the RR. But, we may nevertheless be able to estimate the OR, provided that , unlike the disease, the exposure to the childhood injury is not too rare. Of course, because the disease is rare, this is then also our estimate for the RR.  Looking at the final expression for the OR: the fraction in the numerator,      D   E     /    D   N    ,    {\displaystyle D_{E}/D_{N},}   we can estimate by collecting all the known cases of the disease (presumably there must be some, or else we likely wouldn't be doing the study in the first place), and seeing how many of the diseased people had the exposure, and how many did not. And the fraction in the denominator,      H   E     /    H   N    ,    {\displaystyle H_{E}/H_{N},}   is the odds that a healthy individual in the population was exposed to the childhood injury. Now note that this latter odds can indeed be estimated by random sampling of the population—provided, as we said, that the prevalence of the exposure to the childhood injury is not too small, so that a random sample of a manageable size would be likely to contain a fair number of individuals who have had the exposure. So here the disease is very rare, but the factor thought to contribute to it is not quite so rare; such situations are quite common in practice.  Thus we can estimate the OR, and then, invoking the rare disease assumption again, we say that this is also a good approximation of the RR. Incidentally, the scenario described above is a paradigmatic example of a case-control study . [4]  The same story could be told without ever mentioning the OR, like so: as soon as we have that      N   E    ≈   H   E      {\displaystyle N_{E}\approx H_{E}}   and      N   N    ≈   H   N    ,    {\displaystyle N_{N}\approx H_{N},}   then we have that      N   E     /    N   N    ≈   H   E     /    H   N    .    {\displaystyle N_{E}/N_{N}\approx H_{E}/H_{N}.}   Thus if, by random sampling, we manage to estimate      H   E     /    H   N    ,    {\displaystyle H_{E}/H_{N},}   then, by rare disease assumption, that will be a good estimate of      N   E     /    N   N    ,    {\displaystyle N_{E}/N_{N},}   which is all we need (besides      D   E     /    D   N    ,    {\displaystyle D_{E}/D_{N},}   which we presumably already know by studying the few cases of the disease) to compute the RR. However, it is standard in the literature to explicitly report the OR and then claim that the RR is approximately equal to it.  Definition in terms of group-wise odds [ edit ]  The odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of an event occurring in one group to the odds of it occurring in another group. The term is also used to refer to sample-based estimates of this ratio. These groups might be men and women, an experimental group and a control group , or any other dichotomous classification. If the probabilities of the event in each of the groups are p 1 (first group) and p 2 (second group), then the odds ratio is:           p   1     /   (  1  −   p   1    )     p   2     /   (  1  −   p   2    )     =      p   1     /    q   1       p   2     /    q   2       =       p   1     q   2         p   2     q   1        ,    {\displaystyle {p_{1}/(1-p_{1}) \over p_{2}/(1-p_{2})}={p_{1}/q_{1} \over p_{2}/q_{2}}={\frac {\;p_{1}q_{2}\;}{\;p_{2}q_{1}\;}},}     where q x = 1 − p x . An odds ratio of 1 indicates that the condition or event under study is equally likely to occur in both groups. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates that the condition or event is more likely to occur in the first group. And an odds ratio less than 1 indicates that the condition or event is less likely to occur in the first group. The odds ratio must be nonnegative if it is defined. It is undefined if p 2 q 1 equals zero, i.e., if p 2 equals zero or q 1 equals zero.  Definition in terms of joint and conditional probabilities [ edit ]  The odds ratio can also be defined in terms of the joint probability distribution of two binary random variables . The joint distribution of binary random variables X and Y can be written            Y  =  1    Y  =  0      X  =  1     p   11       p   10        X  =  0     p   01       p   00          {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{c|cc}&Y=1&Y=0\\\hline X=1&p_{11}&p_{10}\\X=0&p_{01}&p_{00}\end{array}}}     where p 11 , p 10 , p 01 and p 00 are non-negative "cell probabilities" that sum to one. The odds for Y within the two subpopulations defined by X = 1 and X = 0 are defined in terms of the conditional probabilities given X , i.e. , P ( Y | X ) :            Y  =  1    Y  =  0      X  =  1       p   11      p   11    +   p   10            p   10      p   11    +   p   10           X  =  0       p   01      p   01    +   p   00            p   00      p   01    +   p   00             {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{c|cc}&Y=1&Y=0\\\hline X=1&{\frac {p_{11}}{p_{11}+p_{10}}}&{\frac {p_{10}}{p_{11}+p_{10}}}\\X=0&{\frac {p_{01}}{p_{01}+p_{00}}}&{\frac {p_{00}}{p_{01}+p_{00}}}\end{array}}}     Thus the odds ratio is             p   11     /   (   p   11    +   p   10    )     p   10     /   (   p   11    +   p   10    )        /         p   01     /   (   p   01    +   p   00    )     p   00     /   (   p   01    +   p   00    )       =       p   11     p   00       p   10     p   01          {\displaystyle {{\dfrac {p_{11}/(p_{11}+p_{10})}{p_{10}/(p_{11}+p_{10})}}{\bigg /}{\dfrac {p_{01}/(p_{01}+p_{00})}{p_{00}/(p_{01}+p_{00})}}}={\dfrac {p_{11}p_{00}}{p_{10}p_{01}}}}     The simple expression on the right, above, is easy to remember as the product of the probabilities of the "concordant cells" ( X = Y ) divided by the product of the probabilities of the "discordant cells" ( X ≠ Y ) . However note that in some applications the labeling of categories as zero and one is arbitrary, so there is nothing special about concordant versus discordant values in these applications.  Symmetry [ edit ]  If we had calculated the odds ratio based on the conditional probabilities given Y ,            Y  =  1    Y  =  0      X  =  1       p   11      p   11    +   p   01            p   10      p   10    +   p   00           X  =  0       p   01      p   11    +   p   01            p   00      p   10    +   p   00             {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{c|cc}&Y=1&Y=0\\\hline X=1&{\frac {p_{11}}{p_{11}+p_{01}}}&{\frac {p_{10}}{p_{10}+p_{00}}}\\X=0&{\frac {p_{01}}{p_{11}+p_{01}}}&{\frac {p_{00}}{p_{10}+p_{00}}}\end{array}}}     we would have gotten the same result             p   11     /   (   p   11    +   p   01    )     p   01     /   (   p   11    +   p   01    )        /         p   10     /   (   p   10    +   p   00    )     p   00     /   (   p   10    +   p   00    )       =       p   11     p   00       p   10     p   01        .    {\displaystyle {{\dfrac {p_{11}/(p_{11}+p_{01})}{p_{01}/(p_{11}+p_{01})}}{\bigg /}{\dfrac {p_{10}/(p_{10}+p_{00})}{p_{00}/(p_{10}+p_{00})}}}={\dfrac {p_{11}p_{00}}{p_{10}p_{01}}}.}     Other measures of effect size for binary data such as the relative risk do not have this symmetry property.  Relation to statistical independence [ edit ]  If X and Y are independent, their joint probabilities can be expressed in terms of their marginal probabilities p x = P ( X = 1) and p y = P ( Y = 1) , as follows            Y  =  1    Y  =  0      X  =  1     p   x     p   y       p   x    (  1  −   p   y    )      X  =  0    (  1  −   p   x    )   p   y      (  1  −   p   x    )  (  1  −   p   y    )        {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{c|cc}&Y=1&Y=0\\\hline X=1&p_{x}p_{y}&p_{x}(1-p_{y})\\X=0&(1-p_{x})p_{y}&(1-p_{x})(1-p_{y})\end{array}}}     In this case, the odds ratio equals one, and conversely the odds ratio can only equal one if the joint probabilities can be factored in this way. Thus the odds ratio equals one if and only if X and Y are independent .  Recovering the cell probabilities from the odds ratio and marginal probabilities [ edit ]  The odds ratio is a function of the cell probabilities, and conversely, the cell probabilities can be recovered given knowledge of the odds ratio and the marginal probabilities P ( X = 1) = p 11 + p 10 and P ( Y = 1) = p 11 + p 01 . If the odds ratio R differs from 1, then        p   11    =     1  +  (   p   1  ⋅    +   p   ⋅  1    )  (  R  −  1  )  −  S    2  (  R  −  1  )       {\displaystyle p_{11}={\frac {1+(p_{1\cdot }+p_{\cdot 1})(R-1)-S}{2(R-1)}}}     where p 1• = p 11 + p 10 , p •1 = p 11 + p 01 , and       S  =    (  1  +  (   p   1  ⋅    +   p   ⋅  1    )  (  R  −  1  )   )   2    +  4  R  (  1  −  R  )   p   1  ⋅     p   ⋅  1      .    {\displaystyle S={\sqrt {(1+(p_{1\cdot }+p_{\cdot 1})(R-1))^{2}+4R(1-R)p_{1\cdot }p_{\cdot 1}}}.}     In the case where R = 1 , we have independence, so p 11 = p 1• p •1 .  Once we have p 11 , the other three cell probabilities can easily be recovered from the marginal probabilities.  Example [ edit ]     A graph showing how the log odds ratio relates to the underlying probabilities of the outcome X occurring in two groups, denoted A and B . The log odds ratio shown here is based on the odds for the event occurring in group B relative to the odds for the event occurring in group A . Thus, when the probability of X occurring in group B is greater than the probability of X occurring in group A , the odds ratio is greater than 1, and the log odds ratio is greater than 0.    Suppose that in a sample of 100 men, 90 drank wine in the previous week, while in a sample of 100 women only 20 drank wine in the same period. The odds of a man drinking wine are 90 to 10, or 9:1, while the odds of a woman drinking wine are only 20 to 80, or 1:4 = 0.25:1. The odds ratio is thus 9/0.25, or 36, showing that men are much more likely to drink wine than women. The detailed calculation is:          0.9   /   0.1    0.2   /   0.8     =      0.9  ×  0.8      0.1  ×  0.2      =    0.72  0.02    =  36    {\displaystyle {0.9/0.1 \over 0.2/0.8}={\frac {\;0.9\times 0.8\;}{\;0.1\times 0.2\;}}={0.72 \over 0.02}=36}     This example also shows how odds ratios are sometimes sensitive in stating relative positions: in this sample men are (90/100)/(20/100) = 4.5 times as likely to have drunk wine than women, but have 36 times the odds. The logarithm of the odds ratio, the difference of the logits of the probabilities , tempers this effect, and also makes the measure symmetric with respect to the ordering of groups. For example, using natural logarithms , an odds ratio of 36/1 maps to 3.584, and an odds ratio of 1/36 maps to −3.584.  Statistical inference [ edit ]     A graph showing the minimum value of the sample log odds ratio statistic that must be observed to be deemed significant at the 0.05 level, for a given sample size. The three lines correspond to different settings of the marginal probabilities in the 2×2 contingency table (the row and column marginal probabilities are equal in this graph).    Several approaches to statistical inference for odds ratios have been developed.  One approach to inference uses large sample approximations to the sampling distribution of the log odds ratio (the natural logarithm of the odds ratio). If we use the joint probability notation defined above, the population log odds ratio is        log  ⁡   (      p   11     p   00       p   01     p   10       )   =  log  ⁡  (   p   11    )  +  log  ⁡  (   p   00      )    −  log  ⁡  (   p   10    )  −  log  ⁡  (   p   01    )   .     {\displaystyle {\log \left({\frac {p_{11}p_{00}}{p_{01}p_{10}}}\right)=\log(p_{11})+\log(p_{00}{\big )}-\log(p_{10})-\log(p_{01})}.\,}     If we observe data in the form of a contingency table            Y  =  1    Y  =  0      X  =  1     n   11       n   10        X  =  0     n   01       n   00          {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{c|cc}&Y=1&Y=0\\\hline X=1&n_{11}&n_{10}\\X=0&n_{01}&n_{00}\end{array}}}     then the probabilities in the joint distribution can be estimated as            Y  =  1    Y  =  0      X  =  1        p  ^      11          p  ^      10        X  =  0        p  ^      01          p  ^      00          {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{c|cc}&Y=1&Y=0\\\hline X=1&{\hat {p}}_{11}&{\hat {p}}_{10}\\X=0&{\hat {p}}_{01}&{\hat {p}}_{00}\end{array}}}     where ︿ p ij = n ij / n , with n = n 11 + n 10 + n 01 + n 00 being the sum of all four cell counts. The sample log odds ratio is        L  =  log  ⁡   (          p  ^      11        p  ^      00          p  ^      10        p  ^      01        )   =  log  ⁡   (       n   11     n   00       n   10     n   01        )      {\displaystyle {L=\log \left({\dfrac {{\hat {p}}_{11}{\hat {p}}_{00}}{{\hat {p}}_{10}{\hat {p}}_{01}}}\right)=\log \left({\dfrac {n_{11}n_{00}}{n_{10}n_{01}}}\right)}}   .   The distribution of the log odds ratio is approximately normal with:       X    ∼      N    (  log  ⁡  (  O  R  )  ,    σ   2    )  .     {\displaystyle X\ \sim \ {\mathcal {N}}(\log(OR),\,\sigma ^{2}).\,}     The standard error for the log odds ratio is approximately          S  E    =       1   n   11       +     1   n   10       +     1   n   01       +     1   n   00            {\displaystyle {{\rm {SE}}={\sqrt {{\dfrac {1}{n_{11}}}+{\dfrac {1}{n_{10}}}+{\dfrac {1}{n_{01}}}+{\dfrac {1}{n_{00}}}}}}}   .   This is an asymptotic approximation, and will not give a meaningful result if any of the cell counts are very small. If L is the sample log odds ratio, an approximate 95% confidence interval for the population log odds ratio is L ± 1.96SE . [5] This can be mapped to exp( L − 1.96SE), exp( L + 1.96SE) to obtain a 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio. If we wish to test the hypothesis that the population odds ratio equals one, the two-sided p-value is 2 P ( Z < −| L |/SE) , where P denotes a probability, and Z denotes a standard normal random variable .  An alternative approach to inference for odds ratios looks at the distribution of the data conditionally on the marginal frequencies of X and Y . An advantage of this approach is that the sampling distribution of the odds ratio can be expressed exactly.  Role in logistic regression [ edit ]  Logistic regression is one way to generalize the odds ratio beyond two binary variables. Suppose we have a binary response variable Y and a binary predictor variable X , and in addition we have other predictor variables Z 1 , ..., Z p that may or may not be binary. If we use multiple logistic regression to regress Y on X , Z 1 , ..., Z p , then the estimated coefficient         β  ^      x      {\displaystyle {\hat {\beta }}_{x}}   for X is related to a conditional odds ratio. Specifically, at the population level       exp  ⁡  (   β   x    )  =     P  (  Y  =  1  ∣  X  =  1  ,   Z   1    ,  …  ,   Z   p    )   /   P  (  Y  =  0  ∣  X  =  1  ,   Z   1    ,  …  ,   Z   p    )    P  (  Y  =  1  ∣  X  =  0  ,   Z   1    ,  …  ,   Z   p    )   /   P  (  Y  =  0  ∣  X  =  0  ,   Z   1    ,  …  ,   Z   p    )     ,    {\displaystyle \exp(\beta _{x})={\frac {P(Y=1\mid X=1,Z_{1},\ldots ,Z_{p})/P(Y=0\mid X=1,Z_{1},\ldots ,Z_{p})}{P(Y=1\mid X=0,Z_{1},\ldots ,Z_{p})/P(Y=0\mid X=0,Z_{1},\ldots ,Z_{p})}},}     so     exp  ⁡  (      β  ^      x    )    {\displaystyle \exp({\hat {\beta }}_{x})}   is an estimate of this conditional odds ratio. The interpretation of     exp  ⁡  (      β  ^      x    )    {\displaystyle \exp({\hat {\beta }}_{x})}   is as an estimate of the odds ratio between Y and X when the values of Z 1 , ..., Z p are held fixed.  Insensitivity to the type of sampling [ edit ]  If the data form a "population sample", then the cell probabilities ∧ p ij are interpreted as the frequencies of each of the four groups in the population as defined by their X and Y values. In many settings it is impractical to obtain a population sample, so a selected sample is used. For example, we may choose to sample units with X = 1 with a given probability f , regardless of their frequency in the population (which would necessitate sampling units with X = 0 with probability 1 − f ). In this situation, our data would follow the following joint probabilities:            Y  =  1    Y  =  0      X  =  1       f   p   11       p   11    +   p   10            f   p   10       p   11    +   p   10           X  =  0       (  1  −  f  )   p   01       p   01    +   p   00            (  1  −  f  )   p   00       p   01    +   p   00             {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{c|cc}&Y=1&Y=0\\\hline X=1&{\frac {fp_{11}}{p_{11}+p_{10}}}&{\frac {fp_{10}}{p_{11}+p_{10}}}\\X=0&{\frac {(1-f)p_{01}}{p_{01}+p_{00}}}&{\frac {(1-f)p_{00}}{p_{01}+p_{00}}}\end{array}}}     The odds ratio  p 11 p 00 / p 01 p 10 for this distribution does not depend on the value of f . This shows that the odds ratio (and consequently the log odds ratio) is invariant to non-random sampling based on one of the variables being studied. Note however that the standard error of the log odds ratio does depend on the value of f . [ citation needed ]  This fact is exploited in two important situations:   Suppose it is inconvenient or impractical to obtain a population sample, but it is practical to obtain a convenience sample of units with different X values, such that within the X = 0 and X = 1 subsamples the Y values are representative of the population (i.e. they follow the correct conditional probabilities).  Suppose the marginal distribution of one variable, say X , is very skewed. For example, if we are studying the relationship between high alcohol consumption and pancreatic cancer in the general population, the incidence of pancreatic cancer would be very low, so it would require a very large population sample to get a modest number of pancreatic cancer cases. However we could use data from hospitals to contact most or all of their pancreatic cancer patients, and then randomly sample an equal number of subjects without pancreatic cancer (this is called a "case-control study").   In both these settings, the odds ratio can be calculated from the selected sample, without biasing the results relative to what would have been obtained for a population sample.  Use in quantitative research [ edit ]  Due to the widespread use of logistic regression , the odds ratio is widely used in many fields of medical and social science research. The odds ratio is commonly used in survey research , in epidemiology , and to express the results of some clinical trials , such as in case-control studies . It is often abbreviated "OR" in reports. When data from multiple surveys is combined, it will often be expressed as "pooled OR".  Relation to relative risk [ edit ]  In clinical studies, as well as in some other settings, the parameter of greatest interest is often the relative risk rather than the odds ratio. The relative risk is best estimated using a population sample, but if the rare disease assumption holds, the odds ratio is a good approximation to the relative risk — the odds is p / (1 − p ), so when p moves towards zero, 1 − p moves towards 1, meaning that the odds approaches the risk, and the odds ratio approaches the relative risk. [6] When the rare disease assumption does not hold, the odds ratio can overestimate the relative risk. [7] [8] [9]  If the absolute risk in the control group is available, conversion between the two is calculated by: [7]       R  R  ≈     O  R    1  −   R   C    +  (   R   C    ×  O  R  )       {\displaystyle RR\approx {\frac {OR}{1-R_{C}+(R_{C}\times OR)}}}     where:   RR = relative risk  OR = odds ratio  R C = absolute risk in the unexposed group, given as a fraction (for example: fill in 10% risk as 0.1)   Confusion and exaggeration [ edit ]  Odds ratios have often been confused with relative risk in medical literature. For non-statisticians, the odds ratio is a difficult concept to comprehend, and it gives a more impressive figure for the effect. [10] However, most authors consider that the relative risk is readily understood. [11] In one study, members of a national disease foundation were actually 3.5 times more likely than nonmembers to have heard of a common treatment for that disease – but the odds ratio was 24 and the paper stated that members were ‘more than 20-fold more likely to have heard of’ the treatment. [12] A study of papers published in two journals reported that 26% of the articles that used an odds ratio interpreted it as a risk ratio. [13]  This may reflect the simple process of uncomprehending authors choosing the most impressive-looking and publishable figure. [11] But its use may in some cases be deliberately deceptive. [14] It has been suggested that the odds ratio should only be presented as a measure of effect size when the risk ratio cannot be estimated directly. [10]  Invertibility and invariance [ edit ]  The odds ratio has another unique property of being directly mathematically invertible whether analyzing the OR as either disease survival or disease onset incidence – where the OR for survival is direct reciprocal of 1/OR for risk. This is known as the 'invariance of the odds ratio'. In contrast, the relative risk does not possess this mathematical invertible property when studying disease survival vs. onset incidence. This phenomenon of OR invertibility vs. RR non-invertibility is best illustrated with an example:  Suppose in a clinical trial, one has an adverse event risk of 4/100 in drug group, and 2/100 in placebo... yielding a RR=2 and OR=2.04166 for drug-vs-placebo adverse risk. However, if analysis was inverted and adverse events were instead analyzed as event-free survival, then the drug group would have a rate of 96/100, and placebo group would have a rate of 98/100—yielding a drug-vs-placebo a RR=0.9796 for survival, but an OR=0.48979. As one can see, a RR of 0.9796 is clearly not the reciprocal of a RR of 2. In contrast, an OR of 0.48979 is indeed the direct reciprocal of an OR of 2.04166.  This is again what is called the 'invariance of the odds ratio', and why a RR for survival is not the same as a RR for risk, while the OR has this symmetrical property when analyzing either survival or adverse risk. The danger to clinical interpretation for the OR comes when the adverse event rate is not rare, thereby exaggerating differences when the OR rare-disease assumption is not met. On the other hand, when the disease is rare, using a RR for survival (e.g. the RR=0.9796 from above example) can clinically hide and conceal an important doubling of adverse risk associated with a drug or exposure. [ citation needed ]  Alternative estimators of the odds ratio [ edit ]  The sample odds ratio n 11 n 00 / n 10 n 01 is easy to calculate, and for moderate and large samples performs well as an estimator of the population odds ratio. When one or more of the cells in the contingency table can have a small value, the sample odds ratio can be biased and exhibit high variance . A number of alternative estimators of the odds ratio have been proposed to address this issue. One alternative estimator is the conditional maximum likelihood estimator, which conditions on the row and column margins when forming the likelihood to maximize (as in Fisher's exact test ). [15] Another alternative estimator is the Mantel-Haenszel estimator .  Numerical examples [ edit ]  The following four contingency tables contain observed cell counts, along with the corresponding sample odds ratio ( OR ) and sample log odds ratio ( LOR ):     OR = 1, LOR = 0  OR = 1, LOR = 0  OR = 4, LOR = 1.39  OR = 0.25, LOR = −1.39    Y = 1  Y = 0  Y = 1  Y = 0  Y = 1  Y = 0  Y = 1  Y = 0    X = 1  10  10  100  100  20  10  10  20    X = 0  5  5  50  50  10  20  20  10    The following joint probability distributions contain the population cell probabilities, along with the corresponding population odds ratio ( OR ) and population log odds ratio ( LOR ):     OR = 1, LOR = 0  OR = 1, LOR = 0  OR = 16, LOR = 2.77  OR = 0.67, LOR = −0.41    Y = 1  Y = 0  Y = 1  Y = 0  Y = 1  Y = 0  Y = 1  Y = 0    X = 1  0.2  0.2  0.4  0.4  0.4  0.1  0.1  0.3    X = 0  0.3  0.3  0.1  0.1  0.1  0.4  0.2  0.4    Worked example [ edit ]      Example 1: risk reduction  Example 2: risk increase    Experimental group (E)  Control group (C)  Total  (E)  (C)  Total    Events (E)  EE = 15  CE = 100  115  EE = 75  CE = 100  175    Non-events (N)  EN = 135  CN = 150  285  EN = 75  CN = 150  225    Total subjects (S)  ES = EE + EN = 150  CS = CE + CN = 250  400  ES = 150  CS = 250  400    Event rate (ER)  EER = EE / ES = 0.1, or 10%  CER = CE / CS = 0.4, or 40%   EER = 0.5 (50%)  CER = 0.4 (40%)       Equation  Variable  Abbr.

It is, in its own words, " God" , but Tanya in her first meeting with it labeled it as the devil. Being X is a mysterious being. It claims to be a God, the God of the Bible, the one that gave the 10 commandments to Moses. However, there are a number of Gods and Archangels overseeing the world(s), which goes against what is postulated in the First Commandment. Its goal appears to be the increase of the number of faithful people in the world.  Contents [ show ]  Plot Edit  Being X is the one that summons Tanya to the new world after her former Japanese body (an unknown salaryman) meets his afterlife and unfavorably reviews God’s system of building the human civilization while maintaining religious devotion. After hearing the review, Being X told him that the significant part of the human race being atheists like him is due to them having being living in a peaceful scientific world, without facing any major setback. By changing all those conditions (and his genre), Being X hypothesized that the Japanese atheist will become a faithful individual and thus, the Japanese Salaryman is reborn as the experimental subject Tanya Degurechaff.
At a conference between Gods, said Gods show preoccupation looking at the rampant decrease in faithful individuals throughout many worlds. They protected humanity in the past from various disasters, helped those who were reached out for them and never hindered civilization’s development. On the contrary, the Gods wanted humans to seek the mysteries behind their workings and reach a higher level of philosophy and thus, welcomed scientific progress. However, they couldn’t foresee that the rapidly increase in living standards and scientific progress would lead to loss of faith (in them). 
The prevalent lack of faith appears to be a threat to their own existence. They use a system called the “Circle of Rebirth” to keep every soul alive and in theory, the number of faithful individuals stable and their power as well. However, with the increasing number of atheists in a faithless world, the system is reaching its limits as inevitably the reborn individuals end up becoming atheists again while the number of faithful individuals keeps decreasing. 
In order to increase the number of faithful individuals in the world without directly imposing their will, they decided to teach words of prayer and give new miracles to the humans so that they can regain their faith in the Gods by themselves. Their first action is to help Schugel with the Type 95 Operation Orb, a device that uses knowledge very close to the realm of the Gods. However, they opted to give him a miracle instead of finishing the Type 95 orb for him or showing him how to do it. Hence, the Type 95 operation orb was able to function in its last field test- despite not being upgraded- just by the power of words of prayer, making Schugel a believer.  Abilities Edit  God's Domain Edit  This ability gives the authorized person to stop time accordingly. It can use it anytime to interfere and to talk to Tanya.  God's Possession (Anime Only) Edit  It can possess anyone and any living things such as animals, insects and even humans whether dead or alive. However, it only took effect when someone believes and have faith on It.  God's Will (Deus lo vult) Edit  The ability to give its blessings to someone. Being X used this authority to let Tanya von Degurechaff and Mary Sue use it for spreading its word to its believers and convert all those who are non-believers.  Quotes Edit  (To Tanya) : " You are lacking in faith, is driven by your sexual lust, holds me in disregard, and completely ignores ethics. " (To Tanya) : " So the reason for the problem, according to you, is that living in a scientific world, is a man, not knowing what is war and having never fallen into any dead ends right? If that’s the case, all I need to do is just throw you into that kind of environment and you will start to believe and have faith again? "  Differences between various Media Edit  The light novel Edit  Gods have name from Christian angelic hierarchy, like Cherub, Seraph, and Thrones. They are working for "the Lord", and whenever they wanna impact on a world, they always ask for the Lord's consent. From vol.1 to vol.3, They only impact on this alternate world for 3 times.  Send the Japanese salaryman's soul into an female embryo. [1]  Send the miracle to Tanya's Elinium type-95 so that none can use the type-95 except her. [2]  Send more miracles to the faithful people so that more apostles will appear. [3]   The anime Edit  The anime didn't reveal much info about how the system works. Hence, whether Being X is part of the group of Gods, a spokesperson for the group, a single entity comprising of all the divine beings, or even the Devil like Tanya claims, is still to be determined. It also doesn't have stable form, and uses its power to impact on this world more often. It attempts to send more miracles to this world, and then intensify the conflicts in this world, which might increase of the number of faithful people.  The manga Edit  Most of the settings get close to the light novel. There is some differences : Gods have various forms, like Jehovah, Shiva, seven-eyed fire titan, and the angel wearing knight armor. Aside of their forms, they also sent 3 miracles, which were all finally, accidentally given for Mary Sue , to the world.  Trivia Edit  Tanya blames Being X for cursing her with the Type 95 operation Orb when it was the God of Invention who instructed Schugel on how to make the orb work.  Another known member of the God’s Collective is the Angel of Wisdom. He’s the one who concludes that the Gods’ plan is not wrong and what’s needed is a way to increase the number of faithful people. Incidentally, his approach is the same one Being X uses when he reincarnates the unknown Japanese salaryman as Tanya Degurechaff.

If $A$ and $B$ are independent events, then the probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur is the product of the probabilities of $A$ and $B$.  Let $A$ be the event I am right on my first guess, and let $B$ be the event I am right on my second guess. Then the probability I am right on both guesses is $(1/2)(1/2)$, or equivalently $(1/2)^2$.  Let $A$ be the event I am right on the first two guesses, and let $B$ be the event I am right on the third guess. Then the probability that both $A$ and $B$ happen, i.e. that I am right on the first $3$ guesses, is $(1.2)^2(1.2)=(1/2)^3$.  Let $A$ be the event I am right on the first three guesses, and let $B$ be the event I am right on the fourth guess. Then the probability that both $A$ and $B$ happen, i.e. that I am right on the first $4$ guesses, is $(1.2)^3(1.2)=(1/2)^4$.  We can keep on using the same reasoning, and conclude that the probability of being right for $X$ guesses in a row is $(1/2)^X$.  More generally, if my probability of being right on any guess is $p$, and I make $X$ independent guesses in a row, my probability of being right all $X$ times is $p^X$.  Remark: Your question used the word odds and we used the term probability . These are different but closely related notions. Probability is mathematically more useful, but odds are more directly useful to gamblers.  Roughly speaking, the odds against an event is the ratio of the probability the event happens to the probability it doesn't happen.  Take for example your $X=7$. The probability we guess right $7$ times in a row is $(1/2)^7$, which is $\frac{1}{128}$.  The odds that this happens are $1$ to $127$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 30 '13 at 15:47             answered Jun 30 '13 at 15:34       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779                  Thank you, this answer was also very useful. – user84483  Jun 30 '13 at 16:16        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      This is a geometric random variable described by the geometric distribution , specifically the first one defined in the article.

It goes like this:  double your last...  1st time: 1 in 2   -  (win a single coin toss)
2nd time: 1 in 4   -  (win 2 consecutive coin tosses) . . .etc.
3rd time: 1 in 8
4th time: 1 in 16
5th time: 1 in 32
6th time: 1 in 64 . . . etc . . . 1 in 2 to the nth. If you wanna get complicated with it then if 2 events have the same odds, there's no such thing as "independence" it's all in your head. Just add number of attempts together (nth)<--(this is an exponent). If the odds aren't 50/50 or if there are multiple events multiply the odds together. 1 in 4 should be represented as the fraction 1/4, 2 in 17 as 2/17 and so on... An example would be: "What would the odds of winning both a 1 in 3 bet and a 1 in 6 bet?" 1/3 X 1/6 = 1/18 or just multiply the 3 and 6 to make it easy. If you wanna know the odds of winning one and losing another, you don't do anything different, just flip the losses upside-down (inverse fractions) Make sense? "What are the odds of winning a 1 in 4 bet and a 1 in 6 bet, then losing a 1 in 4 bet?" 1/4 X 1/6 X 4/1(or just 4)= 1/6. I'm not going to bother with probability vs odds syntax since both boil down to the same thing. Just make sure that a preposition is never the word that you end your sentence in.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Mar 9 at 13:57       NOC117   1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Odds ratio   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search   In statistics , the odds ratio ( OR ) [1] [2] [3] is one of three main ways to quantify how strongly the presence or absence of property A is associated with the presence or absence of property B in a given population . If each individual in a population either does or does not have a property "A" (e.g. "high blood pressure"), and also either does or does not have a property "B" (e.g. "moderate alcohol consumption") where both properties are appropriately defined, then a ratio can be formed which quantitatively describes the association between the presence/absence of "A" (high blood pressure) and the presence/absence of "B" (moderate alcohol consumption) for individuals in the population. This ratio is the odds ratio (OR) and can be computed following these steps:   For a given individual that has "B" compute the odds that the same individual has "A"  For a given individual that does not have "B" compute the odds that the same individual has "A"  Divide the odds from step 1 by the odds from step 2 to obtain the odds ratio (OR).   The term "individual" in this usage does not have to refer to a human being, as a statistical population can measure any set of entities, whether living or inanimate.  If the OR is greater than 1, then having "A" is considered to be " associated " with having "B" in the sense that the having of "B" raises (relative to not-having "B") the odds of having "A". Note that this does not establish that B is a contributing cause of "A": it could be that the association is due to a third property, "C", which is a contributing cause of both "A" and "B" ( confounding ). The odds ratio compares the occurrence of the outcome in the presence of a particular exposure, with the occurrence of the outcome in the absence of a particular exposure.  The two other major ways of quantifying association are the risk ratio ("RR") and the absolute risk reduction ("ARR"). In clinical studies and many other settings, the parameter of greatest interest is often actually the RR, which is determined in a way that is similar to the one just described for the OR, except using probabilities instead of odds. Frequently, however, the available data only allows the computation of the OR ; notably, this is so in the case of case-control studies , as explained below. On the other hand, if one of the properties (say, A) is sufficiently rare (the " rare disease assumption "), then the OR of having A given that the individual has B is a good approximation to the corresponding RR (the specification "A given B" is needed because, while the OR treats the two properties symmetrically, the RR and other measures do not).  In a more technical language, the OR is a measure of effect size , describing the strength of association or non- independence between two binary data values. It is used as a descriptive statistic , and plays an important role in logistic regression .

Imagine we suspect that being exposed to something (say, having had a particular sort of injury in childhood) makes one more likely to develop that disease in adulthood. The most informative thing to compute would be the risk ratio, RR. To do this in the ideal case, for all the adults in the population we would need to know whether they (a) had the exposure to the injury as children and (b) whether they developed the disease as adults. From this we would extract the following information: the total number of people exposed to the childhood injury,      N   E    ,    {\displaystyle N_{E},}   out of which      D   E      {\displaystyle D_{E}}   developed the disease and      H   E      {\displaystyle H_{E}}   stayed healthy; and the total number of people not exposed,      N   N    ,    {\displaystyle N_{N},}   out of which      D   N      {\displaystyle D_{N}}   developed the disease and      H   N      {\displaystyle H_{N}}   stayed healthy. Since      N   E    =   D   E    +   H   E      {\displaystyle N_{E}=D_{E}+H_{E}}   and similarly for the      N   N      {\displaystyle N_{N}}   numbers, we only have four independent numbers, which we can organize in a table :      Diseased  Healthy    Exposed       D   E      {\displaystyle D_{E}}         H   E      {\displaystyle H_{E}}      Not exposed       D   N      {\displaystyle D_{N}}         H   N      {\displaystyle H_{N}}       To avoid possible confusion, we emphasize that all these numbers refer to the entire population, and not to some sample of it.  Now the risk of developing the disease given exposure is      D   E     /    N   E      {\displaystyle D_{E}/N_{E}}   (where      N   E    =   D   E    +   H   E      {\displaystyle N_{E}=D_{E}+H_{E}}   ), and of developing the disease given non-exposure is      D   N     /    N   N    .    {\displaystyle D_{N}/N_{N}.}   The risk ratio , RR, is just the ratio of the two,       R  R  =      D   E     /    N   E       D   N     /    N   N        ,    {\displaystyle RR={\frac {D_{E}/N_{E}}{D_{N}/N_{N}}}\,,}     which can be rewritten as     R  R  =      D   E     N   N       D   N     N   E       =      D   E     /    D   N       N   E     /    N   N       .    {\displaystyle RR={\frac {D_{E}N_{N}}{D_{N}N_{E}}}={\frac {D_{E}/D_{N}}{N_{E}/N_{N}}}.}    In contrast, the odds of developing the disease given exposure is      D   E     /    H   E     ,    {\displaystyle D_{E}/H_{E}\,,}   and of developing the disease given non-exposure is      D   N     /    H   N     .    {\displaystyle D_{N}/H_{N}\,.}   The odds ratio , OR, is the ratio of the two,       O  R  =      D   E     /    H   E       D   N     /    H   N        ,    {\displaystyle OR={\frac {D_{E}/H_{E}}{D_{N}/H_{N}}}\,,}     which can be rewritten as     O  R  =      D   E     H   N       D   N     H   E       =      D   E     /    D   N       H   E     /    H   N       .    {\displaystyle OR={\frac {D_{E}H_{N}}{D_{N}H_{E}}}={\frac {D_{E}/D_{N}}{H_{E}/H_{N}}}.}    We may already note that if the disease is rare, then OR ≈ RR. Indeed, for a rare disease, we will have      D   E    ≪   H   E    ,    {\displaystyle D_{E}\ll H_{E},}   and so      D   E    +   H   E    ≈   H   E    ;    {\displaystyle D_{E}+H_{E}\approx H_{E};}   but then      D   E     /   (   D   E    +   H   E    )  ≈   D   E     /    H   E    ,    {\displaystyle D_{E}/(D_{E}+H_{E})\approx D_{E}/H_{E},}   in other words, for the exposed population, the risk of developing the disease is approximately equal to the odds. Analogous reasoning shows that the risk is approximately equal to the odds for the non-exposed population as well; but then the ratio of the risks, which is RR, is approximately equal to the ratio of the odds, which is OR. Or, we could just notice that the rare disease assumption says that      N   E    ≈   H   E      {\displaystyle N_{E}\approx H_{E}}   and      N   N    ≈   H   N    ,    {\displaystyle N_{N}\approx H_{N},}   from which it follows that      N   E     /    N   N    ≈   H   E     /    H   N    ,    {\displaystyle N_{E}/N_{N}\approx H_{E}/H_{N},}   in other words that the denominators in the final expressions for the RR and the OR are approximately the same. The numerators are exactly the same, and so, again, we conclude that OR ≈ RR. Returning to our hypothetical study, the problem we often face is that we may not have the data to estimate these four numbers. For example, we may not have the population-wide data on who did or did not have the childhood injury.  Often we may overcome this problem by employing random sampling of the population: namely, if neither the disease nor the exposure to the injury are too rare in our population, then we can pick (say) a hundred people at random, and find out these four numbers in that sample; assuming the sample is representative enough of the population, then the RR computed for this sample will be a good estimate for the RR for the whole population.  However, some diseases may be so rare that, in all likelihood, even a large random sample may not contain even a single diseased individual (or it may contain some, but too few to be statistically significant). This would make it impossible to compute the RR. But, we may nevertheless be able to estimate the OR, provided that , unlike the disease, the exposure to the childhood injury is not too rare. Of course, because the disease is rare, this is then also our estimate for the RR.  Looking at the final expression for the OR: the fraction in the numerator,      D   E     /    D   N    ,    {\displaystyle D_{E}/D_{N},}   we can estimate by collecting all the known cases of the disease (presumably there must be some, or else we likely wouldn't be doing the study in the first place), and seeing how many of the diseased people had the exposure, and how many did not. And the fraction in the denominator,      H   E     /    H   N    ,    {\displaystyle H_{E}/H_{N},}   is the odds that a healthy individual in the population was exposed to the childhood injury. Now note that this latter odds can indeed be estimated by random sampling of the population—provided, as we said, that the prevalence of the exposure to the childhood injury is not too small, so that a random sample of a manageable size would be likely to contain a fair number of individuals who have had the exposure. So here the disease is very rare, but the factor thought to contribute to it is not quite so rare; such situations are quite common in practice.  Thus we can estimate the OR, and then, invoking the rare disease assumption again, we say that this is also a good approximation of the RR. Incidentally, the scenario described above is a paradigmatic example of a case-control study . [4]  The same story could be told without ever mentioning the OR, like so: as soon as we have that      N   E    ≈   H   E      {\displaystyle N_{E}\approx H_{E}}   and      N   N    ≈   H   N    ,    {\displaystyle N_{N}\approx H_{N},}   then we have that      N   E     /    N   N    ≈   H   E     /    H   N    .    {\displaystyle N_{E}/N_{N}\approx H_{E}/H_{N}.}   Thus if, by random sampling, we manage to estimate      H   E     /    H   N    ,    {\displaystyle H_{E}/H_{N},}   then, by rare disease assumption, that will be a good estimate of      N   E     /    N   N    ,    {\displaystyle N_{E}/N_{N},}   which is all we need (besides      D   E     /    D   N    ,    {\displaystyle D_{E}/D_{N},}   which we presumably already know by studying the few cases of the disease) to compute the RR. However, it is standard in the literature to explicitly report the OR and then claim that the RR is approximately equal to it.  Definition in terms of group-wise odds [ edit ]  The odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of an event occurring in one group to the odds of it occurring in another group. The term is also used to refer to sample-based estimates of this ratio. These groups might be men and women, an experimental group and a control group , or any other dichotomous classification. If the probabilities of the event in each of the groups are p 1 (first group) and p 2 (second group), then the odds ratio is:           p   1     /   (  1  −   p   1    )     p   2     /   (  1  −   p   2    )     =      p   1     /    q   1       p   2     /    q   2       =       p   1     q   2         p   2     q   1        ,    {\displaystyle {p_{1}/(1-p_{1}) \over p_{2}/(1-p_{2})}={p_{1}/q_{1} \over p_{2}/q_{2}}={\frac {\;p_{1}q_{2}\;}{\;p_{2}q_{1}\;}},}     where q x = 1 − p x . An odds ratio of 1 indicates that the condition or event under study is equally likely to occur in both groups. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates that the condition or event is more likely to occur in the first group. And an odds ratio less than 1 indicates that the condition or event is less likely to occur in the first group. The odds ratio must be nonnegative if it is defined. It is undefined if p 2 q 1 equals zero, i.e., if p 2 equals zero or q 1 equals zero.  Definition in terms of joint and conditional probabilities [ edit ]  The odds ratio can also be defined in terms of the joint probability distribution of two binary random variables . The joint distribution of binary random variables X and Y can be written            Y  =  1    Y  =  0      X  =  1     p   11       p   10        X  =  0     p   01       p   00          {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{c|cc}&Y=1&Y=0\\\hline X=1&p_{11}&p_{10}\\X=0&p_{01}&p_{00}\end{array}}}     where p 11 , p 10 , p 01 and p 00 are non-negative "cell probabilities" that sum to one. The odds for Y within the two subpopulations defined by X = 1 and X = 0 are defined in terms of the conditional probabilities given X , i.e. , P ( Y | X ) :            Y  =  1    Y  =  0      X  =  1       p   11      p   11    +   p   10            p   10      p   11    +   p   10           X  =  0       p   01      p   01    +   p   00            p   00      p   01    +   p   00             {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{c|cc}&Y=1&Y=0\\\hline X=1&{\frac {p_{11}}{p_{11}+p_{10}}}&{\frac {p_{10}}{p_{11}+p_{10}}}\\X=0&{\frac {p_{01}}{p_{01}+p_{00}}}&{\frac {p_{00}}{p_{01}+p_{00}}}\end{array}}}     Thus the odds ratio is             p   11     /   (   p   11    +   p   10    )     p   10     /   (   p   11    +   p   10    )        /         p   01     /   (   p   01    +   p   00    )     p   00     /   (   p   01    +   p   00    )       =       p   11     p   00       p   10     p   01          {\displaystyle {{\dfrac {p_{11}/(p_{11}+p_{10})}{p_{10}/(p_{11}+p_{10})}}{\bigg /}{\dfrac {p_{01}/(p_{01}+p_{00})}{p_{00}/(p_{01}+p_{00})}}}={\dfrac {p_{11}p_{00}}{p_{10}p_{01}}}}     The simple expression on the right, above, is easy to remember as the product of the probabilities of the "concordant cells" ( X = Y ) divided by the product of the probabilities of the "discordant cells" ( X ≠ Y ) . However note that in some applications the labeling of categories as zero and one is arbitrary, so there is nothing special about concordant versus discordant values in these applications.  Symmetry [ edit ]  If we had calculated the odds ratio based on the conditional probabilities given Y ,            Y  =  1    Y  =  0      X  =  1       p   11      p   11    +   p   01            p   10      p   10    +   p   00           X  =  0       p   01      p   11    +   p   01            p   00      p   10    +   p   00             {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{c|cc}&Y=1&Y=0\\\hline X=1&{\frac {p_{11}}{p_{11}+p_{01}}}&{\frac {p_{10}}{p_{10}+p_{00}}}\\X=0&{\frac {p_{01}}{p_{11}+p_{01}}}&{\frac {p_{00}}{p_{10}+p_{00}}}\end{array}}}     we would have gotten the same result             p   11     /   (   p   11    +   p   01    )     p   01     /   (   p   11    +   p   01    )        /         p   10     /   (   p   10    +   p   00    )     p   00     /   (   p   10    +   p   00    )       =       p   11     p   00       p   10     p   01        .    {\displaystyle {{\dfrac {p_{11}/(p_{11}+p_{01})}{p_{01}/(p_{11}+p_{01})}}{\bigg /}{\dfrac {p_{10}/(p_{10}+p_{00})}{p_{00}/(p_{10}+p_{00})}}}={\dfrac {p_{11}p_{00}}{p_{10}p_{01}}}.}     Other measures of effect size for binary data such as the relative risk do not have this symmetry property.  Relation to statistical independence [ edit ]  If X and Y are independent, their joint probabilities can be expressed in terms of their marginal probabilities p x = P ( X = 1) and p y = P ( Y = 1) , as follows            Y  =  1    Y  =  0      X  =  1     p   x     p   y       p   x    (  1  −   p   y    )      X  =  0    (  1  −   p   x    )   p   y      (  1  −   p   x    )  (  1  −   p   y    )        {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{c|cc}&Y=1&Y=0\\\hline X=1&p_{x}p_{y}&p_{x}(1-p_{y})\\X=0&(1-p_{x})p_{y}&(1-p_{x})(1-p_{y})\end{array}}}     In this case, the odds ratio equals one, and conversely the odds ratio can only equal one if the joint probabilities can be factored in this way. Thus the odds ratio equals one if and only if X and Y are independent .  Recovering the cell probabilities from the odds ratio and marginal probabilities [ edit ]  The odds ratio is a function of the cell probabilities, and conversely, the cell probabilities can be recovered given knowledge of the odds ratio and the marginal probabilities P ( X = 1) = p 11 + p 10 and P ( Y = 1) = p 11 + p 01 . If the odds ratio R differs from 1, then        p   11    =     1  +  (   p   1  ⋅    +   p   ⋅  1    )  (  R  −  1  )  −  S    2  (  R  −  1  )       {\displaystyle p_{11}={\frac {1+(p_{1\cdot }+p_{\cdot 1})(R-1)-S}{2(R-1)}}}     where p 1• = p 11 + p 10 , p •1 = p 11 + p 01 , and       S  =    (  1  +  (   p   1  ⋅    +   p   ⋅  1    )  (  R  −  1  )   )   2    +  4  R  (  1  −  R  )   p   1  ⋅     p   ⋅  1      .    {\displaystyle S={\sqrt {(1+(p_{1\cdot }+p_{\cdot 1})(R-1))^{2}+4R(1-R)p_{1\cdot }p_{\cdot 1}}}.}     In the case where R = 1 , we have independence, so p 11 = p 1• p •1 .  Once we have p 11 , the other three cell probabilities can easily be recovered from the marginal probabilities.  Example [ edit ]     A graph showing how the log odds ratio relates to the underlying probabilities of the outcome X occurring in two groups, denoted A and B . The log odds ratio shown here is based on the odds for the event occurring in group B relative to the odds for the event occurring in group A . Thus, when the probability of X occurring in group B is greater than the probability of X occurring in group A , the odds ratio is greater than 1, and the log odds ratio is greater than 0.    Suppose that in a sample of 100 men, 90 drank wine in the previous week, while in a sample of 100 women only 20 drank wine in the same period. The odds of a man drinking wine are 90 to 10, or 9:1, while the odds of a woman drinking wine are only 20 to 80, or 1:4 = 0.25:1. The odds ratio is thus 9/0.25, or 36, showing that men are much more likely to drink wine than women. The detailed calculation is:          0.9   /   0.1    0.2   /   0.8     =      0.9  ×  0.8      0.1  ×  0.2      =    0.72  0.02    =  36    {\displaystyle {0.9/0.1 \over 0.2/0.8}={\frac {\;0.9\times 0.8\;}{\;0.1\times 0.2\;}}={0.72 \over 0.02}=36}     This example also shows how odds ratios are sometimes sensitive in stating relative positions: in this sample men are (90/100)/(20/100) = 4.5 times as likely to have drunk wine than women, but have 36 times the odds. The logarithm of the odds ratio, the difference of the logits of the probabilities , tempers this effect, and also makes the measure symmetric with respect to the ordering of groups. For example, using natural logarithms , an odds ratio of 36/1 maps to 3.584, and an odds ratio of 1/36 maps to −3.584.  Statistical inference [ edit ]     A graph showing the minimum value of the sample log odds ratio statistic that must be observed to be deemed significant at the 0.05 level, for a given sample size. The three lines correspond to different settings of the marginal probabilities in the 2×2 contingency table (the row and column marginal probabilities are equal in this graph).    Several approaches to statistical inference for odds ratios have been developed.  One approach to inference uses large sample approximations to the sampling distribution of the log odds ratio (the natural logarithm of the odds ratio). If we use the joint probability notation defined above, the population log odds ratio is        log  ⁡   (      p   11     p   00       p   01     p   10       )   =  log  ⁡  (   p   11    )  +  log  ⁡  (   p   00      )    −  log  ⁡  (   p   10    )  −  log  ⁡  (   p   01    )   .     {\displaystyle {\log \left({\frac {p_{11}p_{00}}{p_{01}p_{10}}}\right)=\log(p_{11})+\log(p_{00}{\big )}-\log(p_{10})-\log(p_{01})}.\,}     If we observe data in the form of a contingency table            Y  =  1    Y  =  0      X  =  1     n   11       n   10        X  =  0     n   01       n   00          {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{c|cc}&Y=1&Y=0\\\hline X=1&n_{11}&n_{10}\\X=0&n_{01}&n_{00}\end{array}}}     then the probabilities in the joint distribution can be estimated as            Y  =  1    Y  =  0      X  =  1        p  ^      11          p  ^      10        X  =  0        p  ^      01          p  ^      00          {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{c|cc}&Y=1&Y=0\\\hline X=1&{\hat {p}}_{11}&{\hat {p}}_{10}\\X=0&{\hat {p}}_{01}&{\hat {p}}_{00}\end{array}}}     where ︿ p ij = n ij / n , with n = n 11 + n 10 + n 01 + n 00 being the sum of all four cell counts. The sample log odds ratio is        L  =  log  ⁡   (          p  ^      11        p  ^      00          p  ^      10        p  ^      01        )   =  log  ⁡   (       n   11     n   00       n   10     n   01        )      {\displaystyle {L=\log \left({\dfrac {{\hat {p}}_{11}{\hat {p}}_{00}}{{\hat {p}}_{10}{\hat {p}}_{01}}}\right)=\log \left({\dfrac {n_{11}n_{00}}{n_{10}n_{01}}}\right)}}   .   The distribution of the log odds ratio is approximately normal with:       X    ∼      N    (  log  ⁡  (  O  R  )  ,    σ   2    )  .     {\displaystyle X\ \sim \ {\mathcal {N}}(\log(OR),\,\sigma ^{2}).\,}     The standard error for the log odds ratio is approximately          S  E    =       1   n   11       +     1   n   10       +     1   n   01       +     1   n   00            {\displaystyle {{\rm {SE}}={\sqrt {{\dfrac {1}{n_{11}}}+{\dfrac {1}{n_{10}}}+{\dfrac {1}{n_{01}}}+{\dfrac {1}{n_{00}}}}}}}   .   This is an asymptotic approximation, and will not give a meaningful result if any of the cell counts are very small. If L is the sample log odds ratio, an approximate 95% confidence interval for the population log odds ratio is L ± 1.96SE . [5] This can be mapped to exp( L − 1.96SE), exp( L + 1.96SE) to obtain a 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio. If we wish to test the hypothesis that the population odds ratio equals one, the two-sided p-value is 2 P ( Z < −| L |/SE) , where P denotes a probability, and Z denotes a standard normal random variable .  An alternative approach to inference for odds ratios looks at the distribution of the data conditionally on the marginal frequencies of X and Y . An advantage of this approach is that the sampling distribution of the odds ratio can be expressed exactly.  Role in logistic regression [ edit ]  Logistic regression is one way to generalize the odds ratio beyond two binary variables. Suppose we have a binary response variable Y and a binary predictor variable X , and in addition we have other predictor variables Z 1 , ..., Z p that may or may not be binary. If we use multiple logistic regression to regress Y on X , Z 1 , ..., Z p , then the estimated coefficient         β  ^      x      {\displaystyle {\hat {\beta }}_{x}}   for X is related to a conditional odds ratio. Specifically, at the population level       exp  ⁡  (   β   x    )  =     P  (  Y  =  1  ∣  X  =  1  ,   Z   1    ,  …  ,   Z   p    )   /   P  (  Y  =  0  ∣  X  =  1  ,   Z   1    ,  …  ,   Z   p    )    P  (  Y  =  1  ∣  X  =  0  ,   Z   1    ,  …  ,   Z   p    )   /   P  (  Y  =  0  ∣  X  =  0  ,   Z   1    ,  …  ,   Z   p    )     ,    {\displaystyle \exp(\beta _{x})={\frac {P(Y=1\mid X=1,Z_{1},\ldots ,Z_{p})/P(Y=0\mid X=1,Z_{1},\ldots ,Z_{p})}{P(Y=1\mid X=0,Z_{1},\ldots ,Z_{p})/P(Y=0\mid X=0,Z_{1},\ldots ,Z_{p})}},}     so     exp  ⁡  (      β  ^      x    )    {\displaystyle \exp({\hat {\beta }}_{x})}   is an estimate of this conditional odds ratio. The interpretation of     exp  ⁡  (      β  ^      x    )    {\displaystyle \exp({\hat {\beta }}_{x})}   is as an estimate of the odds ratio between Y and X when the values of Z 1 , ..., Z p are held fixed.  Insensitivity to the type of sampling [ edit ]  If the data form a "population sample", then the cell probabilities ∧ p ij are interpreted as the frequencies of each of the four groups in the population as defined by their X and Y values. In many settings it is impractical to obtain a population sample, so a selected sample is used. For example, we may choose to sample units with X = 1 with a given probability f , regardless of their frequency in the population (which would necessitate sampling units with X = 0 with probability 1 − f ). In this situation, our data would follow the following joint probabilities:            Y  =  1    Y  =  0      X  =  1       f   p   11       p   11    +   p   10            f   p   10       p   11    +   p   10           X  =  0       (  1  −  f  )   p   01       p   01    +   p   00            (  1  −  f  )   p   00       p   01    +   p   00             {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{c|cc}&Y=1&Y=0\\\hline X=1&{\frac {fp_{11}}{p_{11}+p_{10}}}&{\frac {fp_{10}}{p_{11}+p_{10}}}\\X=0&{\frac {(1-f)p_{01}}{p_{01}+p_{00}}}&{\frac {(1-f)p_{00}}{p_{01}+p_{00}}}\end{array}}}     The odds ratio  p 11 p 00 / p 01 p 10 for this distribution does not depend on the value of f . This shows that the odds ratio (and consequently the log odds ratio) is invariant to non-random sampling based on one of the variables being studied. Note however that the standard error of the log odds ratio does depend on the value of f . [ citation needed ]  This fact is exploited in two important situations:   Suppose it is inconvenient or impractical to obtain a population sample, but it is practical to obtain a convenience sample of units with different X values, such that within the X = 0 and X = 1 subsamples the Y values are representative of the population (i.e. they follow the correct conditional probabilities).  Suppose the marginal distribution of one variable, say X , is very skewed. For example, if we are studying the relationship between high alcohol consumption and pancreatic cancer in the general population, the incidence of pancreatic cancer would be very low, so it would require a very large population sample to get a modest number of pancreatic cancer cases. However we could use data from hospitals to contact most or all of their pancreatic cancer patients, and then randomly sample an equal number of subjects without pancreatic cancer (this is called a "case-control study").   In both these settings, the odds ratio can be calculated from the selected sample, without biasing the results relative to what would have been obtained for a population sample.  Use in quantitative research [ edit ]  Due to the widespread use of logistic regression , the odds ratio is widely used in many fields of medical and social science research. The odds ratio is commonly used in survey research , in epidemiology , and to express the results of some clinical trials , such as in case-control studies . It is often abbreviated "OR" in reports. When data from multiple surveys is combined, it will often be expressed as "pooled OR".  Relation to relative risk [ edit ]  In clinical studies, as well as in some other settings, the parameter of greatest interest is often the relative risk rather than the odds ratio. The relative risk is best estimated using a population sample, but if the rare disease assumption holds, the odds ratio is a good approximation to the relative risk — the odds is p / (1 − p ), so when p moves towards zero, 1 − p moves towards 1, meaning that the odds approaches the risk, and the odds ratio approaches the relative risk. [6] When the rare disease assumption does not hold, the odds ratio can overestimate the relative risk. [7] [8] [9]  If the absolute risk in the control group is available, conversion between the two is calculated by: [7]       R  R  ≈     O  R    1  −   R   C    +  (   R   C    ×  O  R  )       {\displaystyle RR\approx {\frac {OR}{1-R_{C}+(R_{C}\times OR)}}}     where:   RR = relative risk  OR = odds ratio  R C = absolute risk in the unexposed group, given as a fraction (for example: fill in 10% risk as 0.1)   Confusion and exaggeration [ edit ]  Odds ratios have often been confused with relative risk in medical literature. For non-statisticians, the odds ratio is a difficult concept to comprehend, and it gives a more impressive figure for the effect. [10] However, most authors consider that the relative risk is readily understood. [11] In one study, members of a national disease foundation were actually 3.5 times more likely than nonmembers to have heard of a common treatment for that disease – but the odds ratio was 24 and the paper stated that members were ‘more than 20-fold more likely to have heard of’ the treatment. [12] A study of papers published in two journals reported that 26% of the articles that used an odds ratio interpreted it as a risk ratio. [13]  This may reflect the simple process of uncomprehending authors choosing the most impressive-looking and publishable figure. [11] But its use may in some cases be deliberately deceptive. [14] It has been suggested that the odds ratio should only be presented as a measure of effect size when the risk ratio cannot be estimated directly. [10]  Invertibility and invariance [ edit ]  The odds ratio has another unique property of being directly mathematically invertible whether analyzing the OR as either disease survival or disease onset incidence – where the OR for survival is direct reciprocal of 1/OR for risk. This is known as the 'invariance of the odds ratio'. In contrast, the relative risk does not possess this mathematical invertible property when studying disease survival vs. onset incidence. This phenomenon of OR invertibility vs. RR non-invertibility is best illustrated with an example:  Suppose in a clinical trial, one has an adverse event risk of 4/100 in drug group, and 2/100 in placebo... yielding a RR=2 and OR=2.04166 for drug-vs-placebo adverse risk. However, if analysis was inverted and adverse events were instead analyzed as event-free survival, then the drug group would have a rate of 96/100, and placebo group would have a rate of 98/100—yielding a drug-vs-placebo a RR=0.9796 for survival, but an OR=0.48979. As one can see, a RR of 0.9796 is clearly not the reciprocal of a RR of 2. In contrast, an OR of 0.48979 is indeed the direct reciprocal of an OR of 2.04166.  This is again what is called the 'invariance of the odds ratio', and why a RR for survival is not the same as a RR for risk, while the OR has this symmetrical property when analyzing either survival or adverse risk. The danger to clinical interpretation for the OR comes when the adverse event rate is not rare, thereby exaggerating differences when the OR rare-disease assumption is not met. On the other hand, when the disease is rare, using a RR for survival (e.g. the RR=0.9796 from above example) can clinically hide and conceal an important doubling of adverse risk associated with a drug or exposure. [ citation needed ]  Alternative estimators of the odds ratio [ edit ]  The sample odds ratio n 11 n 00 / n 10 n 01 is easy to calculate, and for moderate and large samples performs well as an estimator of the population odds ratio. When one or more of the cells in the contingency table can have a small value, the sample odds ratio can be biased and exhibit high variance . A number of alternative estimators of the odds ratio have been proposed to address this issue. One alternative estimator is the conditional maximum likelihood estimator, which conditions on the row and column margins when forming the likelihood to maximize (as in Fisher's exact test ). [15] Another alternative estimator is the Mantel-Haenszel estimator .  Numerical examples [ edit ]  The following four contingency tables contain observed cell counts, along with the corresponding sample odds ratio ( OR ) and sample log odds ratio ( LOR ):     OR = 1, LOR = 0  OR = 1, LOR = 0  OR = 4, LOR = 1.39  OR = 0.25, LOR = −1.39    Y = 1  Y = 0  Y = 1  Y = 0  Y = 1  Y = 0  Y = 1  Y = 0    X = 1  10  10  100  100  20  10  10  20    X = 0  5  5  50  50  10  20  20  10    The following joint probability distributions contain the population cell probabilities, along with the corresponding population odds ratio ( OR ) and population log odds ratio ( LOR ):     OR = 1, LOR = 0  OR = 1, LOR = 0  OR = 16, LOR = 2.77  OR = 0.67, LOR = −0.41    Y = 1  Y = 0  Y = 1  Y = 0  Y = 1  Y = 0  Y = 1  Y = 0    X = 1  0.2  0.2  0.4  0.4  0.4  0.1  0.1  0.3    X = 0  0.3  0.3  0.1  0.1  0.1  0.4  0.2  0.4    Worked example [ edit ]      Example 1: risk reduction  Example 2: risk increase    Experimental group (E)  Control group (C)  Total  (E)  (C)  Total    Events (E)  EE = 15  CE = 100  115  EE = 75  CE = 100  175    Non-events (N)  EN = 135  CN = 150  285  EN = 75  CN = 150  225    Total subjects (S)  ES = EE + EN = 150  CS = CE + CN = 250  400  ES = 150  CS = 250  400    Event rate (ER)  EER = EE / ES = 0.1, or 10%  CER = CE / CS = 0.4, or 40%   EER = 0.5 (50%)  CER = 0.4 (40%)       Equation  Variable  Abbr.

It is, in its own words, " God" , but Tanya in her first meeting with it labeled it as the devil. Being X is a mysterious being. It claims to be a God, the God of the Bible, the one that gave the 10 commandments to Moses. However, there are a number of Gods and Archangels overseeing the world(s), which goes against what is postulated in the First Commandment. Its goal appears to be the increase of the number of faithful people in the world.  Contents [ show ]  Plot Edit  Being X is the one that summons Tanya to the new world after her former Japanese body (an unknown salaryman) meets his afterlife and unfavorably reviews God’s system of building the human civilization while maintaining religious devotion. After hearing the review, Being X told him that the significant part of the human race being atheists like him is due to them having being living in a peaceful scientific world, without facing any major setback. By changing all those conditions (and his genre), Being X hypothesized that the Japanese atheist will become a faithful individual and thus, the Japanese Salaryman is reborn as the experimental subject Tanya Degurechaff.
At a conference between Gods, said Gods show preoccupation looking at the rampant decrease in faithful individuals throughout many worlds. They protected humanity in the past from various disasters, helped those who were reached out for them and never hindered civilization’s development. On the contrary, the Gods wanted humans to seek the mysteries behind their workings and reach a higher level of philosophy and thus, welcomed scientific progress. However, they couldn’t foresee that the rapidly increase in living standards and scientific progress would lead to loss of faith (in them). 
The prevalent lack of faith appears to be a threat to their own existence. They use a system called the “Circle of Rebirth” to keep every soul alive and in theory, the number of faithful individuals stable and their power as well. However, with the increasing number of atheists in a faithless world, the system is reaching its limits as inevitably the reborn individuals end up becoming atheists again while the number of faithful individuals keeps decreasing. 
In order to increase the number of faithful individuals in the world without directly imposing their will, they decided to teach words of prayer and give new miracles to the humans so that they can regain their faith in the Gods by themselves. Their first action is to help Schugel with the Type 95 Operation Orb, a device that uses knowledge very close to the realm of the Gods. However, they opted to give him a miracle instead of finishing the Type 95 orb for him or showing him how to do it. Hence, the Type 95 operation orb was able to function in its last field test- despite not being upgraded- just by the power of words of prayer, making Schugel a believer.  Abilities Edit  God's Domain Edit  This ability gives the authorized person to stop time accordingly. It can use it anytime to interfere and to talk to Tanya.  God's Possession (Anime Only) Edit  It can possess anyone and any living things such as animals, insects and even humans whether dead or alive. However, it only took effect when someone believes and have faith on It.  God's Will (Deus lo vult) Edit  The ability to give its blessings to someone. Being X used this authority to let Tanya von Degurechaff and Mary Sue use it for spreading its word to its believers and convert all those who are non-believers.  Quotes Edit  (To Tanya) : " You are lacking in faith, is driven by your sexual lust, holds me in disregard, and completely ignores ethics. " (To Tanya) : " So the reason for the problem, according to you, is that living in a scientific world, is a man, not knowing what is war and having never fallen into any dead ends right? If that’s the case, all I need to do is just throw you into that kind of environment and you will start to believe and have faith again? "  Differences between various Media Edit  The light novel Edit  Gods have name from Christian angelic hierarchy, like Cherub, Seraph, and Thrones. They are working for "the Lord", and whenever they wanna impact on a world, they always ask for the Lord's consent. From vol.1 to vol.3, They only impact on this alternate world for 3 times.  Send the Japanese salaryman's soul into an female embryo. [1]  Send the miracle to Tanya's Elinium type-95 so that none can use the type-95 except her. [2]  Send more miracles to the faithful people so that more apostles will appear. [3]   The anime Edit  The anime didn't reveal much info about how the system works. Hence, whether Being X is part of the group of Gods, a spokesperson for the group, a single entity comprising of all the divine beings, or even the Devil like Tanya claims, is still to be determined. It also doesn't have stable form, and uses its power to impact on this world more often. It attempts to send more miracles to this world, and then intensify the conflicts in this world, which might increase of the number of faithful people.  The manga Edit  Most of the settings get close to the light novel. There is some differences : Gods have various forms, like Jehovah, Shiva, seven-eyed fire titan, and the angel wearing knight armor. Aside of their forms, they also sent 3 miracles, which were all finally, accidentally given for Mary Sue , to the world.  Trivia Edit  Tanya blames Being X for cursing her with the Type 95 operation Orb when it was the God of Invention who instructed Schugel on how to make the orb work.  Another known member of the God’s Collective is the Angel of Wisdom. He’s the one who concludes that the Gods’ plan is not wrong and what’s needed is a way to increase the number of faithful people. Incidentally, his approach is the same one Being X uses when he reincarnates the unknown Japanese salaryman as Tanya Degurechaff.
