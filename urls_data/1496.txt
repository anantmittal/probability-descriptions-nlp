Know Your Days.   There are only six days during any cycle when a woman can get pregnant - the five days leading up to ovulation and the 24 hours after ovulation. This is because sperm can live for up to 5 days in a woman's body, and the ovum lives for only 12-24 hours.   However, the key to knowing when to get pregnant is to know when you ovulate. Figuring out the exact timing of ovulation can be tricky, because it does not happen at exactly the same time each cycle.          How Can CycleBeads Help You Know When You Can Get Pregnant?   CycleBeads lets you know when you can get pregnant by identifying 12 potentially fertile days each cycle – Days 8 through 19, where Day 1 is the first day of your period. These 12 days take into account the 6 days when pregnancy is possible as well as the variability in the timing of ovulation from one cycle to the next. Surveys of women using CycleBeads to get pregnant show that they are highly successful, with more than 80% of women getting pregnant within 6 months and the vast majority achieving pregnancy within the first 3 months of trying to conceive.   How to Plan Pregnancy with CycleBeads?   To use CycleBeads to get pregnant, a couple should have intercourse as often as possible (preferably at least every other day) during the potentially fertile days of a woman’s cycle - days 8 through 19.  That’s it. It’s that simple to get pregnant using this method.  Using one of the CycleBeads tools can help a woman to track the days of cycle to get pregnant and ensure that her cycles are in range for using this family planning method most effectively.   If a woman is not pregnant within 6 cycles of using this method and has been actively trying, she should talk to her doctor to make sure that there are no health problems that are keeping her from achieving pregnancy.   Are There Ways I Can Determine "More Exactly" What Days I Can Get Get Pregnant?   While it is possible to estimate ovulation more exactly, it is a challenging process that requires time and training and the tracking of information such as cervical secretions, basal body temperature and charting throughout the cycle.  Some women may also choose to use ovulation prediction kits, but these can be expensive and only indicate a very narrow window of time during which a woman is fertile. Meaning that women using an ovulation prediction kit may miss a number of potentially fertile days.  For women with regular cycles between 26-32 days it is much easier to simply know that you can get pregnant as early as day 8 of your cycle and as late as day 19 of your cycle and on all the days in between. If you have intercourse often during this time, you have an extremely high probability of getting pregnant. Many women using this family planning method find that as they become more familiar with their cycles, they begin to notice fertility signs such as secretions or light cramping which may help them pinpoint ovulation.

Studies have shown that women who use CycleBeads to help them plan a pregnancy are able get pregnant quickly. 80% of women using CycleBeads achieve pregnancy within 6 months of trying and of those women who get pregnant, 40% of them are pregnant within the first month of use.

You may think that cutting down on sex to "save" your guy's sperm -- or only getting busy when you're ovulating -- will make getting pregnant easier. But many days of not having sex can throw off conception. "It's easy to miss the fertile period if sex is limited only to when you think you're ovulating because many women believe they're ovulating when they actually aren't," says Samuel Wood, M.D., medical director at The Reproductive Sciences Center in La Jolla, CA. So go ahead -- have sex as often as you like, paying special attention to the few days before ovulation. Find books on parenting now Are you pregnant?

But more isn't always better. Although having sex frequently won't decrease the potency of a man's sperm, as many believe, it too often can potentially cause problems, says Dr. Wood. "If it's for reproductive purposes alone, having sex multiple times a day or even every single day could cause 'burnout,' and the couple may begin to view sex as little more than a pre-ovulatory chore," he explains. Then, when that window of fertility is open, one or both of the partners may not be interested, resulting in a missed opportunity. Pregnant? Calculate your due date!

Wrong. Whether you're on top, your guy is on top, or you're doing a crazy new position you read about, the result is the same. "When a man ejaculates, sperm swims out, goes directly into the cervical mucus and into the fallopian tubes," says Serena Chen, M.D., director of the division of reproductive endocrine and infertility at the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Pennsylvania. "This happens in a matter of seconds, regardless of the position during intercourse," Dr. Chen says. So, instead of sticking with one particular thing, mix it up and have fun!  5  of 12 Mistake No. 4: Assuming the Woman is the Problem     5  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest Laura Doss Mistake No. 4: Assuming the Woman is the Problem When a couple has a difficult time getting pregnant, many people (couples included) automatically think it means something is physically wrong with the woman. "Men are less likely to believe or to want to believe something is wrong with them," says Machelle Seibel, M.D., professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. "Because fluids will come out, whether there's sperm there or not, they assume it means they're fertile ," he adds. But that's not necessarily the case. "From day one, couples need to think it could be the woman, the man, both, or simply unexplained infertility," says Dr. Chen. "About half of infertility issues have to do with the woman, 40 percent with the man, and the other 10 percent is both or neither." The best thing, she adds, is for both partners to be assessed from the beginning to know for sure.      6  of 12 6 Common Fertility Mistakes   6  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest  7  of 12 Mistake No. 5: Mistiming Ovulation     7  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest iStock Mistake No. 5: Mistiming Ovulation Knowing exactly when you ovulate can be tricky. Many women follow the textbook rule, believing they ovulate 14 days after the first day of their period, but cycle lengths vary, and ovulation doesn't always occur at the same time each month, Dr. Seibel says. Many women also think they can pinpoint ovulation because of symptoms. "If you're in tune with your body, you may notice that you have an increased clear egg-white-like vaginal discharge a few days before ovulation," says Yvonne Bohn, M.D., an ob-gyn and co-author of The Mommy Docs Ultimate Guide to Pregnancy and Birth . But many women miss this, and some mistakenly think their normal discharge is a sign of ovulation. Instead of guessing (possibly wrong), Dr. Seibel says that using an ovulation predictor kit can give a more accurate answer. 6 Signs You're Ovulating Your Ovulation Calendar: When Are You Most Likely to Get Pregnant?  8  of 12 Mistake No. 6: Having Sex the Day of Ovulation     8  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest Hamiza Bakirci/istock Mistake No. 6: Having Sex the Day of Ovulation If you have an ovulation predictor kit, or if you're charting your basal body temperature or using the calendar method to try to identify ovulation, you may think it makes sense to get physical the day of ovulation -- but that may be too late. After ovulation, the egg can be fertilized for only about 24 hours. If you're wrong about ovulation, you'll have to wait to try again the next month. Because sperm can live for three to five days, having sex in the few days leading up to ovulation will increase your chances of getting pregnant, experts say.

Commercial lubricants negatively affect sperm motility, making it harder for the sperm to reach the egg. If you must use a lube, try Pre-Seed, a sperm-friendly lubricant. Or if you prefer a more natural lube, olive oil, vegetable oil, baby oil, and even egg whites are safe and effective.  10  of 12 Mistake No. 8: Rushing to a Specialist     10  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest istock Mistake No. 8: Rushing to a Specialist After two or three months of trying, it's easy to get frustrated. That doesn't mean an immediate appointment with a fertility specialist is in order. "Even under ideal conditions, perfectly fertile couples can take several months to become pregnant," Dr. Wood assures. If you're under 35, with regular menstrual cycles and no underlying health issues that might affect fertility, Dr. Wood advises waiting it out for one year.  11  of 12 Mistake No. 9: Not Getting Help Soon Enough     11  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest iStockphoto Mistake No. 9: Not Getting Help Soon Enough In some instances, seeing a fertility doc sooner rather than later is the best move. "If you're 35 or older, you should see a fertility specialist after six months of trying without success," Dr. Chen says. And if you're younger and have irregular periods or a history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), or other health issues that may affect fertility or pregnancy, Dr. Chen says it's a good idea to seek out a specialist right away. When Should You See Your Doctor If You're Having Trouble Getting Pregnant?      12  of 12 Mistake No. 10: Neglecting Your General Health     12  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest iStockphoto Mistake No. 10: Neglecting Your General Health Often, when couples are trying to conceive, they focus so intensely on their reproductive health, they neglect their overall health. It becomes all about cervical mucus, sperm count, and doing the do. But it's important to pay attention to your health in general because issues like weight, smoking, stress, and medications can affect fertility too, Dr. Chen says. Before trying to conceive, it's a good idea for both you and your guy to have a medical checkup to discuss any issues that may affect fertility or pregnancy.

By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Your Odds of Conceiving at Every Point in Your Cycle To hit the baby-making bullseye, you've got to aim for certain sweet spots of fertility in your cycle. Here's how to maximize your odds of conceiving throughout the month. Phase 1: Your period In essence, menstruation is the monthly shedding of the endometrium, the inner membrane of the uterus. For most women, this lasts between three and seven days. By the third day, levels of progesterone and estrogen are on the rise and working on rebuilding your endometrium. Around day four, follicle ripening begins to go on the uptick. That means the ovaries are starting to prepare eggs for release. Unless you're a very early ovulator (the average timing for ovulation is 14 days before the start of your period—track yours by using a basal body temperature chart or an ovulation predictor kit ), there's little chance your man's sperm will actually have any eggs to work with during this phase of your cycle. So, can you get pregnant while on your period? Almost nil. It's not detrimental to have intercourse, and some women see it as a good time to take a breather from the rigors of frequent baby-making sex. Phase 2: Pre-ovulation "I recommend having sex frequently—two to three times a week, but every other day if you can—shortly after you stop menstruating to cover your window of pre-ovulation," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence. Here's why: Around day seven of your cycle, you'll notice a vaginal discharge that seems a little springy to the touch. Within a few days, it will turn white and creamy, a cue that your fertility is returning once again. It doesn't mean the egg is released yet, but it's a good indicator that ovulation is on the way and that your cervical mucus is a friendly environment for sperm. Remember, you can get pregnant right after your period, even if you're not yet ovulating. That's because sperm can live up to five days if it's trapped in fertile cervical mucus. So it behooves you to get a few of his swimmers in place. "One study showed that people who had sex only one time during this phase, even four to five days before ovulation, still got pregnant," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic in Boston. Your odds of conceiving: Good. An egg isn't technically released during this phase but you'll want to step up your sexual routine in the event that you ovulate earlier than planned. Phase 3: Ovulation Welcome to prime time for conception! No matter how long your periods are, ovulation generally starts about 14 days before your next scheduled period. When it happens, your body temperature rises about a half a degree. But bear in mind that this takes place after you're already ovulating, which could be too late. "That's where ovulation kits become so helpful," Dr. Bayer explains. "Once it turns positive, have sex in the next 24 to 36 hours." Another good indication of fertility is a change in the consistency your cervical mucus. "You'll see vaginal discharge that increases in amount and has the consistency of egg whites, signaling it's the perfect time to have intercourse," Dr. Bayer says. Test yours by sticking your index finger and thumb in your vagina to get a sample, then tapping your finger and thumb together. If the consistency is thin and spreads easily between two fingers, you're good to go. Your odds of conceiving: High, if you have sex within 36 hours. Any eggs that are released live no longer than 12 hours. In fact, it's best if his swimmers meet your egg within four to six hours of its release. Data show that having every-other-day sex is just as effective as doing it every day, so no need to go crazy getting busy every hour (unless you really want to!). Phase 4: Post-ovulation Also known as the luteal phase, this final portion of your cycle lasts a minimum of 12 days and as many as 16. Progesterone starts to rise, signaling that the ovaries don't need to release any more eggs this month. Your cervical mucus will dry up and create a plug to prevent any additional sperm from entering the uterus. It takes about six days for any fertilized eggs to travel to your uterus. If one implants in your endometrium, you'll start to see the rise in human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the hormone measured by home pregnancy tests , within a week. Your odds of conceiving: Low. Once the egg has been released, there's not much that can be done until next month. But there's certainly no harm in having sex if you're in the mood!

For most women, trying to conceive is a crash course in Reproduction 101. By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Pregnancy Sex Tips: Have Fun Sex and Get Pregnant         Jamie Grill/Tetra Images/Corbis  First, the basics. You're born with 1 to 2 million eggs at birth, and those are all eggs you're going to have in a lifetime. By the time of your first period, your supply dwindles to 300,000. "If a woman ovulates 500 times between the ages of 12 and 52, and if not all of those eggs are considered to be healthy, what you're left with is a select few eggs that are truly viable for pregnancy," says Alan Copperman, M.D., director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York and co-director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Adding insult to injury, human reproduction isn't all that efficient. There is only one week in your cycle during which your odds are really favorable -- and goodness knows that few of us can devote a whole week each month to nonstop boot-knocking in the name of baby making. It helps to know your odds of conception at every stage so you can make the most of them. Early 20s (20 to 24) Behold, the magic window for baby making! "[When a woman is] 21, 90 percent of [her] eggs are chromosomally normal, which helps your chances of conceiving a healthy baby," Dr. Copperman says. You also have age on your side -- the average woman's fertility peaks at the age of 24. Women under age 25 have a 96 percent chance of conceiving in a year if they're trying each month. If the guy is under 25, the odds drop to 92 percent. That's because many fertility issues among younger couples are on the man's side. Most are easily treatable and don't require help from a specialist unless conception is taking longer than one year. Mid-late 20s (25 to 29) From age 25 to 34, you have an 86 percent chance of conceiving after trying for a year. Your chances of miscarrying are 10 percent, only a little higher than they were in your early 20s. Keep doing what you've been doing and you'll be likely to have a baby within a year. There's no need to consult a specialist until you've been actively trying for more than 12 months without success. Early 30s (30 to 34) Your odds of conceiving are still high -- up to an 86 percent success rate for couples that try for a full year. The only major change is that your chances of miscarriage by age 30 have risen to 20 percent. Conventional wisdom says that you don't need to see fertility treatment in your early 30s until you've been trying for a year with no luck, but some doctors recommend consulting your ob-gyn or primary care physician if you're still having trouble after 9 months. "That way, they can pinpoint any problems and treat them before your fertility starts to decline more rapidly after 35," Dr. Copperman says. Mid to late 30s (35 to 39) "You still have a good outlook for getting pregnant in this window, particularly before age 37," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence and an associate professor at Brown University Medical School. At 35, most women have a 15 to 20 percent chance of getting pregnant in a given month. That could mean a 78 percent chance of conceiving within the year. But 35 seems to be the point where fertility does decline. "The most common reason is reduced egg quality," Dr. Pagidas explains. "You may have plenty of eggs to work with, but they're likely to have more chromosomal defects that affect their viability. You're also at a little greater risk of miscarriage, a Down syndrome pregnancy or an abnormal pregnancy." Roughly 30 percent of women age 35 may take a year or more to conceive. Doctors don't want you to wait that long to find out if you're one of them. Time is of the essence, and if you're having trouble conceiving after six months, see a specialist to undergo some testing. Intrauterine insemination is a less invasive assisted reproductive technology that may work but in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be an excellent treatment option as well. Finally, this is your last chance to freeze viable eggs for use at a later date, should you prefer not to get pregnant right now. "A woman can freeze her eggs up until age 40; then she can come back years later and have a good chance of pregnancy even into her mid-40s," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic. Early 40s (40 to 44) With advancing age, egg quality and quantity go down. At this stage, you're facing a few challenges that make it harder to conceive and to stay pregnant. "By the time she's in her 40s, 90 percent of a woman's eggs are chromosomally abnormal," Dr. Copperman says. Assistance from reproductive technologies becomes more common at this time, and not just because of the egg issue. There may be more issues with older male partners, and some women report an increase in uterine lining issues with age. The uterine lining thins and blood supply to it decreases with age, making it more difficult for the egg to implant. Women approaching menopause may also see their cycles shorten. (The onset of menopause is generally between ages 40 and 60.) "That means as the cycle shortens, ovulation occurs earlier in the cycle, as soon as day nine," Dr. Bayer explains. "You need to make sure you adjust the timing of intercourse around ovulation accordingly." The rule of thumb at this age for natural conception is to have sex every other day around the time of ovulation. A good sign that you are getting close to ovulation is an increased production of a clear cervical mucus. An ovulation predictor kit may also help with the timing of sex. If conception is taking more than three months, see your doctor right away. For women over the age of 40, conservative treatment with inseminations carries a low success rate. The best option is IVF. If a 42-year-old woman has five embryos placed, there is a 10 to 20 percent chance of pregnancy. (If pregnancy is achieved, there is a 20 percent chance of a multiple; this carries its own risks.) For women who have low ovarian reserve and produce only a few embryos, or for women over the age of 43, egg donation is the best choice. 45 and over At 45, a woman's likelihood of getting pregnant is no more than 3 or 4 percent. That's not to say it's impossible, but assisted reproductive technologies are almost always necessary, with IVF the most common. "The few eggs you have left may have chromosomal abnormalities, so screening before IVF is critical," says Dr. Copperman. Success rates are 0 to 1 percent, and most clinics recommend using eggs donated by a younger woman for those who want to conceive between ages 46 and 50. For a woman in her mid-40s who wants to have a biological pregnancy, using a donor egg is best bet. "It's fairly easy for a healthy woman to achieve and sustain a pregnancy if the egg is from a healthy 25- or 30-year old," Dr. Bayer says. "Even if she's in menopause, success rates are about 60 to 65 percent." All ages, listen up! Regardless of your age, you can maximize your chances of conceiving each month by figuring out exactly when you ovulate. "Ovulation generally occurs 14 days before your next period, no matter how long your cycle is," says Dr. Bayer. For instance, if you have a 34-day cycle, you ovulate around day 20; a woman with a 26-day cycle would ovulate on day 12. Whatever your date of ovulation, plan to have intercourse in the five days prior to that day and for two days after. "You'll know you're nearing ovulation when you start producing clear, slippery cervical mucus which starts one to four days before egg release," Dr. Bayer says. Another good predictor is ovulation kit. "When it shows you're getting ready to ovulate, have intercourse over the next two days to catch the fertile window. You have 24 to 36 hours to have sex to make it in the optimal window," Dr. Bayer explains. Copyright © 2013 Meredith Corporation.

Here, we answer some common conception questions to help increase your chances of getting pregnant. By K. Aleisha Fetters  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Phillip Graybill  Q: Will having an orgasm help me get pregnant? A: Yes! Yes! Yes! Some experts believe that uterine contractions during orgasm may help propel sperm into the cervix, but one thing is for sure -- the tingles (and flood of oxytocin) during orgasm definitely make you relaxed. And that means you've already cleared the biggest baby-making blocker: stress. "The better the sex, the better the chances of conception," says reproductive physiologist Joanna Ellington, Ph.D., in the British documentary The Great Sperm Race . Men who are fully stimulated will ejaculate up to 50 percent more, according to research revealed in the program. "So if you have what I call 'gourmet sex,' where you really spend time and you make it fun for both partners, that is going to make the man more stimulated and he is going to ejaculate more and healthier sperm," she says. Sure, plain old sex, with no female orgasm, can result in a baby, too, but why not go for the gold? Q: Can we determine the sex of our baby? A: Depends on whom you ask. Proponents of the Shettles Method, which was developed in the 1960s, claim a 75- to 90-percent success rate in determining their babies' gender. The Shettles Method is based on the belief that sperm with Y chromosomes (which produce boys) move faster than sperm with X chromosomes (which produce girls) and it is possible that alkaline secretions in the vaginal tract, caused by female orgasm, favor Y chromosomal sperm. Still, there's no "convincing evidence" that sexual techniques can determine gender, according to Optimizing natural fertility . So if your hubby really wants to get out the ol' toy trucks again, opting for in vitro is his best bet, says Melissa M. Goist, M.D., Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at The Ohio State University Medical Center. Do Sex Positions Matter? Q: Do certain sex positions help my chances of conceiving? A: Common sense says that deep penetration (through positions like rear-entry and missionary) will dispense sperm closer to the cervix, helping the little swimmers reach their goal, but there's no evidence to back up the theory. Regardless of how you get down to business, sperm are present in the cervical canal just seconds after ejaculation, according to Optimizing natural fertility , a committee opinion by the Practice Committee of American Society for Reproductive Medicine in collaboration with the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. That means your favorite position is the best one for conceiving, says Shari Brasner, M.D., ob-gyn at New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital. "There is no rationale for sex to be uncomfortable or awkward." Q: Can oral sex as foreplay hurt our chances of conceiving? A: Not to be a foreplay killer, but saliva can be a sperm killer. It can interfere with your cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract (making it inhospitable to sperm), and even take out stalwart swimmers, according to Optimizing natural fertility. If clitoral stimulation helps get you in the mood, ask your man to reach for fertility-safe lubricant and put his fingers to work instead. Being face-to-face--and mouth-to-mouth--during the act might even be more intimate. Q: Is hot tub sex a bad idea when trying to conceive? A: Yes. Hot tubs are typically factory programmed at 104?. At that temp (some like it hotter!) it takes only 10 to 20 minutes to raise the temperature of your body, his body, and his testicles to 102? or higher, according to the American Pregnancy Association. And his boys don't like getting any warmer than 96? if they can help it. Not only can sperm cells sizzle in the heat, the production of them can temporarily screech to a halt--decreasing his sperm count for days. Can You Give Sperm an Advantage? Q: Can gravity help sperm work their magic? A: Probably not. Some women think that lying on your back with your hips elevated for 20 minutes after sex will help ensure that every last sperm gets a fighting chance at the prize, but the belief has no scientific foundation, according to Optimizing natural fertility . It can't hurt, though, Dr. Goist says. So why not use the technique as an excuse to get your post-romp cuddle on? Q: Will lubricants help his sperm reach my egg? A: Nope. Your cervical mucus moves sperm along quite swimmingly all on its own. Plus, most lubricants can interfere with cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract, and kill off even the sturdiest of sperm. In fact, water-based lubricants (like Astroglide, K-Y Jelly, and Touch) inhibit sperm motility in vitro by 60 percent to 100 percent within 60 minutes of incubation, according to a study published in the International Journal of Fertility and Menopausal Studies . If you really need some extra lubrication during sex (a common issue when you're more focused on making babies than making love), sticking with mineral oil, canola oil, or a hydroxyethylcellulose-based lubricant such as Pre-Seed are your best bets, Dr. Brasner says. Timing it Right Q: Is there an ideal time of day to have sex to conceive? A: Sure is. It's in the morning. Or, specifically, after your man gets a good night's rest, says Dr. Goist. When he's sleeping, his body regenerates the sperm lost during the day. Although the average sperm cell has a pretty short shelf life--only seven days--even stalwart swimmers can hit their expiration date early if they get too warm from exercise like bike riding, Dr. Goist says. Q: Should we "save" his sperm for when I'm ovulating? A: No! If your man has been stepping up on cold showers to store his swimmers until your ovulation test turns positive, it's time to turn the heat back up. As long as your partner has a normal sperm count, you'll have the best shot of conceiving if you have sex once a day, according to Optimizing natural fertility . Abstaining can increase sperm count (a good thing in that more boys start the trip), but it can also decrease sperm motility (a bad thing if you don't want them to just chase their tails). Moreover, abstinence intervals greater than five days can diminish sperm counts. Don't forget: Most (but certainly not all!) pregnancies occur during the two days before ovulation, according to a study published in the journal Human Reproduction .

The BabyCenter Editorial Team          Mom Answers ( 84 )   Best answers   Most recent      BEST ANSWER   At least that&#39;s what the doctors say. In reality you can get pregnant any time of your menstrual cycle. And not nessesarily when you&#39;re ovulating. But I know a person who can tell you for shure will you get pregnant or not and when just by looking at your photo. It&#39;s very easy to find him. Just go on facebook and search for this group. The name of this group is Baby gender by parents photo                 elliejankins    Answered 10/11/16                202 found this helpful     The time when you are ovulating is the best possible change to conceive, but keep in mind that everything has to be just right in order to actually get pregnant. A lot of times the sperm and the egg meet and the beginnings of an embryo will start, but implantation never occurs and you would have a normal period and no pregnancy. And there are a significant number of &quot;pregnancies&quot; that implant and then spontaneously miscarry long before you would know you were pregnant and you'd have a normal period. The static is that if you and your are healthy and have intercourse on the exact day that you ovulate there is a 1 in 4 chance of getting pregnant (and detecting it). Also keep in mind that sperm can live in the vagina for approx 3-7 days, so it is possible to get pregnant from sex either a few days before or a few days after ovulation.                 LMGJackson    Answered 11/30/07               194 found this helpful     it isnt a sure thing but it is VERY possible. If a sperm fertilizes and egg but then doesnt attach to the uterine wall then you will not get pregnant. the egg will just pass out during your next period.              Anonymous   Answered 9/14/07               138 found this helpful     Like others have posted...that is the BEST time for getting pregnant, but I do know someone who did the ovulation kits, knew she was ovulating and still didn't get pregnant. I know she eventually did, but without being checked by a doctor you don't really know why you aren't getting pregnant. It could be lots of things including stress or a low sperm count.              Anonymous   Answered 11/8/07               87 found this helpful     It is the most likely time to get pregnant when you are ovulating. However sperm can live up to 7 days inside your vagina. If you are trying to get pregnant, just make an appointment with your Gynecologist for the best advice. If you are trying to NOT get pregnant use birth control and/or get yourself to planned parenthood.                 gratefulbeauty    Answered 11/26/07               60 found this helpful     the doctors say that the best and more effective way to concieve a baby but it happens when the time is right. for one whole year after i was married both me and my husband tried for a baby and i went by an ovulation calculator to have intercourse and nothing happend then march came and i lost track of the calculater and in may i found out i was 6 weeks preggers              Anonymous   Answered 11/6/07               57 found this helpful     it also depends on if your body is ready              Anonymous   Answered 9/27/07               55 found this helpful     No it is NOT a sure thing! my DH and I had sex one month every other day during ovulation and NOTHING so then we tried EVERYDAY during ovulation and NOTHING. the one time we only had sex ONCE is when we got pregnant.

What are the most common reasons for not getting pregnant? Medical causes for not getting pregnant Are there any unexplained and combination infertility factors? Are regular/heavy periods a sign of fertility? Can you get pregnant at any time of the month? Are you fertile if you have regular period? How can I get pregnant faster? Why am I not getting pregnant the second time? Have you been trying to conceive for a while now? Then, it is high time you knew the reasons for not getting pregnant and fixed the issue. Conceiving is not just about having sex. Several factors, single or a combination, contribute to your not getting pregnant. MomJunction helps you understand these problems and improve your conception rates, by offering solutions and treatment methods. But first, let’s take a look at this question!  How Long Does It Take For A Woman To Get Pregnant? If you are healthy and your reproductive parts are functioning at their best, you have a 25% probability of becoming pregnant during every menstrual cycle (1) . According to the statistics presented in Before Your Pregnancy by Amy Ogle and Lisa Mazullo. Sponsored Of all couples (women younger than 30 years) trying to conceive:- 30 percent will conceive within the initial month (first cycle) 75 percent will conceive after six months 85 percent will conceive within one year (12 cycles) 90 percent will conceive after one year 95 percent will conceive after two years 91 percent will conceive within three years (36 cycles) (about three years). 93 to 95 percent will conceive within four years (48 cycles) Several factors come into play and define when a couple may conceive. Back to top [Read: When Is The Best Time To Get Pregnant ] What Are The Most Common Reasons For Not Getting Pregnant? While your periods may be regular, a number of everyday activities can impact your chances of conception. Let us know about them: 1. Too much or too little sex: Sex is probably the most basic human need for pleasure and reproduction. And, people are always in the extremes (1) . Having too much sex: Some people believe that having more sex could lead to conception. But this may not always be true. Though frequent sex will not decrease the vigor of a man’s sperm, it can cause potential health problems such as fatigue, dizziness, weak knees, and frequent urination. If you indulge in a lot of sex only to have babies, it could lead to BURNOUT (a state of fatigue, depleting your energy for sex). In this case, when the actual fertile window is open, either partner may not be interested in sex. And, as a couple you lose an opportunity to conceive. Having too little sex: You may be cutting down on intercourse to save the sperm or you only have sex during ovulation. But staying without sex for many days may affect your conception. You could miss your fertile phase when sex is limited as you may not always be correct about your ovulation. What next? Try to have sex frequently and keep a close watch on your ovulation dates. If you have irregular periods or problems tracking your fertile window, use an ovulation kit. If the result shows that ovulation is due in one or two days, have sex during that time. Keep in mind not to have sex just for having a baby, because then you can’t enjoy the process. [ Read: Best Sex Positions To Get Pregnant  ] 2. Over-stress Stress will take a toll on your health both physically and mentally, and affect your ability to get pregnant. Other emotional disturbances such as depression and anxiety can lower your fertility levels. You should be calm and in a balanced state when trying to conceive. Stress hampers the hypothalamus functions, which control the pituitary gland. The gland regulates adrenal, thyroid, and ovaries, and affects the period cycle, even leading to irregular periods. What next? You should give yourself some time to come out of the stress phase to improve your chances of conceiving. To beat stress, you could join a support group, see a psychologist, join yoga for fertility, meditate and exercise (2) . 3. The man-problem: One of the primary and top causes of infertility is low sperm count and poor sperm motility (due to structural abnormalities). This factor accounts for 30 to 40% of infertility problems in couples (3) . [Read: Infertility In Men – Symptoms And Treatment ] What next? The foremost step is to see a doctor or a fertility specialist for immediate treatment. For low sperm count or motility, in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is the best solution. IVF involves mating the egg and sperms outside the human body, and transferring the fertilized egg to the vagina. In ICSI, a single sperm is picked and directly injected into the egg (4) . 4. Running to the bathroom after sex: Many women rush to the bathroom after sex to clean up, wash. It is essential to stay in bed for some time after sex to ensure that the sperm gets a chance to reach the egg and fertilize it. If you get up and rush, as soon as you are done with the act, you are letting gravity drag the sperm down and the rest of it is washed away when you clean up. And, this is one of the natural reasons for not getting pregnant. What next? Focus on relaxing and lying in bed for a while after sex so that you can improve your chances of conception and pregnancy (5) . 5. Undergarments too tight: Women wear tight undergarments for proper shape, and also to accentuate their body and figure. But, you may be hampering the functions of your reproductive organs. In men, the sperm production goes down, and in women, the air-circulation reduces and leads to discomfort. What next? Wear well-fitted, but cotton undergarments to avoid infections. This will reduce sweat and moisture-related problems, and allow your privates to breathe and relax (6) . 6. Sleeping less: Sleep deprivation can strain and exhaust the body and affect the functions of the immune system. This increases your chances of getting infections, and in turn, affects the reproductive cycle. The same applies to men. Infections could develop into fever, and excess body heat can damage the sperm. Women may feel anxious due to lack of sleep that could affect their menstrual cycle (7) . What next? Get enough sleep to stay healthy. In case you suffer from insomnia, then consult a doctor. 7. Under or overweight: Being too thin or too fat will also affect your chances of conceiving. If you are undernourished, you will not ovulate well. If you’re on the heavier side, then it will hamper your fertility. Therefore, an ideal body weight is what helps, and if you are over your ideal BMI, there are fewer chances of conception even if your ovulation is regular (8) . What next? Maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle. Indulge in moderate fitness routine. You may check with your healthcare provider for nutrition and supplementation. 8. Over-use of lubricants: Studies state that vaginal lubricants negatively affect the motility of the sperm and interfere with fertilization. This is true for both over-the-counter and homemade lubricants. The reason – the pH of cervical mucus produced before ovulation is ideal for the survival of sperm and its motility. But lubricants have an acidic pH, which is enough to kill sperms. Also, the sperm’s motility is affected by the thickness of the lubricants and their water content (9) . What next? Foreplay is the best lubricant for conception. Take your time to get into the mood. If that doesn’t work, use warm water for lubrication as it is non-toxic and will not interfere with the sperm’s motility. If you still require lubricant while trying to get pregnant, you can choose “fertility friendly” lubricants such as Conceive Plus and Pre-Seed (10) . 9. Poor lifestyle choices: Common lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking, drug abuse, and caffeine affect your fertility. In men, these factors decrease the sperm count and motility and in females, they cause irregular ovulation. What next? Quit these habits, especially a few months before you plan to conceive. Switch to healthier life choices. Also, avoid the use of artificial sweeteners and exposure to chemicals (11) . 10. Environmental pollution: Environmental toxins are known to harm both men and women. Exposure to pollutants such as chemicals, pesticides, cigarette smoke, polychlorinated biphenyls, plastics, food packaging, and personal care products (soaps, shampoos, and cosmetics), could affect your health, especially fertility. They lower the couples’ ability to conceive by 29% (12) . What next? Though it is inevitable to avoid exposure to environmental toxins and chemicals, you should avoid them as much as possible. Stop using pesticides for your plants and lawn. Choose organic foods. Use organic and natural personal care products. Wear protective gear when you are working in chemical-prone areas, and always remain in highly ventilated places. All of the above reasons are lifestyle choices or environmental factors that affect the ability to conceive. Now, let’s look at some medical causes of not getting pregnant. Back to top [Read: Tips To Increase Your Chances Of Getting Pregnant ] Medical Causes For Not Getting Pregnant: In some cases, the egg may get aborted naturally, while in others, the couple could suffer from impotency. You must, however, give yourself a year to conceive. If things don’t work out by then, then you may reach out to a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. The causes of infertility are different in men and women. The medical causes of infertility in women are: 11. Irregular periods: Women who do not menstruate regularly have more difficulty in getting pregnant. Irregular periods indicate inconsistent ovulation, and conceiving without an egg is impossible. Therefore, the less you ovulate, the less are your chances of getting pregnant (13) . [ Read: Reasons Of Irregular Periods ] How can I get pregnant with irregular periods? A doctor can help you find the underlying cause for irregular periods and offer the treatment accordingly. You should also focus on a healthy diet, attain ideal weight, perform moderate exercises, and take fertility enhancing supplements as suggested by the doctor. 12. Endometriosis: This is a chronic disorder of the reproductive system in which the endometrial cells grow outside the uterus. It will block the tubes preventing fertilization or the fertilized egg from traveling towards the fallopian tubes. This condition causes painful periods, severe pain while penetration during sex, painful bowel movements, and frequent urination along with a feeling of bladder being full during menstrual cycle, or chronic pelvic pain (14) . What could be the possible treatment? The best treatment is laparoscopy in which a light tube is used to check and remove abnormal cysts and blocked tubes. Post the surgery, you will conceive in six to eight months. If that does not happen, then fertility drugs with intrauterine insemination (IUI) are given, and in severe cases, in-vitro fertilization is used. [Read: What Is Endometriosis & How Does It Affect Pregnancy  ] 13. Ovulation problems: Almost 20 to 40% of infertility problems in women are caused due to irregular ovulation, which prevents the release of mature eggs from ovaries. Where some women can never ovulate, others ovulate once in a quarter. Hormonal fluctuations, excess weight gain or loss, excessive exercise, or severe stress could be the key reasons of ovulatory disorders (15) . What could be the possible treatment? Your doctor will prescribe ovulation stimulators such as gonadotrophins, clomifene, prolactin suppressants, often with IVF and fertility drugs. 14. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): It is a complex condition caused by hormonal imbalance, which interrupts ovulation. Small cysts are formed in the ovaries that disrupt ripening of ovarian follicle and maturation. The other possible symptoms include irregular menstruation, weight gain, excess hair growth, and acne. What could be the possible treatment? Changes in diet and lifestyle that help control weight, and medical treatments such as ovulation stimulatory drugs (gonadotrophins, clomifene) along with IVF, can treat PCOS ( 16) . [ Read: PCOS And Pregnancy ] 15. Tubal diseases: Damaged or blocked fallopian tubes prevent eggs from reaching the uterus and sperm from reaching the egg, thus preventing conception. These conditions could arise due to sexually transmitted diseases, pelvic inflammatory diseases, or sterilization surgeries, if any. What could be the possible treatment? Laparoscopic surgery helps open and repair the tubes, and is followed by IVF (13) . 16. Egg factor: The egg quality and quantity decline around late 30s and early 40s. Women are born with approximately one to two million eggs at birth and the eggs gradually lessen to 300, 000 by puberty. Then about 300 mature and release through ovulation. And, by menopause, you have no eggs left. What could be the possible treatment? As the loss of eggs is an irreversible process, you should try to plan pregnancy in your fertile age. Also, try losing weight if you are overweight, quit smoking, manage thyroid issues (if you have any), and take supplements including fish oils, prenatal vitamins, probiotics, vitamin D, and Coenzyme Q10. These improve egg quality. The possible solutions if the above do not work are egg or embryo donation, adoption, or surrogacy (17) . 17. Low progesterone levels: After ovulation, the corpus luteum (remnant egg follicle) produces progesterone to support embryo implantation during early pregnancy. The deficiency of progesterone in this phase is called Luteal Phase Defect (LPD), and may be one of the reasons for infertility. Even if you conceive, the placenta and fetus would not grow further, causing non-viable fetus or early fetal loss. Other medical conditions such as prolactin or thyroid abnormalities could lead to abnormal luteal functioning (18) . What could be the possible treatment? Your doctor may refer you to a reproductive endocrinologist. The treatments include progesterone supplements, vaginal injections, or suppositories to thicken the uterine lining for embryo attachment. 18. Cervical mucus problems: Cervical mucus usually changes its consistency to clear and elastic forms so that the sperms can easily move through the mucus into female reproductive organs. In a case of cervical mucus abnormalities, the mucus prevents the sperm from passing through. The mucus may contract an infection, or contain antibodies that kill sperms. These problems are encountered in women with chronic cervicitis or a narrowed cervix followed by any prior surgery (19) , and lead to pregnancy failure. What could be the possible treatment? Identifying and treating infections and using assisted reproductive methods such as IUI and in-vitro fertilization, help solve the problem. The medical causes of infertility in men are: [ Read: Cervical Mucus And Ovulation ] 19. Sperm problems: Poor sperm mobility, low or no sperm count, and abnormally shaped sperms can decrease a man’s fertility. What could be the possible treatment? Fertility drugs are the first line of treatment to boost sperm production. The next options are IUI and ICSI (20) . 20. Tube blockages: Blockages in the epididymis (a long coiled tube that lies behind testicles and stores mature sperms) and vas deferens (the muscular tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct) could adversely affect the transport of fertile sperms. The obstruction in the tubes could be due to infections including gonorrhea or chlamydia, birth defects, or injuries. Also, varicoceles (enlarged veins in the scrotum) will affect sperm mobility. What could be the possible treatment? Health practitioners usually prefer surgical correction of tube blockages, which corrects fertility (20) . Besides lifestyle choices and medical reasons, there are a few other factors that can affect fertility. Back to top Are There Any Other Factors That Affect Fertility? Yes! Unexplained and combination reasons account for almost 25% and 40% respectively of all infertility cases (21) . 21. Unexplained infertility: Of all the infertility cases, 25% are diagnosed as unexplained infertility, due to failure in finding the actual cause even after a range of tests and assessments. The partners undergo a variety of tests without any definitive results. Though you may not actually have any problem, it results in confusion (22) . What next? Doctors usually advise the next best step, which is to conceive by having regular intercourse (without focusing on having babies). If it doesn’t work even after a couple of years, you may be given an IVF treatment. 22. Combination infertility: Here, both the partners are diagnosed with fertility problems, or when one of them has a couple of fertility issues. What next? Appropriate treatments are offered according to the cause of infertility. In women, sometimes the menstrual cycle may change in intensity and duration. This could also directly affect fertility. Back to top [Read: Infertility In Women ] Are Heavy Periods A Sign Of Fertility? Heavy periods are not a sign of fertility, and sometimes could indicate a different problem. You may feel fatigued and worn out. In the process of losing more blood, you will lose the essential body resources built over time. If you get sudden, heavy periods, you should immediately discuss with your doctor (23) . Back to top Can You Get Pregnant At Any Time Of The Month? It is not possible to get pregnant at anytime of the month. You must be ovulating in order to conceive. This means that you should have sex in the days leading to and around ovulation. The two to three days before ovulation and the day you ovulate are most fertile days (26) . You must, however, understand that fertile days do not directly mean that everything is functioning well. Back to top [Read: Know Your Most Fertile Days To Get Pregnant ] Are You Fertile If You Have Regular Period? If you have regular periods, your chances of fertility are high. However, fertility is tricky as there may be reasons that could prevent conception in spite of having a good number of eggs. If you have been trying to conceive for months or years and failing, then you must see a fertility specialist or gynecologist to rule out the possible causes. Also, remember that you do not always need medical assistance for conception. Certain lifestyle changes could naturally help you conceive. If fertility is in place, then it shouldn’t be very difficult for a couple to conceive. However, you can increase your chances of conception by a mark. Back to top How Can I Get Pregnant Faster? Once you decide to have a baby, you may want to get pregnant faster. There are ways to boost your likeliness of conceiving quickly. Schedule a preconception check-up or counseling Stay away from birth control pills days or weeks before you try to conceive Figure out your ovulation time. You could use an ovulation predictor kit. Have sex at the right time Give sperms a boost by improving diet, exercising regularly, limiting chemical exposure, and consuming herbal supplements Eat a healthy and nutritious diet Relax and have fun while making love The sooner you implement these changes, the faster you can get pregnant (25) . While some couples have issues getting pregnant the first time, others have issues conceiving a second time. And we’ll tell you why. Back to top Why Am I Not Getting Pregnant The Second Time? Your fertility can reduce from your first pregnancy and women may find it difficult to become pregnant for the second time. This is known as secondary infertility. Here are some common reasons for not getting pregnant: If you are a woman over 35 years, then the egg count will fall, leading to no or lesser eggs Men over 50 have a decreased fertility and abnormal sperm Changes in ovulation and menstrual cycles due to hormonal dysfunction, weight issues, stress, medications (steroids, antibiotics, and antihistamines), and substance abuse (drugs, tobacco and alcohol) Complication in your first pregnancy or labor Damage to fallopian tubes due to abdominal surgery, endometriosis, sexually transmitted infections (24) Back to top There are certainly ways to fix infertility and conceive easily.

conceive isn't as easy as some people think. 7 surprising fertility facts 00:18:37 Fertility and trying to conceive isn?t as easy as some people think, here are some facts that might surprise you! 29 May 2017 11 months /video/video.kidspot.com.au/Birth/  Fertility and conception experts like Medica IVF's Dr David Knight say the human species is not as fertile as we like to think. "If you are between 18 and 34 and you and your partner are generally healthy, doctors say more often than not some simple problems - with easy fixes - may be standing in your way," he says. There are plenty of myths and old wives tales about fertility that Dr Knight says can get in the way of successfully falling pregnant. Fertility fact 1: How often to have sex Most women know they must ovulate in order to conceive, but having sex on the day of ovulation does not increase the chances of conception. It may in fact decrease a woman's chance as many wait for ovulation before having sex which may cause them to bypass their most fertile time. After ovulation, an egg is only viable for about 24 hours, so if you are waiting until you ovulate to have intercourse, chances are you are going to miss the opportunity to get pregnant that month. Since sperm can also live in your reproductive tract for 3-4 days, having sex two to three times a week, means that when an egg is released there will be sperm waiting! "I tell my patients to have regular intercourse, meaning 2-3 times a week generally starting after your period stops. Specifically I encourage couples NOT to monitor ovulation or use temperature graphs," Dr Knight says. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that having sex beginning six days prior to ovulation is the most conducive to achieving conception. The more times you have intercourse during your 'window of opportunity', the more likely you are to get pregnant.  Source: iStock  Fertility fact 2: Relax, have sex every day Don't worry about having too much sex when you are trying to conceive. The same NEJM study found that having sex every day is slightly more likely to result in pregnancy than intercourse every other day. Experts do caution couples not to put love making on a schedule. That, they say, just might decrease chances of conception. The scientific evidence is scarce, but if you are stressed and love making is on 'schedule',' there is some data to show that hormones may be affected and that in turn could influence conception. A Harvard Medical School study on women with fertility problems, that 55% of those who completed a 10-week course of relaxation training and stress reduction had a viable pregnancy within one year, compared with just 20% of the group who had no stress reduction training. Doctors have also found that women undergoing fertility treatments , who remained relaxed and optimistic, had better overall outcomes than women who were pessimistic about their ability to conceive. If you are worried all the time about getting pregnant, if you obsess over it and think about only that, you might influence your body chemistry in a way that does affect your fertility. The key is to "think about making love, not about making babies." Fertility fact 3: How position affects conception There are many myths surrounding sexual intercourse and the best time to conceive. Many couples widely believe that the position taken during sexual intercourse will affect their chances of getting pregnant. Furthermore, many believe their chances of conceiving are increased by lying on their backs for 20 minutes, ensuring the semen stays in the neck of the uterus for longer. Whilst semen does inevitably come out of the vagina following ejaculation, sufficient sperm are deposited in the neck of the womb and are able to begin their journey towards the egg, regardless of the position taken.  Source: iStock  Fertility fact 4: Don't think sperm potency improves by saving up Millions of sperm are produced every day in the testicles. The sperm are stored in a tiny sac, the epididymis, which lies at the top of each testicle. Abstaining from sex in order to accumulate sperm so that more are deposited during sex will not increase your chances of achieving conception. In fact the stored, older sperm may be of inferior quality and even hinder the newly produced, healthier sperm from reaching the egg. Fertility fact 5: Lubricant won't help sperm to slip, slide and get inside Not only is this not true, it could actually prevent you from getting pregnant, says Dr Knight.Most lubricants change the pH or acid balance inside the vagina, and that in turn may affect sperm motility and ultimately prevent, or at least reduce the chances of a pregnancy occurring. If you find you must use a lubricant avoid petroleum jelly. Instead try natural vegetable products, such as olive oil, which is less likely to cause sperm any serious problems.  11 Apr 2018  Fertility fact 6: Just because the female doesn't orgasm, doesn't matter There is no evidence to support that a woman with low libido or failure to orgasm cannot conceive - though some patients do think this. Furthermore, a woman does not need to achieve an orgasm in order to conceive. Continually trying to find the right time to have sexual intercourse may place a strain on a couple's lovemaking and this in turn may hinder their chances of getting pregnant. Couples should have sexual intercourse when they feel like it and not limit it to the period during the woman's cycle perceived to be the most fertile. Furthermore, women do not always ovulate on the fourteenth day of their cycle and it is easy to misjudge the fertile time. The chance of becoming pregnant in any one month for a fertile couple is at best 25 per cent and even in entirely healthy couples. Fertility fact 7: Failing to conceive doesn't mean you are a failure Infertility is a medical condition just like arthritis or asthma, which can require medical treatment. It is no reflection on how masculine or feminine a person is. Although there are no dietary or nutritional cures for infertility, a healthy lifestyle is important. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, not smoking and avoiding alcohol and caffeine are probably wise ideas.

Sex! (Or intercourse at the right time, to be technical about it.)  The 'fertile window' is when you should be having lots of sex if you want to conceive.  The fertile window  We’re talking about the days in a woman’s menstrual cycle when pregnancy is possible. The ‘fertile window’ depends on the length of a woman’s cycle, this varies between women.  Pregnancy is technically only possible during the five days before ovulation through to the day of ovulation. These six days are the ‘fertile window’ in a woman’s cycle, and reflect the lifespan of sperm (5 days) and the lifespan of the ovum (24 hours).  Ovulation is when a mature egg is released from the ovary, moves down the fallopian tube, and is available in the fallopian tube to be fertilised. If there is sperm waiting around at the time the egg is released, there is a higher chance that it will be fertilised. Ovulation happens about two weeks before the woman’s next expected period. So if her average menstrual cycle is 28 days, ovulation will happen around day 14.  If sex is timed five days before a woman’s ovulation, the probability of her getting pregnant is about 10%. The probability of pregnancy rises steadily until the two days before and including the day of ovulation. The likelihood of conceiving is dramatically increased if intercourse occurs in the three days leading up to and including ovulation.  At the end of a woman’s ‘fertile window’, the probability of pregnancy declines rapidly and by 12-24 hours after she ovulates, a woman is no longer able to get pregnant during that cycle.  Too complicated?  If your partner is not aware of her ‘fertile window’ or when she ovulates, she can find more information here . Otherwise, to cover all bases, sexual intercourse is recommended every 2 to 3 days to help optimise your chance of conceiving. But there’s no limit to how much sex you can have during that 6-day period.  The likelihood of actually becoming pregnant is dramatically increased if you have intercourse in the three days leading up to and including ovulation. If sex is timed well on any of these three days, she has a 27-33% chance of becoming pregnant. Adapted from data by Wilcox, A.J. et al. NEJM (1995) 333:1517 Myth conception The myth: "A woman can get pregnant any time of the month." The truth: The only time a woman can conceive is during the ‘fertile window’ of the menstrual cycle.  The ’fertile window’ in the menstrual cycle is the six days leading up to ovulation, when the egg is released from the ovary. This depends on how long the woman’s menstrual cycles are.  Not all women have the same length of cycle. If, on average, your partner has a period every 28 days the best chance of conceiving is between days 12 and 14 (with ovulation day on day 14). If she has a 24 -day cycle, then focus your efforts between days 7 and 10.

Know Your Days.   There are only six days during any cycle when a woman can get pregnant - the five days leading up to ovulation and the 24 hours after ovulation. This is because sperm can live for up to 5 days in a woman's body, and the ovum lives for only 12-24 hours.   However, the key to knowing when to get pregnant is to know when you ovulate. Figuring out the exact timing of ovulation can be tricky, because it does not happen at exactly the same time each cycle.          How Can CycleBeads Help You Know When You Can Get Pregnant?   CycleBeads lets you know when you can get pregnant by identifying 12 potentially fertile days each cycle – Days 8 through 19, where Day 1 is the first day of your period. These 12 days take into account the 6 days when pregnancy is possible as well as the variability in the timing of ovulation from one cycle to the next. Surveys of women using CycleBeads to get pregnant show that they are highly successful, with more than 80% of women getting pregnant within 6 months and the vast majority achieving pregnancy within the first 3 months of trying to conceive.   How to Plan Pregnancy with CycleBeads?   To use CycleBeads to get pregnant, a couple should have intercourse as often as possible (preferably at least every other day) during the potentially fertile days of a woman’s cycle - days 8 through 19.  That’s it. It’s that simple to get pregnant using this method.  Using one of the CycleBeads tools can help a woman to track the days of cycle to get pregnant and ensure that her cycles are in range for using this family planning method most effectively.   If a woman is not pregnant within 6 cycles of using this method and has been actively trying, she should talk to her doctor to make sure that there are no health problems that are keeping her from achieving pregnancy.   Are There Ways I Can Determine "More Exactly" What Days I Can Get Get Pregnant?   While it is possible to estimate ovulation more exactly, it is a challenging process that requires time and training and the tracking of information such as cervical secretions, basal body temperature and charting throughout the cycle.  Some women may also choose to use ovulation prediction kits, but these can be expensive and only indicate a very narrow window of time during which a woman is fertile. Meaning that women using an ovulation prediction kit may miss a number of potentially fertile days.  For women with regular cycles between 26-32 days it is much easier to simply know that you can get pregnant as early as day 8 of your cycle and as late as day 19 of your cycle and on all the days in between. If you have intercourse often during this time, you have an extremely high probability of getting pregnant. Many women using this family planning method find that as they become more familiar with their cycles, they begin to notice fertility signs such as secretions or light cramping which may help them pinpoint ovulation.

Studies have shown that women who use CycleBeads to help them plan a pregnancy are able get pregnant quickly. 80% of women using CycleBeads achieve pregnancy within 6 months of trying and of those women who get pregnant, 40% of them are pregnant within the first month of use.

You may think that cutting down on sex to "save" your guy's sperm -- or only getting busy when you're ovulating -- will make getting pregnant easier. But many days of not having sex can throw off conception. "It's easy to miss the fertile period if sex is limited only to when you think you're ovulating because many women believe they're ovulating when they actually aren't," says Samuel Wood, M.D., medical director at The Reproductive Sciences Center in La Jolla, CA. So go ahead -- have sex as often as you like, paying special attention to the few days before ovulation. Find books on parenting now Are you pregnant? Take our quiz!  2  of 12 Mistake No. 2: Having Too Much Sex     2  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest Sarah Kehoe Mistake No. 2: Having Too Much Sex Some couples think they have conception all figured out: The more sex you have, the easier and sooner you'll conceive. But more isn't always better. Although having sex frequently won't decrease the potency of a man's sperm, as many believe, it too often can potentially cause problems, says Dr. Wood. "If it's for reproductive purposes alone, having sex multiple times a day or even every single day could cause 'burnout,' and the couple may begin to view sex as little more than a pre-ovulatory chore," he explains. Then, when that window of fertility is open, one or both of the partners may not be interested, resulting in a missed opportunity. Pregnant? Calculate your due date!

Wrong. Whether you're on top, your guy is on top, or you're doing a crazy new position you read about, the result is the same. "When a man ejaculates, sperm swims out, goes directly into the cervical mucus and into the fallopian tubes," says Serena Chen, M.D., director of the division of reproductive endocrine and infertility at the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Pennsylvania. "This happens in a matter of seconds, regardless of the position during intercourse," Dr. Chen says. So, instead of sticking with one particular thing, mix it up and have fun!  5  of 12 Mistake No. 4: Assuming the Woman is the Problem     5  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest Laura Doss Mistake No. 4: Assuming the Woman is the Problem When a couple has a difficult time getting pregnant, many people (couples included) automatically think it means something is physically wrong with the woman. "Men are less likely to believe or to want to believe something is wrong with them," says Machelle Seibel, M.D., professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. "Because fluids will come out, whether there's sperm there or not, they assume it means they're fertile ," he adds. But that's not necessarily the case. "From day one, couples need to think it could be the woman, the man, both, or simply unexplained infertility," says Dr. Chen. "About half of infertility issues have to do with the woman, 40 percent with the man, and the other 10 percent is both or neither." The best thing, she adds, is for both partners to be assessed from the beginning to know for sure.      6  of 12 6 Common Fertility Mistakes   6  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest  7  of 12 Mistake No. 5: Mistiming Ovulation     7  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest iStock Mistake No. 5: Mistiming Ovulation Knowing exactly when you ovulate can be tricky. Many women follow the textbook rule, believing they ovulate 14 days after the first day of their period, but cycle lengths vary, and ovulation doesn't always occur at the same time each month, Dr. Seibel says. Many women also think they can pinpoint ovulation because of symptoms. "If you're in tune with your body, you may notice that you have an increased clear egg-white-like vaginal discharge a few days before ovulation," says Yvonne Bohn, M.D., an ob-gyn and co-author of The Mommy Docs Ultimate Guide to Pregnancy and Birth . But many women miss this, and some mistakenly think their normal discharge is a sign of ovulation. Instead of guessing (possibly wrong), Dr. Seibel says that using an ovulation predictor kit can give a more accurate answer. 6 Signs You're Ovulating Your Ovulation Calendar: When Are You Most Likely to Get Pregnant?  8  of 12 Mistake No. 6: Having Sex the Day of Ovulation     8  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest Hamiza Bakirci/istock Mistake No. 6: Having Sex the Day of Ovulation If you have an ovulation predictor kit, or if you're charting your basal body temperature or using the calendar method to try to identify ovulation, you may think it makes sense to get physical the day of ovulation -- but that may be too late. After ovulation, the egg can be fertilized for only about 24 hours. If you're wrong about ovulation, you'll have to wait to try again the next month. Because sperm can live for three to five days, having sex in the few days leading up to ovulation will increase your chances of getting pregnant, experts say.

Win Baby Gear!  9  of 12 Mistake No. 7: Using Lubricant     9  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest Bryan McCay Mistake No. 7: Using Lubricant Think twice next time you reach for the lube. Commercial lubricants negatively affect sperm motility, making it harder for the sperm to reach the egg. If you must use a lube, try Pre-Seed, a sperm-friendly lubricant. Or if you prefer a more natural lube, olive oil, vegetable oil, baby oil, and even egg whites are safe and effective.  10  of 12 Mistake No. 8: Rushing to a Specialist     10  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest istock Mistake No. 8: Rushing to a Specialist After two or three months of trying, it's easy to get frustrated. That doesn't mean an immediate appointment with a fertility specialist is in order. "Even under ideal conditions, perfectly fertile couples can take several months to become pregnant," Dr. Wood assures. If you're under 35, with regular menstrual cycles and no underlying health issues that might affect fertility, Dr. Wood advises waiting it out for one year.  11  of 12 Mistake No. 9: Not Getting Help Soon Enough     11  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest iStockphoto Mistake No. 9: Not Getting Help Soon Enough In some instances, seeing a fertility doc sooner rather than later is the best move. "If you're 35 or older, you should see a fertility specialist after six months of trying without success," Dr. Chen says. And if you're younger and have irregular periods or a history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), or other health issues that may affect fertility or pregnancy, Dr. Chen says it's a good idea to seek out a specialist right away. When Should You See Your Doctor If You're Having Trouble Getting Pregnant?      12  of 12 Mistake No. 10: Neglecting Your General Health     12  of 12   Facebook  Pinterest iStockphoto Mistake No. 10: Neglecting Your General Health Often, when couples are trying to conceive, they focus so intensely on their reproductive health, they neglect their overall health. It becomes all about cervical mucus, sperm count, and doing the do. But it's important to pay attention to your health in general because issues like weight, smoking, stress, and medications can affect fertility too, Dr. Chen says. Before trying to conceive, it's a good idea for both you and your guy to have a medical checkup to discuss any issues that may affect fertility or pregnancy.

By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Your Odds of Conceiving at Every Point in Your Cycle To hit the baby-making bullseye, you've got to aim for certain sweet spots of fertility in your cycle. Here's how to maximize your odds of conceiving throughout the month. Phase 1: Your period In essence, menstruation is the monthly shedding of the endometrium, the inner membrane of the uterus. For most women, this lasts between three and seven days. By the third day, levels of progesterone and estrogen are on the rise and working on rebuilding your endometrium. Around day four, follicle ripening begins to go on the uptick. That means the ovaries are starting to prepare eggs for release. Unless you're a very early ovulator (the average timing for ovulation is 14 days before the start of your period—track yours by using a basal body temperature chart or an ovulation predictor kit ), there's little chance your man's sperm will actually have any eggs to work with during this phase of your cycle. So, can you get pregnant while on your period? Almost nil. It's not detrimental to have intercourse, and some women see it as a good time to take a breather from the rigors of frequent baby-making sex. Phase 2: Pre-ovulation "I recommend having sex frequently—two to three times a week, but every other day if you can—shortly after you stop menstruating to cover your window of pre-ovulation," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence. Here's why: Around day seven of your cycle, you'll notice a vaginal discharge that seems a little springy to the touch. Within a few days, it will turn white and creamy, a cue that your fertility is returning once again. It doesn't mean the egg is released yet, but it's a good indicator that ovulation is on the way and that your cervical mucus is a friendly environment for sperm. Remember, you can get pregnant right after your period, even if you're not yet ovulating. That's because sperm can live up to five days if it's trapped in fertile cervical mucus. So it behooves you to get a few of his swimmers in place. "One study showed that people who had sex only one time during this phase, even four to five days before ovulation, still got pregnant," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic in Boston. Your odds of conceiving: Good. An egg isn't technically released during this phase but you'll want to step up your sexual routine in the event that you ovulate earlier than planned. Phase 3: Ovulation Welcome to prime time for conception! No matter how long your periods are, ovulation generally starts about 14 days before your next scheduled period. When it happens, your body temperature rises about a half a degree. But bear in mind that this takes place after you're already ovulating, which could be too late. "That's where ovulation kits become so helpful," Dr. Bayer explains. "Once it turns positive, have sex in the next 24 to 36 hours." Another good indication of fertility is a change in the consistency your cervical mucus. "You'll see vaginal discharge that increases in amount and has the consistency of egg whites, signaling it's the perfect time to have intercourse," Dr. Bayer says. Test yours by sticking your index finger and thumb in your vagina to get a sample, then tapping your finger and thumb together. If the consistency is thin and spreads easily between two fingers, you're good to go. Your odds of conceiving: High, if you have sex within 36 hours. Any eggs that are released live no longer than 12 hours. In fact, it's best if his swimmers meet your egg within four to six hours of its release. Data show that having every-other-day sex is just as effective as doing it every day, so no need to go crazy getting busy every hour (unless you really want to!). Phase 4: Post-ovulation Also known as the luteal phase, this final portion of your cycle lasts a minimum of 12 days and as many as 16. Progesterone starts to rise, signaling that the ovaries don't need to release any more eggs this month. Your cervical mucus will dry up and create a plug to prevent any additional sperm from entering the uterus. It takes about six days for any fertilized eggs to travel to your uterus. If one implants in your endometrium, you'll start to see the rise in human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), the hormone measured by home pregnancy tests , within a week. Your odds of conceiving: Low. Once the egg has been released, there's not much that can be done until next month. But there's certainly no harm in having sex if you're in the mood!

For most women, trying to conceive is a crash course in Reproduction 101. By Holly Eagleson  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print Pregnancy Sex Tips: Have Fun Sex and Get Pregnant         Jamie Grill/Tetra Images/Corbis  First, the basics. You're born with 1 to 2 million eggs at birth, and those are all eggs you're going to have in a lifetime. By the time of your first period, your supply dwindles to 300,000. "If a woman ovulates 500 times between the ages of 12 and 52, and if not all of those eggs are considered to be healthy, what you're left with is a select few eggs that are truly viable for pregnancy," says Alan Copperman, M.D., director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York and co-director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Adding insult to injury, human reproduction isn't all that efficient. There is only one week in your cycle during which your odds are really favorable -- and goodness knows that few of us can devote a whole week each month to nonstop boot-knocking in the name of baby making. It helps to know your odds of conception at every stage so you can make the most of them. Early 20s (20 to 24) Behold, the magic window for baby making! "[When a woman is] 21, 90 percent of [her] eggs are chromosomally normal, which helps your chances of conceiving a healthy baby," Dr. Copperman says. You also have age on your side -- the average woman's fertility peaks at the age of 24. Women under age 25 have a 96 percent chance of conceiving in a year if they're trying each month. If the guy is under 25, the odds drop to 92 percent. That's because many fertility issues among younger couples are on the man's side. Most are easily treatable and don't require help from a specialist unless conception is taking longer than one year. Mid-late 20s (25 to 29) From age 25 to 34, you have an 86 percent chance of conceiving after trying for a year. Your chances of miscarrying are 10 percent, only a little higher than they were in your early 20s. Keep doing what you've been doing and you'll be likely to have a baby within a year. There's no need to consult a specialist until you've been actively trying for more than 12 months without success. Early 30s (30 to 34) Your odds of conceiving are still high -- up to an 86 percent success rate for couples that try for a full year. The only major change is that your chances of miscarriage by age 30 have risen to 20 percent. Conventional wisdom says that you don't need to see fertility treatment in your early 30s until you've been trying for a year with no luck, but some doctors recommend consulting your ob-gyn or primary care physician if you're still having trouble after 9 months. "That way, they can pinpoint any problems and treat them before your fertility starts to decline more rapidly after 35," Dr. Copperman says. Mid to late 30s (35 to 39) "You still have a good outlook for getting pregnant in this window, particularly before age 37," says Kelly Pagidas, M.D., a fertility specialist with Women & Infants Center for Reproduction and Infertility in Providence and an associate professor at Brown University Medical School. At 35, most women have a 15 to 20 percent chance of getting pregnant in a given month. That could mean a 78 percent chance of conceiving within the year. But 35 seems to be the point where fertility does decline. "The most common reason is reduced egg quality," Dr. Pagidas explains. "You may have plenty of eggs to work with, but they're likely to have more chromosomal defects that affect their viability. You're also at a little greater risk of miscarriage, a Down syndrome pregnancy or an abnormal pregnancy." Roughly 30 percent of women age 35 may take a year or more to conceive. Doctors don't want you to wait that long to find out if you're one of them. Time is of the essence, and if you're having trouble conceiving after six months, see a specialist to undergo some testing. Intrauterine insemination is a less invasive assisted reproductive technology that may work but in vitro fertilization (IVF) may be an excellent treatment option as well. Finally, this is your last chance to freeze viable eggs for use at a later date, should you prefer not to get pregnant right now. "A woman can freeze her eggs up until age 40; then she can come back years later and have a good chance of pregnancy even into her mid-40s," says Steven R. Bayer, M.D., reproductive endocrinologist at Boston IVF fertility clinic. Early 40s (40 to 44) With advancing age, egg quality and quantity go down. At this stage, you're facing a few challenges that make it harder to conceive and to stay pregnant. "By the time she's in her 40s, 90 percent of a woman's eggs are chromosomally abnormal," Dr. Copperman says. Assistance from reproductive technologies becomes more common at this time, and not just because of the egg issue. There may be more issues with older male partners, and some women report an increase in uterine lining issues with age. The uterine lining thins and blood supply to it decreases with age, making it more difficult for the egg to implant. Women approaching menopause may also see their cycles shorten. (The onset of menopause is generally between ages 40 and 60.) "That means as the cycle shortens, ovulation occurs earlier in the cycle, as soon as day nine," Dr. Bayer explains. "You need to make sure you adjust the timing of intercourse around ovulation accordingly." The rule of thumb at this age for natural conception is to have sex every other day around the time of ovulation. A good sign that you are getting close to ovulation is an increased production of a clear cervical mucus. An ovulation predictor kit may also help with the timing of sex. If conception is taking more than three months, see your doctor right away. For women over the age of 40, conservative treatment with inseminations carries a low success rate. The best option is IVF. If a 42-year-old woman has five embryos placed, there is a 10 to 20 percent chance of pregnancy. (If pregnancy is achieved, there is a 20 percent chance of a multiple; this carries its own risks.) For women who have low ovarian reserve and produce only a few embryos, or for women over the age of 43, egg donation is the best choice. 45 and over At 45, a woman's likelihood of getting pregnant is no more than 3 or 4 percent. That's not to say it's impossible, but assisted reproductive technologies are almost always necessary, with IVF the most common. "The few eggs you have left may have chromosomal abnormalities, so screening before IVF is critical," says Dr. Copperman. Success rates are 0 to 1 percent, and most clinics recommend using eggs donated by a younger woman for those who want to conceive between ages 46 and 50. For a woman in her mid-40s who wants to have a biological pregnancy, using a donor egg is best bet. "It's fairly easy for a healthy woman to achieve and sustain a pregnancy if the egg is from a healthy 25- or 30-year old," Dr. Bayer says. "Even if she's in menopause, success rates are about 60 to 65 percent." All ages, listen up! Regardless of your age, you can maximize your chances of conceiving each month by figuring out exactly when you ovulate. "Ovulation generally occurs 14 days before your next period, no matter how long your cycle is," says Dr. Bayer. For instance, if you have a 34-day cycle, you ovulate around day 20; a woman with a 26-day cycle would ovulate on day 12. Whatever your date of ovulation, plan to have intercourse in the five days prior to that day and for two days after. "You'll know you're nearing ovulation when you start producing clear, slippery cervical mucus which starts one to four days before egg release," Dr. Bayer says. Another good predictor is ovulation kit. "When it shows you're getting ready to ovulate, have intercourse over the next two days to catch the fertile window. You have 24 to 36 hours to have sex to make it in the optimal window," Dr. Bayer explains. Copyright © 2013 Meredith Corporation.

Here, we answer some common conception questions to help increase your chances of getting pregnant. By K. Aleisha Fetters  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         Phillip Graybill  Q: Will having an orgasm help me get pregnant? A: Yes! Yes! Yes! Some experts believe that uterine contractions during orgasm may help propel sperm into the cervix, but one thing is for sure -- the tingles (and flood of oxytocin) during orgasm definitely make you relaxed. And that means you've already cleared the biggest baby-making blocker: stress. "The better the sex, the better the chances of conception," says reproductive physiologist Joanna Ellington, Ph.D., in the British documentary The Great Sperm Race . Men who are fully stimulated will ejaculate up to 50 percent more, according to research revealed in the program. "So if you have what I call 'gourmet sex,' where you really spend time and you make it fun for both partners, that is going to make the man more stimulated and he is going to ejaculate more and healthier sperm," she says. Sure, plain old sex, with no female orgasm, can result in a baby, too, but why not go for the gold? Q: Can we determine the sex of our baby? A: Depends on whom you ask. Proponents of the Shettles Method, which was developed in the 1960s, claim a 75- to 90-percent success rate in determining their babies' gender. The Shettles Method is based on the belief that sperm with Y chromosomes (which produce boys) move faster than sperm with X chromosomes (which produce girls) and it is possible that alkaline secretions in the vaginal tract, caused by female orgasm, favor Y chromosomal sperm. Still, there's no "convincing evidence" that sexual techniques can determine gender, according to Optimizing natural fertility . So if your hubby really wants to get out the ol' toy trucks again, opting for in vitro is his best bet, says Melissa M. Goist, M.D., Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at The Ohio State University Medical Center. Do Sex Positions Matter? Q: Do certain sex positions help my chances of conceiving? A: Common sense says that deep penetration (through positions like rear-entry and missionary) will dispense sperm closer to the cervix, helping the little swimmers reach their goal, but there's no evidence to back up the theory. Regardless of how you get down to business, sperm are present in the cervical canal just seconds after ejaculation, according to Optimizing natural fertility , a committee opinion by the Practice Committee of American Society for Reproductive Medicine in collaboration with the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. That means your favorite position is the best one for conceiving, says Shari Brasner, M.D., ob-gyn at New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital. "There is no rationale for sex to be uncomfortable or awkward." Q: Can oral sex as foreplay hurt our chances of conceiving? A: Not to be a foreplay killer, but saliva can be a sperm killer. It can interfere with your cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract (making it inhospitable to sperm), and even take out stalwart swimmers, according to Optimizing natural fertility. If clitoral stimulation helps get you in the mood, ask your man to reach for fertility-safe lubricant and put his fingers to work instead. Being face-to-face--and mouth-to-mouth--during the act might even be more intimate. Q: Is hot tub sex a bad idea when trying to conceive? A: Yes. Hot tubs are typically factory programmed at 104?. At that temp (some like it hotter!) it takes only 10 to 20 minutes to raise the temperature of your body, his body, and his testicles to 102? or higher, according to the American Pregnancy Association. And his boys don't like getting any warmer than 96? if they can help it. Not only can sperm cells sizzle in the heat, the production of them can temporarily screech to a halt--decreasing his sperm count for days. Can You Give Sperm an Advantage? Q: Can gravity help sperm work their magic? A: Probably not. Some women think that lying on your back with your hips elevated for 20 minutes after sex will help ensure that every last sperm gets a fighting chance at the prize, but the belief has no scientific foundation, according to Optimizing natural fertility . It can't hurt, though, Dr. Goist says. So why not use the technique as an excuse to get your post-romp cuddle on? Q: Will lubricants help his sperm reach my egg? A: Nope. Your cervical mucus moves sperm along quite swimmingly all on its own. Plus, most lubricants can interfere with cervical mucus, alter the pH in your vaginal tract, and kill off even the sturdiest of sperm. In fact, water-based lubricants (like Astroglide, K-Y Jelly, and Touch) inhibit sperm motility in vitro by 60 percent to 100 percent within 60 minutes of incubation, according to a study published in the International Journal of Fertility and Menopausal Studies . If you really need some extra lubrication during sex (a common issue when you're more focused on making babies than making love), sticking with mineral oil, canola oil, or a hydroxyethylcellulose-based lubricant such as Pre-Seed are your best bets, Dr. Brasner says. Timing it Right Q: Is there an ideal time of day to have sex to conceive? A: Sure is. It's in the morning. Or, specifically, after your man gets a good night's rest, says Dr. Goist. When he's sleeping, his body regenerates the sperm lost during the day. Although the average sperm cell has a pretty short shelf life--only seven days--even stalwart swimmers can hit their expiration date early if they get too warm from exercise like bike riding, Dr. Goist says. Q: Should we "save" his sperm for when I'm ovulating? A: No! If your man has been stepping up on cold showers to store his swimmers until your ovulation test turns positive, it's time to turn the heat back up. As long as your partner has a normal sperm count, you'll have the best shot of conceiving if you have sex once a day, according to Optimizing natural fertility . Abstaining can increase sperm count (a good thing in that more boys start the trip), but it can also decrease sperm motility (a bad thing if you don't want them to just chase their tails). Moreover, abstinence intervals greater than five days can diminish sperm counts. Don't forget: Most (but certainly not all!) pregnancies occur during the two days before ovulation, according to a study published in the journal Human Reproduction .

If you're ready to start trying to conceive, learn how long it typically takes and how you can try to get pregnant faster.          The BabyCenter Editorial Team          Mom Answers ( 84 )   Best answers   Most recent      BEST ANSWER   At least that&#39;s what the doctors say. In reality you can get pregnant any time of your menstrual cycle. And not nessesarily when you&#39;re ovulating. But I know a person who can tell you for shure will you get pregnant or not and when just by looking at your photo. It&#39;s very easy to find him. Just go on facebook and search for this group. The name of this group is Baby gender by parents photo                 elliejankins    Answered 10/11/16                202 found this helpful     The time when you are ovulating is the best possible change to conceive, but keep in mind that everything has to be just right in order to actually get pregnant. A lot of times the sperm and the egg meet and the beginnings of an embryo will start, but implantation never occurs and you would have a normal period and no pregnancy. And there are a significant number of &quot;pregnancies&quot; that implant and then spontaneously miscarry long before you would know you were pregnant and you'd have a normal period. The static is that if you and your are healthy and have intercourse on the exact day that you ovulate there is a 1 in 4 chance of getting pregnant (and detecting it). Also keep in mind that sperm can live in the vagina for approx 3-7 days, so it is possible to get pregnant from sex either a few days before or a few days after ovulation.                 LMGJackson    Answered 11/30/07               194 found this helpful     it isnt a sure thing but it is VERY possible. If a sperm fertilizes and egg but then doesnt attach to the uterine wall then you will not get pregnant. the egg will just pass out during your next period.              Anonymous   Answered 9/14/07               138 found this helpful     Like others have posted...that is the BEST time for getting pregnant, but I do know someone who did the ovulation kits, knew she was ovulating and still didn't get pregnant. I know she eventually did, but without being checked by a doctor you don't really know why you aren't getting pregnant. It could be lots of things including stress or a low sperm count.              Anonymous   Answered 11/8/07               87 found this helpful     It is the most likely time to get pregnant when you are ovulating. However sperm can live up to 7 days inside your vagina. If you are trying to get pregnant, just make an appointment with your Gynecologist for the best advice. If you are trying to NOT get pregnant use birth control and/or get yourself to planned parenthood.                 gratefulbeauty    Answered 11/26/07               60 found this helpful     the doctors say that the best and more effective way to concieve a baby but it happens when the time is right. for one whole year after i was married both me and my husband tried for a baby and i went by an ovulation calculator to have intercourse and nothing happend then march came and i lost track of the calculater and in may i found out i was 6 weeks preggers              Anonymous   Answered 11/6/07               57 found this helpful     it also depends on if your body is ready              Anonymous   Answered 9/27/07               55 found this helpful     No it is NOT a sure thing! my DH and I had sex one month every other day during ovulation and NOTHING so then we tried EVERYDAY during ovulation and NOTHING. the one time we only had sex ONCE is when we got pregnant.

What are the most common reasons for not getting pregnant? Medical causes for not getting pregnant Are there any unexplained and combination infertility factors? Are regular/heavy periods a sign of fertility? Can you get pregnant at any time of the month? Are you fertile if you have regular period? How can I get pregnant faster? Why am I not getting pregnant the second time? Have you been trying to conceive for a while now? Then, it is high time you knew the reasons for not getting pregnant and fixed the issue. Conceiving is not just about having sex. Several factors, single or a combination, contribute to your not getting pregnant. MomJunction helps you understand these problems and improve your conception rates, by offering solutions and treatment methods. But first, let’s take a look at this question!  How Long Does It Take For A Woman To Get Pregnant? If you are healthy and your reproductive parts are functioning at their best, you have a 25% probability of becoming pregnant during every menstrual cycle (1) . According to the statistics presented in Before Your Pregnancy by Amy Ogle and Lisa Mazullo. Sponsored Of all couples (women younger than 30 years) trying to conceive:- 30 percent will conceive within the initial month (first cycle) 75 percent will conceive after six months 85 percent will conceive within one year (12 cycles) 90 percent will conceive after one year 95 percent will conceive after two years 91 percent will conceive within three years (36 cycles) (about three years). 93 to 95 percent will conceive within four years (48 cycles) Several factors come into play and define when a couple may conceive. Back to top [Read: When Is The Best Time To Get Pregnant ] What Are The Most Common Reasons For Not Getting Pregnant? While your periods may be regular, a number of everyday activities can impact your chances of conception. Let us know about them: 1. Too much or too little sex: Sex is probably the most basic human need for pleasure and reproduction. And, people are always in the extremes (1) . Having too much sex: Some people believe that having more sex could lead to conception. But this may not always be true. Though frequent sex will not decrease the vigor of a man’s sperm, it can cause potential health problems such as fatigue, dizziness, weak knees, and frequent urination. If you indulge in a lot of sex only to have babies, it could lead to BURNOUT (a state of fatigue, depleting your energy for sex). In this case, when the actual fertile window is open, either partner may not be interested in sex. And, as a couple you lose an opportunity to conceive. Having too little sex: You may be cutting down on intercourse to save the sperm or you only have sex during ovulation. But staying without sex for many days may affect your conception. You could miss your fertile phase when sex is limited as you may not always be correct about your ovulation. What next? Try to have sex frequently and keep a close watch on your ovulation dates. If you have irregular periods or problems tracking your fertile window, use an ovulation kit. If the result shows that ovulation is due in one or two days, have sex during that time. Keep in mind not to have sex just for having a baby, because then you can’t enjoy the process. [ Read: Best Sex Positions To Get Pregnant  ] 2. Over-stress Stress will take a toll on your health both physically and mentally, and affect your ability to get pregnant. Other emotional disturbances such as depression and anxiety can lower your fertility levels. You should be calm and in a balanced state when trying to conceive. Stress hampers the hypothalamus functions, which control the pituitary gland. The gland regulates adrenal, thyroid, and ovaries, and affects the period cycle, even leading to irregular periods. What next? You should give yourself some time to come out of the stress phase to improve your chances of conceiving. To beat stress, you could join a support group, see a psychologist, join yoga for fertility, meditate and exercise (2) . 3. The man-problem: One of the primary and top causes of infertility is low sperm count and poor sperm motility (due to structural abnormalities). This factor accounts for 30 to 40% of infertility problems in couples (3) . [Read: Infertility In Men – Symptoms And Treatment ] What next? The foremost step is to see a doctor or a fertility specialist for immediate treatment. For low sperm count or motility, in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is the best solution. IVF involves mating the egg and sperms outside the human body, and transferring the fertilized egg to the vagina. In ICSI, a single sperm is picked and directly injected into the egg (4) . 4. Running to the bathroom after sex: Many women rush to the bathroom after sex to clean up, wash. It is essential to stay in bed for some time after sex to ensure that the sperm gets a chance to reach the egg and fertilize it. If you get up and rush, as soon as you are done with the act, you are letting gravity drag the sperm down and the rest of it is washed away when you clean up. And, this is one of the natural reasons for not getting pregnant. What next? Focus on relaxing and lying in bed for a while after sex so that you can improve your chances of conception and pregnancy (5) . 5. Undergarments too tight: Women wear tight undergarments for proper shape, and also to accentuate their body and figure. But, you may be hampering the functions of your reproductive organs. In men, the sperm production goes down, and in women, the air-circulation reduces and leads to discomfort. What next? Wear well-fitted, but cotton undergarments to avoid infections. This will reduce sweat and moisture-related problems, and allow your privates to breathe and relax (6) . 6. Sleeping less: Sleep deprivation can strain and exhaust the body and affect the functions of the immune system. This increases your chances of getting infections, and in turn, affects the reproductive cycle. The same applies to men. Infections could develop into fever, and excess body heat can damage the sperm. Women may feel anxious due to lack of sleep that could affect their menstrual cycle (7) . What next? Get enough sleep to stay healthy. In case you suffer from insomnia, then consult a doctor. 7. Under or overweight: Being too thin or too fat will also affect your chances of conceiving. If you are undernourished, you will not ovulate well. If you’re on the heavier side, then it will hamper your fertility. Therefore, an ideal body weight is what helps, and if you are over your ideal BMI, there are fewer chances of conception even if your ovulation is regular (8) . What next? Maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle. Indulge in moderate fitness routine. You may check with your healthcare provider for nutrition and supplementation. 8. Over-use of lubricants: Studies state that vaginal lubricants negatively affect the motility of the sperm and interfere with fertilization. This is true for both over-the-counter and homemade lubricants. The reason – the pH of cervical mucus produced before ovulation is ideal for the survival of sperm and its motility. But lubricants have an acidic pH, which is enough to kill sperms. Also, the sperm’s motility is affected by the thickness of the lubricants and their water content (9) . What next? Foreplay is the best lubricant for conception. Take your time to get into the mood. If that doesn’t work, use warm water for lubrication as it is non-toxic and will not interfere with the sperm’s motility. If you still require lubricant while trying to get pregnant, you can choose “fertility friendly” lubricants such as Conceive Plus and Pre-Seed (10) . 9. Poor lifestyle choices: Common lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking, drug abuse, and caffeine affect your fertility. In men, these factors decrease the sperm count and motility and in females, they cause irregular ovulation. What next? Quit these habits, especially a few months before you plan to conceive. Switch to healthier life choices. Also, avoid the use of artificial sweeteners and exposure to chemicals (11) . 10. Environmental pollution: Environmental toxins are known to harm both men and women. Exposure to pollutants such as chemicals, pesticides, cigarette smoke, polychlorinated biphenyls, plastics, food packaging, and personal care products (soaps, shampoos, and cosmetics), could affect your health, especially fertility. They lower the couples’ ability to conceive by 29% (12) . What next? Though it is inevitable to avoid exposure to environmental toxins and chemicals, you should avoid them as much as possible. Stop using pesticides for your plants and lawn. Choose organic foods. Use organic and natural personal care products. Wear protective gear when you are working in chemical-prone areas, and always remain in highly ventilated places. All of the above reasons are lifestyle choices or environmental factors that affect the ability to conceive. Now, let’s look at some medical causes of not getting pregnant. Back to top [Read: Tips To Increase Your Chances Of Getting Pregnant ] Medical Causes For Not Getting Pregnant: In some cases, the egg may get aborted naturally, while in others, the couple could suffer from impotency. You must, however, give yourself a year to conceive. If things don’t work out by then, then you may reach out to a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. The causes of infertility are different in men and women. The medical causes of infertility in women are: 11. Irregular periods: Women who do not menstruate regularly have more difficulty in getting pregnant. Irregular periods indicate inconsistent ovulation, and conceiving without an egg is impossible. Therefore, the less you ovulate, the less are your chances of getting pregnant (13) . [ Read: Reasons Of Irregular Periods ] How can I get pregnant with irregular periods? A doctor can help you find the underlying cause for irregular periods and offer the treatment accordingly. You should also focus on a healthy diet, attain ideal weight, perform moderate exercises, and take fertility enhancing supplements as suggested by the doctor. 12. Endometriosis: This is a chronic disorder of the reproductive system in which the endometrial cells grow outside the uterus. It will block the tubes preventing fertilization or the fertilized egg from traveling towards the fallopian tubes. This condition causes painful periods, severe pain while penetration during sex, painful bowel movements, and frequent urination along with a feeling of bladder being full during menstrual cycle, or chronic pelvic pain (14) . What could be the possible treatment? The best treatment is laparoscopy in which a light tube is used to check and remove abnormal cysts and blocked tubes. Post the surgery, you will conceive in six to eight months. If that does not happen, then fertility drugs with intrauterine insemination (IUI) are given, and in severe cases, in-vitro fertilization is used. [Read: What Is Endometriosis & How Does It Affect Pregnancy  ] 13. Ovulation problems: Almost 20 to 40% of infertility problems in women are caused due to irregular ovulation, which prevents the release of mature eggs from ovaries. Where some women can never ovulate, others ovulate once in a quarter. Hormonal fluctuations, excess weight gain or loss, excessive exercise, or severe stress could be the key reasons of ovulatory disorders (15) . What could be the possible treatment? Your doctor will prescribe ovulation stimulators such as gonadotrophins, clomifene, prolactin suppressants, often with IVF and fertility drugs. 14. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): It is a complex condition caused by hormonal imbalance, which interrupts ovulation. Small cysts are formed in the ovaries that disrupt ripening of ovarian follicle and maturation. The other possible symptoms include irregular menstruation, weight gain, excess hair growth, and acne. What could be the possible treatment? Changes in diet and lifestyle that help control weight, and medical treatments such as ovulation stimulatory drugs (gonadotrophins, clomifene) along with IVF, can treat PCOS ( 16) . [ Read: PCOS And Pregnancy ] 15. Tubal diseases: Damaged or blocked fallopian tubes prevent eggs from reaching the uterus and sperm from reaching the egg, thus preventing conception. These conditions could arise due to sexually transmitted diseases, pelvic inflammatory diseases, or sterilization surgeries, if any. What could be the possible treatment? Laparoscopic surgery helps open and repair the tubes, and is followed by IVF (13) . 16. Egg factor: The egg quality and quantity decline around late 30s and early 40s. Women are born with approximately one to two million eggs at birth and the eggs gradually lessen to 300, 000 by puberty. Then about 300 mature and release through ovulation. And, by menopause, you have no eggs left. What could be the possible treatment? As the loss of eggs is an irreversible process, you should try to plan pregnancy in your fertile age. Also, try losing weight if you are overweight, quit smoking, manage thyroid issues (if you have any), and take supplements including fish oils, prenatal vitamins, probiotics, vitamin D, and Coenzyme Q10. These improve egg quality. The possible solutions if the above do not work are egg or embryo donation, adoption, or surrogacy (17) . 17. Low progesterone levels: After ovulation, the corpus luteum (remnant egg follicle) produces progesterone to support embryo implantation during early pregnancy. The deficiency of progesterone in this phase is called Luteal Phase Defect (LPD), and may be one of the reasons for infertility. Even if you conceive, the placenta and fetus would not grow further, causing non-viable fetus or early fetal loss. Other medical conditions such as prolactin or thyroid abnormalities could lead to abnormal luteal functioning (18) . What could be the possible treatment? Your doctor may refer you to a reproductive endocrinologist. The treatments include progesterone supplements, vaginal injections, or suppositories to thicken the uterine lining for embryo attachment. 18. Cervical mucus problems: Cervical mucus usually changes its consistency to clear and elastic forms so that the sperms can easily move through the mucus into female reproductive organs. In a case of cervical mucus abnormalities, the mucus prevents the sperm from passing through. The mucus may contract an infection, or contain antibodies that kill sperms. These problems are encountered in women with chronic cervicitis or a narrowed cervix followed by any prior surgery (19) , and lead to pregnancy failure. What could be the possible treatment? Identifying and treating infections and using assisted reproductive methods such as IUI and in-vitro fertilization, help solve the problem. The medical causes of infertility in men are: [ Read: Cervical Mucus And Ovulation ] 19. Sperm problems: Poor sperm mobility, low or no sperm count, and abnormally shaped sperms can decrease a man’s fertility. What could be the possible treatment? Fertility drugs are the first line of treatment to boost sperm production. The next options are IUI and ICSI (20) . 20. Tube blockages: Blockages in the epididymis (a long coiled tube that lies behind testicles and stores mature sperms) and vas deferens (the muscular tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct) could adversely affect the transport of fertile sperms. The obstruction in the tubes could be due to infections including gonorrhea or chlamydia, birth defects, or injuries. Also, varicoceles (enlarged veins in the scrotum) will affect sperm mobility. What could be the possible treatment? Health practitioners usually prefer surgical correction of tube blockages, which corrects fertility (20) . Besides lifestyle choices and medical reasons, there are a few other factors that can affect fertility. Back to top Are There Any Other Factors That Affect Fertility? Yes! Unexplained and combination reasons account for almost 25% and 40% respectively of all infertility cases (21) . 21.

conceive isn't as easy as some people think. 7 surprising fertility facts 00:18:37 Fertility and trying to conceive isn?t as easy as some people think, here are some facts that might surprise you! 29 May 2017 11 months /video/video.kidspot.com.au/Birth/  Fertility and conception experts like Medica IVF's Dr David Knight say the human species is not as fertile as we like to think. "If you are between 18 and 34 and you and your partner are generally healthy, doctors say more often than not some simple problems - with easy fixes - may be standing in your way," he says. There are plenty of myths and old wives tales about fertility that Dr Knight says can get in the way of successfully falling pregnant. Fertility fact 1: How often to have sex Most women know they must ovulate in order to conceive, but having sex on the day of ovulation does not increase the chances of conception. It may in fact decrease a woman's chance as many wait for ovulation before having sex which may cause them to bypass their most fertile time. After ovulation, an egg is only viable for about 24 hours, so if you are waiting until you ovulate to have intercourse, chances are you are going to miss the opportunity to get pregnant that month. Since sperm can also live in your reproductive tract for 3-4 days, having sex two to three times a week, means that when an egg is released there will be sperm waiting! "I tell my patients to have regular intercourse, meaning 2-3 times a week generally starting after your period stops. Specifically I encourage couples NOT to monitor ovulation or use temperature graphs," Dr Knight says. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that having sex beginning six days prior to ovulation is the most conducive to achieving conception. The more times you have intercourse during your 'window of opportunity', the more likely you are to get pregnant.  Source: iStock  Fertility fact 2: Relax, have sex every day Don't worry about having too much sex when you are trying to conceive. The same NEJM study found that having sex every day is slightly more likely to result in pregnancy than intercourse every other day. Experts do caution couples not to put love making on a schedule. That, they say, just might decrease chances of conception. The scientific evidence is scarce, but if you are stressed and love making is on 'schedule',' there is some data to show that hormones may be affected and that in turn could influence conception. A Harvard Medical School study on women with fertility problems, that 55% of those who completed a 10-week course of relaxation training and stress reduction had a viable pregnancy within one year, compared with just 20% of the group who had no stress reduction training. Doctors have also found that women undergoing fertility treatments , who remained relaxed and optimistic, had better overall outcomes than women who were pessimistic about their ability to conceive. If you are worried all the time about getting pregnant, if you obsess over it and think about only that, you might influence your body chemistry in a way that does affect your fertility. The key is to "think about making love, not about making babies." Fertility fact 3: How position affects conception There are many myths surrounding sexual intercourse and the best time to conceive. Many couples widely believe that the position taken during sexual intercourse will affect their chances of getting pregnant. Furthermore, many believe their chances of conceiving are increased by lying on their backs for 20 minutes, ensuring the semen stays in the neck of the uterus for longer. Whilst semen does inevitably come out of the vagina following ejaculation, sufficient sperm are deposited in the neck of the womb and are able to begin their journey towards the egg, regardless of the position taken.  Source: iStock  Fertility fact 4: Don't think sperm potency improves by saving up Millions of sperm are produced every day in the testicles. The sperm are stored in a tiny sac, the epididymis, which lies at the top of each testicle. Abstaining from sex in order to accumulate sperm so that more are deposited during sex will not increase your chances of achieving conception. In fact the stored, older sperm may be of inferior quality and even hinder the newly produced, healthier sperm from reaching the egg. Fertility fact 5: Lubricant won't help sperm to slip, slide and get inside Not only is this not true, it could actually prevent you from getting pregnant, says Dr Knight.Most lubricants change the pH or acid balance inside the vagina, and that in turn may affect sperm motility and ultimately prevent, or at least reduce the chances of a pregnancy occurring. If you find you must use a lubricant avoid petroleum jelly. Instead try natural vegetable products, such as olive oil, which is less likely to cause sperm any serious problems.  11 Apr 2018  Fertility fact 6: Just because the female doesn't orgasm, doesn't matter There is no evidence to support that a woman with low libido or failure to orgasm cannot conceive - though some patients do think this. Furthermore, a woman does not need to achieve an orgasm in order to conceive. Continually trying to find the right time to have sexual intercourse may place a strain on a couple's lovemaking and this in turn may hinder their chances of getting pregnant. Couples should have sexual intercourse when they feel like it and not limit it to the period during the woman's cycle perceived to be the most fertile. Furthermore, women do not always ovulate on the fourteenth day of their cycle and it is easy to misjudge the fertile time. The chance of becoming pregnant in any one month for a fertile couple is at best 25 per cent and even in entirely healthy couples. Fertility fact 7: Failing to conceive doesn't mean you are a failure Infertility is a medical condition just like arthritis or asthma, which can require medical treatment. It is no reflection on how masculine or feminine a person is. Although there are no dietary or nutritional cures for infertility, a healthy lifestyle is important. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, not smoking and avoiding alcohol and caffeine are probably wise ideas.

Sex! (Or intercourse at the right time, to be technical about it.)  The 'fertile window' is when you should be having lots of sex if you want to conceive.  The fertile window  We’re talking about the days in a woman’s menstrual cycle when pregnancy is possible. The ‘fertile window’ depends on the length of a woman’s cycle, this varies between women.  Pregnancy is technically only possible during the five days before ovulation through to the day of ovulation. These six days are the ‘fertile window’ in a woman’s cycle, and reflect the lifespan of sperm (5 days) and the lifespan of the ovum (24 hours).  Ovulation is when a mature egg is released from the ovary, moves down the fallopian tube, and is available in the fallopian tube to be fertilised. If there is sperm waiting around at the time the egg is released, there is a higher chance that it will be fertilised. Ovulation happens about two weeks before the woman’s next expected period. So if her average menstrual cycle is 28 days, ovulation will happen around day 14.  If sex is timed five days before a woman’s ovulation, the probability of her getting pregnant is about 10%. The probability of pregnancy rises steadily until the two days before and including the day of ovulation. The likelihood of conceiving is dramatically increased if intercourse occurs in the three days leading up to and including ovulation.  At the end of a woman’s ‘fertile window’, the probability of pregnancy declines rapidly and by 12-24 hours after she ovulates, a woman is no longer able to get pregnant during that cycle.  Too complicated?  If your partner is not aware of her ‘fertile window’ or when she ovulates, she can find more information here . Otherwise, to cover all bases, sexual intercourse is recommended every 2 to 3 days to help optimise your chance of conceiving. But there’s no limit to how much sex you can have during that 6-day period.  The likelihood of actually becoming pregnant is dramatically increased if you have intercourse in the three days leading up to and including ovulation. If sex is timed well on any of these three days, she has a 27-33% chance of becoming pregnant. Adapted from data by Wilcox, A.J. et al. NEJM (1995) 333:1517 Myth conception The myth: "A woman can get pregnant any time of the month." The truth: The only time a woman can conceive is during the ‘fertile window’ of the menstrual cycle.  The ’fertile window’ in the menstrual cycle is the six days leading up to ovulation, when the egg is released from the ovary. This depends on how long the woman’s menstrual cycles are.  Not all women have the same length of cycle. If, on average, your partner has a period every 28 days the best chance of conceiving is between days 12 and 14 (with ovulation day on day 14). If she has a 24 -day cycle, then focus your efforts between days 7 and 10.
