Study finds only 6% who try will succeed ... and graduates are more likely to kick the habit  By Daniel Bates    Updated: 12:23 EDT, 11 November 2011                    63  View comments     They say that quitting smoking is the hardest thing to do, now new research underlines just how difficult it can be. Just six per cent of people who try to stub out their nicotine habit actually succeed in doing so, the study found. This is despite more than two thirds of people who smoke wanting to quit because they know it is bad for them.       Quit: Those who tried to quit could have doubled or tripled their chances  by using medicine or seeking counselling (pic posed by model) White men and women were more likely to succeed but having a university education and seeking help or taking medication regardless of your race gave you the best shot. The U.S. study found that nearly 69 per cent of adult smokers wanted to quit last year, and more than half tried. But when asked how many actually achieved their goal, the numbers plummeted. Those with a university-level degree were most likely to quit with a success rate of 8.9 per cent. Those who did not stay on in higher education had just a 3.2 per cent success rate.

Six per cent of white men and women by comparison kicked the habit. Amongst all those who tried to stop smoking research showed that they could have doubled or tripled their chances of making it by using medicine or seeking counselling. But most of those who tried to quit last year didn't use either, nor did they receive advice to quit from a doctor. Dr Timothy McAfee, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health told a news briefing that only five years ago, some feared aggressive anti-smoking campaigns merely made smokers more determined to stick to their cigarettes. 'What this study shows is quite the opposite,' he told Foxnews.com. 'It was reassuring to us.' In Britain, smoking has fallen out of favour as it became less socially acceptable and smokers became aware of the risks. About 10 million adults in the UK now smoke: 22 per cent of men and 21 per cent of women. That compares to 82 per cent for men in 1948 and 41 per cent for women, although the figures could have been higher as they only take into account cigarettes and not pipes or other ways people used to smoke. The study was carried out by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

The purpose of this study is to improve the estimate of number of quit attempts prior to quitting successfully. Design We used data from 1277 participants who had made an attempt to quit smoking in the Ontario Tobacco Survey, a longitudinal survey of smokers followed every 6 months for up to 3 years beginning in 2005. We calculated the number of quit attempts prior to quitting successfully under four different sets of assumptions. Our expected best set of assumptions incorporated a life table approach accounting for the declining success rates for subsequent observed quit attempts in the cohort. Results The estimated average number of quit attempts expected before quitting successfully ranged from 6.1 under the assumptions consistent with prior research, 19.6 using a constant rate approach, 29.6 using the method with the expected lowest bias, to 142 using an approach including previous recall history. Conclusions Previous estimates of number of quit attempts required to quit may be underestimating the average number of attempts as these estimates excluded smokers who have greater difficulty quitting and relied on lifetime recall of number of attempts. Understanding that for many smokers it may take 30 or more quit attempts before being successful may assist with clinical expectations. smoking cessation population longitudinal addiction This is an Open Access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Novel use of life table methodology to overcome issues of censoring. Population estimates of cessation derived from a large, longitudinal, population representative study designed to assess smoking cessation every 6 months for up to 3 years. Findings reflect a population average and are not individually predictive. The definition used of a successful quit was cessation to 1 year, but significant likelihood of relapse for some after that point. Introduction Tobacco use is the number one cause of preventable mortality. Five million deaths each year are attributable to smoking, with an estimated rise to as much as 10 million deaths per year by the 2030s. 1 Yet, despite the widespread awareness of the harms of smoking, millions continue to smoke around the world partly due to the difficulty it takes to quit smoking. Mark Twain is reported to have said, ‘Quitting smoking is easy: I've done it thousands of times’. Smoking cessation is a difficult and complex process, and smokers use many methods and approaches to achieve cessation. Knowing how many quit attempts it takes an average smoker to quit is important as it can frame different narratives about the quitting process. This information can be used to inform smoking cessation advice and important messages to stay engaged in the process of quitting. Alternatively, knowing the average number of quit attempts may be a deterrent to continue trying. For this reason, the number of quit attempts it takes before smokers are successful at quitting is a statistic that figures prominently in much of the literature on smoking cessation programmes. For instance, the American Cancer Society suggests that it takes 8–10 quit attempts, 2 while the Australian Cancer Council suggests that it is 12–14 attempts. 3 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests 8–11 attempts before quitting permanently. 4 Many practitioners believe that it takes five to seven attempts. 5 One document on smoking cessation by a maker of smoking cessation medication 6 cites that most smokers quit five to seven times before they succeed, referencing a review article, 7 which refers to a 1995 Epidemiological Review article 8 that only indirectly refers to this statistic. We know that the likelihood of quitting smoking on any given quit attempt is low; 9 however, providing an accurate determination of the number of quit attempts the average smoker takes to succeed is extremely difficult. Current estimates appear to come from recalled lifetime quit attempts among smokers who had successfully quit. For instance, a recent Gallup poll of Americans found that former smokers had made an average of 6.1 quit attempts before quitting successfully. 10 The cross-sectional Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey reported that former smokers had 3.2 prior quit attempts. 11 Similarly, the estimate of 12–14 attempts reported by Zhu et al 12 was derived from cross-sectional data in California. However, the use of cross-sectional data has severe limitations, as it depends on a smoker's ability to remember past quit attempts over a lifetime. The number of recalled quit attempts is significantly lower in cross-sectional assessments compared with longitudinal assessments. 13 These estimates are also biased as they only account for successful quitting among people who are able to quit and do not consider all quit attempts from those whose data were censored—those who have yet to succeed. Consequently, we should expect that the real number of attempts prior to quitting successfully should be substantially higher than these estimates. One study suggests that these estimates are too low. Borland et al used data from the longitudinal International Tobacco Cohort to estimate that the average smoker had made 40 attempts by the age of 40. 13 While Borland’s study does not directly address the question of average number of quit attempts taken before quitting successfully, it demonstrates that smokers attempt to quit at the rate of approximately once per year. If it did take five to seven attempts to quit successfully, at an average of one quit attempt per year, we would expect to see very few smokers over the age of 30 years. If we assume that each quit attempt is an independent event, this allows us to use basic probability to come up with the geometric mean, which is calculated by dividing 1 by the probability of that event. If it does take five to seven attempts on average as suggested, then one must assume that the success rate for each attempt is somewhere between 14% and 20%—a figure that does not consistently align with the literature for long-term success. 4  , 9  , 14  , 15 Thus, we should expect, a priori, that the lifetime number of quit attempts should be substantially higher than the five to seven attempts figure. However, the real number of attempts needed to succeed should be even higher, as the assumption of independence of quit attempts is not realistic. We should expect that the average chance of success will decrease over repeated quit attempts. Those who will have an easier time quitting will succeed on early attempts, whereas those who struggle may repeatedly try and relapse, making the average success rate for early quit attempts higher than subsequent ones. Partos and colleagues found that smokers who had one or more recent failed quit attempts were indeed less likely to quit successfully. 16 It may be possible to improve on the estimate of the number of quit attempts prior to quitting successfully. A standard life table translates cross-sectional age-specific mortality rates into a theoretical cohort lasting from birth to death. 17 The same probability approach could be used to model the change in a hypothetical cohort of quitting smokers where the probability of exit changes by ‘quit age’ (1 for first attempt, 2 for second attempt, and so on). This approach would translate cross-sectional (longitudinally observed but in a cross-section of time) quit attempt-specific success rates into a theoretical cohort lasting from the first to the last quit attempt. The calculation of the chance of success based on the number of previous quit attempts would allow for a calculation of an average of the number of attempts to quit that does not depend on an assumption that quit attempts are independent events. This approach would also allow for the inclusion of unsuccessful quitters into the average that were not included in previous work. The purpose of this paper is to improve on the literature estimating the number of attempts it takes to quit smoking successfully by calculating the number under four different sets of assumptions. Methods Participants We primarily used data from the Ontario Tobacco Survey (OTS), a population-based longitudinal panel survey of smokers (18 years of age and over) in Ontario, Canada. Smokers were followed for up to 3 years at ∼6-month intervals (baseline survey plus 6 follow-ups) with recruitment beginning in 2005. Recruitment was staggered so that the survey interviews were conducted between 2005 and 2011. The smoker response rate was 61%. Participants were selected through random digit dialling stratified by region of Ontario, and characteristics of the sample were consistent with census data from Ontario. 18 Further details of the questionnaire, variables, sampling and recruitment processes are documented online at http://otru.org/research-evaluation/ontario-tobacco-survey/ots-technical-documentation/ . 18 The full sample consisted of 4501 recent (past 6-month smokers) of those 4501 recent smokers and 3960 were current (past month smokers). For this study, to study quit attempt-specific quit rates, only respondents (n=1277) identified as current smokers (past month) at baseline and who self-reported a serious quit attempt at follow-up 1, follow-up 2 or follow-up 3 were included. The eligible participants made a total of 3362 quit attempts. Previous studies of the OTS have examined the predictors associated with making a quit attempt and the individual risk factors associated with successful quitting in this cohort, which include fewer previous quit attempts, higher level of education, belief that it would not be hard to quit and lower perceived addiction. 18 The characteristics of the sample are representative of the characteristics of smokers making a quit attempt in Ontario (see table 1 ). The OTS was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Toronto and the University of Waterloo.

Those without follow-up data were younger (37.6 vs 44.2 years) and more likely to be male than were those who were included in the analysis; however, there was no difference in smoking behaviours (self-perceived addiction, intentions to quit, daily smoking status and number of cigarettes smoked per day) for those with follow-up data compared with those without follow-up data. Of those participants who made an eligible quit attempt, 91 were lost to follow-up before a successful or unsuccessful quit attempt could be ascertained (see table 2 ). Adjusting for time in study, there were no differences in demographics or smoking behaviours comparing with lost to follow-up to other eligible participants.

By serious, we mean that you made a conscious attempt to stay off cigarettes for good’. Quit attempts over follow-up : At each follow-up, respondents were asked, ‘In the past 6 months, how many times did you make a serious attempt to quit smoking? By serious, we mean that you made a conscious attempt to stay off cigarettes for good’. Successful quit : A successful quit was defined as one that lasted for at least 1 year, as assessed by self-reported time since last cigarette. Time since last cigarette was asked at each follow-up by asking participants, ‘Have you smoked a cigarette since we last spoke with you in [Date of Interview]?’ and ‘How long ago was it that you last smoked a cigarette?’ All available follow-up data were used to assess successful quitting until at least 1 year without relapse had occurred. Statistical analysis This study takes four different approaches to estimating the number of quit attempts each with their own sets of limitations. These analyses are descriptive of the data. The first method is a count of the number of attempts; the second is the calculation of the mean based on a simple probability calculation; Methods 3 and 4 rely on a novel use of a life table analysis. Probability of quitting successful for each of the methods, both overall and quit attempt number specific, is based on observational data from the OTS. We calculated the estimate for each method across the overall sample, as well as within subpopulations of smoking frequency at baseline (daily, less than daily). Method 1: Recalled quit attempts, among successful quitters. We identified the mean number of quits of successful quitters (quit for >1 year) as reported by participants who made successful quits in the OTS cohort. We then added the number of recalled quit attempts at baseline to this figure. Formula for Method 1: This method corresponds to the assumptions that have been used previously to calculate the average number of quit attempts before quitting successfully using cross-sectional surveys. We expect theoretically that this method will underestimate the number of quit attempts given the known issues with ability to recall quit attempts, which will be much more severe over a lifetime compared with a 6-month period. 13 This method also censors the results of unsuccessful smokers, making this more precisely stated as an estimate of the number of attempts of those who are successful at quitting smoking. Method 2: Constant rate assumption. In this method, we assumed that the rate of success is constant over individuals and that each individual quit attempt is independent of previous quit attempts. That is, it assumes that the chances of being successful on any one quit attempt do not depend on previous attempts to quit, so we can calculate the number of attempts expected prior to quitting based only on our estimate of success rate per quit. The median and mean attempt numbers are calculated from the geometric distribution—the probability distribution of the number of Bernoulli trials prior to achieving one success, using the formula: where p is the probability of success to derive the mean. The probability of long-term success was based on the percentage of quit attempts that were successful among all quit attempts among attempts observed in the OTS survey (170 successful quits out of 3362 attempts, 5.1%) and for daily and occasional smokers separately (4.9% (n=2930) and 6.0% (n=432), respectively). Theoretically, we expect this calculation to underestimate the number of quit attempts. Quit attempts are unlikely to be independent events as probability of success decreases with multiple quit attempts (see figure 1 ).

The top figure includes only observed quit attempts, while the bottom figure also includes reported quit attempts prior to study entry. Dotted lines represent upper and lower CIs. A life table analysis was used to calculate probabilities (n=1277). Method 3: Variable rate assumption, observed quit success rates. In this method, we assumed that the rate of success per quit attempt was not independent (in contrast with Method 2) but that instead the chance of success varies by previous number of attempts. That is, we recognised that the predicted probability of success is less if we know that they have tried and failed to quit previously. Figure 1 demonstrates that probability of success does decrease with increasing number of attempts. We used only attempts reported during the period of the study in this method. To do this, we first calculated the probability of a successful quit per quit attempt observed. We estimated the probability of success for each quit attempt using a standard life table approach. 17 We used quit attempt number as the unit of ‘age’ in a life table calculation of survival, where the outcome was successful quitting. We observed quit attempt ‘age’, that is, the cumulative attempt number, and coded whether each attempt was successful or unsuccessful. Then, we calculated the following quantities: . n i , the number of people who have not quit successfully (>1 year) at quit attempt i (normally the number of survivors for that age interval); . e i , the number of successful quits that occur at that quit attempt i; . q i , the estimated probability of quitting successfully at quit attempt i (calculated as e i /n i ); . p i , the estimated probability of not quitting successfully at quit attempt i (calculated as p i =1−q i ); and . s i , the estimated probability of not quitting successfully from baseline to the end of the quit attempt i (calculated as p 0 ×p 1 ×p 2 ×…p i ). We adjusted for the influence of right censoring (quit attempts that are not observed as they occur after the period of study observation) using the standard actuarial method by calculating n i : subtracting half the number in the period that was censored after a quit attempt was observed. This calculation provides an estimate of the probability of success by quit attempt number, and cumulative probability of success. The expected average number of quits prior to quitting successfully was then obtained by calculating the area under the curve (equivalent to the restricted mean). 20 We expect that this method will modestly underestimate the number of quit attempts. Ignoring previous quitting history will attribute a greater probability of success to earlier rather than later attempts (many of the first and second attempts observed are likely to be people who are making their third or higher lifetime quit attempt), which will produce an overestimate. We also do not know what the effect on success rates would be of quit attempts made in relatively short succession after a failed attempt, compared to attempts made further apart. Given that earlier probabilities will have a bigger effect on the area under the curve that is used to produce the mean, we expect that the overall bias in this method will be a relatively modest underestimate, and provide the best estimate of the number of quit attempts. Method 4: Life table, with recalled lifetime quit numbers . We repeated the life table analysis as in Method 3; however, for this method, we calculated the probability of success per quit attempt on a lifetime basis, by adding the lifetime recalled quit number at baseline to the observed quit attempts under observation in the survey for each individual. That is, quit attempt i was calculated as the sum of recalled lifetime quit attempt plus the observed quit attempt number. We expect that this method will overestimate the effect. Unlike with Method 3, Method 4 censors the data from successful smokers, estimating, in essence, the average number of quit attempts among those with difficulty in quitting. The method has a similar but opposite issue to that of Method 1, recalled life attempts among successful smokers. Where Method 1 excludes information from people who have not yet quit, underestimating the result, Method 4 does not account for people who have already quit, overestimating the effect. However, the use of lifetime recall quit attempt will underestimate the total number of quit attempts. Results Method 1: Recalled quit attempts, among successful quitters: Among those who successfully quit, the average number of attempts reported during 18 months of observation was 2.0 (SD: 3.15). Among those who did not successfully quit, there were 2.9 attempts (SD: 3.4). Adding all previous lifetime quit attempts reported by each smoker to their total number of observed attempts (4.3, SD: 0.25, attempts at baseline) suggests that the successful quitter reports an average of 6.3 (SD: 1.4) lifetime quit attempts. Successful daily smokers reported a mean of 6.8 (SD: 1.6) lifetime attempts, while successful occasional smokers reported a mean of 4.7 (SD: 0.6) lifetime attempts ( table 3 ). View this table: View inline  View popup  Table 3  Estimate of the number of quit attempts made prior to successfully quitting for 1 year or longer among 1277 smokers in the Ontario Tobacco Survey for four different methods of calculation Method 2: Constant rate assumption : Using the estimated 5.1% success rate per quit attempt found in this population, the geometric mean is then 19.6 quit attempts before quitting successfully. When stratified by frequency of smoking, the expected average number of quit attempts before quitting successfully would be 20.4 quit attempts for daily smokers and 16.7 attempts for occasional smokers ( table 3 ). Method 3: Variable rate assumption, observed quit success rates: Using observed quit attempts, the probability of a successful quit was highest on the initial quit attempt (11% success); the second attempt was much lower at 5% success, while subsequent attempts were even less likely to succeed ( figure 1 ). Using this distribution of quit attempts in the life table analysis, we found that the average number of quit attempts expected in order to succeed was 29.6 (95% CI 27.6 to 31.6) attempts (area under the survival curve, figure 2 ). The calculation when stratified by smoking frequency suggested that the average number of attempts for occasional smokers was much fewer ( table 3 ).

The top figure includes only observed quit attempts, while the bottom figure also includes reported quit attempts prior to study entry. Dotted lines represent upper and lower CIs. A life table analysis was used to calculate survival probabilities (n=1277). Method 4: Life table, with recalled lifetime quit numbers : When the lifetime number of recalled quit attempts were included to the probability of quitting on a given quit attempt, the likelihood for success peaks on the fourth to sixth attempt ( figure 1 ), roughly the average of previously recalled quit attempts among the population of those attempting to quit, with subsequent attempts much less likely to be successful. Using this distribution of probability of quitting per quit attempt using the life table approach, the mean number of attempts was 142.0 (95% CI 122.8 to 161.2); daily smokers had a mean of 142.3 (95% CI 122.8 to 161.9), while occasional smokers had a mean of 21.0 (95% CI 18.3 to 23.7; table 3 ). Discussion The average number of quit attempts is likely significantly higher than what is generally communicated to smokers. Under what we consider to be the best set of assumptions (Method 3: Life Table, Observed Quit Rates), this study suggests that a current smoker tries to quit on average 30 times or more before successfully quitting for 1 year or longer. The life table approach within this population-representative longitudinal cohort overcomes some of the challenges of estimating the number of quit attempts it takes a smoker to quit for good. Previous estimates of how many quit attempts it takes to quit used populations of former smokers exclusively; these estimates are significantly biased by difficulty in recalling past quit attempts, and by not accounting for the large number of people who try to quit but who are never successful. 9  , 11  , 12 We selected Method 3: Life Table, Observed Quit Rates as the best set of assumptions as it accounts for the biases (lifetime recall, independence assumption, exclusion of unsuccessful quitters) that affect Method 1 (Recalled Attempts Among Successful Quitters) and Method 2 (Constant Rate Assumption), and consequently provides a better estimate of the average number of attempts prior to quitting successfully than those two methods. Arguably, Method 4: Life Table, Recalled Lifetime Quit numbers improves upon Method 3 as it uses a distribution of success per quit attempt that may be more realistic. That is, Method 4 demonstrates that, as expected, the highest success rates are not on the first lifetime quit attempt, but rather peak after a number of quit attempts, before declining. However, the downside of Method 4 is that it is likely underestimating the quit success rates, particularly for the early attempts as we were unable to measure the quit success of people who quit prior to study entry and who conceivably were people who found quitting easier. The implication is that the 30-attempt estimate is likely still underestimating the true average number of attempts, but the true estimate is likely lower than that obtained for Method 4. The estimate of 30 attempts is consistent with the estimate of quitting behaviour from Borland et al 13 who found an annual rate of quit attempts of ∼1 per year. Given that most smokers begin smoking as adolescents, at an average of one quit per year, if, on average it takes 30 attempts to quit, we would expect the average smoker to quit in their late 40s or early 50s—consistent with clinical observations. It is important to note that this is a descriptive estimate, and not a normative one. This has two implications. The first is that it is important to consider the results as an average of a population, rather than any one individual experience. Despite a high number of quit attempts needed to quit was found on average in this study, many individual smokers are able to quit successfully on relatively few attempts. 21 Ashley et al 22 suggested that between 40% and 52% of former smokers quit the first time they make a serious attempt to do so. This is consistent with the assumption that quit attempts are not independent—those who have difficulty quitting will need to make many more quit attempts to succeed than those who have less difficulty. While many people may be able to quit smoking on the first few attempts, others may not be able to quit after hundreds of attempts. Efforts can also be taken by individuals to improve their chances of success, such as using quit aids, or receiving counselling. The second implication of this is, as a descriptive statistic, the estimates here in this study describe the experience of this population, given the population distribution of these factors at the time. To compare the estimate of average number of quit attempts from one jurisdiction or time period to another may theoretically require standardisation of these factors to the Ontario population at this time. While there are many factors that affect the ability to quit smoking, these estimates can be considered accurate for this population. The correspondence between the estimate found in this study (6.1) to those prior estimates that were made under the similar sets of assumptions (ie, five to seven attempts) 21 suggest that there are minimal systematic differences in quitting behaviour or recall in this cohort compared to other surveys on which previous estimates were based. Thus, the differences in the estimates can be attributed primarily to the different methods rather than the uniqueness of the Ontario, Canada population of smokers. Limitations This study defined quit attempt as a ‘serious quit attempt’ as self-perceived by the smoker. Other definitions of quit attempts that require smokers to be abstinent for a certain amount of time (such as 24 hours or 1 week) add significant bias by excluding those smokers who are least likely to quit and have the most difficulty maintaining abstinence. 23 While some quit attempts may indeed be more serious than others, the amount of effort for each of these attempt was reported as attempt to quit for good, which is the more relevant factor than the amount of time abstinent prior to the quit attempt. 24 On the other hand, it is possible that ‘rapid fire’ quit attempts may be less likely to succeed than those spaced further apart. 16 Finally, while recall of quit attempts over a 6-month period is more accurate than recall of lifetime quit attempts, it is likely that some quit attempts were incorrectly recalled within this period. Quit success was assessed at 1 year. While many smokers can maintain abstinence after 1 year of successful quit, over 37.1% of those may subsequently relapse. 25 No biochemical verification of abstinence was used; however, a review by the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) Subcommittee on Biochemical Verification 26 concluded that biochemical validation is not always necessary in smoking cessation studies, because the levels of misrepresentation are generally low (0–8.8%). These limitations of the definition of these factors suggest that the quit success per attempt is likely overestimated in this study, which would further increase the estimate of average of number of quit attempts prior to quitting. The average number of quit attempts prior to a successful quit is a number that is inherently difficult to capture with full certainty; nevertheless, this study improves upon the estimation of the average number of quit attempts. Most accepted previous estimates have relied on recalled data from cross-sectional studies, and have not addressed the issues of censored data from smokers who have not yet or will not ever quit. The life table methodology with the use of longitudinal survey data addresses some of these previous limitations to provide a more realistic estimate of the experience of smokers. Implications Knowing that many smokers try and fail on multiple attempts leads to three potential implications. The first suggests that we need to recognise that quit attempts occur frequently, and that further increasing the frequency of these attempts and the rate of success on these attempts may be required to reduce smoking prevalence in a population. For any given quit attempt to be successful, many more resources may be needed, particularly evidence-based resources such as pharmaceutical aids and counselling. 27 Environmental changes that encourage quitting, such as price increases and smoke-free laws, with little or no marginal cost per quit attempt should be seen as important in cost-effective smoking cessation systems. 28 More research is needed to understand how best to communicate to smokers about the number of quit attempts prior to successful quitting. Our study does demonstrate that it takes many more quit attempts to succeed than previously estimated. It is possible that being realistic about the chances of success and the length of time it may take to become a successful quitter may help facilitate a positive, long-term relationship with healthcare providers. Smoking is a chronic condition, and an appropriate estimation may help avoid treating quit attempts as discrete, acute events. On the other hand, communicating the specific number to patients may not be helpful. It may be that some smokers may be discouraged by hearing how difficult it can be to quit smoking. Further research to help customise risk messaging and supportive interventions is required for those who have a number of previously failed attempts to quit and for new smokers just beginning their journey to quitting.

Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed, with some relapsing even after a lengthy period of abstinence. Few population-based cohort studies have examined relapse among former smokers. Quantification of the relationship between the duration of abstinence and the likelihood of continued abstinence is important for the evaluation of ongoing public health interventions and the design of smoking-cessation programs. Purpose: We analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline (e.g., 1 to <3 months and 3 to <6 months). Methods: From the 1990 California Tobacco Survey that used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults (baseline interview) from June 1990 through February 1991, a stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March 1992 through July 1992. Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions about the lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and the self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included all 1449 former smokers at baseline interview who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who also provided a valid date at both of the surveys when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” All data were weighted to account for the study design and to ensure that the estimates were representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region. Results: Only about 12% of the former smokers who had quit for less than 1 month at baseline remained continuously abstinent at the follow-up interview. This percentage increased to 25% for those who had quit from 1 to less than 3 months; it increased again to 52% if the duration of quitting was from 3 to less than 6 months, but it increased only slightly to 59.2% for those who had quit from 6 to less than 12 months. Overall, the likelihood of remaining continuously abstinent until the follow-up interview was about 90% for former smokers who had quit for 3 months or longer and 95% for those who had quit for 1 year or longer. Conclusions and Implications: We suggest that self-reported cessation for more than 3 months be considered as an intermediate criterion for success both in longitudinal studies and the cross-sectional evaluation of community interventions. If a more stringent criterion is needed, we recommend self-reported cessation for at least 1 year. [J Natl Cancer Inst 1997; 89:572–6] For most smokers, quitting is a difficult process. Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed ( 1 , 2 ) , with some relapse occurring even after a lengthy period of abstinence ( 2 , 3 ) . Currently, in the United States there are several population-based tobacco control programs with goals to encourage successful cessation (1,4–7) . Evaluation of these programs generally relies on estimates of point prevalence-a measure of the percent of the population currently smoking that is based on self-report of current smoking status. Some shortduration former smokers will inevitably relapse, and if public health programs result in more very short duration quit attempts but not more long-term cessation, point prevalence may not be the best evaluation measure. Instead, an estimate that incorporates some measure of successful cessation is needed (1,8,9) . Also, further understanding of duration of abstinence and relapse should aid the design of effective relapse prevention programs and help determine optimal follow-up time. Clinic-based cessation programs have long documented that duration of abstinence is the major predictor of long-term success (1,10,11) . In a review and evaluation of smoking cessation programs, Schwartz ( 12 ) suggested, without presenting supportive evidence, that 1 year was an optimal follow-up period for program evaluation, although a 6-month period was acceptable. The great majority of smokers quit by themselves ( 13 ) , and abstinence rates likely differ from those observed in the clinical setting. Cohen et al. ( 14 ) summarize quitting rates for 10 longitudinal self-help studies but had difficulty defining successful cessation because of the different definitions and lengths of follow-up. Previous studies that have examined the issue of relapse after long intervals of abstinence have relied on nonrepresentative samples or have been fairly small. The Cancer Prevention Study of the 1960s found that among 65 709 male volunteers 30v89 years of age who quit at baseline, 37.3% were smoking again 2 years later ( 15 ) . Among a subset of this sample, aged 50–69 years and abstinent 2–4 years, 5v9 years, and 10 or more years at baseline, current smoking at follow-up was 8.7%, 4.1%, and 2.2%, respectively ( 16 ) . Another longitudinal population study conducted in Michigan in 1980 reported that 40% of recent quitters (<6 months; n = 97) were smoking at followup 2 years later ( 17 ) . In this report, we analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline.  Methods  The 1990 California Tobacco Survey used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults from June 1990 through February 1991. A stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March through July 1992, with the probability of selection much higher for those who reported smoking within 5 years of the baseline interview ( 18 ) . Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions on lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included former smokers at baseline who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who provided a valid date at each survey when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” If the year given was the present or past one, the month needed to be specified as well. Former smokers who reported smoking a year before the baseline interview were asked, “ How many cigarettes were you smoking per day at this time 12 months ago?” No other consumption data for former smokers was collected. We also analyzed the use of other tobacco products (cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, or snuff) at baseline. Respondents who reported ever using one of these products were asked, “ Do you currently use [the product] every day, some days, or not at all?” We called respondents continuously abstinent if they reported a quit date at follow-up that was before the baseline interview date. Current smoking at follow-up was another outcome. Recyclers were defined as former smoker at follow-up, with a quit date after the baseline interview. Baseline duration of abstinence was computed as the elapsed time from the quit date to the interview date. All respondents in the full 1992 longitudinal sample, which included never smokers, long-term former smokers, recent quitters, and current smokers, were assigned a base weight to account for the probability of initial interview and reinterview that differed according to baseline smoking status. Next, a poststratification procedure was applied to ensure that estimates are representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region ( 18 , 19 ) . An ideal procedure would adjust just the sample analyzed to the population of former smokers, but adequate estimates of such population totals are not available.  Data Analysis  Weighted percentages are reported together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on variance estimates from a jackknife procedure ( 19 , 20 ) . Subgroups defined by duration of abstinence at baseline were compared with respect to demographics by use of a special chi-squared procedure ( 21 ) for complex sample designs as implemented in the statistical analysis package, WesVarPC ( 22 ) . Reported cigarette consumption 1 year before the baseline interview was compared for those who had quit for 1 year or less. WesVarPC was also used to perform a logistic regression with demographic variables and duration of abstinence at baseline as the independent variables and continuous abstinence (see above) as the dependent variable. We report adjusted (all demographic variables) odds ratios (ORs) from the logistic regression together with their 95% CIs.  Results  There were 1449 former smokers at baseline who had provided valid information concerning when they quit smoking, which represents 91% of the potential sample. The median intersurvey interval was 20.3 months (range, 14.6–24.7 months). shows the percentage of respondents who were continuously abstinent and who reported current smoking at follow-up grouped according to duration of abstinence at baseline. Only 12% of those who had not smoked for a month or less at baseline were still quit at follow-up, and almost 50% were currently smoking. The remainder were recyclers. Continuous abstinence increased to 25% for those who had abstained for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the percent currently smoking did not decrease. For those quit 3 but less than 6 months at baseline, continuous abstinence more than doubled to 52% and current smoking dropped to 25%. The group that had abstained for 1 but less than 2 years showed another large increase in continuous abstinence to 76% and a drop in current smoking to below 10%. Not until duration of abstinence was 3 but less than 4 years did the rate of continuous abstinence exceed 90%. It should be noted that within each of the above groups, especially those for shorter cessation, relapse is not necessarily homogeneous. For instance, a subgroup that quit for 3 but less than 4 months will have a different rate of continuous abstinence than the subgroup that quit for 4 but less than 6 months.   Fig. 1.

The n shown for the pair of bars for each duration of abstinence interval is for the total number of former smokers at baseline in the interval, including those continuously abstinent, currently smoking, and recyclers. Former smokers at either interview answered “ no” when asked if they smoke now. Former smokers are continuously abstinent if they reported a quit date at follow-up that was before the baseline interview date. Current smokers at follow-up responded “ yes” when asked if they smoked now. Recyclers are former smokers at follow-up who reported a quit date between the two interview dates.

Percent = those who are continuously abstinent or currently smoking. Bars = 95% confidence intervals. Table 1 examines different potential cut points as criteria for successful cessation. Considering that everyone was abstinent at baseline, 87.5% were still abstinent at follow-up, 6.0% were recyclers, and 6.5% reported current smoking at follow-up. Among those who had quit for less than 3 months at baseline, nearly half were currently smoking at follow-up. However, among those who had quit for 3 months or longer at baseline, fewer than 5% were currently smoking at follow-up and over 90% remained abstinent. Of those who had quit for 1 year or longer at baseline, only 2% were currently smoking at follow-up and nearly 95% were continuously abstinent. The percentage of recyclers decreased with greater cut points. To preserve adequate cell sizes for the logistic regression, we compare only two levels of each demographic variable except raceand four categories for duration of abstinence as baseline. Univariate results are presented in Table 2. There is a significant trend to older age with increased duration of abstinence at baseline. Also, whites are more likely and Hispanics are less likely to have been abstinent longer at baseline. Although there was a trend for more light smokers (<15 cigarettes) in the group who had quit for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline compared with those who had quit for less than 3 months, it was not statistically significant. Considering the adjusted ORs from the logistic regression, those subjects 45 years of age and older are 1.8 (95% CI = 1.1–3.1) times more likely to be continuously abstinent at follow-up than those younger than 45 years ( P <.05). The other demographic variables were not independently significant. Even after adjusting for age and the other demographic variables, compared with those who were abstinent for less than 3 months at base- line, those who were abstinent for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline were 6.2 (95% CI = 2.3–17.3) times more likely ( P <.001), those abstinent for 12 but less than 36 months were 18.7 (95% CI = 8.2v42.5) times more likely ( P <.0001), and those abstinent for 36 months or longer were 139.8 (95% CI = 60.6–322.5) times more likely ( P <.0001) to be continuously abstinent at follow-up. Altogether, 6.4% ± 3.4% of former smokers at baseline reported use of other tobacco products every day or some days, but only 2.0% ± 1.5% reported daily use.   Table 1.

Abstinence at follow-up for different quit duration cut points at baseline  Discussion  These results provide quantitative population data to support the conclusions of earlier studies (10,11,14,16) that found that the duration of abstinence is an excellent predictor of continued long-term abstinence (10,11,14,16) . More than 50% of former smokers abstinent for 3 but less than 6 months remained continuously abstinent until follow-up, which represented a substantial increase from those who had quit for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the rate for those who had quit for 6 but less than 12 months was only marginally higher (). Thus, for longitudinal studies, 3 months may be a reasonable follow-up period to assess intermediate success. Also, for evaluation of population interventions using cross-sectional surveys, a criterion of at least 3 months's cessation may prove to be a fairly stable measure of the prevalence of successful former smokers. Another sizable increase in continuous abstinence occurs for smokers who have quit for 1 but less than 2 years. However, the rate of continuous abstinence does not exceed 90% until smokers have been abstinent for 3 but less than 4 years. More important, we were unable to identify a duration of abstinence after which former smokers had no risk of relapse. Thus, no definition of successful cessation can be absolute.   Table 2. View large Download slide Table 2. Demographic characteristics according to duration of abstinence at baseline Table 2. View large Download slide Table 2. Demographic characteristics according to duration of abstinence at baseline Since any cut point chosen will include all former smokers who have abstained at least this long, the “ sensitivity” for predicting continuous abstinence will be high. For instance, using abstinence for a day as the cut point (all of the subjects in the present study), 88% will still be abstinent at follow-up an average of nearly 2 years later (Table 1). If 3 months is the criterion, 92% will remain abstinent. With 3 years as a criterion, 97% will remain abstinent. It is possible that some demographic or other subgroups of former smokers have a different level of risk of relapse than the population in general. For instance, former smokers who maintain their addiction to nicotine by use of other tobacco products may be more likely to remain continuously abstinent from cigarettes than those using no tobacco products. However, since only 2% of ex-smokers reported daily use of other tobacco products, it is unlikely that the results of this study are appreciably influenced. Previous studies ( 23-26 ) have identified demographic, psychosocial, and other factors (including former level of addiction) that are related to future relapse. Multivariate logistic regression in our sample indicated that older quitters are more likely to remain continuously abstinent at follow-up than younger ones, no doubt because they had already been abstinent longer at baseline. However, since the group that had quit for less than 3 months at baseline contains relatively fewer younger smokers than the group that had quit for 3 but less than 12 months, perhaps the criterion for intermediate successful cessation in younger smokers should be longer than the 3 months we generally suggest. Fewer than one in eight former smokers who had abstained for a month or less at baseline were continuously abstinent over the next 2 years (). This low abstinence rate was expected from outcomes documented in clinic studies ( 27 ) . However, these low rates may also reflect social desirability pressures that lead some smokers to misreport their smoking status ( 28 ) , so that our sample of former smokers may actually contain a few current ones. Indeed, the validity of selfreported smoking status has been investigated by comparing self-reports with reports of smoking status by another adult in the household or a significant other ( 29 ) . Discrepancy was particularly likely for very recent (<1 month) self-reported quitters. However, only about 3% of all recent former smokers reported quitting in the last month at both baseline and follow-up. This small fraction could be perennial “ former smokers” or they could be recyclers. The rate of recycling is the highest for smokers who have abstained for less than 3 months, suggesting that some of these smokers are in the midst of one of several attempts to abstain, which may ultimately lead to success. The recycling rate decreases with greater cut points as more and more former smokers achieve long-term abstinence. Previous population studies (1,2,30) have shown that about one third of all smokers make at least one attempt to quit in the course of a year, and that this proportion can approach one half during mass-media antismoking campaigns ( 18 , 31 ) . If tobacco control interventions increase the number of smokers making an attempt or the number of attempts a smoker makes, point prevalence may be an unstable surveillance or evaluation measure. A survey conducted during a period of intense intervention would likely show a lower prevalence and a higher quit ratio (quotient of all smokers who have quit to all ever smokers) than a similar survey conducted before the intervention or 6 to 12 months later, when most of the quitters had relapsed. Counting those who had quit for 3 months or less as smokers would produce a slightly higher prevalence estimate, but such an estimate would likely be more stable and better suited to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of tobacco control efforts. Our results appear to justify those surveys, which oversample those who have smoked within the past 5 years to determine knowledge and attitudes, and to characterize behavior of participants at risk of smoking in the near future (19,30,32) . Moreover, besides issues of recall, these data support the decision to use a 1-year interval before the interview for assessment of recent quitting behavior ( 19 , 32 ) . Some smokers who have abstained for less than 1 year may have recycled through several attempts in the year before they were surveyed again. The high probability of relapse early after an attempt to quit was a major consideration in the design of a telephone counseling cessation program ( 33 ) . Clients are called at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days after quitting. Our study indicates that significant relapse occurs still later, even after withdrawal has been successfully negotiated. Whether it is cost-effective to extend the counseling beyond 1 month- and, if so, the identification of an optimal schedule-will require further research. When asked why they returned to smoking, many longer-term quitters cite a stressful life event ( 26 ) . Cessation programs should be sure to warn quitters against using cigarettes as a coping mechanism and should assist them in identifying and developing alternative coping strategies.

Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed, with some relapsing even after a lengthy period of abstinence. Few population-based cohort studies have examined relapse among former smokers. Quantification of the relationship between the duration of abstinence and the likelihood of continued abstinence is important for the evaluation of ongoing public health interventions and the design of smoking-cessation programs. Purpose: We analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline (e.g., 1 to <3 months and 3 to <6 months). Methods: From the 1990 California Tobacco Survey that used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults (baseline interview) from June 1990 through February 1991, a stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March 1992 through July 1992. Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions about the lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and the self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included all 1449 former smokers at baseline interview who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who also provided a valid date at both of the surveys when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” All data were weighted to account for the study design and to ensure that the estimates were representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region. Results: Only about 12% of the former smokers who had quit for less than 1 month at baseline remained continuously abstinent at the follow-up interview. This percentage increased to 25% for those who had quit from 1 to less than 3 months; it increased again to 52% if the duration of quitting was from 3 to less than 6 months, but it increased only slightly to 59.2% for those who had quit from 6 to less than 12 months. Overall, the likelihood of remaining continuously abstinent until the follow-up interview was about 90% for former smokers who had quit for 3 months or longer and 95% for those who had quit for 1 year or longer. Conclusions and Implications: We suggest that self-reported cessation for more than 3 months be considered as an intermediate criterion for success both in longitudinal studies and the cross-sectional evaluation of community interventions. If a more stringent criterion is needed, we recommend self-reported cessation for at least 1 year. [J Natl Cancer Inst 1997; 89:572–6] For most smokers, quitting is a difficult process. Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed ( 1 , 2 ) , with some relapse occurring even after a lengthy period of abstinence ( 2 , 3 ) . Currently, in the United States there are several population-based tobacco control programs with goals to encourage successful cessation (1,4–7) . Evaluation of these programs generally relies on estimates of point prevalence-a measure of the percent of the population currently smoking that is based on self-report of current smoking status. Some shortduration former smokers will inevitably relapse, and if public health programs result in more very short duration quit attempts but not more long-term cessation, point prevalence may not be the best evaluation measure. Instead, an estimate that incorporates some measure of successful cessation is needed (1,8,9) . Also, further understanding of duration of abstinence and relapse should aid the design of effective relapse prevention programs and help determine optimal follow-up time. Clinic-based cessation programs have long documented that duration of abstinence is the major predictor of long-term success (1,10,11) . In a review and evaluation of smoking cessation programs, Schwartz ( 12 ) suggested, without presenting supportive evidence, that 1 year was an optimal follow-up period for program evaluation, although a 6-month period was acceptable. The great majority of smokers quit by themselves ( 13 ) , and abstinence rates likely differ from those observed in the clinical setting. Cohen et al. ( 14 ) summarize quitting rates for 10 longitudinal self-help studies but had difficulty defining successful cessation because of the different definitions and lengths of follow-up. Previous studies that have examined the issue of relapse after long intervals of abstinence have relied on nonrepresentative samples or have been fairly small. The Cancer Prevention Study of the 1960s found that among 65 709 male volunteers 30v89 years of age who quit at baseline, 37.3% were smoking again 2 years later ( 15 ) . Among a subset of this sample, aged 50–69 years and abstinent 2–4 years, 5v9 years, and 10 or more years at baseline, current smoking at follow-up was 8.7%, 4.1%, and 2.2%, respectively ( 16 ) . Another longitudinal population study conducted in Michigan in 1980 reported that 40% of recent quitters (<6 months; n = 97) were smoking at followup 2 years later ( 17 ) . In this report, we analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline.  Methods  The 1990 California Tobacco Survey used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults from June 1990 through February 1991. A stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March through July 1992, with the probability of selection much higher for those who reported smoking within 5 years of the baseline interview ( 18 ) . Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions on lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included former smokers at baseline who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who provided a valid date at each survey when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” If the year given was the present or past one, the month needed to be specified as well. Former smokers who reported smoking a year before the baseline interview were asked, “ How many cigarettes were you smoking per day at this time 12 months ago?” No other consumption data for former smokers was collected. We also analyzed the use of other tobacco products (cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, or snuff) at baseline. Respondents who reported ever using one of these products were asked, “ Do you currently use [the product] every day, some days, or not at all?” We called respondents continuously abstinent if they reported a quit date at follow-up that was before the baseline interview date. Current smoking at follow-up was another outcome. Recyclers were defined as former smoker at follow-up, with a quit date after the baseline interview. Baseline duration of abstinence was computed as the elapsed time from the quit date to the interview date. All respondents in the full 1992 longitudinal sample, which included never smokers, long-term former smokers, recent quitters, and current smokers, were assigned a base weight to account for the probability of initial interview and reinterview that differed according to baseline smoking status. Next, a poststratification procedure was applied to ensure that estimates are representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region ( 18 , 19 ) . An ideal procedure would adjust just the sample analyzed to the population of former smokers, but adequate estimates of such population totals are not available.  Data Analysis  Weighted percentages are reported together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on variance estimates from a jackknife procedure ( 19 , 20 ) . Subgroups defined by duration of abstinence at baseline were compared with respect to demographics by use of a special chi-squared procedure ( 21 ) for complex sample designs as implemented in the statistical analysis package, WesVarPC ( 22 ) . Reported cigarette consumption 1 year before the baseline interview was compared for those who had quit for 1 year or less. WesVarPC was also used to perform a logistic regression with demographic variables and duration of abstinence at baseline as the independent variables and continuous abstinence (see above) as the dependent variable. We report adjusted (all demographic variables) odds ratios (ORs) from the logistic regression together with their 95% CIs.  Results  There were 1449 former smokers at baseline who had provided valid information concerning when they quit smoking, which represents 91% of the potential sample. The median intersurvey interval was 20.3 months (range, 14.6–24.7 months). shows the percentage of respondents who were continuously abstinent and who reported current smoking at follow-up grouped according to duration of abstinence at baseline. Only 12% of those who had not smoked for a month or less at baseline were still quit at follow-up, and almost 50% were currently smoking. The remainder were recyclers. Continuous abstinence increased to 25% for those who had abstained for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the percent currently smoking did not decrease. For those quit 3 but less than 6 months at baseline, continuous abstinence more than doubled to 52% and current smoking dropped to 25%. The group that had abstained for 1 but less than 2 years showed another large increase in continuous abstinence to 76% and a drop in current smoking to below 10%. Not until duration of abstinence was 3 but less than 4 years did the rate of continuous abstinence exceed 90%. It should be noted that within each of the above groups, especially those for shorter cessation, relapse is not necessarily homogeneous. For instance, a subgroup that quit for 3 but less than 4 months will have a different rate of continuous abstinence than the subgroup that quit for 4 but less than 6 months.   Fig. 1.

The n shown for the pair of bars for each duration of abstinence interval is for the total number of former smokers at baseline in the interval, including those continuously abstinent, currently smoking, and recyclers. Former smokers at either interview answered “ no” when asked if they smoke now.

Percent = those who are continuously abstinent or currently smoking. Bars = 95% confidence intervals. Table 1 examines different potential cut points as criteria for successful cessation. Considering that everyone was abstinent at baseline, 87.5% were still abstinent at follow-up, 6.0% were recyclers, and 6.5% reported current smoking at follow-up. Among those who had quit for less than 3 months at baseline, nearly half were currently smoking at follow-up. However, among those who had quit for 3 months or longer at baseline, fewer than 5% were currently smoking at follow-up and over 90% remained abstinent. Of those who had quit for 1 year or longer at baseline, only 2% were currently smoking at follow-up and nearly 95% were continuously abstinent. The percentage of recyclers decreased with greater cut points. To preserve adequate cell sizes for the logistic regression, we compare only two levels of each demographic variable except raceand four categories for duration of abstinence as baseline. Univariate results are presented in Table 2. There is a significant trend to older age with increased duration of abstinence at baseline. Also, whites are more likely and Hispanics are less likely to have been abstinent longer at baseline. Although there was a trend for more light smokers (<15 cigarettes) in the group who had quit for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline compared with those who had quit for less than 3 months, it was not statistically significant. Considering the adjusted ORs from the logistic regression, those subjects 45 years of age and older are 1.8 (95% CI = 1.1–3.1) times more likely to be continuously abstinent at follow-up than those younger than 45 years ( P <.05). The other demographic variables were not independently significant. Even after adjusting for age and the other demographic variables, compared with those who were abstinent for less than 3 months at base- line, those who were abstinent for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline were 6.2 (95% CI = 2.3–17.3) times more likely ( P <.001), those abstinent for 12 but less than 36 months were 18.7 (95% CI = 8.2v42.5) times more likely ( P <.0001), and those abstinent for 36 months or longer were 139.8 (95% CI = 60.6–322.5) times more likely ( P <.0001) to be continuously abstinent at follow-up. Altogether, 6.4% ± 3.4% of former smokers at baseline reported use of other tobacco products every day or some days, but only 2.0% ± 1.5% reported daily use.   Table 1.

Abstinence at follow-up for different quit duration cut points at baseline  Discussion  These results provide quantitative population data to support the conclusions of earlier studies (10,11,14,16) that found that the duration of abstinence is an excellent predictor of continued long-term abstinence (10,11,14,16) . More than 50% of former smokers abstinent for 3 but less than 6 months remained continuously abstinent until follow-up, which represented a substantial increase from those who had quit for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the rate for those who had quit for 6 but less than 12 months was only marginally higher (). Thus, for longitudinal studies, 3 months may be a reasonable follow-up period to assess intermediate success. Also, for evaluation of population interventions using cross-sectional surveys, a criterion of at least 3 months's cessation may prove to be a fairly stable measure of the prevalence of successful former smokers. Another sizable increase in continuous abstinence occurs for smokers who have quit for 1 but less than 2 years. However, the rate of continuous abstinence does not exceed 90% until smokers have been abstinent for 3 but less than 4 years. More important, we were unable to identify a duration of abstinence after which former smokers had no risk of relapse. Thus, no definition of successful cessation can be absolute.   Table 2. View large Download slide Table 2. Demographic characteristics according to duration of abstinence at baseline Table 2. View large Download slide Table 2. Demographic characteristics according to duration of abstinence at baseline Since any cut point chosen will include all former smokers who have abstained at least this long, the “ sensitivity” for predicting continuous abstinence will be high. For instance, using abstinence for a day as the cut point (all of the subjects in the present study), 88% will still be abstinent at follow-up an average of nearly 2 years later (Table 1). If 3 months is the criterion, 92% will remain abstinent. With 3 years as a criterion, 97% will remain abstinent. It is possible that some demographic or other subgroups of former smokers have a different level of risk of relapse than the population in general. For instance, former smokers who maintain their addiction to nicotine by use of other tobacco products may be more likely to remain continuously abstinent from cigarettes than those using no tobacco products. However, since only 2% of ex-smokers reported daily use of other tobacco products, it is unlikely that the results of this study are appreciably influenced. Previous studies ( 23-26 ) have identified demographic, psychosocial, and other factors (including former level of addiction) that are related to future relapse. Multivariate logistic regression in our sample indicated that older quitters are more likely to remain continuously abstinent at follow-up than younger ones, no doubt because they had already been abstinent longer at baseline. However, since the group that had quit for less than 3 months at baseline contains relatively fewer younger smokers than the group that had quit for 3 but less than 12 months, perhaps the criterion for intermediate successful cessation in younger smokers should be longer than the 3 months we generally suggest. Fewer than one in eight former smokers who had abstained for a month or less at baseline were continuously abstinent over the next 2 years (). This low abstinence rate was expected from outcomes documented in clinic studies ( 27 ) . However, these low rates may also reflect social desirability pressures that lead some smokers to misreport their smoking status ( 28 ) , so that our sample of former smokers may actually contain a few current ones. Indeed, the validity of selfreported smoking status has been investigated by comparing self-reports with reports of smoking status by another adult in the household or a significant other ( 29 ) . Discrepancy was particularly likely for very recent (<1 month) self-reported quitters. However, only about 3% of all recent former smokers reported quitting in the last month at both baseline and follow-up. This small fraction could be perennial “ former smokers” or they could be recyclers. The rate of recycling is the highest for smokers who have abstained for less than 3 months, suggesting that some of these smokers are in the midst of one of several attempts to abstain, which may ultimately lead to success. The recycling rate decreases with greater cut points as more and more former smokers achieve long-term abstinence. Previous population studies (1,2,30) have shown that about one third of all smokers make at least one attempt to quit in the course of a year, and that this proportion can approach one half during mass-media antismoking campaigns ( 18 , 31 ) . If tobacco control interventions increase the number of smokers making an attempt or the number of attempts a smoker makes, point prevalence may be an unstable surveillance or evaluation measure. A survey conducted during a period of intense intervention would likely show a lower prevalence and a higher quit ratio (quotient of all smokers who have quit to all ever smokers) than a similar survey conducted before the intervention or 6 to 12 months later, when most of the quitters had relapsed. Counting those who had quit for 3 months or less as smokers would produce a slightly higher prevalence estimate, but such an estimate would likely be more stable and better suited to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of tobacco control efforts. Our results appear to justify those surveys, which oversample those who have smoked within the past 5 years to determine knowledge and attitudes, and to characterize behavior of participants at risk of smoking in the near future (19,30,32) . Moreover, besides issues of recall, these data support the decision to use a 1-year interval before the interview for assessment of recent quitting behavior ( 19 , 32 ) . Some smokers who have abstained for less than 1 year may have recycled through several attempts in the year before they were surveyed again. The high probability of relapse early after an attempt to quit was a major consideration in the design of a telephone counseling cessation program ( 33 ) . Clients are called at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days after quitting. Our study indicates that significant relapse occurs still later, even after withdrawal has been successfully negotiated. Whether it is cost-effective to extend the counseling beyond 1 month- and, if so, the identification of an optimal schedule-will require further research. When asked why they returned to smoking, many longer-term quitters cite a stressful life event ( 26 ) . Cessation programs should be sure to warn quitters against using cigarettes as a coping mechanism and should assist them in identifying and developing alternative coping strategies.

Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed, with some relapsing even after a lengthy period of abstinence. Few population-based cohort studies have examined relapse among former smokers. Quantification of the relationship between the duration of abstinence and the likelihood of continued abstinence is important for the evaluation of ongoing public health interventions and the design of smoking-cessation programs. Purpose: We analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline (e.g., 1 to <3 months and 3 to <6 months). Methods: From the 1990 California Tobacco Survey that used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults (baseline interview) from June 1990 through February 1991, a stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March 1992 through July 1992. Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions about the lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and the self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included all 1449 former smokers at baseline interview who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who also provided a valid date at both of the surveys when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” All data were weighted to account for the study design and to ensure that the estimates were representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region. Results: Only about 12% of the former smokers who had quit for less than 1 month at baseline remained continuously abstinent at the follow-up interview. This percentage increased to 25% for those who had quit from 1 to less than 3 months; it increased again to 52% if the duration of quitting was from 3 to less than 6 months, but it increased only slightly to 59.2% for those who had quit from 6 to less than 12 months. Overall, the likelihood of remaining continuously abstinent until the follow-up interview was about 90% for former smokers who had quit for 3 months or longer and 95% for those who had quit for 1 year or longer. Conclusions and Implications: We suggest that self-reported cessation for more than 3 months be considered as an intermediate criterion for success both in longitudinal studies and the cross-sectional evaluation of community interventions. If a more stringent criterion is needed, we recommend self-reported cessation for at least 1 year. [J Natl Cancer Inst 1997; 89:572–6] For most smokers, quitting is a difficult process. Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed ( 1 , 2 ) , with some relapse occurring even after a lengthy period of abstinence ( 2 , 3 ) . Currently, in the United States there are several population-based tobacco control programs with goals to encourage successful cessation (1,4–7) . Evaluation of these programs generally relies on estimates of point prevalence-a measure of the percent of the population currently smoking that is based on self-report of current smoking status. Some shortduration former smokers will inevitably relapse, and if public health programs result in more very short duration quit attempts but not more long-term cessation, point prevalence may not be the best evaluation measure. Instead, an estimate that incorporates some measure of successful cessation is needed (1,8,9) . Also, further understanding of duration of abstinence and relapse should aid the design of effective relapse prevention programs and help determine optimal follow-up time. Clinic-based cessation programs have long documented that duration of abstinence is the major predictor of long-term success (1,10,11) . In a review and evaluation of smoking cessation programs, Schwartz ( 12 ) suggested, without presenting supportive evidence, that 1 year was an optimal follow-up period for program evaluation, although a 6-month period was acceptable. The great majority of smokers quit by themselves ( 13 ) , and abstinence rates likely differ from those observed in the clinical setting. Cohen et al. ( 14 ) summarize quitting rates for 10 longitudinal self-help studies but had difficulty defining successful cessation because of the different definitions and lengths of follow-up. Previous studies that have examined the issue of relapse after long intervals of abstinence have relied on nonrepresentative samples or have been fairly small. The Cancer Prevention Study of the 1960s found that among 65 709 male volunteers 30v89 years of age who quit at baseline, 37.3% were smoking again 2 years later ( 15 ) . Among a subset of this sample, aged 50–69 years and abstinent 2–4 years, 5v9 years, and 10 or more years at baseline, current smoking at follow-up was 8.7%, 4.1%, and 2.2%, respectively ( 16 ) . Another longitudinal population study conducted in Michigan in 1980 reported that 40% of recent quitters (<6 months; n = 97) were smoking at followup 2 years later ( 17 ) . In this report, we analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline.  Methods  The 1990 California Tobacco Survey used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults from June 1990 through February 1991. A stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March through July 1992, with the probability of selection much higher for those who reported smoking within 5 years of the baseline interview ( 18 ) . Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions on lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included former smokers at baseline who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who provided a valid date at each survey when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” If the year given was the present or past one, the month needed to be specified as well. Former smokers who reported smoking a year before the baseline interview were asked, “ How many cigarettes were you smoking per day at this time 12 months ago?” No other consumption data for former smokers was collected. We also analyzed the use of other tobacco products (cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, or snuff) at baseline. Respondents who reported ever using one of these products were asked, “ Do you currently use [the product] every day, some days, or not at all?” We called respondents continuously abstinent if they reported a quit date at follow-up that was before the baseline interview date. Current smoking at follow-up was another outcome. Recyclers were defined as former smoker at follow-up, with a quit date after the baseline interview. Baseline duration of abstinence was computed as the elapsed time from the quit date to the interview date. All respondents in the full 1992 longitudinal sample, which included never smokers, long-term former smokers, recent quitters, and current smokers, were assigned a base weight to account for the probability of initial interview and reinterview that differed according to baseline smoking status. Next, a poststratification procedure was applied to ensure that estimates are representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region ( 18 , 19 ) . An ideal procedure would adjust just the sample analyzed to the population of former smokers, but adequate estimates of such population totals are not available.  Data Analysis  Weighted percentages are reported together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on variance estimates from a jackknife procedure ( 19 , 20 ) . Subgroups defined by duration of abstinence at baseline were compared with respect to demographics by use of a special chi-squared procedure ( 21 ) for complex sample designs as implemented in the statistical analysis package, WesVarPC ( 22 ) . Reported cigarette consumption 1 year before the baseline interview was compared for those who had quit for 1 year or less. WesVarPC was also used to perform a logistic regression with demographic variables and duration of abstinence at baseline as the independent variables and continuous abstinence (see above) as the dependent variable. We report adjusted (all demographic variables) odds ratios (ORs) from the logistic regression together with their 95% CIs.  Results  There were 1449 former smokers at baseline who had provided valid information concerning when they quit smoking, which represents 91% of the potential sample. The median intersurvey interval was 20.3 months (range, 14.6–24.7 months). shows the percentage of respondents who were continuously abstinent and who reported current smoking at follow-up grouped according to duration of abstinence at baseline. Only 12% of those who had not smoked for a month or less at baseline were still quit at follow-up, and almost 50% were currently smoking. The remainder were recyclers. Continuous abstinence increased to 25% for those who had abstained for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the percent currently smoking did not decrease. For those quit 3 but less than 6 months at baseline, continuous abstinence more than doubled to 52% and current smoking dropped to 25%. The group that had abstained for 1 but less than 2 years showed another large increase in continuous abstinence to 76% and a drop in current smoking to below 10%. Not until duration of abstinence was 3 but less than 4 years did the rate of continuous abstinence exceed 90%. It should be noted that within each of the above groups, especially those for shorter cessation, relapse is not necessarily homogeneous. For instance, a subgroup that quit for 3 but less than 4 months will have a different rate of continuous abstinence than the subgroup that quit for 4 but less than 6 months.   Fig. 1.

The n shown for the pair of bars for each duration of abstinence interval is for the total number of former smokers at baseline in the interval, including those continuously abstinent, currently smoking, and recyclers. Former smokers at either interview answered “ no” when asked if they smoke now. Former smokers are continuously abstinent if they reported a quit date at follow-up that was before the baseline interview date. Current smokers at follow-up responded “ yes” when asked if they smoked now. Recyclers are former smokers at follow-up who reported a quit date between the two interview dates. Percent = those who are continuously abstinent or currently smoking. Bars = 95% confidence intervals. Fig. 1. View large Download slide Fig. 1. The n shown for the pair of bars for each duration of abstinence interval is for the total number of former smokers at baseline in the interval, including those continuously abstinent, currently smoking, and recyclers. Former smokers at either interview answered “ no” when asked if they smoke now. Former smokers are continuously abstinent if they reported a quit date at follow-up that was before the baseline interview date.

Percent = those who are continuously abstinent or currently smoking. Bars = 95% confidence intervals. Table 1 examines different potential cut points as criteria for successful cessation. Considering that everyone was abstinent at baseline, 87.5% were still abstinent at follow-up, 6.0% were recyclers, and 6.5% reported current smoking at follow-up. Among those who had quit for less than 3 months at baseline, nearly half were currently smoking at follow-up. However, among those who had quit for 3 months or longer at baseline, fewer than 5% were currently smoking at follow-up and over 90% remained abstinent. Of those who had quit for 1 year or longer at baseline, only 2% were currently smoking at follow-up and nearly 95% were continuously abstinent. The percentage of recyclers decreased with greater cut points. To preserve adequate cell sizes for the logistic regression, we compare only two levels of each demographic variable except raceand four categories for duration of abstinence as baseline. Univariate results are presented in Table 2. There is a significant trend to older age with increased duration of abstinence at baseline. Also, whites are more likely and Hispanics are less likely to have been abstinent longer at baseline. Although there was a trend for more light smokers (<15 cigarettes) in the group who had quit for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline compared with those who had quit for less than 3 months, it was not statistically significant. Considering the adjusted ORs from the logistic regression, those subjects 45 years of age and older are 1.8 (95% CI = 1.1–3.1) times more likely to be continuously abstinent at follow-up than those younger than 45 years ( P <.05). The other demographic variables were not independently significant. Even after adjusting for age and the other demographic variables, compared with those who were abstinent for less than 3 months at base- line, those who were abstinent for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline were 6.2 (95% CI = 2.3–17.3) times more likely ( P <.001), those abstinent for 12 but less than 36 months were 18.7 (95% CI = 8.2v42.5) times more likely ( P <.0001), and those abstinent for 36 months or longer were 139.8 (95% CI = 60.6–322.5) times more likely ( P <.0001) to be continuously abstinent at follow-up. Altogether, 6.4% ± 3.4% of former smokers at baseline reported use of other tobacco products every day or some days, but only 2.0% ± 1.5% reported daily use.   Table 1.

Abstinence at follow-up for different quit duration cut points at baseline  Discussion  These results provide quantitative population data to support the conclusions of earlier studies (10,11,14,16) that found that the duration of abstinence is an excellent predictor of continued long-term abstinence (10,11,14,16) . More than 50% of former smokers abstinent for 3 but less than 6 months remained continuously abstinent until follow-up, which represented a substantial increase from those who had quit for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the rate for those who had quit for 6 but less than 12 months was only marginally higher (). Thus, for longitudinal studies, 3 months may be a reasonable follow-up period to assess intermediate success. Also, for evaluation of population interventions using cross-sectional surveys, a criterion of at least 3 months's cessation may prove to be a fairly stable measure of the prevalence of successful former smokers. Another sizable increase in continuous abstinence occurs for smokers who have quit for 1 but less than 2 years. However, the rate of continuous abstinence does not exceed 90% until smokers have been abstinent for 3 but less than 4 years. More important, we were unable to identify a duration of abstinence after which former smokers had no risk of relapse. Thus, no definition of successful cessation can be absolute.   Table 2. View large Download slide Table 2. Demographic characteristics according to duration of abstinence at baseline Table 2. View large Download slide Table 2. Demographic characteristics according to duration of abstinence at baseline Since any cut point chosen will include all former smokers who have abstained at least this long, the “ sensitivity” for predicting continuous abstinence will be high. For instance, using abstinence for a day as the cut point (all of the subjects in the present study), 88% will still be abstinent at follow-up an average of nearly 2 years later (Table 1). If 3 months is the criterion, 92% will remain abstinent. With 3 years as a criterion, 97% will remain abstinent. It is possible that some demographic or other subgroups of former smokers have a different level of risk of relapse than the population in general. For instance, former smokers who maintain their addiction to nicotine by use of other tobacco products may be more likely to remain continuously abstinent from cigarettes than those using no tobacco products. However, since only 2% of ex-smokers reported daily use of other tobacco products, it is unlikely that the results of this study are appreciably influenced. Previous studies ( 23-26 ) have identified demographic, psychosocial, and other factors (including former level of addiction) that are related to future relapse. Multivariate logistic regression in our sample indicated that older quitters are more likely to remain continuously abstinent at follow-up than younger ones, no doubt because they had already been abstinent longer at baseline. However, since the group that had quit for less than 3 months at baseline contains relatively fewer younger smokers than the group that had quit for 3 but less than 12 months, perhaps the criterion for intermediate successful cessation in younger smokers should be longer than the 3 months we generally suggest. Fewer than one in eight former smokers who had abstained for a month or less at baseline were continuously abstinent over the next 2 years (). This low abstinence rate was expected from outcomes documented in clinic studies ( 27 ) . However, these low rates may also reflect social desirability pressures that lead some smokers to misreport their smoking status ( 28 ) , so that our sample of former smokers may actually contain a few current ones. Indeed, the validity of selfreported smoking status has been investigated by comparing self-reports with reports of smoking status by another adult in the household or a significant other ( 29 ) . Discrepancy was particularly likely for very recent (<1 month) self-reported quitters. However, only about 3% of all recent former smokers reported quitting in the last month at both baseline and follow-up. This small fraction could be perennial “ former smokers” or they could be recyclers. The rate of recycling is the highest for smokers who have abstained for less than 3 months, suggesting that some of these smokers are in the midst of one of several attempts to abstain, which may ultimately lead to success. The recycling rate decreases with greater cut points as more and more former smokers achieve long-term abstinence. Previous population studies (1,2,30) have shown that about one third of all smokers make at least one attempt to quit in the course of a year, and that this proportion can approach one half during mass-media antismoking campaigns ( 18 , 31 ) . If tobacco control interventions increase the number of smokers making an attempt or the number of attempts a smoker makes, point prevalence may be an unstable surveillance or evaluation measure. A survey conducted during a period of intense intervention would likely show a lower prevalence and a higher quit ratio (quotient of all smokers who have quit to all ever smokers) than a similar survey conducted before the intervention or 6 to 12 months later, when most of the quitters had relapsed. Counting those who had quit for 3 months or less as smokers would produce a slightly higher prevalence estimate, but such an estimate would likely be more stable and better suited to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of tobacco control efforts. Our results appear to justify those surveys, which oversample those who have smoked within the past 5 years to determine knowledge and attitudes, and to characterize behavior of participants at risk of smoking in the near future (19,30,32) . Moreover, besides issues of recall, these data support the decision to use a 1-year interval before the interview for assessment of recent quitting behavior ( 19 , 32 ) . Some smokers who have abstained for less than 1 year may have recycled through several attempts in the year before they were surveyed again. The high probability of relapse early after an attempt to quit was a major consideration in the design of a telephone counseling cessation program ( 33 ) . Clients are called at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days after quitting. Our study indicates that significant relapse occurs still later, even after withdrawal has been successfully negotiated. Whether it is cost-effective to extend the counseling beyond 1 month- and, if so, the identification of an optimal schedule-will require further research. When asked why they returned to smoking, many longer-term quitters cite a stressful life event ( 26 ) . Cessation programs should be sure to warn quitters against using cigarettes as a coping mechanism and should assist them in identifying and developing alternative coping strategies.

Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed, with some relapsing even after a lengthy period of abstinence. Few population-based cohort studies have examined relapse among former smokers. Quantification of the relationship between the duration of abstinence and the likelihood of continued abstinence is important for the evaluation of ongoing public health interventions and the design of smoking-cessation programs. Purpose: We analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline (e.g., 1 to <3 months and 3 to <6 months). Methods: From the 1990 California Tobacco Survey that used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults (baseline interview) from June 1990 through February 1991, a stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March 1992 through July 1992. Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions about the lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and the self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included all 1449 former smokers at baseline interview who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who also provided a valid date at both of the surveys when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” All data were weighted to account for the study design and to ensure that the estimates were representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region. Results: Only about 12% of the former smokers who had quit for less than 1 month at baseline remained continuously abstinent at the follow-up interview. This percentage increased to 25% for those who had quit from 1 to less than 3 months; it increased again to 52% if the duration of quitting was from 3 to less than 6 months, but it increased only slightly to 59.2% for those who had quit from 6 to less than 12 months. Overall, the likelihood of remaining continuously abstinent until the follow-up interview was about 90% for former smokers who had quit for 3 months or longer and 95% for those who had quit for 1 year or longer. Conclusions and Implications: We suggest that self-reported cessation for more than 3 months be considered as an intermediate criterion for success both in longitudinal studies and the cross-sectional evaluation of community interventions. If a more stringent criterion is needed, we recommend self-reported cessation for at least 1 year. [J Natl Cancer Inst 1997; 89:572–6] For most smokers, quitting is a difficult process. Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed ( 1 , 2 ) , with some relapse occurring even after a lengthy period of abstinence ( 2 , 3 ) . Currently, in the United States there are several population-based tobacco control programs with goals to encourage successful cessation (1,4–7) . Evaluation of these programs generally relies on estimates of point prevalence-a measure of the percent of the population currently smoking that is based on self-report of current smoking status. Some shortduration former smokers will inevitably relapse, and if public health programs result in more very short duration quit attempts but not more long-term cessation, point prevalence may not be the best evaluation measure. Instead, an estimate that incorporates some measure of successful cessation is needed (1,8,9) . Also, further understanding of duration of abstinence and relapse should aid the design of effective relapse prevention programs and help determine optimal follow-up time. Clinic-based cessation programs have long documented that duration of abstinence is the major predictor of long-term success (1,10,11) . In a review and evaluation of smoking cessation programs, Schwartz ( 12 ) suggested, without presenting supportive evidence, that 1 year was an optimal follow-up period for program evaluation, although a 6-month period was acceptable. The great majority of smokers quit by themselves ( 13 ) , and abstinence rates likely differ from those observed in the clinical setting. Cohen et al. ( 14 ) summarize quitting rates for 10 longitudinal self-help studies but had difficulty defining successful cessation because of the different definitions and lengths of follow-up. Previous studies that have examined the issue of relapse after long intervals of abstinence have relied on nonrepresentative samples or have been fairly small. The Cancer Prevention Study of the 1960s found that among 65 709 male volunteers 30v89 years of age who quit at baseline, 37.3% were smoking again 2 years later ( 15 ) . Among a subset of this sample, aged 50–69 years and abstinent 2–4 years, 5v9 years, and 10 or more years at baseline, current smoking at follow-up was 8.7%, 4.1%, and 2.2%, respectively ( 16 ) . Another longitudinal population study conducted in Michigan in 1980 reported that 40% of recent quitters (<6 months; n = 97) were smoking at followup 2 years later ( 17 ) . In this report, we analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline.  Methods  The 1990 California Tobacco Survey used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults from June 1990 through February 1991. A stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March through July 1992, with the probability of selection much higher for those who reported smoking within 5 years of the baseline interview ( 18 ) . Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions on lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included former smokers at baseline who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who provided a valid date at each survey when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” If the year given was the present or past one, the month needed to be specified as well. Former smokers who reported smoking a year before the baseline interview were asked, “ How many cigarettes were you smoking per day at this time 12 months ago?” No other consumption data for former smokers was collected. We also analyzed the use of other tobacco products (cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, or snuff) at baseline. Respondents who reported ever using one of these products were asked, “ Do you currently use [the product] every day, some days, or not at all?” We called respondents continuously abstinent if they reported a quit date at follow-up that was before the baseline interview date. Current smoking at follow-up was another outcome. Recyclers were defined as former smoker at follow-up, with a quit date after the baseline interview. Baseline duration of abstinence was computed as the elapsed time from the quit date to the interview date. All respondents in the full 1992 longitudinal sample, which included never smokers, long-term former smokers, recent quitters, and current smokers, were assigned a base weight to account for the probability of initial interview and reinterview that differed according to baseline smoking status. Next, a poststratification procedure was applied to ensure that estimates are representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region ( 18 , 19 ) . An ideal procedure would adjust just the sample analyzed to the population of former smokers, but adequate estimates of such population totals are not available.  Data Analysis  Weighted percentages are reported together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on variance estimates from a jackknife procedure ( 19 , 20 ) . Subgroups defined by duration of abstinence at baseline were compared with respect to demographics by use of a special chi-squared procedure ( 21 ) for complex sample designs as implemented in the statistical analysis package, WesVarPC ( 22 ) . Reported cigarette consumption 1 year before the baseline interview was compared for those who had quit for 1 year or less. WesVarPC was also used to perform a logistic regression with demographic variables and duration of abstinence at baseline as the independent variables and continuous abstinence (see above) as the dependent variable. We report adjusted (all demographic variables) odds ratios (ORs) from the logistic regression together with their 95% CIs.  Results  There were 1449 former smokers at baseline who had provided valid information concerning when they quit smoking, which represents 91% of the potential sample. The median intersurvey interval was 20.3 months (range, 14.6–24.7 months). shows the percentage of respondents who were continuously abstinent and who reported current smoking at follow-up grouped according to duration of abstinence at baseline. Only 12% of those who had not smoked for a month or less at baseline were still quit at follow-up, and almost 50% were currently smoking. The remainder were recyclers. Continuous abstinence increased to 25% for those who had abstained for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the percent currently smoking did not decrease. For those quit 3 but less than 6 months at baseline, continuous abstinence more than doubled to 52% and current smoking dropped to 25%. The group that had abstained for 1 but less than 2 years showed another large increase in continuous abstinence to 76% and a drop in current smoking to below 10%. Not until duration of abstinence was 3 but less than 4 years did the rate of continuous abstinence exceed 90%. It should be noted that within each of the above groups, especially those for shorter cessation, relapse is not necessarily homogeneous. For instance, a subgroup that quit for 3 but less than 4 months will have a different rate of continuous abstinence than the subgroup that quit for 4 but less than 6 months.   Fig. 1.

Percent = those who are continuously abstinent or currently smoking. Bars = 95% confidence intervals. Table 1 examines different potential cut points as criteria for successful cessation. Considering that everyone was abstinent at baseline, 87.5% were still abstinent at follow-up, 6.0% were recyclers, and 6.5% reported current smoking at follow-up. Among those who had quit for less than 3 months at baseline, nearly half were currently smoking at follow-up. However, among those who had quit for 3 months or longer at baseline, fewer than 5% were currently smoking at follow-up and over 90% remained abstinent. Of those who had quit for 1 year or longer at baseline, only 2% were currently smoking at follow-up and nearly 95% were continuously abstinent. The percentage of recyclers decreased with greater cut points. To preserve adequate cell sizes for the logistic regression, we compare only two levels of each demographic variable except raceand four categories for duration of abstinence as baseline. Univariate results are presented in Table 2. There is a significant trend to older age with increased duration of abstinence at baseline. Also, whites are more likely and Hispanics are less likely to have been abstinent longer at baseline. Although there was a trend for more light smokers (<15 cigarettes) in the group who had quit for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline compared with those who had quit for less than 3 months, it was not statistically significant. Considering the adjusted ORs from the logistic regression, those subjects 45 years of age and older are 1.8 (95% CI = 1.1–3.1) times more likely to be continuously abstinent at follow-up than those younger than 45 years ( P <.05). The other demographic variables were not independently significant. Even after adjusting for age and the other demographic variables, compared with those who were abstinent for less than 3 months at base- line, those who were abstinent for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline were 6.2 (95% CI = 2.3–17.3) times more likely ( P <.001), those abstinent for 12 but less than 36 months were 18.7 (95% CI = 8.2v42.5) times more likely ( P <.0001), and those abstinent for 36 months or longer were 139.8 (95% CI = 60.6–322.5) times more likely ( P <.0001) to be continuously abstinent at follow-up. Altogether, 6.4% ± 3.4% of former smokers at baseline reported use of other tobacco products every day or some days, but only 2.0% ± 1.5% reported daily use.   Table 1.

Abstinence at follow-up for different quit duration cut points at baseline  Discussion  These results provide quantitative population data to support the conclusions of earlier studies (10,11,14,16) that found that the duration of abstinence is an excellent predictor of continued long-term abstinence (10,11,14,16) . More than 50% of former smokers abstinent for 3 but less than 6 months remained continuously abstinent until follow-up, which represented a substantial increase from those who had quit for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the rate for those who had quit for 6 but less than 12 months was only marginally higher (). Thus, for longitudinal studies, 3 months may be a reasonable follow-up period to assess intermediate success. Also, for evaluation of population interventions using cross-sectional surveys, a criterion of at least 3 months's cessation may prove to be a fairly stable measure of the prevalence of successful former smokers. Another sizable increase in continuous abstinence occurs for smokers who have quit for 1 but less than 2 years. However, the rate of continuous abstinence does not exceed 90% until smokers have been abstinent for 3 but less than 4 years. More important, we were unable to identify a duration of abstinence after which former smokers had no risk of relapse. Thus, no definition of successful cessation can be absolute.   Table 2. View large Download slide Table 2. Demographic characteristics according to duration of abstinence at baseline Table 2. View large Download slide Table 2. Demographic characteristics according to duration of abstinence at baseline Since any cut point chosen will include all former smokers who have abstained at least this long, the “ sensitivity” for predicting continuous abstinence will be high. For instance, using abstinence for a day as the cut point (all of the subjects in the present study), 88% will still be abstinent at follow-up an average of nearly 2 years later (Table 1). If 3 months is the criterion, 92% will remain abstinent. With 3 years as a criterion, 97% will remain abstinent. It is possible that some demographic or other subgroups of former smokers have a different level of risk of relapse than the population in general. For instance, former smokers who maintain their addiction to nicotine by use of other tobacco products may be more likely to remain continuously abstinent from cigarettes than those using no tobacco products. However, since only 2% of ex-smokers reported daily use of other tobacco products, it is unlikely that the results of this study are appreciably influenced. Previous studies ( 23-26 ) have identified demographic, psychosocial, and other factors (including former level of addiction) that are related to future relapse. Multivariate logistic regression in our sample indicated that older quitters are more likely to remain continuously abstinent at follow-up than younger ones, no doubt because they had already been abstinent longer at baseline. However, since the group that had quit for less than 3 months at baseline contains relatively fewer younger smokers than the group that had quit for 3 but less than 12 months, perhaps the criterion for intermediate successful cessation in younger smokers should be longer than the 3 months we generally suggest. Fewer than one in eight former smokers who had abstained for a month or less at baseline were continuously abstinent over the next 2 years (). This low abstinence rate was expected from outcomes documented in clinic studies ( 27 ) . However, these low rates may also reflect social desirability pressures that lead some smokers to misreport their smoking status ( 28 ) , so that our sample of former smokers may actually contain a few current ones. Indeed, the validity of selfreported smoking status has been investigated by comparing self-reports with reports of smoking status by another adult in the household or a significant other ( 29 ) . Discrepancy was particularly likely for very recent (<1 month) self-reported quitters. However, only about 3% of all recent former smokers reported quitting in the last month at both baseline and follow-up. This small fraction could be perennial “ former smokers” or they could be recyclers. The rate of recycling is the highest for smokers who have abstained for less than 3 months, suggesting that some of these smokers are in the midst of one of several attempts to abstain, which may ultimately lead to success. The recycling rate decreases with greater cut points as more and more former smokers achieve long-term abstinence. Previous population studies (1,2,30) have shown that about one third of all smokers make at least one attempt to quit in the course of a year, and that this proportion can approach one half during mass-media antismoking campaigns ( 18 , 31 ) . If tobacco control interventions increase the number of smokers making an attempt or the number of attempts a smoker makes, point prevalence may be an unstable surveillance or evaluation measure. A survey conducted during a period of intense intervention would likely show a lower prevalence and a higher quit ratio (quotient of all smokers who have quit to all ever smokers) than a similar survey conducted before the intervention or 6 to 12 months later, when most of the quitters had relapsed. Counting those who had quit for 3 months or less as smokers would produce a slightly higher prevalence estimate, but such an estimate would likely be more stable and better suited to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of tobacco control efforts. Our results appear to justify those surveys, which oversample those who have smoked within the past 5 years to determine knowledge and attitudes, and to characterize behavior of participants at risk of smoking in the near future (19,30,32) . Moreover, besides issues of recall, these data support the decision to use a 1-year interval before the interview for assessment of recent quitting behavior ( 19 , 32 ) . Some smokers who have abstained for less than 1 year may have recycled through several attempts in the year before they were surveyed again. The high probability of relapse early after an attempt to quit was a major consideration in the design of a telephone counseling cessation program ( 33 ) . Clients are called at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days after quitting. Our study indicates that significant relapse occurs still later, even after withdrawal has been successfully negotiated. Whether it is cost-effective to extend the counseling beyond 1 month- and, if so, the identification of an optimal schedule-will require further research. When asked why they returned to smoking, many longer-term quitters cite a stressful life event ( 26 ) . Cessation programs should be sure to warn quitters against using cigarettes as a coping mechanism and should assist them in identifying and developing alternative coping strategies.

Genetics can help determine whether a person is likely to quit smoking on his or her own or need medication to improve the chances of success, according to research published in today’s American Journal of Psychiatry. Researchers say the study moves health care providers a step closer to one day providing more individualized treatment plans to help patients quit smoking.  The study was supported by multiple components of the National Institutes of Health, including the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) , the National Human Genome Research Institute , the National Cancer Institute , and the Clinical and Translational Science Awards program, administered by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences .  “This study builds on our knowledge of genetic vulnerability to nicotine dependence, and will help us tailor smoking cessation strategies accordingly,” said NIDA Director Nora D. Volkow, M.D. “It also highlights the potential value of genetic screening in helping to identify individuals early on and reduce their risk for tobacco addiction and its related negative health consequences.”  Researchers focused on specific variations in a cluster of nicotinic receptor genes, CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4, which prior studies have shown contribute to nicotine dependence and heavy smoking. Using data obtained from a previous study supported by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute , researchers showed that individuals carrying the high-risk form of this gene cluster reported a 2-year delay in the median quit age compared to those with the low-risk genes. This delay was attributable to a pattern of heavier smoking among those with the high risk gene cluster. The researchers then conducted a clinical trial, which confirmed that persons with the high-risk genes were more likely to fail in their quit attempts compared to those with the low-risk genes when treated with placebo. However, medications approved for nicotine cessation (such as nicotine replacement therapies or bupropion) increased the likelihood of abstinence in the high risk groups. Those with the highest risk had a three-fold increase in their odds of being abstinent at the end of active treatment compared to placebo, indicating that these medications may be particularly beneficial for this population.  “We found that the effects of smoking cessation medications depend on a person’s genes,” said first author Li-Shiun Chen, M.D., of the Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis. “If smokers have the risk genes, they don’t quit easily on their own and will benefit greatly from the medications. If smokers don’t have the risk genes, they are likely to quit successfully without the help of medications such as nicotine replacement or bupropion.”  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States. Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke results in more than 440,000 preventable deaths each year — about 1 in 5 U.S. deaths overall. Another 8.6 million live with a serious illness caused by smoking. Despite these well-documented health costs, over 46 million U.S. adults continue to smoke cigarettes.

Canada's cigarette pack addiction warning label reads, "Warning: cigarettes are highly addictive. Studies have shown that tobacco can be harder to quit than heroin or cocaine." There is no U.S. addiction warning label. Nicotine physically alters and desensitizes the brain. It causes eleven different brain regions to grow millions of extra acetylcholine receptors.  Successful quitting is allowing time for re-sensitization, time for reconditioning subconscious nicotine feeding cues, and time to move beyond years of conscious smoking rationalizations and minimizations. Recent studies suggest that most of us became addicted to nicotine far quicker and while smoking far fewer cigarettes than previously believed possible. Two-thirds of all first time youth smokers will become chemically addicted. A June 2005 study (Kandel) found that 86.8% of students smoking nicotine at least once daily were already hooked solid using dependency standards contained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 4th Edition. The law of addiction states "administration of a drug to an addict will cause re-establishment of chemical dependence upon the addictive substance at the old level of use or greater." Yes, just one powerful puff of nicotine and you'll be faced with enduring nicotine detox all over again. We're not that strong. But adherence to just one rule guarantees success to all ... no nicotine just one day at a time, Never Take Another Puff! Nicotine dependency is every bit as real and permanent as alcoholism. Don't play games with yourself. Treating a true addiction as though it were some nasty little habit is a recipe for relapse. There is no such thing as just one puff. It truly is an all or nothing proposition. Quitting smoking nicotine is not impossible. In fact, we have more ex-smokers in the U.S. than current smokers. Whether we eventually learn the power of one puff through the school of hard-quitting-knocks or in lessons such as this, knowledge truly is power. We can either master our dependency or it will continue to master us. While 91.2% of successful quitters quit entirely on their own, the odds of any particular uneducated and unsupported on-your-own attempt succeeding for one full year are roughly 5%. But again, anyone is fully capable of quitting so long as they remain obedient to the law of addiction. Although extremely addictive, like salt, nicotine is simply a chemical with an I.Q. of zero.  It cannot plot, plan, conspire or think and is not some demon dwelling within.  Although we'll never be stronger than nicotine we don't need to be. Our greatest weapon is, and always was, our vastly superior intelligence, but only if put to work. Only in an addict's mind would the chemical depriving them of freedom, and gradually destroying their body, be considered a friend, pal or companion. Cigarettes are not our friend.  Imagine the sickness afflicting a mind willing to trade five thousand sunrises for one chemical. Are you having trouble getting started?  Is your motivation in need of a boost? Visit WhyQuit.com and meet Noni, Bryan, Brandon, Kim or Sean, or watch one of eighteen short determination fueling movie clips.  If you don't have Internet access visit your local library. Fear of success is the biggest obstacle to making a serious attempt.  Your dependency-conditioned mind is likely terrified at the thought that life without smoking won't be worth living, or that you'll leave part of you behind.  But within just two weeks you'll begin to develop a sense of both the gradually emerging beauty that is "you," and a growing feeling that life without nicotine might actually be easier. Visit WhyQuit.com, the source of these quitting tips, and make one complete read of Joel's Library before getting started.  It's a free collection of roughly 90 short quitting articles, each containing a pearl of wisdom. Forget about quitting "forever."  Like attempting the seemingly impossible task of eating an entire elephant, it's the biggest psychological bite imaginable. Instead, work hard at adopting a more manageable "one day at a time" standard for measuring victory. If we insist on seeing success only in terms of quitting forever, on which day will we be entitled to celebrate? Nicotine dependency recovery is a temporary journey of re-adjustment.  It transports us home to the richest sense of mental quiet and deep inner calm that we've known since nicotine assumed command and control over the flow of more than 200 of our body's neurochemicals, including dopamine, adrenaline and serotonin. Nicotine's half-life is two hours.  Unless replenished, the amount of nicotine remaining in your bloodstream will be cut by half every two hours.  When quitting cold turkey, 100% of nicotine and 90% of its metabolites will be out of your system within 72 hours. It's then that neuronal re-sensitization (to your own acetylcholine) can begin in full. Regarding withdrawal symptoms, within reason, it's fairly safe to blame most of what you'll feel during the first three days on quitting. But after that you need to listen to your body and if concerned give your doctor a call.  Don't blame your symptoms on where you're going but on where you've been. See each symptom as a true sign of ongoing healing. Each puff of smoke contained more than 500 different gases and 3,500 different particles. One or more of these 4,000 chemicals may have been masking an underlying hidden health problem such as a thyroid condition (iodine), asthma (bronchiodialiators), or even chronic organic depression (nicotine).  Your cigarette's chemicals may also have been interacting with medications you were taking and an adjustment may be necessary.  Stay alert and if at all concerned contact your physician or pharmacist. Chemical dependency upon smoking nicotine is one of the most intense, repetitive and dependable relationships you've likely ever known.  It has infected almost every aspect of your life.  Be prepared to experience a normal sense of emotional loss when quitting.  Expect to travel through and experience six different emotional phases: (1) denial, (2) anger, (3) bargaining, (4) depression, (5) acceptance, and (6) complacency. According to evidence tables in the June 2000 USDHHS Guideline, a smoker's natural six-month odds of quitting "on-their-own" are roughly 10%. Education, new behavioral skills, and ongoing support can easily more than triple those odds. Talk to your doctor about Zyban or Wellbutrin should you feel the need to slightly diminish early anxieties. Both products contain the same active chemical, bupropion. You may find that your health insurance policy covers Wellbutrin (marketed for depression) but not Zyban (marketed for smoking cessation).  In clinical studies, bupropion performed roughly 15 percentage points above placebo at six months.  Although its use comes with some risks, including a one in a thousand risk of seizure, they pale in comparison to smoking's risks. The pharmaceutical industry has not been entirely candid with smokers regarding their odds of success while using nicotine replacement products (NRT).  A March 2003 study (Hughes) combined and averaged the seven over-the-counter nicotine patch and gum studies. It found that only 7% of study participants were still not smoking at six months. Have you already tried quitting with NRT once? If so, it's important to note that only two studies have focused on repeat or second-time nicotine patch users. A 1993 study (Tonnesen) found that 0% of second-time patch users succeeded in quitting for 6 months and a 1995 study (Gourlay) reported a 1.6% rate. Unlike abrupt nicotine cessation, the odds of success generally decline with subsequent NRT attempts. Little known is the fact that NRT studies measured smoking cessation while all but ignoring nicotine cessation. A November 2003 study (Shiffman) found that up to 7% of those attempting to quit with nicotine gum were still using the gum at six months. It makes you wonder if anyone actually breaks free of nicotine while chewing it. The study also reports that up to 36.6% of all current nicotine gum users are today engaged in persistent long-term use. More recently, a June 2004 study (Mooney) reviewed 73 double blind NRT studies and found that they were not blind as claimed. Nicotine is a psychoactive chemical producing a dopamine/adrenaline high. The study found that 71% of NRT studies assessing blindness failed their own assessment as "subjects accurately judged treatment assignment at a rate significantly above chance." Would you be able to tell if your nicotine gum was nicotine-free? So could they. Unlike clinical studies, all real-world quitting surveys to date (California, Minnesota, Maryland, London, Quebec and the UK) have found that those quitting with nicotine replacement products do not perform better than those quitting without them. A survey published in the September 2002 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association concludes, "NRT appears no longer effective in increasing long-term successful cessation in California smokers." Regarding hypnosis, a 1998 Cochrane Review of nine different hypnosis quit smoking studies concluded that "we have not shown that hypnotherapy has a greater effect on six month quit rates than other interventions or no treatment." A 2002 Cochrane Review of 22 different acupuncture studies concluded that, "there is no clear evidence that acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy or electro-stimulation are effective for smoking cessation." Don't let the above quitting method study findings frustrate you.  Instead use them to gauge just how serious the challenge before you is. In 2002 41.2% of U.S. smokers quit smoking for at least one day. Sadly, only 1 in 20 succeeded in remaining quit for one year. But few had any understanding of the amazing chemical they were up against. Once in the heat of battle, it is normal for your mind to quickly forget many of the reasons that motivated you to quit smoking. Write yourself a loving reminder letter, carry it with you, and read it often. Make it your first line of defense - a motivational tool that you can pull out during moments of challenge. As with achievement in almost all human endeavors, the wind beneath your recovery wings will not be strength or willpower but robust dreams and desires. Keep your dreams vibrant and on center-stage in your mind and no circumstance will deprive you of glory. Each puff of nicotine was our spoon, releasing stored fats into our bloodstream. It allowed us to skip meals without experiencing wild blood-sugar swing symptoms such as an inability to concentrate or hunger related anxieties. Learn to again properly fuel your body by spreading out your normal daily calorie intake more evenly. Do not skip meals. Drink plenty of acidic fruit juice the first three days. Cranberry is excellent and a bottle will cost you about the same as a pack of cigarettes. The acidic juices will not only aid in more quickly removing the alkaloid nicotine but will help stabilize blood sugars. Take care beyond three days as juices can be rather fattening. Regarding weight, you'd need to gain at least 75 extra pounds in order to equal the health risks associated with smoking one pack a day. Eat vegetables and fruits instead of candies, chips and pastries to help avoid weight gain. Engage is some moderate form of regular exercise if at all concerned about weight gain. A substantial increase in overall lung function of up to 30% within just 90 days will aid you in engaging in extended periods of physical activity, in shedding any extra pounds, and in building cardiovascular endurance. Recognize that contrary to popular thinking, smoking nicotine did not relieve stress but only its own absence. Nicotine is an alkaloid. Stress is an acid-producing event capable of quickly neutralizing the body's nicotine reserves. As smokers, we added early withdrawal to every stressful event. You will soon discover an amazing sense of calm during crisis. You cannot quit for others. It must be your gift to you. Quitting for a child, spouse, parent or friend creates a natural sense of deprivation that will ultimately result in relapse. If quitting for another person, how will an addict's junkie mind respond the first time they disappoint us? A positive can-do attitude is important. We are what we think. Take pride in each hour of healing and freedom, and in each challenge overcome.  Celebrate the full and complete victory each reflects. The next few minutes are all that matter and each is entirely do-able. Yes you can! Years of smoking nicotine conditioned us to be extremely impatient, at least when it comes to our addiction. A deprived nicotine addict could inhale a puff of nicotine and have it arrive and release dopamine in their brain within just 8 seconds. Realize the importance of patience to successful recovery. Baby steps, just one hour, challenge and day at a time and then celebrate the new found patience you just demonstrated. Get rid of all cigarettes. Keeping a stash of cigarettes makes as much sense as someone on suicide watch keeping a loaded gun handy just to prove they can. Toying with a 50% chance of depriving yourself of 14 years of life isn't some game. Fully commit to going the distance and seeing what it's like to awaken to an expectation of going your entire day without once wanting to smoke nicotine. Oh, it'll still happen from time to time but such events will become the exception, not the rule. Amazingly, nicotine somehow doubles the rate by which the body depletes caffeine. Your blood-caffeine level will rise by 203% if no intake reduction is made when quitting. Although not a problem for most light to moderate caffeine users, consider a caffeine intake reduction if troubled by anxieties or if experiencing difficulty relaxing or sleeping. You conditioned your mind to expect nicotine when encountering certain locations, times, events, people or emotions. Be prepared for each event to trigger a brief crave episode. Encountering a trigger cannot trigger relapse unless you take a puff. Take heart, most triggers are reconditioned by a single encounter during which the subconscious mind fails to receive the expected result - nicotine. In contrast to conscious thought fixation (the "nice juicy steak" type thinking), no subconsciously triggered crave episode will last longer than three minutes. A recent study found that nicotine cessation causes serious time distortion. Although no crave episode will last longer than three minutes, to a quitter the minutes can feel like hours. Keep a clock handy to maintain honest perspective. The "average" number of crave episodes (each less than three minutes) experienced by the "average" quitter on their most challenging day of recovery is six episodes on day three. That's a total of 18 minutes of challenge on your most challenging day. But what if you're not average? What if you established and must encounter and recondition twice as many nicotine-feeding cues as the average quitter? That's 36 minutes of significant challenge. Can you handle 36 minutes of serious anxiety? Absolutely! We all can. Be prepared for a small spike in crave episodes on day seven as you celebrate your first full week of freedom from nicotine. Yes, for most of us smoking was part of every celebration, and also part of every celebration that for one reason or another suddenly turned sour. Also stay alert for subtle differences between crave triggers. For example, the Sunday newspaper is much thicker and may have required three cigarettes to read instead of just one. The average quitter will be experiencing just 1.4 crave episodes per day by day ten. After that you'll soon begin to experience entire days without encountering a single un-reconditioned subconscious crave trigger.  If a later crave episode ever feels far more intense it's likely that it has been some time since your last significant challenge and you've dropped your guard and defenses a bit.  It can feel as though you've been sucker punched.  If so, see the distance between challenges as a wonderful sign of subconscious healing. One coping method is to practice slow deep breathing when experiencing a crave episode. Try briefly clearing your mind of all needless chatter by focusing on your favorite person, place or thing. Another popular three minute crave coping exercise is to say your ABCs while associating each letter with your favorite food, person or place. For example, the letter "A" is for grandma's hot apple pie. "B" is for warm buttered biscuits. I think you'll find that you'll never make it to the challenging letter Q. Another coping technique is to mentally reach out and embrace your crave. A crave cannot cut you, burn you, kill you, or make you bleed. Try being brave just once. In your mind, wrap your arms around the crave's anxiety energy and then watch as it slowly fizzles and dies while in your embrace. Yes, another trigger bites the dust and victory is once again yours! Recognize the fact that everything you did as a smoker you will learn to again comfortably do as an ex-smoker.  Meet, greet and defeat your triggers, don't hide from them. You need not give up anything except nicotine. Be extremely careful with early alcohol use during the first couple of weeks. Using an inhibition diminishing substance and then intentionally surrounding yourself with smoking smokers, while still engaged in early withdrawal, is a recipe for relapse. Get your quitting feet under you first. If you do use alcohol, once ready to challenge your drinking triggers, consider breaking the challenge down into manageable trigger segments. Try drinking at home first without smokers around, go out with smokers but refrain from drinking, or consider spacing your drinks further apart, or drinking water or juice between drinks. Have an escape plan, and a backup, and be fully prepared to use them both. Don't expect family or friends who have never been chemically dependent themselves to have any appreciation of your challenges or the time required to achieve substantial comfort. It simply isn't fair to them or you. Recognize that smoking nicotine cannot solve any crisis. There is absolutely no legitimate excuse for relapse, including an auto accident, financial crisis, divorce, job loss, a terrorist attack, a hurricane, or the eventual inevitable death of those we love most. Unlike a less than three-minute subconscious crave episode, we can consciously fixate on any thought of wanting to smoke for as long as we're able to maintain our concentration.  Don't try to run or hide from thoughts of wanting but instead place the thought under honest light. Flavor?  Are there any taste buds inside your lungs? Treat nicotine dependency recovery as if it were no different than alcoholism. Don't debate with yourself about wanting "a" cigarette. Instead, ask yourself how you'd feel about going back to your old level of consumption or greater. Save the money you usually spend on cigarettes and buy yourself something you really want after a week or a month. Save for a year and treat yourself to a vacation. Quickly climb from that deep smoker's rut by spending time in places where you couldn't smoke, such as movies, libraries and no smoking sections of restaurants, by engaging in activities lasting longer than an hour, and by ever so slightly pushing your normal limits of physical endurance in order to sample the amazing healing within. Tell people around you that you have quit smoking.  Fully commit to your recovery while taking pride in each and every hour and day of freedom from nicotine. Avoid crutches.  A crutch is any form of quitting reliance that you lean upon so heavily in supporting your quit (yes, a noun) that if quickly removed would likely result in relapse. Do not lean heavily upon a quitting buddy who quits at the same time as you, as their odds of successfully quitting for one year are extremely small. Instead ask an ex-smoker for support, call your local Lung Association, Cancer Society or Heart Association office, or visit a free online support forum such as WhyQuit.com's Freedom from Tobacco. Be prepared for an extremely vivid smoking dream as tobacco odors emitted from horizontal healing lungs are swept up bronchial tubes by rapidly healing cilia, and come in contact with a vastly enhanced sense of smell. See it as the wonderful sign of healing it reflects and nothing more. Your quitting means thousands of dollars in lost profits to the tobacco industry. They do not want to lose you. See store tobacco advertising and the hundreds of neatly aligned packs and cartons for what they truly reflect - bait. Behind the pretty colored boxes and among more than 600 flavor additives is  hidden what many dependency experts now consider earth's most captivating chemical. Regardless of how long you've smoked, how old you are, or how badly you've damaged your body, it's never too late to arrest your dependency, become its master, and commence the deepest and most intense period of healing that your body and mind have likely ever known. Study smokers closely.  They are not smoking nicotine to tease you. They do so because they must, in order to replenish a constantly falling blood-serum nicotine level. Most nicotine is smoked while on autopilot.  What cue triggered the public feeding you're now witnessing?  Watch acid-producing events such as stress or alcohol quickly neutralize their body's nicotine reserves. Witness their endless mandatory cycle of replenishment. There is a major distinction between thinking about smoking and wanting to smoke. Don't confuse the two.  After years of smoking you should expect to notice and smell smokers (especially in movies) but it doesn't necessarily mean that you want to smoke. As for thoughts of wanting, with each passing day they'll gradually grow shorter in duration, generally less intense and a bit further apart. What should you call yourself?  Although it's normal to want to consider ourselves non-smokers, there is a major distinction between a never-smoker and an ex-smoker. Only the ex-smoker need protect against relapse. Don't let complacency destroy your healing and glory. The ingredients for relapse are a failing memory of why we quit and of the early challenges, rewriting the law of addiction to exempt or exclude ourselves, and an excuse such stress, celebration, illness, finances, war, death, or even a cigar at the birth of a baby. Remember that there are only two good reasons to take a puff once you quit. You decide you want to go back to your old level of consumption until smoking cripples and then kills you, or, you decide you really enjoy withdrawal and you want to make it last forever.  As long as neither of these options appeals to you - no nicotine just one day at a time ... Never Take Another Puff!  XXX  The above collection of quit smoking tips was compiled by John R.

Most smokers try this strategystopping all at once without the help of medication , nicotine replacement methods, or any formal therapyon their first attempt to give up cigarettes. But only about 3% to 10% are actually able to kick the habit without help. "It is like tightrope-walking without a net," says Thomas Glynn, director of cancer science and trends at the American Cancer Society. "It is natural to want to try to quit independently. Most people think they can handle quitting on their own, but they typically underestimate how powerful nicotine dependence really is." Why is it so hard to quit cold turkey? Most smokers are both physically and psychologically addicted to cigarettes. As a result, when they give up smoking, their bodies experience withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, insomnia, and depression, which can last up to three months. "I Quit My Pack-a-Day Habit Cold Turkey" Peter worried that his social life would suffer Read more More about quitting smoking 97 Reasons to Quit Smoking Alternative Methods for Quitting Smoking: Hypnosis, Acupuncture, Meditation Don't Go It Alone: Quitting Smoking in Support Groups Medication or over-the-counter aids like nicotine patches or gums help to mitigate these effects, and can therefore double or even triple your chance of success. But when you quit cold turkey, there is nothing in your body to serve as a buffer for withdrawal symptoms. This is one reason why smokers who quit abruptly are more likely to fall off the wagon. "The withdrawal symptoms were unbearable," says Evan Rabinowitz, 28, from Brooklyn, N.Y., who has tried to quit cold turkey four times. "I became incredibly agitated and irritable every time I tried to quit." It's important to remember, however, that every smoker is differentand some may find it more manageable to stop smoking without any help. Some think it is easier to deal with acute withdrawal than it is to put up with more mild symptoms for an extended period of time. Others say that weaning themselves off cigarettes with a nicotine patch or gum teases them and they prefer a more black-and-white approach. Experts say chances of success depend on several factors, not just a person's willpower. The extent of your addiction, your daily habits and routines, and the amount of support you get from friends and family can all have a big effect. "It really depends on your personality," says Norman Edelman, MD, chief medical officer at the American Lung Association. "What works for one person doesnt necessarily work for someone else. If you are macho and think you can tough it out, then give it a try. If it doesnt work, try another approach." Next Page: The upshot? It's free! [ pagebreak ] Is there an upside to quitting cold turkey? Flying solo may not be the most successful way to quit, but it does have certain advantages. It takes less time and less work than going to counseling sessions , keeping appointments, and digging deep into the emotional and mental issues behind your smoking habit. The biggest upside for many smokers is that it is free. That was certainly why Rabinowitz decided to give it a try. "One of the primary motivations for quitting has been the financial cost of smoking," he says. "I am not inclined to try expensive cessation aids such as patches or medication." Tips to help you quit If you do decide to quit without any outside help, that doesn't mean you shouldn't at least have a plan. In fact, one of the reasons why unaided attempts fail so often, Glynn says, is because most smokers decide to quit on the spur of the moment or without adequate planning. "Quitting smoking is a process," he adds. "Cold-turkey quits would be much more successful if smokers prepared ahead of time." If you think you may want to try quitting cold turkey, there are some things you can do to boost your chances of success: Have a plan. Decide on a quit day and get rid of any items that remind you of smokinglike lighters and ashtraysahead of time. Inform your friends and family that you are going to quit and ask for their encouragement. Switch it up. Change your routine. If you always smoke when you go out with a certain group of friends, take a break from themor at least from activities related to smokinguntil your withdrawal symptoms subside. Keep your mouth busy. Experts say that keeping your mouth occupiedwith sugarless gum, cinnamon sticks, or even drug-free, imitation cigarettes can help you fight the urge to light up. Drink water. Rather than munching on food to satisfy your nicotine cravings (which can cause the weight gain that often accompanies smoking cessation), sipping water can keep your mouth occupied and will help you feel alert. Try carrying a water bottle around with you to keep yourself hydrated throughout the day. Avoid alcohol and coffee. Stay away from drinks that you may associate with lighting up. "For many smokers, cigarettes and alcohol are interconnected," says Glynn. "You want to break that connection for a while during quitting." Be active . Easing yourself into a light exercise routine can distract you from smoking, motivate you to stay healthy, and help you avoid post-cessation weight gain. Inspire yourself. Make a list of all the reasons why you want to quit and keep it in your pocket. Look at it when you get discouraged. If after all this you still find yourself struggling with cravings but dont want to resort to medication, get some support. Find an online smoking-cessation aid, such as the American Lung Associations Freedom from Smoking program or a local support group , such as Nicotine Anonymous .

Photograph: Yui Mok/PA     Success rates for smokers trying to give up have hit a record high in part thanks to the increasing use of e-cigarettes, figures reveal.  Nearly 20% of those who attempted to quit in the first half of 2017 managed to kick the habit, a University College London report shows.  By contrast, over the past decade the average has been 15.7%. UCL researchers defined successful quitting as not having smoked in the previous 12 months.  The increase in those giving up has been driven by a sharp increase in kicking the habit among the less well off. Success rates among poorer people have historically been low but, for the first time, smokers with manual jobs have practically the same chance of quitting as those in white collar jobs.  E-cigarettes have become the most popular method of quitting nationwide. In many ways, they mimic the experience of smoking a cigarette and are a far more attractive proposition for many people than putting on a nicotine patch. Their usage, combined with local stop smoking services, is the most effective way to give up.  The news comes as Public Health England (PHE) prepare to launch new TV adverts to encourage people to try e-cigarettes if they are struggling to quit regular smoking.  The UCL report gives a number of other reasons to explain why people are enjoying success in quitting smoking.      Ten years after the smoking ban, vaping is a £1bn business           Read more       The added restrictions on smoking in public places and elsewhere discourages the practice, the banning of the use of attractive brand imagery on tobacco packaging has seen sales fall sharply , plus there has been the development of a strong anti-smoking culture in England.  This has helped stop-smoking campaigns such as Stoptober , which runs through October, become so effective. Last year more than half (53%) of all those taking part in Stoptober used an e-cigarette as a quitting aid.  This year the TV ad for the campaign will promote e-cigarettes as an alternative to smoking while the campaign will do more to encourage smokers keen to try e-cigarettes to help them stop smoking.  Not everyone is convinced of the benefits of e-cigarettes though. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has issued new guidance that does not list e-cigarettes as an aid to stopping smoking.  It warns that patients should be told by doctors there is currently little evidence on the benefits or harms of e-cigarettes. They are, indeed, not a universal panacea and experts are keen to stress the challenges that lay ahead.  The deputy chief medical officer, Prof Gina Radford, said: “The battle against smoking is far from over – it is still the country’s biggest killer, causing 79,000 deaths a year. And for every death, another 20 smokers are suffering from a smoking-related disease.  “Far too many people are still dying as a result of smoking but there has never been a better time to quit – the culture has changed, strong legislation is in place and effective support is available.”    Topics     Smoking        E-cigarettes    Health    news         Share on Facebook           Share on Twitter           Share via Email           Share on LinkedIn           Share on Pinterest           Share on Google+           Share on WhatsApp           Share on Messenger               Reuse this content                             Most viewed                            UK    UK politics    Education    Media    Society    Law    Scotland    Wales    Northern Ireland          back to top                 jobs   become a supporter   make a contribution   guardian labs     about us   work for us   contact us   advertise with us     help   terms & conditions   privacy policy   cookie policy   securedrop   complaints & corrections     all topics   all contributors   Facebook   Twitter   subscribe   digital newspaper archive       © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Quitting smoking greatly reduces the risk of developing smoking-related diseases .  Tobacco/nicotine dependence is a condition that often requires repeated treatments, but there are helpful treatments and resources for quitting .  Smokers can and do quit smoking. In fact, today there are more former smokers than current smokers . 1     Nicotine Dependence   Most smokers become addicted to nicotine, a drug that is found naturally in tobacco. 2   More people in the United States are addicted to nicotine than to any other drug. 3 Research suggests that nicotine may be as addictive as heroin, cocaine, or alcohol. 1,2,4   Quitting smoking is hard and may require several attempts. 4,5 People who stop smoking often start again because of withdrawal symptoms, stress, and weight gain. 4,5,6   Nicotine withdrawal symptoms may include: 4,6  Feeling irritable, angry, or anxious  Having trouble thinking  Craving tobacco products  Feeling hungrier than usual        Health Benefits of Quitting    Tobacco smoke contains a deadly mix of more than 7,000 chemicals; hundreds are harmful, and about 70 can cause cancer. 1,4,7 Smoking increases the risk for serious health problems, many diseases, and death. 1,4  People who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk for disease and early death. Although the health benefits are greater for people who stop at earlier ages, there are benefits at any age. 1,4,8,9 You are never too old to quit .     Stopping smoking is associated with the following health benefits: 1,4,8,9    Lowered risk for lung cancer and many other types of cancer.  Reduced risk for heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease (narrowing of the blood vessels outside your heart).  Reduced heart disease risk within 1 to 2 years of quitting.  Reduced respiratory symptoms, such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. While these symptoms may not disappear, they do not continue to progress at the same rate among people who quit compared with those who continue to smoke.  Reduced risk of developing some lung diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also known as COPD, one of the leading causes of death in the United States).  Reduced risk for infertility in women of childbearing age. Women who stop smoking during pregnancy also reduce their risk of having a low birth weight baby.      Smokers’ Attempts to Quit  Among all current U.S. adult cigarette smokers, nearly 7 out of every 10 (68.0%) reported in 2015 that they wanted to quit completely. 10    Since 2002, the number of former smokers has been greater than the number of current smokers.   Percentage of adult daily cigarette smokers who stopped smoking for more than 1 day in 2015 because they were trying to quit: 10    More than 5 out of 10 (55.4%) of all adult smokers  Nearly 7 out of 10 (66.7%) smokers aged 18–24 years  Nearly 6 out of 10 (59.8%) smokers aged 25–44 years  More than 4 out of 10 (49.6%) smokers aged 45–64 years  About 4 out of 10 (47.2%) smokers aged 65 years or older   Percentage of high school cigarette smokers who tried to stop smoking in the past 12 months: 11    More than 4 out of 10 (45.5%) of all high school students who smoke      Ways to Quit Smoking  Most former smokers quit without using one of the treatments that scientific research has shown can work. 10 However, the following treatments are proven to be effective for smokers who want help to quit:   Brief help by a doctor (such as when a doctor takes 10 minutes or less to give a patient advice and assistance about quitting) 6   Individual, group, or telephone counseling 6   Behavioral therapies (such as training in problem solving) 6   Treatments with more person-to-person contact and more intensity (such as more or longer counseling sessions) 6   Programs to deliver treatments using mobile phones 12    Medications for quitting that have been found to be effective include the following:   Nicotine replacement products 6  Over-the-counter (nicotine patch [which is also available by prescription], gum, lozenge)  Prescription (nicotine patch, inhaler, nasal spray)    Prescription non-nicotine medications: bupropion SR (Zyban ® ), 6 varenicline tartrate (Chantix ® ) 6,13    Counseling and medication are both effective for treating tobacco dependence, and using them together is more effective than using either one alone. 6    More information is needed about quitting for people who smoke cigarettes and also use other types of tobacco. 1       Helpful Resources  Quitline Services  Call 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669) if you want help quitting .

Study finds only 6% who try will succeed ... and graduates are more likely to kick the habit  By Daniel Bates    Updated: 12:23 EDT, 11 November 2011                    63  View comments     They say that quitting smoking is the hardest thing to do, now new research underlines just how difficult it can be. Just six per cent of people who try to stub out their nicotine habit actually succeed in doing so, the study found. This is despite more than two thirds of people who smoke wanting to quit because they know it is bad for them.       Quit: Those who tried to quit could have doubled or tripled their chances  by using medicine or seeking counselling (pic posed by model) White men and women were more likely to succeed but having a university education and seeking help or taking medication regardless of your race gave you the best shot. The U.S. study found that nearly 69 per cent of adult smokers wanted to quit last year, and more than half tried. But when asked how many actually achieved their goal, the numbers plummeted. Those with a university-level degree were most likely to quit with a success rate of 8.9 per cent. Those who did not stay on in higher education had just a 3.2 per cent success rate.

Six per cent of white men and women by comparison kicked the habit. Amongst all those who tried to stop smoking research showed that they could have doubled or tripled their chances of making it by using medicine or seeking counselling. But most of those who tried to quit last year didn't use either, nor did they receive advice to quit from a doctor. Dr Timothy McAfee, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health told a news briefing that only five years ago, some feared aggressive anti-smoking campaigns merely made smokers more determined to stick to their cigarettes. 'What this study shows is quite the opposite,' he told Foxnews.com. 'It was reassuring to us.' In Britain, smoking has fallen out of favour as it became less socially acceptable and smokers became aware of the risks. About 10 million adults in the UK now smoke: 22 per cent of men and 21 per cent of women. That compares to 82 per cent for men in 1948 and 41 per cent for women, although the figures could have been higher as they only take into account cigarettes and not pipes or other ways people used to smoke. The study was carried out by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

The purpose of this study is to improve the estimate of number of quit attempts prior to quitting successfully. Design We used data from 1277 participants who had made an attempt to quit smoking in the Ontario Tobacco Survey, a longitudinal survey of smokers followed every 6 months for up to 3 years beginning in 2005. We calculated the number of quit attempts prior to quitting successfully under four different sets of assumptions. Our expected best set of assumptions incorporated a life table approach accounting for the declining success rates for subsequent observed quit attempts in the cohort. Results The estimated average number of quit attempts expected before quitting successfully ranged from 6.1 under the assumptions consistent with prior research, 19.6 using a constant rate approach, 29.6 using the method with the expected lowest bias, to 142 using an approach including previous recall history. Conclusions Previous estimates of number of quit attempts required to quit may be underestimating the average number of attempts as these estimates excluded smokers who have greater difficulty quitting and relied on lifetime recall of number of attempts. Understanding that for many smokers it may take 30 or more quit attempts before being successful may assist with clinical expectations. smoking cessation population longitudinal addiction This is an Open Access article distributed in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits others to distribute, remix, adapt, build upon this work non-commercially, and license their derivative works on different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

Novel use of life table methodology to overcome issues of censoring. Population estimates of cessation derived from a large, longitudinal, population representative study designed to assess smoking cessation every 6 months for up to 3 years. Findings reflect a population average and are not individually predictive. The definition used of a successful quit was cessation to 1 year, but significant likelihood of relapse for some after that point. Introduction Tobacco use is the number one cause of preventable mortality. Five million deaths each year are attributable to smoking, with an estimated rise to as much as 10 million deaths per year by the 2030s. 1 Yet, despite the widespread awareness of the harms of smoking, millions continue to smoke around the world partly due to the difficulty it takes to quit smoking. Mark Twain is reported to have said, ‘Quitting smoking is easy: I've done it thousands of times’. Smoking cessation is a difficult and complex process, and smokers use many methods and approaches to achieve cessation. Knowing how many quit attempts it takes an average smoker to quit is important as it can frame different narratives about the quitting process. This information can be used to inform smoking cessation advice and important messages to stay engaged in the process of quitting. Alternatively, knowing the average number of quit attempts may be a deterrent to continue trying. For this reason, the number of quit attempts it takes before smokers are successful at quitting is a statistic that figures prominently in much of the literature on smoking cessation programmes. For instance, the American Cancer Society suggests that it takes 8–10 quit attempts, 2 while the Australian Cancer Council suggests that it is 12–14 attempts. 3 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests 8–11 attempts before quitting permanently. 4 Many practitioners believe that it takes five to seven attempts. 5 One document on smoking cessation by a maker of smoking cessation medication 6 cites that most smokers quit five to seven times before they succeed, referencing a review article, 7 which refers to a 1995 Epidemiological Review article 8 that only indirectly refers to this statistic. We know that the likelihood of quitting smoking on any given quit attempt is low; 9 however, providing an accurate determination of the number of quit attempts the average smoker takes to succeed is extremely difficult. Current estimates appear to come from recalled lifetime quit attempts among smokers who had successfully quit. For instance, a recent Gallup poll of Americans found that former smokers had made an average of 6.1 quit attempts before quitting successfully. 10 The cross-sectional Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey reported that former smokers had 3.2 prior quit attempts. 11 Similarly, the estimate of 12–14 attempts reported by Zhu et al 12 was derived from cross-sectional data in California. However, the use of cross-sectional data has severe limitations, as it depends on a smoker's ability to remember past quit attempts over a lifetime. The number of recalled quit attempts is significantly lower in cross-sectional assessments compared with longitudinal assessments. 13 These estimates are also biased as they only account for successful quitting among people who are able to quit and do not consider all quit attempts from those whose data were censored—those who have yet to succeed. Consequently, we should expect that the real number of attempts prior to quitting successfully should be substantially higher than these estimates. One study suggests that these estimates are too low. Borland et al used data from the longitudinal International Tobacco Cohort to estimate that the average smoker had made 40 attempts by the age of 40. 13 While Borland’s study does not directly address the question of average number of quit attempts taken before quitting successfully, it demonstrates that smokers attempt to quit at the rate of approximately once per year. If it did take five to seven attempts to quit successfully, at an average of one quit attempt per year, we would expect to see very few smokers over the age of 30 years. If we assume that each quit attempt is an independent event, this allows us to use basic probability to come up with the geometric mean, which is calculated by dividing 1 by the probability of that event. If it does take five to seven attempts on average as suggested, then one must assume that the success rate for each attempt is somewhere between 14% and 20%—a figure that does not consistently align with the literature for long-term success. 4  , 9  , 14  , 15 Thus, we should expect, a priori, that the lifetime number of quit attempts should be substantially higher than the five to seven attempts figure. However, the real number of attempts needed to succeed should be even higher, as the assumption of independence of quit attempts is not realistic. We should expect that the average chance of success will decrease over repeated quit attempts. Those who will have an easier time quitting will succeed on early attempts, whereas those who struggle may repeatedly try and relapse, making the average success rate for early quit attempts higher than subsequent ones. Partos and colleagues found that smokers who had one or more recent failed quit attempts were indeed less likely to quit successfully. 16 It may be possible to improve on the estimate of the number of quit attempts prior to quitting successfully. A standard life table translates cross-sectional age-specific mortality rates into a theoretical cohort lasting from birth to death. 17 The same probability approach could be used to model the change in a hypothetical cohort of quitting smokers where the probability of exit changes by ‘quit age’ (1 for first attempt, 2 for second attempt, and so on). This approach would translate cross-sectional (longitudinally observed but in a cross-section of time) quit attempt-specific success rates into a theoretical cohort lasting from the first to the last quit attempt. The calculation of the chance of success based on the number of previous quit attempts would allow for a calculation of an average of the number of attempts to quit that does not depend on an assumption that quit attempts are independent events. This approach would also allow for the inclusion of unsuccessful quitters into the average that were not included in previous work. The purpose of this paper is to improve on the literature estimating the number of attempts it takes to quit smoking successfully by calculating the number under four different sets of assumptions. Methods Participants We primarily used data from the Ontario Tobacco Survey (OTS), a population-based longitudinal panel survey of smokers (18 years of age and over) in Ontario, Canada. Smokers were followed for up to 3 years at ∼6-month intervals (baseline survey plus 6 follow-ups) with recruitment beginning in 2005. Recruitment was staggered so that the survey interviews were conducted between 2005 and 2011. The smoker response rate was 61%. Participants were selected through random digit dialling stratified by region of Ontario, and characteristics of the sample were consistent with census data from Ontario. 18 Further details of the questionnaire, variables, sampling and recruitment processes are documented online at http://otru.org/research-evaluation/ontario-tobacco-survey/ots-technical-documentation/ . 18 The full sample consisted of 4501 recent (past 6-month smokers) of those 4501 recent smokers and 3960 were current (past month smokers). For this study, to study quit attempt-specific quit rates, only respondents (n=1277) identified as current smokers (past month) at baseline and who self-reported a serious quit attempt at follow-up 1, follow-up 2 or follow-up 3 were included. The eligible participants made a total of 3362 quit attempts. Previous studies of the OTS have examined the predictors associated with making a quit attempt and the individual risk factors associated with successful quitting in this cohort, which include fewer previous quit attempts, higher level of education, belief that it would not be hard to quit and lower perceived addiction. 18 The characteristics of the sample are representative of the characteristics of smokers making a quit attempt in Ontario (see table 1 ). The OTS was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Toronto and the University of Waterloo. View this table: View inline  View popup  Table 1  Characteristics of current smokers at baseline in the Ontario Tobacco Survey who had made at least one quit attempt (n=1277) Among eligible participants at baseline, only 400 (10.1%) did not provide follow-up data. Those without follow-up data were younger (37.6 vs 44.2 years) and more likely to be male than were those who were included in the analysis; however, there was no difference in smoking behaviours (self-perceived addiction, intentions to quit, daily smoking status and number of cigarettes smoked per day) for those with follow-up data compared with those without follow-up data. Of those participants who made an eligible quit attempt, 91 were lost to follow-up before a successful or unsuccessful quit attempt could be ascertained (see table 2 ). Adjusting for time in study, there were no differences in demographics or smoking behaviours comparing with lost to follow-up to other eligible participants. View this table: View inline  View popup  Table 2  Number of eligible participants lost to follow-up prior to ascertainment of outcome Measures Lifetime quit attempts at baseline : At baseline, participants were asked, ‘How many times have you EVER made a serious attempt to quit smoking? By serious, we mean that you made a conscious attempt to stay off cigarettes for good’. Quit attempts over follow-up : At each follow-up, respondents were asked, ‘In the past 6 months, how many times did you make a serious attempt to quit smoking? By serious, we mean that you made a conscious attempt to stay off cigarettes for good’. Successful quit : A successful quit was defined as one that lasted for at least 1 year, as assessed by self-reported time since last cigarette. Time since last cigarette was asked at each follow-up by asking participants, ‘Have you smoked a cigarette since we last spoke with you in [Date of Interview]?’ and ‘How long ago was it that you last smoked a cigarette?’ All available follow-up data were used to assess successful quitting until at least 1 year without relapse had occurred. Statistical analysis This study takes four different approaches to estimating the number of quit attempts each with their own sets of limitations. These analyses are descriptive of the data. The first method is a count of the number of attempts; the second is the calculation of the mean based on a simple probability calculation; Methods 3 and 4 rely on a novel use of a life table analysis. Probability of quitting successful for each of the methods, both overall and quit attempt number specific, is based on observational data from the OTS. We calculated the estimate for each method across the overall sample, as well as within subpopulations of smoking frequency at baseline (daily, less than daily). Method 1: Recalled quit attempts, among successful quitters. We identified the mean number of quits of successful quitters (quit for >1 year) as reported by participants who made successful quits in the OTS cohort. We then added the number of recalled quit attempts at baseline to this figure. Formula for Method 1: This method corresponds to the assumptions that have been used previously to calculate the average number of quit attempts before quitting successfully using cross-sectional surveys. We expect theoretically that this method will underestimate the number of quit attempts given the known issues with ability to recall quit attempts, which will be much more severe over a lifetime compared with a 6-month period. 13 This method also censors the results of unsuccessful smokers, making this more precisely stated as an estimate of the number of attempts of those who are successful at quitting smoking. Method 2: Constant rate assumption. In this method, we assumed that the rate of success is constant over individuals and that each individual quit attempt is independent of previous quit attempts. That is, it assumes that the chances of being successful on any one quit attempt do not depend on previous attempts to quit, so we can calculate the number of attempts expected prior to quitting based only on our estimate of success rate per quit. The median and mean attempt numbers are calculated from the geometric distribution—the probability distribution of the number of Bernoulli trials prior to achieving one success, using the formula: where p is the probability of success to derive the mean. The probability of long-term success was based on the percentage of quit attempts that were successful among all quit attempts among attempts observed in the OTS survey (170 successful quits out of 3362 attempts, 5.1%) and for daily and occasional smokers separately (4.9% (n=2930) and 6.0% (n=432), respectively). Theoretically, we expect this calculation to underestimate the number of quit attempts. Quit attempts are unlikely to be independent events as probability of success decreases with multiple quit attempts (see figure 1 ).

The top figure includes only observed quit attempts, while the bottom figure also includes reported quit attempts prior to study entry. Dotted lines represent upper and lower CIs. A life table analysis was used to calculate probabilities (n=1277). Method 3: Variable rate assumption, observed quit success rates. In this method, we assumed that the rate of success per quit attempt was not independent (in contrast with Method 2) but that instead the chance of success varies by previous number of attempts. That is, we recognised that the predicted probability of success is less if we know that they have tried and failed to quit previously. Figure 1 demonstrates that probability of success does decrease with increasing number of attempts. We used only attempts reported during the period of the study in this method. To do this, we first calculated the probability of a successful quit per quit attempt observed. We estimated the probability of success for each quit attempt using a standard life table approach. 17 We used quit attempt number as the unit of ‘age’ in a life table calculation of survival, where the outcome was successful quitting. We observed quit attempt ‘age’, that is, the cumulative attempt number, and coded whether each attempt was successful or unsuccessful. Then, we calculated the following quantities: . n i , the number of people who have not quit successfully (>1 year) at quit attempt i (normally the number of survivors for that age interval); . e i , the number of successful quits that occur at that quit attempt i; . q i , the estimated probability of quitting successfully at quit attempt i (calculated as e i /n i ); . p i , the estimated probability of not quitting successfully at quit attempt i (calculated as p i =1−q i ); and . s i , the estimated probability of not quitting successfully from baseline to the end of the quit attempt i (calculated as p 0 ×p 1 ×p 2 ×…p i ). We adjusted for the influence of right censoring (quit attempts that are not observed as they occur after the period of study observation) using the standard actuarial method by calculating n i : subtracting half the number in the period that was censored after a quit attempt was observed. This calculation provides an estimate of the probability of success by quit attempt number, and cumulative probability of success. The expected average number of quits prior to quitting successfully was then obtained by calculating the area under the curve (equivalent to the restricted mean). 20 We expect that this method will modestly underestimate the number of quit attempts. Ignoring previous quitting history will attribute a greater probability of success to earlier rather than later attempts (many of the first and second attempts observed are likely to be people who are making their third or higher lifetime quit attempt), which will produce an overestimate. We also do not know what the effect on success rates would be of quit attempts made in relatively short succession after a failed attempt, compared to attempts made further apart. Given that earlier probabilities will have a bigger effect on the area under the curve that is used to produce the mean, we expect that the overall bias in this method will be a relatively modest underestimate, and provide the best estimate of the number of quit attempts. Method 4: Life table, with recalled lifetime quit numbers . We repeated the life table analysis as in Method 3; however, for this method, we calculated the probability of success per quit attempt on a lifetime basis, by adding the lifetime recalled quit number at baseline to the observed quit attempts under observation in the survey for each individual. That is, quit attempt i was calculated as the sum of recalled lifetime quit attempt plus the observed quit attempt number. We expect that this method will overestimate the effect. Unlike with Method 3, Method 4 censors the data from successful smokers, estimating, in essence, the average number of quit attempts among those with difficulty in quitting. The method has a similar but opposite issue to that of Method 1, recalled life attempts among successful smokers. Where Method 1 excludes information from people who have not yet quit, underestimating the result, Method 4 does not account for people who have already quit, overestimating the effect. However, the use of lifetime recall quit attempt will underestimate the total number of quit attempts. Results Method 1: Recalled quit attempts, among successful quitters: Among those who successfully quit, the average number of attempts reported during 18 months of observation was 2.0 (SD: 3.15). Among those who did not successfully quit, there were 2.9 attempts (SD: 3.4). Adding all previous lifetime quit attempts reported by each smoker to their total number of observed attempts (4.3, SD: 0.25, attempts at baseline) suggests that the successful quitter reports an average of 6.3 (SD: 1.4) lifetime quit attempts. Successful daily smokers reported a mean of 6.8 (SD: 1.6) lifetime attempts, while successful occasional smokers reported a mean of 4.7 (SD: 0.6) lifetime attempts ( table 3 ). View this table: View inline  View popup  Table 3  Estimate of the number of quit attempts made prior to successfully quitting for 1 year or longer among 1277 smokers in the Ontario Tobacco Survey for four different methods of calculation Method 2: Constant rate assumption : Using the estimated 5.1% success rate per quit attempt found in this population, the geometric mean is then 19.6 quit attempts before quitting successfully. When stratified by frequency of smoking, the expected average number of quit attempts before quitting successfully would be 20.4 quit attempts for daily smokers and 16.7 attempts for occasional smokers ( table 3 ). Method 3: Variable rate assumption, observed quit success rates: Using observed quit attempts, the probability of a successful quit was highest on the initial quit attempt (11% success); the second attempt was much lower at 5% success, while subsequent attempts were even less likely to succeed ( figure 1 ). Using this distribution of quit attempts in the life table analysis, we found that the average number of quit attempts expected in order to succeed was 29.6 (95% CI 27.6 to 31.6) attempts (area under the survival curve, figure 2 ). The calculation when stratified by smoking frequency suggested that the average number of attempts for occasional smokers was much fewer ( table 3 ).

The top figure includes only observed quit attempts, while the bottom figure also includes reported quit attempts prior to study entry. Dotted lines represent upper and lower CIs. A life table analysis was used to calculate survival probabilities (n=1277). Method 4: Life table, with recalled lifetime quit numbers : When the lifetime number of recalled quit attempts were included to the probability of quitting on a given quit attempt, the likelihood for success peaks on the fourth to sixth attempt ( figure 1 ), roughly the average of previously recalled quit attempts among the population of those attempting to quit, with subsequent attempts much less likely to be successful. Using this distribution of probability of quitting per quit attempt using the life table approach, the mean number of attempts was 142.0 (95% CI 122.8 to 161.2); daily smokers had a mean of 142.3 (95% CI 122.8 to 161.9), while occasional smokers had a mean of 21.0 (95% CI 18.3 to 23.7; table 3 ). Discussion The average number of quit attempts is likely significantly higher than what is generally communicated to smokers. Under what we consider to be the best set of assumptions (Method 3: Life Table, Observed Quit Rates), this study suggests that a current smoker tries to quit on average 30 times or more before successfully quitting for 1 year or longer. The life table approach within this population-representative longitudinal cohort overcomes some of the challenges of estimating the number of quit attempts it takes a smoker to quit for good. Previous estimates of how many quit attempts it takes to quit used populations of former smokers exclusively; these estimates are significantly biased by difficulty in recalling past quit attempts, and by not accounting for the large number of people who try to quit but who are never successful. 9  , 11  , 12 We selected Method 3: Life Table, Observed Quit Rates as the best set of assumptions as it accounts for the biases (lifetime recall, independence assumption, exclusion of unsuccessful quitters) that affect Method 1 (Recalled Attempts Among Successful Quitters) and Method 2 (Constant Rate Assumption), and consequently provides a better estimate of the average number of attempts prior to quitting successfully than those two methods. Arguably, Method 4: Life Table, Recalled Lifetime Quit numbers improves upon Method 3 as it uses a distribution of success per quit attempt that may be more realistic. That is, Method 4 demonstrates that, as expected, the highest success rates are not on the first lifetime quit attempt, but rather peak after a number of quit attempts, before declining. However, the downside of Method 4 is that it is likely underestimating the quit success rates, particularly for the early attempts as we were unable to measure the quit success of people who quit prior to study entry and who conceivably were people who found quitting easier. The implication is that the 30-attempt estimate is likely still underestimating the true average number of attempts, but the true estimate is likely lower than that obtained for Method 4. The estimate of 30 attempts is consistent with the estimate of quitting behaviour from Borland et al 13 who found an annual rate of quit attempts of ∼1 per year. Given that most smokers begin smoking as adolescents, at an average of one quit per year, if, on average it takes 30 attempts to quit, we would expect the average smoker to quit in their late 40s or early 50s—consistent with clinical observations. It is important to note that this is a descriptive estimate, and not a normative one. This has two implications. The first is that it is important to consider the results as an average of a population, rather than any one individual experience. Despite a high number of quit attempts needed to quit was found on average in this study, many individual smokers are able to quit successfully on relatively few attempts. 21 Ashley et al 22 suggested that between 40% and 52% of former smokers quit the first time they make a serious attempt to do so. This is consistent with the assumption that quit attempts are not independent—those who have difficulty quitting will need to make many more quit attempts to succeed than those who have less difficulty. While many people may be able to quit smoking on the first few attempts, others may not be able to quit after hundreds of attempts. Efforts can also be taken by individuals to improve their chances of success, such as using quit aids, or receiving counselling. The second implication of this is, as a descriptive statistic, the estimates here in this study describe the experience of this population, given the population distribution of these factors at the time. To compare the estimate of average number of quit attempts from one jurisdiction or time period to another may theoretically require standardisation of these factors to the Ontario population at this time. While there are many factors that affect the ability to quit smoking, these estimates can be considered accurate for this population. The correspondence between the estimate found in this study (6.1) to those prior estimates that were made under the similar sets of assumptions (ie, five to seven attempts) 21 suggest that there are minimal systematic differences in quitting behaviour or recall in this cohort compared to other surveys on which previous estimates were based. Thus, the differences in the estimates can be attributed primarily to the different methods rather than the uniqueness of the Ontario, Canada population of smokers. Limitations This study defined quit attempt as a ‘serious quit attempt’ as self-perceived by the smoker. Other definitions of quit attempts that require smokers to be abstinent for a certain amount of time (such as 24 hours or 1 week) add significant bias by excluding those smokers who are least likely to quit and have the most difficulty maintaining abstinence. 23 While some quit attempts may indeed be more serious than others, the amount of effort for each of these attempt was reported as attempt to quit for good, which is the more relevant factor than the amount of time abstinent prior to the quit attempt. 24 On the other hand, it is possible that ‘rapid fire’ quit attempts may be less likely to succeed than those spaced further apart. 16 Finally, while recall of quit attempts over a 6-month period is more accurate than recall of lifetime quit attempts, it is likely that some quit attempts were incorrectly recalled within this period. Quit success was assessed at 1 year. While many smokers can maintain abstinence after 1 year of successful quit, over 37.1% of those may subsequently relapse. 25 No biochemical verification of abstinence was used; however, a review by the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) Subcommittee on Biochemical Verification 26 concluded that biochemical validation is not always necessary in smoking cessation studies, because the levels of misrepresentation are generally low (0–8.8%). These limitations of the definition of these factors suggest that the quit success per attempt is likely overestimated in this study, which would further increase the estimate of average of number of quit attempts prior to quitting. The average number of quit attempts prior to a successful quit is a number that is inherently difficult to capture with full certainty; nevertheless, this study improves upon the estimation of the average number of quit attempts. Most accepted previous estimates have relied on recalled data from cross-sectional studies, and have not addressed the issues of censored data from smokers who have not yet or will not ever quit. The life table methodology with the use of longitudinal survey data addresses some of these previous limitations to provide a more realistic estimate of the experience of smokers. Implications Knowing that many smokers try and fail on multiple attempts leads to three potential implications. The first suggests that we need to recognise that quit attempts occur frequently, and that further increasing the frequency of these attempts and the rate of success on these attempts may be required to reduce smoking prevalence in a population. For any given quit attempt to be successful, many more resources may be needed, particularly evidence-based resources such as pharmaceutical aids and counselling. 27 Environmental changes that encourage quitting, such as price increases and smoke-free laws, with little or no marginal cost per quit attempt should be seen as important in cost-effective smoking cessation systems. 28 More research is needed to understand how best to communicate to smokers about the number of quit attempts prior to successful quitting. Our study does demonstrate that it takes many more quit attempts to succeed than previously estimated. It is possible that being realistic about the chances of success and the length of time it may take to become a successful quitter may help facilitate a positive, long-term relationship with healthcare providers. Smoking is a chronic condition, and an appropriate estimation may help avoid treating quit attempts as discrete, acute events. On the other hand, communicating the specific number to patients may not be helpful. It may be that some smokers may be discouraged by hearing how difficult it can be to quit smoking. Further research to help customise risk messaging and supportive interventions is required for those who have a number of previously failed attempts to quit and for new smokers just beginning their journey to quitting.

Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed, with some relapsing even after a lengthy period of abstinence. Few population-based cohort studies have examined relapse among former smokers. Quantification of the relationship between the duration of abstinence and the likelihood of continued abstinence is important for the evaluation of ongoing public health interventions and the design of smoking-cessation programs. Purpose: We analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline (e.g., 1 to <3 months and 3 to <6 months). Methods: From the 1990 California Tobacco Survey that used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults (baseline interview) from June 1990 through February 1991, a stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March 1992 through July 1992. Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions about the lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and the self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included all 1449 former smokers at baseline interview who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who also provided a valid date at both of the surveys when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” All data were weighted to account for the study design and to ensure that the estimates were representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region. Results: Only about 12% of the former smokers who had quit for less than 1 month at baseline remained continuously abstinent at the follow-up interview. This percentage increased to 25% for those who had quit from 1 to less than 3 months; it increased again to 52% if the duration of quitting was from 3 to less than 6 months, but it increased only slightly to 59.2% for those who had quit from 6 to less than 12 months. Overall, the likelihood of remaining continuously abstinent until the follow-up interview was about 90% for former smokers who had quit for 3 months or longer and 95% for those who had quit for 1 year or longer. Conclusions and Implications: We suggest that self-reported cessation for more than 3 months be considered as an intermediate criterion for success both in longitudinal studies and the cross-sectional evaluation of community interventions. If a more stringent criterion is needed, we recommend self-reported cessation for at least 1 year. [J Natl Cancer Inst 1997; 89:572–6] For most smokers, quitting is a difficult process. Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed ( 1 , 2 ) , with some relapse occurring even after a lengthy period of abstinence ( 2 , 3 ) . Currently, in the United States there are several population-based tobacco control programs with goals to encourage successful cessation (1,4–7) . Evaluation of these programs generally relies on estimates of point prevalence-a measure of the percent of the population currently smoking that is based on self-report of current smoking status. Some shortduration former smokers will inevitably relapse, and if public health programs result in more very short duration quit attempts but not more long-term cessation, point prevalence may not be the best evaluation measure. Instead, an estimate that incorporates some measure of successful cessation is needed (1,8,9) . Also, further understanding of duration of abstinence and relapse should aid the design of effective relapse prevention programs and help determine optimal follow-up time. Clinic-based cessation programs have long documented that duration of abstinence is the major predictor of long-term success (1,10,11) . In a review and evaluation of smoking cessation programs, Schwartz ( 12 ) suggested, without presenting supportive evidence, that 1 year was an optimal follow-up period for program evaluation, although a 6-month period was acceptable. The great majority of smokers quit by themselves ( 13 ) , and abstinence rates likely differ from those observed in the clinical setting. Cohen et al. ( 14 ) summarize quitting rates for 10 longitudinal self-help studies but had difficulty defining successful cessation because of the different definitions and lengths of follow-up. Previous studies that have examined the issue of relapse after long intervals of abstinence have relied on nonrepresentative samples or have been fairly small. The Cancer Prevention Study of the 1960s found that among 65 709 male volunteers 30v89 years of age who quit at baseline, 37.3% were smoking again 2 years later ( 15 ) . Among a subset of this sample, aged 50–69 years and abstinent 2–4 years, 5v9 years, and 10 or more years at baseline, current smoking at follow-up was 8.7%, 4.1%, and 2.2%, respectively ( 16 ) . Another longitudinal population study conducted in Michigan in 1980 reported that 40% of recent quitters (<6 months; n = 97) were smoking at followup 2 years later ( 17 ) . In this report, we analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline.  Methods  The 1990 California Tobacco Survey used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults from June 1990 through February 1991. A stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March through July 1992, with the probability of selection much higher for those who reported smoking within 5 years of the baseline interview ( 18 ) . Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions on lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included former smokers at baseline who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who provided a valid date at each survey when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” If the year given was the present or past one, the month needed to be specified as well. Former smokers who reported smoking a year before the baseline interview were asked, “ How many cigarettes were you smoking per day at this time 12 months ago?” No other consumption data for former smokers was collected. We also analyzed the use of other tobacco products (cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, or snuff) at baseline. Respondents who reported ever using one of these products were asked, “ Do you currently use [the product] every day, some days, or not at all?” We called respondents continuously abstinent if they reported a quit date at follow-up that was before the baseline interview date. Current smoking at follow-up was another outcome. Recyclers were defined as former smoker at follow-up, with a quit date after the baseline interview. Baseline duration of abstinence was computed as the elapsed time from the quit date to the interview date. All respondents in the full 1992 longitudinal sample, which included never smokers, long-term former smokers, recent quitters, and current smokers, were assigned a base weight to account for the probability of initial interview and reinterview that differed according to baseline smoking status. Next, a poststratification procedure was applied to ensure that estimates are representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region ( 18 , 19 ) . An ideal procedure would adjust just the sample analyzed to the population of former smokers, but adequate estimates of such population totals are not available.  Data Analysis  Weighted percentages are reported together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on variance estimates from a jackknife procedure ( 19 , 20 ) . Subgroups defined by duration of abstinence at baseline were compared with respect to demographics by use of a special chi-squared procedure ( 21 ) for complex sample designs as implemented in the statistical analysis package, WesVarPC ( 22 ) . Reported cigarette consumption 1 year before the baseline interview was compared for those who had quit for 1 year or less. WesVarPC was also used to perform a logistic regression with demographic variables and duration of abstinence at baseline as the independent variables and continuous abstinence (see above) as the dependent variable. We report adjusted (all demographic variables) odds ratios (ORs) from the logistic regression together with their 95% CIs.  Results  There were 1449 former smokers at baseline who had provided valid information concerning when they quit smoking, which represents 91% of the potential sample. The median intersurvey interval was 20.3 months (range, 14.6–24.7 months). shows the percentage of respondents who were continuously abstinent and who reported current smoking at follow-up grouped according to duration of abstinence at baseline. Only 12% of those who had not smoked for a month or less at baseline were still quit at follow-up, and almost 50% were currently smoking. The remainder were recyclers. Continuous abstinence increased to 25% for those who had abstained for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the percent currently smoking did not decrease. For those quit 3 but less than 6 months at baseline, continuous abstinence more than doubled to 52% and current smoking dropped to 25%. The group that had abstained for 1 but less than 2 years showed another large increase in continuous abstinence to 76% and a drop in current smoking to below 10%. Not until duration of abstinence was 3 but less than 4 years did the rate of continuous abstinence exceed 90%. It should be noted that within each of the above groups, especially those for shorter cessation, relapse is not necessarily homogeneous. For instance, a subgroup that quit for 3 but less than 4 months will have a different rate of continuous abstinence than the subgroup that quit for 4 but less than 6 months.   Fig. 1.

Considering that everyone was abstinent at baseline, 87.5% were still abstinent at follow-up, 6.0% were recyclers, and 6.5% reported current smoking at follow-up. Among those who had quit for less than 3 months at baseline, nearly half were currently smoking at follow-up. However, among those who had quit for 3 months or longer at baseline, fewer than 5% were currently smoking at follow-up and over 90% remained abstinent. Of those who had quit for 1 year or longer at baseline, only 2% were currently smoking at follow-up and nearly 95% were continuously abstinent. The percentage of recyclers decreased with greater cut points. To preserve adequate cell sizes for the logistic regression, we compare only two levels of each demographic variable except raceand four categories for duration of abstinence as baseline. Univariate results are presented in Table 2. There is a significant trend to older age with increased duration of abstinence at baseline. Also, whites are more likely and Hispanics are less likely to have been abstinent longer at baseline. Although there was a trend for more light smokers (<15 cigarettes) in the group who had quit for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline compared with those who had quit for less than 3 months, it was not statistically significant. Considering the adjusted ORs from the logistic regression, those subjects 45 years of age and older are 1.8 (95% CI = 1.1–3.1) times more likely to be continuously abstinent at follow-up than those younger than 45 years ( P <.05). The other demographic variables were not independently significant. Even after adjusting for age and the other demographic variables, compared with those who were abstinent for less than 3 months at base- line, those who were abstinent for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline were 6.2 (95% CI = 2.3–17.3) times more likely ( P <.001), those abstinent for 12 but less than 36 months were 18.7 (95% CI = 8.2v42.5) times more likely ( P <.0001), and those abstinent for 36 months or longer were 139.8 (95% CI = 60.6–322.5) times more likely ( P <.0001) to be continuously abstinent at follow-up. Altogether, 6.4% ± 3.4% of former smokers at baseline reported use of other tobacco products every day or some days, but only 2.0% ± 1.5% reported daily use.   Table 1.

Abstinence at follow-up for different quit duration cut points at baseline  Discussion  These results provide quantitative population data to support the conclusions of earlier studies (10,11,14,16) that found that the duration of abstinence is an excellent predictor of continued long-term abstinence (10,11,14,16) . More than 50% of former smokers abstinent for 3 but less than 6 months remained continuously abstinent until follow-up, which represented a substantial increase from those who had quit for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the rate for those who had quit for 6 but less than 12 months was only marginally higher (). Thus, for longitudinal studies, 3 months may be a reasonable follow-up period to assess intermediate success. Also, for evaluation of population interventions using cross-sectional surveys, a criterion of at least 3 months's cessation may prove to be a fairly stable measure of the prevalence of successful former smokers. Another sizable increase in continuous abstinence occurs for smokers who have quit for 1 but less than 2 years. However, the rate of continuous abstinence does not exceed 90% until smokers have been abstinent for 3 but less than 4 years. More important, we were unable to identify a duration of abstinence after which former smokers had no risk of relapse. Thus, no definition of successful cessation can be absolute.   Table 2. View large Download slide Table 2. Demographic characteristics according to duration of abstinence at baseline Table 2. View large Download slide Table 2. Demographic characteristics according to duration of abstinence at baseline Since any cut point chosen will include all former smokers who have abstained at least this long, the “ sensitivity” for predicting continuous abstinence will be high. For instance, using abstinence for a day as the cut point (all of the subjects in the present study), 88% will still be abstinent at follow-up an average of nearly 2 years later (Table 1). If 3 months is the criterion, 92% will remain abstinent. With 3 years as a criterion, 97% will remain abstinent. It is possible that some demographic or other subgroups of former smokers have a different level of risk of relapse than the population in general. For instance, former smokers who maintain their addiction to nicotine by use of other tobacco products may be more likely to remain continuously abstinent from cigarettes than those using no tobacco products. However, since only 2% of ex-smokers reported daily use of other tobacco products, it is unlikely that the results of this study are appreciably influenced. Previous studies ( 23-26 ) have identified demographic, psychosocial, and other factors (including former level of addiction) that are related to future relapse. Multivariate logistic regression in our sample indicated that older quitters are more likely to remain continuously abstinent at follow-up than younger ones, no doubt because they had already been abstinent longer at baseline. However, since the group that had quit for less than 3 months at baseline contains relatively fewer younger smokers than the group that had quit for 3 but less than 12 months, perhaps the criterion for intermediate successful cessation in younger smokers should be longer than the 3 months we generally suggest. Fewer than one in eight former smokers who had abstained for a month or less at baseline were continuously abstinent over the next 2 years (). This low abstinence rate was expected from outcomes documented in clinic studies ( 27 ) . However, these low rates may also reflect social desirability pressures that lead some smokers to misreport their smoking status ( 28 ) , so that our sample of former smokers may actually contain a few current ones. Indeed, the validity of selfreported smoking status has been investigated by comparing self-reports with reports of smoking status by another adult in the household or a significant other ( 29 ) . Discrepancy was particularly likely for very recent (<1 month) self-reported quitters. However, only about 3% of all recent former smokers reported quitting in the last month at both baseline and follow-up. This small fraction could be perennial “ former smokers” or they could be recyclers. The rate of recycling is the highest for smokers who have abstained for less than 3 months, suggesting that some of these smokers are in the midst of one of several attempts to abstain, which may ultimately lead to success. The recycling rate decreases with greater cut points as more and more former smokers achieve long-term abstinence. Previous population studies (1,2,30) have shown that about one third of all smokers make at least one attempt to quit in the course of a year, and that this proportion can approach one half during mass-media antismoking campaigns ( 18 , 31 ) . If tobacco control interventions increase the number of smokers making an attempt or the number of attempts a smoker makes, point prevalence may be an unstable surveillance or evaluation measure. A survey conducted during a period of intense intervention would likely show a lower prevalence and a higher quit ratio (quotient of all smokers who have quit to all ever smokers) than a similar survey conducted before the intervention or 6 to 12 months later, when most of the quitters had relapsed. Counting those who had quit for 3 months or less as smokers would produce a slightly higher prevalence estimate, but such an estimate would likely be more stable and better suited to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of tobacco control efforts. Our results appear to justify those surveys, which oversample those who have smoked within the past 5 years to determine knowledge and attitudes, and to characterize behavior of participants at risk of smoking in the near future (19,30,32) . Moreover, besides issues of recall, these data support the decision to use a 1-year interval before the interview for assessment of recent quitting behavior ( 19 , 32 ) . Some smokers who have abstained for less than 1 year may have recycled through several attempts in the year before they were surveyed again. The high probability of relapse early after an attempt to quit was a major consideration in the design of a telephone counseling cessation program ( 33 ) . Clients are called at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days after quitting. Our study indicates that significant relapse occurs still later, even after withdrawal has been successfully negotiated. Whether it is cost-effective to extend the counseling beyond 1 month- and, if so, the identification of an optimal schedule-will require further research. When asked why they returned to smoking, many longer-term quitters cite a stressful life event ( 26 ) . Cessation programs should be sure to warn quitters against using cigarettes as a coping mechanism and should assist them in identifying and developing alternative coping strategies.

Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed, with some relapsing even after a lengthy period of abstinence. Few population-based cohort studies have examined relapse among former smokers. Quantification of the relationship between the duration of abstinence and the likelihood of continued abstinence is important for the evaluation of ongoing public health interventions and the design of smoking-cessation programs. Purpose: We analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline (e.g., 1 to <3 months and 3 to <6 months). Methods: From the 1990 California Tobacco Survey that used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults (baseline interview) from June 1990 through February 1991, a stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March 1992 through July 1992. Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions about the lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and the self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included all 1449 former smokers at baseline interview who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who also provided a valid date at both of the surveys when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” All data were weighted to account for the study design and to ensure that the estimates were representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region. Results: Only about 12% of the former smokers who had quit for less than 1 month at baseline remained continuously abstinent at the follow-up interview. This percentage increased to 25% for those who had quit from 1 to less than 3 months; it increased again to 52% if the duration of quitting was from 3 to less than 6 months, but it increased only slightly to 59.2% for those who had quit from 6 to less than 12 months. Overall, the likelihood of remaining continuously abstinent until the follow-up interview was about 90% for former smokers who had quit for 3 months or longer and 95% for those who had quit for 1 year or longer. Conclusions and Implications: We suggest that self-reported cessation for more than 3 months be considered as an intermediate criterion for success both in longitudinal studies and the cross-sectional evaluation of community interventions. If a more stringent criterion is needed, we recommend self-reported cessation for at least 1 year. [J Natl Cancer Inst 1997; 89:572–6] For most smokers, quitting is a difficult process. Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed ( 1 , 2 ) , with some relapse occurring even after a lengthy period of abstinence ( 2 , 3 ) . Currently, in the United States there are several population-based tobacco control programs with goals to encourage successful cessation (1,4–7) . Evaluation of these programs generally relies on estimates of point prevalence-a measure of the percent of the population currently smoking that is based on self-report of current smoking status. Some shortduration former smokers will inevitably relapse, and if public health programs result in more very short duration quit attempts but not more long-term cessation, point prevalence may not be the best evaluation measure. Instead, an estimate that incorporates some measure of successful cessation is needed (1,8,9) . Also, further understanding of duration of abstinence and relapse should aid the design of effective relapse prevention programs and help determine optimal follow-up time. Clinic-based cessation programs have long documented that duration of abstinence is the major predictor of long-term success (1,10,11) . In a review and evaluation of smoking cessation programs, Schwartz ( 12 ) suggested, without presenting supportive evidence, that 1 year was an optimal follow-up period for program evaluation, although a 6-month period was acceptable. The great majority of smokers quit by themselves ( 13 ) , and abstinence rates likely differ from those observed in the clinical setting. Cohen et al. ( 14 ) summarize quitting rates for 10 longitudinal self-help studies but had difficulty defining successful cessation because of the different definitions and lengths of follow-up. Previous studies that have examined the issue of relapse after long intervals of abstinence have relied on nonrepresentative samples or have been fairly small. The Cancer Prevention Study of the 1960s found that among 65 709 male volunteers 30v89 years of age who quit at baseline, 37.3% were smoking again 2 years later ( 15 ) . Among a subset of this sample, aged 50–69 years and abstinent 2–4 years, 5v9 years, and 10 or more years at baseline, current smoking at follow-up was 8.7%, 4.1%, and 2.2%, respectively ( 16 ) . Another longitudinal population study conducted in Michigan in 1980 reported that 40% of recent quitters (<6 months; n = 97) were smoking at followup 2 years later ( 17 ) . In this report, we analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline.  Methods  The 1990 California Tobacco Survey used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults from June 1990 through February 1991. A stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March through July 1992, with the probability of selection much higher for those who reported smoking within 5 years of the baseline interview ( 18 ) . Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions on lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included former smokers at baseline who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who provided a valid date at each survey when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” If the year given was the present or past one, the month needed to be specified as well. Former smokers who reported smoking a year before the baseline interview were asked, “ How many cigarettes were you smoking per day at this time 12 months ago?” No other consumption data for former smokers was collected. We also analyzed the use of other tobacco products (cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, or snuff) at baseline. Respondents who reported ever using one of these products were asked, “ Do you currently use [the product] every day, some days, or not at all?” We called respondents continuously abstinent if they reported a quit date at follow-up that was before the baseline interview date. Current smoking at follow-up was another outcome. Recyclers were defined as former smoker at follow-up, with a quit date after the baseline interview. Baseline duration of abstinence was computed as the elapsed time from the quit date to the interview date. All respondents in the full 1992 longitudinal sample, which included never smokers, long-term former smokers, recent quitters, and current smokers, were assigned a base weight to account for the probability of initial interview and reinterview that differed according to baseline smoking status. Next, a poststratification procedure was applied to ensure that estimates are representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region ( 18 , 19 ) . An ideal procedure would adjust just the sample analyzed to the population of former smokers, but adequate estimates of such population totals are not available.  Data Analysis  Weighted percentages are reported together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on variance estimates from a jackknife procedure ( 19 , 20 ) . Subgroups defined by duration of abstinence at baseline were compared with respect to demographics by use of a special chi-squared procedure ( 21 ) for complex sample designs as implemented in the statistical analysis package, WesVarPC ( 22 ) . Reported cigarette consumption 1 year before the baseline interview was compared for those who had quit for 1 year or less. WesVarPC was also used to perform a logistic regression with demographic variables and duration of abstinence at baseline as the independent variables and continuous abstinence (see above) as the dependent variable. We report adjusted (all demographic variables) odds ratios (ORs) from the logistic regression together with their 95% CIs.  Results  There were 1449 former smokers at baseline who had provided valid information concerning when they quit smoking, which represents 91% of the potential sample. The median intersurvey interval was 20.3 months (range, 14.6–24.7 months). shows the percentage of respondents who were continuously abstinent and who reported current smoking at follow-up grouped according to duration of abstinence at baseline. Only 12% of those who had not smoked for a month or less at baseline were still quit at follow-up, and almost 50% were currently smoking. The remainder were recyclers. Continuous abstinence increased to 25% for those who had abstained for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the percent currently smoking did not decrease. For those quit 3 but less than 6 months at baseline, continuous abstinence more than doubled to 52% and current smoking dropped to 25%. The group that had abstained for 1 but less than 2 years showed another large increase in continuous abstinence to 76% and a drop in current smoking to below 10%. Not until duration of abstinence was 3 but less than 4 years did the rate of continuous abstinence exceed 90%. It should be noted that within each of the above groups, especially those for shorter cessation, relapse is not necessarily homogeneous. For instance, a subgroup that quit for 3 but less than 4 months will have a different rate of continuous abstinence than the subgroup that quit for 4 but less than 6 months.   Fig. 1.

The n shown for the pair of bars for each duration of abstinence interval is for the total number of former smokers at baseline in the interval, including those continuously abstinent, currently smoking, and recyclers. Former smokers at either interview answered “ no” when asked if they smoke now. Former smokers are continuously abstinent if they reported a quit date at follow-up that was before the baseline interview date. Current smokers at follow-up responded “ yes” when asked if they smoked now. Recyclers are former smokers at follow-up who reported a quit date between the two interview dates. Percent = those who are continuously abstinent or currently smoking. Bars = 95% confidence intervals. Fig. 1. View large Download slide Fig. 1.

Percent = those who are continuously abstinent or currently smoking. Bars = 95% confidence intervals. Table 1 examines different potential cut points as criteria for successful cessation. Considering that everyone was abstinent at baseline, 87.5% were still abstinent at follow-up, 6.0% were recyclers, and 6.5% reported current smoking at follow-up. Among those who had quit for less than 3 months at baseline, nearly half were currently smoking at follow-up. However, among those who had quit for 3 months or longer at baseline, fewer than 5% were currently smoking at follow-up and over 90% remained abstinent. Of those who had quit for 1 year or longer at baseline, only 2% were currently smoking at follow-up and nearly 95% were continuously abstinent. The percentage of recyclers decreased with greater cut points. To preserve adequate cell sizes for the logistic regression, we compare only two levels of each demographic variable except raceand four categories for duration of abstinence as baseline. Univariate results are presented in Table 2. There is a significant trend to older age with increased duration of abstinence at baseline. Also, whites are more likely and Hispanics are less likely to have been abstinent longer at baseline. Although there was a trend for more light smokers (<15 cigarettes) in the group who had quit for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline compared with those who had quit for less than 3 months, it was not statistically significant. Considering the adjusted ORs from the logistic regression, those subjects 45 years of age and older are 1.8 (95% CI = 1.1–3.1) times more likely to be continuously abstinent at follow-up than those younger than 45 years ( P <.05). The other demographic variables were not independently significant. Even after adjusting for age and the other demographic variables, compared with those who were abstinent for less than 3 months at base- line, those who were abstinent for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline were 6.2 (95% CI = 2.3–17.3) times more likely ( P <.001), those abstinent for 12 but less than 36 months were 18.7 (95% CI = 8.2v42.5) times more likely ( P <.0001), and those abstinent for 36 months or longer were 139.8 (95% CI = 60.6–322.5) times more likely ( P <.0001) to be continuously abstinent at follow-up. Altogether, 6.4% ± 3.4% of former smokers at baseline reported use of other tobacco products every day or some days, but only 2.0% ± 1.5% reported daily use.   Table 1.

Abstinence at follow-up for different quit duration cut points at baseline  Discussion  These results provide quantitative population data to support the conclusions of earlier studies (10,11,14,16) that found that the duration of abstinence is an excellent predictor of continued long-term abstinence (10,11,14,16) . More than 50% of former smokers abstinent for 3 but less than 6 months remained continuously abstinent until follow-up, which represented a substantial increase from those who had quit for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the rate for those who had quit for 6 but less than 12 months was only marginally higher (). Thus, for longitudinal studies, 3 months may be a reasonable follow-up period to assess intermediate success. Also, for evaluation of population interventions using cross-sectional surveys, a criterion of at least 3 months's cessation may prove to be a fairly stable measure of the prevalence of successful former smokers. Another sizable increase in continuous abstinence occurs for smokers who have quit for 1 but less than 2 years. However, the rate of continuous abstinence does not exceed 90% until smokers have been abstinent for 3 but less than 4 years. More important, we were unable to identify a duration of abstinence after which former smokers had no risk of relapse. Thus, no definition of successful cessation can be absolute.   Table 2.

Demographic characteristics according to duration of abstinence at baseline Since any cut point chosen will include all former smokers who have abstained at least this long, the “ sensitivity” for predicting continuous abstinence will be high. For instance, using abstinence for a day as the cut point (all of the subjects in the present study), 88% will still be abstinent at follow-up an average of nearly 2 years later (Table 1). If 3 months is the criterion, 92% will remain abstinent. With 3 years as a criterion, 97% will remain abstinent. It is possible that some demographic or other subgroups of former smokers have a different level of risk of relapse than the population in general. For instance, former smokers who maintain their addiction to nicotine by use of other tobacco products may be more likely to remain continuously abstinent from cigarettes than those using no tobacco products. However, since only 2% of ex-smokers reported daily use of other tobacco products, it is unlikely that the results of this study are appreciably influenced. Previous studies ( 23-26 ) have identified demographic, psychosocial, and other factors (including former level of addiction) that are related to future relapse. Multivariate logistic regression in our sample indicated that older quitters are more likely to remain continuously abstinent at follow-up than younger ones, no doubt because they had already been abstinent longer at baseline. However, since the group that had quit for less than 3 months at baseline contains relatively fewer younger smokers than the group that had quit for 3 but less than 12 months, perhaps the criterion for intermediate successful cessation in younger smokers should be longer than the 3 months we generally suggest. Fewer than one in eight former smokers who had abstained for a month or less at baseline were continuously abstinent over the next 2 years (). This low abstinence rate was expected from outcomes documented in clinic studies ( 27 ) . However, these low rates may also reflect social desirability pressures that lead some smokers to misreport their smoking status ( 28 ) , so that our sample of former smokers may actually contain a few current ones. Indeed, the validity of selfreported smoking status has been investigated by comparing self-reports with reports of smoking status by another adult in the household or a significant other ( 29 ) . Discrepancy was particularly likely for very recent (<1 month) self-reported quitters. However, only about 3% of all recent former smokers reported quitting in the last month at both baseline and follow-up. This small fraction could be perennial “ former smokers” or they could be recyclers. The rate of recycling is the highest for smokers who have abstained for less than 3 months, suggesting that some of these smokers are in the midst of one of several attempts to abstain, which may ultimately lead to success. The recycling rate decreases with greater cut points as more and more former smokers achieve long-term abstinence. Previous population studies (1,2,30) have shown that about one third of all smokers make at least one attempt to quit in the course of a year, and that this proportion can approach one half during mass-media antismoking campaigns ( 18 , 31 ) . If tobacco control interventions increase the number of smokers making an attempt or the number of attempts a smoker makes, point prevalence may be an unstable surveillance or evaluation measure. A survey conducted during a period of intense intervention would likely show a lower prevalence and a higher quit ratio (quotient of all smokers who have quit to all ever smokers) than a similar survey conducted before the intervention or 6 to 12 months later, when most of the quitters had relapsed. Counting those who had quit for 3 months or less as smokers would produce a slightly higher prevalence estimate, but such an estimate would likely be more stable and better suited to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of tobacco control efforts. Our results appear to justify those surveys, which oversample those who have smoked within the past 5 years to determine knowledge and attitudes, and to characterize behavior of participants at risk of smoking in the near future (19,30,32) . Moreover, besides issues of recall, these data support the decision to use a 1-year interval before the interview for assessment of recent quitting behavior ( 19 , 32 ) . Some smokers who have abstained for less than 1 year may have recycled through several attempts in the year before they were surveyed again. The high probability of relapse early after an attempt to quit was a major consideration in the design of a telephone counseling cessation program ( 33 ) . Clients are called at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days after quitting. Our study indicates that significant relapse occurs still later, even after withdrawal has been successfully negotiated. Whether it is cost-effective to extend the counseling beyond 1 month- and, if so, the identification of an optimal schedule-will require further research. When asked why they returned to smoking, many longer-term quitters cite a stressful life event ( 26 ) . Cessation programs should be sure to warn quitters against using cigarettes as a coping mechanism and should assist them in identifying and developing alternative coping strategies.

Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed, with some relapsing even after a lengthy period of abstinence. Few population-based cohort studies have examined relapse among former smokers. Quantification of the relationship between the duration of abstinence and the likelihood of continued abstinence is important for the evaluation of ongoing public health interventions and the design of smoking-cessation programs. Purpose: We analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline (e.g., 1 to <3 months and 3 to <6 months). Methods: From the 1990 California Tobacco Survey that used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults (baseline interview) from June 1990 through February 1991, a stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March 1992 through July 1992. Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions about the lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and the self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included all 1449 former smokers at baseline interview who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who also provided a valid date at both of the surveys when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” All data were weighted to account for the study design and to ensure that the estimates were representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region. Results: Only about 12% of the former smokers who had quit for less than 1 month at baseline remained continuously abstinent at the follow-up interview. This percentage increased to 25% for those who had quit from 1 to less than 3 months; it increased again to 52% if the duration of quitting was from 3 to less than 6 months, but it increased only slightly to 59.2% for those who had quit from 6 to less than 12 months. Overall, the likelihood of remaining continuously abstinent until the follow-up interview was about 90% for former smokers who had quit for 3 months or longer and 95% for those who had quit for 1 year or longer. Conclusions and Implications: We suggest that self-reported cessation for more than 3 months be considered as an intermediate criterion for success both in longitudinal studies and the cross-sectional evaluation of community interventions. If a more stringent criterion is needed, we recommend self-reported cessation for at least 1 year. [J Natl Cancer Inst 1997; 89:572–6] For most smokers, quitting is a difficult process. Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed ( 1 , 2 ) , with some relapse occurring even after a lengthy period of abstinence ( 2 , 3 ) . Currently, in the United States there are several population-based tobacco control programs with goals to encourage successful cessation (1,4–7) . Evaluation of these programs generally relies on estimates of point prevalence-a measure of the percent of the population currently smoking that is based on self-report of current smoking status. Some shortduration former smokers will inevitably relapse, and if public health programs result in more very short duration quit attempts but not more long-term cessation, point prevalence may not be the best evaluation measure. Instead, an estimate that incorporates some measure of successful cessation is needed (1,8,9) . Also, further understanding of duration of abstinence and relapse should aid the design of effective relapse prevention programs and help determine optimal follow-up time. Clinic-based cessation programs have long documented that duration of abstinence is the major predictor of long-term success (1,10,11) . In a review and evaluation of smoking cessation programs, Schwartz ( 12 ) suggested, without presenting supportive evidence, that 1 year was an optimal follow-up period for program evaluation, although a 6-month period was acceptable. The great majority of smokers quit by themselves ( 13 ) , and abstinence rates likely differ from those observed in the clinical setting. Cohen et al. ( 14 ) summarize quitting rates for 10 longitudinal self-help studies but had difficulty defining successful cessation because of the different definitions and lengths of follow-up. Previous studies that have examined the issue of relapse after long intervals of abstinence have relied on nonrepresentative samples or have been fairly small. The Cancer Prevention Study of the 1960s found that among 65 709 male volunteers 30v89 years of age who quit at baseline, 37.3% were smoking again 2 years later ( 15 ) . Among a subset of this sample, aged 50–69 years and abstinent 2–4 years, 5v9 years, and 10 or more years at baseline, current smoking at follow-up was 8.7%, 4.1%, and 2.2%, respectively ( 16 ) . Another longitudinal population study conducted in Michigan in 1980 reported that 40% of recent quitters (<6 months; n = 97) were smoking at followup 2 years later ( 17 ) . In this report, we analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline.  Methods  The 1990 California Tobacco Survey used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults from June 1990 through February 1991. A stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March through July 1992, with the probability of selection much higher for those who reported smoking within 5 years of the baseline interview ( 18 ) . Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions on lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included former smokers at baseline who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who provided a valid date at each survey when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” If the year given was the present or past one, the month needed to be specified as well. Former smokers who reported smoking a year before the baseline interview were asked, “ How many cigarettes were you smoking per day at this time 12 months ago?” No other consumption data for former smokers was collected. We also analyzed the use of other tobacco products (cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, or snuff) at baseline. Respondents who reported ever using one of these products were asked, “ Do you currently use [the product] every day, some days, or not at all?” We called respondents continuously abstinent if they reported a quit date at follow-up that was before the baseline interview date. Current smoking at follow-up was another outcome. Recyclers were defined as former smoker at follow-up, with a quit date after the baseline interview. Baseline duration of abstinence was computed as the elapsed time from the quit date to the interview date. All respondents in the full 1992 longitudinal sample, which included never smokers, long-term former smokers, recent quitters, and current smokers, were assigned a base weight to account for the probability of initial interview and reinterview that differed according to baseline smoking status. Next, a poststratification procedure was applied to ensure that estimates are representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region ( 18 , 19 ) . An ideal procedure would adjust just the sample analyzed to the population of former smokers, but adequate estimates of such population totals are not available.  Data Analysis  Weighted percentages are reported together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on variance estimates from a jackknife procedure ( 19 , 20 ) . Subgroups defined by duration of abstinence at baseline were compared with respect to demographics by use of a special chi-squared procedure ( 21 ) for complex sample designs as implemented in the statistical analysis package, WesVarPC ( 22 ) . Reported cigarette consumption 1 year before the baseline interview was compared for those who had quit for 1 year or less. WesVarPC was also used to perform a logistic regression with demographic variables and duration of abstinence at baseline as the independent variables and continuous abstinence (see above) as the dependent variable. We report adjusted (all demographic variables) odds ratios (ORs) from the logistic regression together with their 95% CIs.  Results  There were 1449 former smokers at baseline who had provided valid information concerning when they quit smoking, which represents 91% of the potential sample. The median intersurvey interval was 20.3 months (range, 14.6–24.7 months). shows the percentage of respondents who were continuously abstinent and who reported current smoking at follow-up grouped according to duration of abstinence at baseline. Only 12% of those who had not smoked for a month or less at baseline were still quit at follow-up, and almost 50% were currently smoking. The remainder were recyclers. Continuous abstinence increased to 25% for those who had abstained for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the percent currently smoking did not decrease. For those quit 3 but less than 6 months at baseline, continuous abstinence more than doubled to 52% and current smoking dropped to 25%. The group that had abstained for 1 but less than 2 years showed another large increase in continuous abstinence to 76% and a drop in current smoking to below 10%. Not until duration of abstinence was 3 but less than 4 years did the rate of continuous abstinence exceed 90%. It should be noted that within each of the above groups, especially those for shorter cessation, relapse is not necessarily homogeneous. For instance, a subgroup that quit for 3 but less than 4 months will have a different rate of continuous abstinence than the subgroup that quit for 4 but less than 6 months.   Fig. 1.

Considering that everyone was abstinent at baseline, 87.5% were still abstinent at follow-up, 6.0% were recyclers, and 6.5% reported current smoking at follow-up. Among those who had quit for less than 3 months at baseline, nearly half were currently smoking at follow-up. However, among those who had quit for 3 months or longer at baseline, fewer than 5% were currently smoking at follow-up and over 90% remained abstinent. Of those who had quit for 1 year or longer at baseline, only 2% were currently smoking at follow-up and nearly 95% were continuously abstinent. The percentage of recyclers decreased with greater cut points. To preserve adequate cell sizes for the logistic regression, we compare only two levels of each demographic variable except raceand four categories for duration of abstinence as baseline. Univariate results are presented in Table 2. There is a significant trend to older age with increased duration of abstinence at baseline. Also, whites are more likely and Hispanics are less likely to have been abstinent longer at baseline. Although there was a trend for more light smokers (<15 cigarettes) in the group who had quit for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline compared with those who had quit for less than 3 months, it was not statistically significant. Considering the adjusted ORs from the logistic regression, those subjects 45 years of age and older are 1.8 (95% CI = 1.1–3.1) times more likely to be continuously abstinent at follow-up than those younger than 45 years ( P <.05). The other demographic variables were not independently significant. Even after adjusting for age and the other demographic variables, compared with those who were abstinent for less than 3 months at base- line, those who were abstinent for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline were 6.2 (95% CI = 2.3–17.3) times more likely ( P <.001), those abstinent for 12 but less than 36 months were 18.7 (95% CI = 8.2v42.5) times more likely ( P <.0001), and those abstinent for 36 months or longer were 139.8 (95% CI = 60.6–322.5) times more likely ( P <.0001) to be continuously abstinent at follow-up. Altogether, 6.4% ± 3.4% of former smokers at baseline reported use of other tobacco products every day or some days, but only 2.0% ± 1.5% reported daily use.   Table 1.

Abstinence at follow-up for different quit duration cut points at baseline  Discussion  These results provide quantitative population data to support the conclusions of earlier studies (10,11,14,16) that found that the duration of abstinence is an excellent predictor of continued long-term abstinence (10,11,14,16) . More than 50% of former smokers abstinent for 3 but less than 6 months remained continuously abstinent until follow-up, which represented a substantial increase from those who had quit for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the rate for those who had quit for 6 but less than 12 months was only marginally higher (). Thus, for longitudinal studies, 3 months may be a reasonable follow-up period to assess intermediate success. Also, for evaluation of population interventions using cross-sectional surveys, a criterion of at least 3 months's cessation may prove to be a fairly stable measure of the prevalence of successful former smokers. Another sizable increase in continuous abstinence occurs for smokers who have quit for 1 but less than 2 years. However, the rate of continuous abstinence does not exceed 90% until smokers have been abstinent for 3 but less than 4 years. More important, we were unable to identify a duration of abstinence after which former smokers had no risk of relapse. Thus, no definition of successful cessation can be absolute.   Table 2. View large Download slide Table 2. Demographic characteristics according to duration of abstinence at baseline Table 2. View large Download slide Table 2. Demographic characteristics according to duration of abstinence at baseline Since any cut point chosen will include all former smokers who have abstained at least this long, the “ sensitivity” for predicting continuous abstinence will be high. For instance, using abstinence for a day as the cut point (all of the subjects in the present study), 88% will still be abstinent at follow-up an average of nearly 2 years later (Table 1). If 3 months is the criterion, 92% will remain abstinent. With 3 years as a criterion, 97% will remain abstinent. It is possible that some demographic or other subgroups of former smokers have a different level of risk of relapse than the population in general. For instance, former smokers who maintain their addiction to nicotine by use of other tobacco products may be more likely to remain continuously abstinent from cigarettes than those using no tobacco products. However, since only 2% of ex-smokers reported daily use of other tobacco products, it is unlikely that the results of this study are appreciably influenced. Previous studies ( 23-26 ) have identified demographic, psychosocial, and other factors (including former level of addiction) that are related to future relapse. Multivariate logistic regression in our sample indicated that older quitters are more likely to remain continuously abstinent at follow-up than younger ones, no doubt because they had already been abstinent longer at baseline. However, since the group that had quit for less than 3 months at baseline contains relatively fewer younger smokers than the group that had quit for 3 but less than 12 months, perhaps the criterion for intermediate successful cessation in younger smokers should be longer than the 3 months we generally suggest. Fewer than one in eight former smokers who had abstained for a month or less at baseline were continuously abstinent over the next 2 years (). This low abstinence rate was expected from outcomes documented in clinic studies ( 27 ) . However, these low rates may also reflect social desirability pressures that lead some smokers to misreport their smoking status ( 28 ) , so that our sample of former smokers may actually contain a few current ones. Indeed, the validity of selfreported smoking status has been investigated by comparing self-reports with reports of smoking status by another adult in the household or a significant other ( 29 ) . Discrepancy was particularly likely for very recent (<1 month) self-reported quitters. However, only about 3% of all recent former smokers reported quitting in the last month at both baseline and follow-up. This small fraction could be perennial “ former smokers” or they could be recyclers. The rate of recycling is the highest for smokers who have abstained for less than 3 months, suggesting that some of these smokers are in the midst of one of several attempts to abstain, which may ultimately lead to success. The recycling rate decreases with greater cut points as more and more former smokers achieve long-term abstinence. Previous population studies (1,2,30) have shown that about one third of all smokers make at least one attempt to quit in the course of a year, and that this proportion can approach one half during mass-media antismoking campaigns ( 18 , 31 ) . If tobacco control interventions increase the number of smokers making an attempt or the number of attempts a smoker makes, point prevalence may be an unstable surveillance or evaluation measure. A survey conducted during a period of intense intervention would likely show a lower prevalence and a higher quit ratio (quotient of all smokers who have quit to all ever smokers) than a similar survey conducted before the intervention or 6 to 12 months later, when most of the quitters had relapsed. Counting those who had quit for 3 months or less as smokers would produce a slightly higher prevalence estimate, but such an estimate would likely be more stable and better suited to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of tobacco control efforts. Our results appear to justify those surveys, which oversample those who have smoked within the past 5 years to determine knowledge and attitudes, and to characterize behavior of participants at risk of smoking in the near future (19,30,32) . Moreover, besides issues of recall, these data support the decision to use a 1-year interval before the interview for assessment of recent quitting behavior ( 19 , 32 ) . Some smokers who have abstained for less than 1 year may have recycled through several attempts in the year before they were surveyed again. The high probability of relapse early after an attempt to quit was a major consideration in the design of a telephone counseling cessation program ( 33 ) . Clients are called at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days after quitting. Our study indicates that significant relapse occurs still later, even after withdrawal has been successfully negotiated. Whether it is cost-effective to extend the counseling beyond 1 month- and, if so, the identification of an optimal schedule-will require further research. When asked why they returned to smoking, many longer-term quitters cite a stressful life event ( 26 ) . Cessation programs should be sure to warn quitters against using cigarettes as a coping mechanism and should assist them in identifying and developing alternative coping strategies.

Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed, with some relapsing even after a lengthy period of abstinence. Few population-based cohort studies have examined relapse among former smokers. Quantification of the relationship between the duration of abstinence and the likelihood of continued abstinence is important for the evaluation of ongoing public health interventions and the design of smoking-cessation programs. Purpose: We analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline (e.g., 1 to <3 months and 3 to <6 months). Methods: From the 1990 California Tobacco Survey that used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults (baseline interview) from June 1990 through February 1991, a stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March 1992 through July 1992. Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions about the lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and the self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included all 1449 former smokers at baseline interview who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who also provided a valid date at both of the surveys when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” All data were weighted to account for the study design and to ensure that the estimates were representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region. Results: Only about 12% of the former smokers who had quit for less than 1 month at baseline remained continuously abstinent at the follow-up interview. This percentage increased to 25% for those who had quit from 1 to less than 3 months; it increased again to 52% if the duration of quitting was from 3 to less than 6 months, but it increased only slightly to 59.2% for those who had quit from 6 to less than 12 months. Overall, the likelihood of remaining continuously abstinent until the follow-up interview was about 90% for former smokers who had quit for 3 months or longer and 95% for those who had quit for 1 year or longer. Conclusions and Implications: We suggest that self-reported cessation for more than 3 months be considered as an intermediate criterion for success both in longitudinal studies and the cross-sectional evaluation of community interventions. If a more stringent criterion is needed, we recommend self-reported cessation for at least 1 year. [J Natl Cancer Inst 1997; 89:572–6] For most smokers, quitting is a difficult process. Many smokers try to quit repeatedly before they succeed ( 1 , 2 ) , with some relapse occurring even after a lengthy period of abstinence ( 2 , 3 ) . Currently, in the United States there are several population-based tobacco control programs with goals to encourage successful cessation (1,4–7) . Evaluation of these programs generally relies on estimates of point prevalence-a measure of the percent of the population currently smoking that is based on self-report of current smoking status. Some shortduration former smokers will inevitably relapse, and if public health programs result in more very short duration quit attempts but not more long-term cessation, point prevalence may not be the best evaluation measure. Instead, an estimate that incorporates some measure of successful cessation is needed (1,8,9) . Also, further understanding of duration of abstinence and relapse should aid the design of effective relapse prevention programs and help determine optimal follow-up time. Clinic-based cessation programs have long documented that duration of abstinence is the major predictor of long-term success (1,10,11) . In a review and evaluation of smoking cessation programs, Schwartz ( 12 ) suggested, without presenting supportive evidence, that 1 year was an optimal follow-up period for program evaluation, although a 6-month period was acceptable. The great majority of smokers quit by themselves ( 13 ) , and abstinence rates likely differ from those observed in the clinical setting. Cohen et al. ( 14 ) summarize quitting rates for 10 longitudinal self-help studies but had difficulty defining successful cessation because of the different definitions and lengths of follow-up. Previous studies that have examined the issue of relapse after long intervals of abstinence have relied on nonrepresentative samples or have been fairly small. The Cancer Prevention Study of the 1960s found that among 65 709 male volunteers 30v89 years of age who quit at baseline, 37.3% were smoking again 2 years later ( 15 ) . Among a subset of this sample, aged 50–69 years and abstinent 2–4 years, 5v9 years, and 10 or more years at baseline, current smoking at follow-up was 8.7%, 4.1%, and 2.2%, respectively ( 16 ) . Another longitudinal population study conducted in Michigan in 1980 reported that 40% of recent quitters (<6 months; n = 97) were smoking at followup 2 years later ( 17 ) . In this report, we analyzed longitudinal data from a large, representative population cohort of former smokers and estimated the probability of future relapse for different durations of abstinence at baseline.  Methods  The 1990 California Tobacco Survey used a random-digit-dialed computer-assisted telephone survey to interview 24 296 California adults from June 1990 through February 1991. A stratified random sample of 4642 adults was reinterviewed from March through July 1992, with the probability of selection much higher for those who reported smoking within 5 years of the baseline interview ( 18 ) . Both surveys assessed smoking status using standard questions on lifetime use of 100 cigarettes and self-classification of current smoking: 1) “ Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?” and 2) “ Do you smoke cigarettes now?” We included former smokers at baseline who answered “ yes” to the first question and “ no” to the second and who provided a valid date at each survey when asked, “ When did you last smoke regularly?” If the year given was the present or past one, the month needed to be specified as well. Former smokers who reported smoking a year before the baseline interview were asked, “ How many cigarettes were you smoking per day at this time 12 months ago?” No other consumption data for former smokers was collected. We also analyzed the use of other tobacco products (cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, or snuff) at baseline. Respondents who reported ever using one of these products were asked, “ Do you currently use [the product] every day, some days, or not at all?” We called respondents continuously abstinent if they reported a quit date at follow-up that was before the baseline interview date. Current smoking at follow-up was another outcome. Recyclers were defined as former smoker at follow-up, with a quit date after the baseline interview. Baseline duration of abstinence was computed as the elapsed time from the quit date to the interview date. All respondents in the full 1992 longitudinal sample, which included never smokers, long-term former smokers, recent quitters, and current smokers, were assigned a base weight to account for the probability of initial interview and reinterview that differed according to baseline smoking status. Next, a poststratification procedure was applied to ensure that estimates are representative of the California population by age, sex, race, education, and geographic region ( 18 , 19 ) . An ideal procedure would adjust just the sample analyzed to the population of former smokers, but adequate estimates of such population totals are not available.  Data Analysis  Weighted percentages are reported together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on variance estimates from a jackknife procedure ( 19 , 20 ) . Subgroups defined by duration of abstinence at baseline were compared with respect to demographics by use of a special chi-squared procedure ( 21 ) for complex sample designs as implemented in the statistical analysis package, WesVarPC ( 22 ) . Reported cigarette consumption 1 year before the baseline interview was compared for those who had quit for 1 year or less. WesVarPC was also used to perform a logistic regression with demographic variables and duration of abstinence at baseline as the independent variables and continuous abstinence (see above) as the dependent variable. We report adjusted (all demographic variables) odds ratios (ORs) from the logistic regression together with their 95% CIs.  Results  There were 1449 former smokers at baseline who had provided valid information concerning when they quit smoking, which represents 91% of the potential sample. The median intersurvey interval was 20.3 months (range, 14.6–24.7 months). shows the percentage of respondents who were continuously abstinent and who reported current smoking at follow-up grouped according to duration of abstinence at baseline. Only 12% of those who had not smoked for a month or less at baseline were still quit at follow-up, and almost 50% were currently smoking. The remainder were recyclers. Continuous abstinence increased to 25% for those who had abstained for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the percent currently smoking did not decrease. For those quit 3 but less than 6 months at baseline, continuous abstinence more than doubled to 52% and current smoking dropped to 25%. The group that had abstained for 1 but less than 2 years showed another large increase in continuous abstinence to 76% and a drop in current smoking to below 10%. Not until duration of abstinence was 3 but less than 4 years did the rate of continuous abstinence exceed 90%. It should be noted that within each of the above groups, especially those for shorter cessation, relapse is not necessarily homogeneous. For instance, a subgroup that quit for 3 but less than 4 months will have a different rate of continuous abstinence than the subgroup that quit for 4 but less than 6 months.   Fig. 1.

Percent = those who are continuously abstinent or currently smoking. Bars = 95% confidence intervals. Table 1 examines different potential cut points as criteria for successful cessation. Considering that everyone was abstinent at baseline, 87.5% were still abstinent at follow-up, 6.0% were recyclers, and 6.5% reported current smoking at follow-up. Among those who had quit for less than 3 months at baseline, nearly half were currently smoking at follow-up. However, among those who had quit for 3 months or longer at baseline, fewer than 5% were currently smoking at follow-up and over 90% remained abstinent. Of those who had quit for 1 year or longer at baseline, only 2% were currently smoking at follow-up and nearly 95% were continuously abstinent. The percentage of recyclers decreased with greater cut points. To preserve adequate cell sizes for the logistic regression, we compare only two levels of each demographic variable except raceand four categories for duration of abstinence as baseline. Univariate results are presented in Table 2. There is a significant trend to older age with increased duration of abstinence at baseline. Also, whites are more likely and Hispanics are less likely to have been abstinent longer at baseline. Although there was a trend for more light smokers (<15 cigarettes) in the group who had quit for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline compared with those who had quit for less than 3 months, it was not statistically significant. Considering the adjusted ORs from the logistic regression, those subjects 45 years of age and older are 1.8 (95% CI = 1.1–3.1) times more likely to be continuously abstinent at follow-up than those younger than 45 years ( P <.05). The other demographic variables were not independently significant. Even after adjusting for age and the other demographic variables, compared with those who were abstinent for less than 3 months at base- line, those who were abstinent for 3 but less than 12 months at baseline were 6.2 (95% CI = 2.3–17.3) times more likely ( P <.001), those abstinent for 12 but less than 36 months were 18.7 (95% CI = 8.2v42.5) times more likely ( P <.0001), and those abstinent for 36 months or longer were 139.8 (95% CI = 60.6–322.5) times more likely ( P <.0001) to be continuously abstinent at follow-up. Altogether, 6.4% ± 3.4% of former smokers at baseline reported use of other tobacco products every day or some days, but only 2.0% ± 1.5% reported daily use.   Table 1.

Abstinence at follow-up for different quit duration cut points at baseline  Discussion  These results provide quantitative population data to support the conclusions of earlier studies (10,11,14,16) that found that the duration of abstinence is an excellent predictor of continued long-term abstinence (10,11,14,16) . More than 50% of former smokers abstinent for 3 but less than 6 months remained continuously abstinent until follow-up, which represented a substantial increase from those who had quit for 1 but less than 3 months; however, the rate for those who had quit for 6 but less than 12 months was only marginally higher (). Thus, for longitudinal studies, 3 months may be a reasonable follow-up period to assess intermediate success. Also, for evaluation of population interventions using cross-sectional surveys, a criterion of at least 3 months's cessation may prove to be a fairly stable measure of the prevalence of successful former smokers. Another sizable increase in continuous abstinence occurs for smokers who have quit for 1 but less than 2 years. However, the rate of continuous abstinence does not exceed 90% until smokers have been abstinent for 3 but less than 4 years. More important, we were unable to identify a duration of abstinence after which former smokers had no risk of relapse. Thus, no definition of successful cessation can be absolute.   Table 2. View large Download slide Table 2. Demographic characteristics according to duration of abstinence at baseline Table 2. View large Download slide Table 2. Demographic characteristics according to duration of abstinence at baseline Since any cut point chosen will include all former smokers who have abstained at least this long, the “ sensitivity” for predicting continuous abstinence will be high. For instance, using abstinence for a day as the cut point (all of the subjects in the present study), 88% will still be abstinent at follow-up an average of nearly 2 years later (Table 1). If 3 months is the criterion, 92% will remain abstinent. With 3 years as a criterion, 97% will remain abstinent. It is possible that some demographic or other subgroups of former smokers have a different level of risk of relapse than the population in general. For instance, former smokers who maintain their addiction to nicotine by use of other tobacco products may be more likely to remain continuously abstinent from cigarettes than those using no tobacco products. However, since only 2% of ex-smokers reported daily use of other tobacco products, it is unlikely that the results of this study are appreciably influenced. Previous studies ( 23-26 ) have identified demographic, psychosocial, and other factors (including former level of addiction) that are related to future relapse. Multivariate logistic regression in our sample indicated that older quitters are more likely to remain continuously abstinent at follow-up than younger ones, no doubt because they had already been abstinent longer at baseline. However, since the group that had quit for less than 3 months at baseline contains relatively fewer younger smokers than the group that had quit for 3 but less than 12 months, perhaps the criterion for intermediate successful cessation in younger smokers should be longer than the 3 months we generally suggest. Fewer than one in eight former smokers who had abstained for a month or less at baseline were continuously abstinent over the next 2 years (). This low abstinence rate was expected from outcomes documented in clinic studies ( 27 ) . However, these low rates may also reflect social desirability pressures that lead some smokers to misreport their smoking status ( 28 ) , so that our sample of former smokers may actually contain a few current ones. Indeed, the validity of selfreported smoking status has been investigated by comparing self-reports with reports of smoking status by another adult in the household or a significant other ( 29 ) . Discrepancy was particularly likely for very recent (<1 month) self-reported quitters. However, only about 3% of all recent former smokers reported quitting in the last month at both baseline and follow-up. This small fraction could be perennial “ former smokers” or they could be recyclers. The rate of recycling is the highest for smokers who have abstained for less than 3 months, suggesting that some of these smokers are in the midst of one of several attempts to abstain, which may ultimately lead to success. The recycling rate decreases with greater cut points as more and more former smokers achieve long-term abstinence. Previous population studies (1,2,30) have shown that about one third of all smokers make at least one attempt to quit in the course of a year, and that this proportion can approach one half during mass-media antismoking campaigns ( 18 , 31 ) . If tobacco control interventions increase the number of smokers making an attempt or the number of attempts a smoker makes, point prevalence may be an unstable surveillance or evaluation measure. A survey conducted during a period of intense intervention would likely show a lower prevalence and a higher quit ratio (quotient of all smokers who have quit to all ever smokers) than a similar survey conducted before the intervention or 6 to 12 months later, when most of the quitters had relapsed. Counting those who had quit for 3 months or less as smokers would produce a slightly higher prevalence estimate, but such an estimate would likely be more stable and better suited to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of tobacco control efforts. Our results appear to justify those surveys, which oversample those who have smoked within the past 5 years to determine knowledge and attitudes, and to characterize behavior of participants at risk of smoking in the near future (19,30,32) . Moreover, besides issues of recall, these data support the decision to use a 1-year interval before the interview for assessment of recent quitting behavior ( 19 , 32 ) . Some smokers who have abstained for less than 1 year may have recycled through several attempts in the year before they were surveyed again. The high probability of relapse early after an attempt to quit was a major consideration in the design of a telephone counseling cessation program ( 33 ) . Clients are called at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days after quitting. Our study indicates that significant relapse occurs still later, even after withdrawal has been successfully negotiated. Whether it is cost-effective to extend the counseling beyond 1 month- and, if so, the identification of an optimal schedule-will require further research. When asked why they returned to smoking, many longer-term quitters cite a stressful life event ( 26 ) . Cessation programs should be sure to warn quitters against using cigarettes as a coping mechanism and should assist them in identifying and developing alternative coping strategies.

Genetics can help determine whether a person is likely to quit smoking on his or her own or need medication to improve the chances of success, according to research published in today’s American Journal of Psychiatry. Researchers say the study moves health care providers a step closer to one day providing more individualized treatment plans to help patients quit smoking.  The study was supported by multiple components of the National Institutes of Health, including the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) , the National Human Genome Research Institute , the National Cancer Institute , and the Clinical and Translational Science Awards program, administered by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences .  “This study builds on our knowledge of genetic vulnerability to nicotine dependence, and will help us tailor smoking cessation strategies accordingly,” said NIDA Director Nora D. Volkow, M.D. “It also highlights the potential value of genetic screening in helping to identify individuals early on and reduce their risk for tobacco addiction and its related negative health consequences.”  Researchers focused on specific variations in a cluster of nicotinic receptor genes, CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4, which prior studies have shown contribute to nicotine dependence and heavy smoking. Using data obtained from a previous study supported by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute , researchers showed that individuals carrying the high-risk form of this gene cluster reported a 2-year delay in the median quit age compared to those with the low-risk genes. This delay was attributable to a pattern of heavier smoking among those with the high risk gene cluster. The researchers then conducted a clinical trial, which confirmed that persons with the high-risk genes were more likely to fail in their quit attempts compared to those with the low-risk genes when treated with placebo. However, medications approved for nicotine cessation (such as nicotine replacement therapies or bupropion) increased the likelihood of abstinence in the high risk groups. Those with the highest risk had a three-fold increase in their odds of being abstinent at the end of active treatment compared to placebo, indicating that these medications may be particularly beneficial for this population.  “We found that the effects of smoking cessation medications depend on a person’s genes,” said first author Li-Shiun Chen, M.D., of the Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis. “If smokers have the risk genes, they don’t quit easily on their own and will benefit greatly from the medications. If smokers don’t have the risk genes, they are likely to quit successfully without the help of medications such as nicotine replacement or bupropion.”  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States. Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke results in more than 440,000 preventable deaths each year — about 1 in 5 U.S. deaths overall. Another 8.6 million live with a serious illness caused by smoking. Despite these well-documented health costs, over 46 million U.S. adults continue to smoke cigarettes.

Canada's cigarette pack addiction warning label reads, "Warning: cigarettes are highly addictive. Studies have shown that tobacco can be harder to quit than heroin or cocaine." There is no U.S. addiction warning label. Nicotine physically alters and desensitizes the brain. It causes eleven different brain regions to grow millions of extra acetylcholine receptors.  Successful quitting is allowing time for re-sensitization, time for reconditioning subconscious nicotine feeding cues, and time to move beyond years of conscious smoking rationalizations and minimizations. Recent studies suggest that most of us became addicted to nicotine far quicker and while smoking far fewer cigarettes than previously believed possible. Two-thirds of all first time youth smokers will become chemically addicted. A June 2005 study (Kandel) found that 86.8% of students smoking nicotine at least once daily were already hooked solid using dependency standards contained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 4th Edition. The law of addiction states "administration of a drug to an addict will cause re-establishment of chemical dependence upon the addictive substance at the old level of use or greater." Yes, just one powerful puff of nicotine and you'll be faced with enduring nicotine detox all over again. We're not that strong. But adherence to just one rule guarantees success to all ... no nicotine just one day at a time, Never Take Another Puff! Nicotine dependency is every bit as real and permanent as alcoholism. Don't play games with yourself. Treating a true addiction as though it were some nasty little habit is a recipe for relapse. There is no such thing as just one puff. It truly is an all or nothing proposition. Quitting smoking nicotine is not impossible. In fact, we have more ex-smokers in the U.S. than current smokers. Whether we eventually learn the power of one puff through the school of hard-quitting-knocks or in lessons such as this, knowledge truly is power. We can either master our dependency or it will continue to master us. While 91.2% of successful quitters quit entirely on their own, the odds of any particular uneducated and unsupported on-your-own attempt succeeding for one full year are roughly 5%. But again, anyone is fully capable of quitting so long as they remain obedient to the law of addiction. Although extremely addictive, like salt, nicotine is simply a chemical with an I.Q. of zero.  It cannot plot, plan, conspire or think and is not some demon dwelling within.  Although we'll never be stronger than nicotine we don't need to be. Our greatest weapon is, and always was, our vastly superior intelligence, but only if put to work. Only in an addict's mind would the chemical depriving them of freedom, and gradually destroying their body, be considered a friend, pal or companion. Cigarettes are not our friend.  Imagine the sickness afflicting a mind willing to trade five thousand sunrises for one chemical. Are you having trouble getting started?  Is your motivation in need of a boost? Visit WhyQuit.com and meet Noni, Bryan, Brandon, Kim or Sean, or watch one of eighteen short determination fueling movie clips.  If you don't have Internet access visit your local library. Fear of success is the biggest obstacle to making a serious attempt.  Your dependency-conditioned mind is likely terrified at the thought that life without smoking won't be worth living, or that you'll leave part of you behind.  But within just two weeks you'll begin to develop a sense of both the gradually emerging beauty that is "you," and a growing feeling that life without nicotine might actually be easier. Visit WhyQuit.com, the source of these quitting tips, and make one complete read of Joel's Library before getting started.  It's a free collection of roughly 90 short quitting articles, each containing a pearl of wisdom. Forget about quitting "forever."  Like attempting the seemingly impossible task of eating an entire elephant, it's the biggest psychological bite imaginable. Instead, work hard at adopting a more manageable "one day at a time" standard for measuring victory. If we insist on seeing success only in terms of quitting forever, on which day will we be entitled to celebrate? Nicotine dependency recovery is a temporary journey of re-adjustment.  It transports us home to the richest sense of mental quiet and deep inner calm that we've known since nicotine assumed command and control over the flow of more than 200 of our body's neurochemicals, including dopamine, adrenaline and serotonin. Nicotine's half-life is two hours.  Unless replenished, the amount of nicotine remaining in your bloodstream will be cut by half every two hours.  When quitting cold turkey, 100% of nicotine and 90% of its metabolites will be out of your system within 72 hours. It's then that neuronal re-sensitization (to your own acetylcholine) can begin in full. Regarding withdrawal symptoms, within reason, it's fairly safe to blame most of what you'll feel during the first three days on quitting. But after that you need to listen to your body and if concerned give your doctor a call.  Don't blame your symptoms on where you're going but on where you've been. See each symptom as a true sign of ongoing healing. Each puff of smoke contained more than 500 different gases and 3,500 different particles. One or more of these 4,000 chemicals may have been masking an underlying hidden health problem such as a thyroid condition (iodine), asthma (bronchiodialiators), or even chronic organic depression (nicotine).  Your cigarette's chemicals may also have been interacting with medications you were taking and an adjustment may be necessary.  Stay alert and if at all concerned contact your physician or pharmacist. Chemical dependency upon smoking nicotine is one of the most intense, repetitive and dependable relationships you've likely ever known.  It has infected almost every aspect of your life.  Be prepared to experience a normal sense of emotional loss when quitting.  Expect to travel through and experience six different emotional phases: (1) denial, (2) anger, (3) bargaining, (4) depression, (5) acceptance, and (6) complacency. According to evidence tables in the June 2000 USDHHS Guideline, a smoker's natural six-month odds of quitting "on-their-own" are roughly 10%. Education, new behavioral skills, and ongoing support can easily more than triple those odds. Talk to your doctor about Zyban or Wellbutrin should you feel the need to slightly diminish early anxieties. Both products contain the same active chemical, bupropion. You may find that your health insurance policy covers Wellbutrin (marketed for depression) but not Zyban (marketed for smoking cessation).  In clinical studies, bupropion performed roughly 15 percentage points above placebo at six months.  Although its use comes with some risks, including a one in a thousand risk of seizure, they pale in comparison to smoking's risks. The pharmaceutical industry has not been entirely candid with smokers regarding their odds of success while using nicotine replacement products (NRT).  A March 2003 study (Hughes) combined and averaged the seven over-the-counter nicotine patch and gum studies. It found that only 7% of study participants were still not smoking at six months. Have you already tried quitting with NRT once? If so, it's important to note that only two studies have focused on repeat or second-time nicotine patch users. A 1993 study (Tonnesen) found that 0% of second-time patch users succeeded in quitting for 6 months and a 1995 study (Gourlay) reported a 1.6% rate. Unlike abrupt nicotine cessation, the odds of success generally decline with subsequent NRT attempts. Little known is the fact that NRT studies measured smoking cessation while all but ignoring nicotine cessation. A November 2003 study (Shiffman) found that up to 7% of those attempting to quit with nicotine gum were still using the gum at six months. It makes you wonder if anyone actually breaks free of nicotine while chewing it. The study also reports that up to 36.6% of all current nicotine gum users are today engaged in persistent long-term use. More recently, a June 2004 study (Mooney) reviewed 73 double blind NRT studies and found that they were not blind as claimed. Nicotine is a psychoactive chemical producing a dopamine/adrenaline high. The study found that 71% of NRT studies assessing blindness failed their own assessment as "subjects accurately judged treatment assignment at a rate significantly above chance." Would you be able to tell if your nicotine gum was nicotine-free? So could they. Unlike clinical studies, all real-world quitting surveys to date (California, Minnesota, Maryland, London, Quebec and the UK) have found that those quitting with nicotine replacement products do not perform better than those quitting without them. A survey published in the September 2002 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association concludes, "NRT appears no longer effective in increasing long-term successful cessation in California smokers." Regarding hypnosis, a 1998 Cochrane Review of nine different hypnosis quit smoking studies concluded that "we have not shown that hypnotherapy has a greater effect on six month quit rates than other interventions or no treatment." A 2002 Cochrane Review of 22 different acupuncture studies concluded that, "there is no clear evidence that acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy or electro-stimulation are effective for smoking cessation." Don't let the above quitting method study findings frustrate you.  Instead use them to gauge just how serious the challenge before you is. In 2002 41.2% of U.S. smokers quit smoking for at least one day. Sadly, only 1 in 20 succeeded in remaining quit for one year. But few had any understanding of the amazing chemical they were up against. Once in the heat of battle, it is normal for your mind to quickly forget many of the reasons that motivated you to quit smoking. Write yourself a loving reminder letter, carry it with you, and read it often. Make it your first line of defense - a motivational tool that you can pull out during moments of challenge. As with achievement in almost all human endeavors, the wind beneath your recovery wings will not be strength or willpower but robust dreams and desires. Keep your dreams vibrant and on center-stage in your mind and no circumstance will deprive you of glory. Each puff of nicotine was our spoon, releasing stored fats into our bloodstream. It allowed us to skip meals without experiencing wild blood-sugar swing symptoms such as an inability to concentrate or hunger related anxieties. Learn to again properly fuel your body by spreading out your normal daily calorie intake more evenly. Do not skip meals. Drink plenty of acidic fruit juice the first three days. Cranberry is excellent and a bottle will cost you about the same as a pack of cigarettes. The acidic juices will not only aid in more quickly removing the alkaloid nicotine but will help stabilize blood sugars. Take care beyond three days as juices can be rather fattening. Regarding weight, you'd need to gain at least 75 extra pounds in order to equal the health risks associated with smoking one pack a day. Eat vegetables and fruits instead of candies, chips and pastries to help avoid weight gain. Engage is some moderate form of regular exercise if at all concerned about weight gain. A substantial increase in overall lung function of up to 30% within just 90 days will aid you in engaging in extended periods of physical activity, in shedding any extra pounds, and in building cardiovascular endurance. Recognize that contrary to popular thinking, smoking nicotine did not relieve stress but only its own absence. Nicotine is an alkaloid. Stress is an acid-producing event capable of quickly neutralizing the body's nicotine reserves. As smokers, we added early withdrawal to every stressful event. You will soon discover an amazing sense of calm during crisis. You cannot quit for others. It must be your gift to you. Quitting for a child, spouse, parent or friend creates a natural sense of deprivation that will ultimately result in relapse. If quitting for another person, how will an addict's junkie mind respond the first time they disappoint us? A positive can-do attitude is important. We are what we think. Take pride in each hour of healing and freedom, and in each challenge overcome.  Celebrate the full and complete victory each reflects. The next few minutes are all that matter and each is entirely do-able. Yes you can! Years of smoking nicotine conditioned us to be extremely impatient, at least when it comes to our addiction. A deprived nicotine addict could inhale a puff of nicotine and have it arrive and release dopamine in their brain within just 8 seconds. Realize the importance of patience to successful recovery. Baby steps, just one hour, challenge and day at a time and then celebrate the new found patience you just demonstrated. Get rid of all cigarettes. Keeping a stash of cigarettes makes as much sense as someone on suicide watch keeping a loaded gun handy just to prove they can. Toying with a 50% chance of depriving yourself of 14 years of life isn't some game. Fully commit to going the distance and seeing what it's like to awaken to an expectation of going your entire day without once wanting to smoke nicotine. Oh, it'll still happen from time to time but such events will become the exception, not the rule. Amazingly, nicotine somehow doubles the rate by which the body depletes caffeine. Your blood-caffeine level will rise by 203% if no intake reduction is made when quitting. Although not a problem for most light to moderate caffeine users, consider a caffeine intake reduction if troubled by anxieties or if experiencing difficulty relaxing or sleeping. You conditioned your mind to expect nicotine when encountering certain locations, times, events, people or emotions. Be prepared for each event to trigger a brief crave episode. Encountering a trigger cannot trigger relapse unless you take a puff. Take heart, most triggers are reconditioned by a single encounter during which the subconscious mind fails to receive the expected result - nicotine. In contrast to conscious thought fixation (the "nice juicy steak" type thinking), no subconsciously triggered crave episode will last longer than three minutes. A recent study found that nicotine cessation causes serious time distortion. Although no crave episode will last longer than three minutes, to a quitter the minutes can feel like hours. Keep a clock handy to maintain honest perspective. The "average" number of crave episodes (each less than three minutes) experienced by the "average" quitter on their most challenging day of recovery is six episodes on day three. That's a total of 18 minutes of challenge on your most challenging day. But what if you're not average? What if you established and must encounter and recondition twice as many nicotine-feeding cues as the average quitter? That's 36 minutes of significant challenge. Can you handle 36 minutes of serious anxiety? Absolutely! We all can. Be prepared for a small spike in crave episodes on day seven as you celebrate your first full week of freedom from nicotine. Yes, for most of us smoking was part of every celebration, and also part of every celebration that for one reason or another suddenly turned sour. Also stay alert for subtle differences between crave triggers. For example, the Sunday newspaper is much thicker and may have required three cigarettes to read instead of just one. The average quitter will be experiencing just 1.4 crave episodes per day by day ten. After that you'll soon begin to experience entire days without encountering a single un-reconditioned subconscious crave trigger.  If a later crave episode ever feels far more intense it's likely that it has been some time since your last significant challenge and you've dropped your guard and defenses a bit.  It can feel as though you've been sucker punched.  If so, see the distance between challenges as a wonderful sign of subconscious healing. One coping method is to practice slow deep breathing when experiencing a crave episode. Try briefly clearing your mind of all needless chatter by focusing on your favorite person, place or thing. Another popular three minute crave coping exercise is to say your ABCs while associating each letter with your favorite food, person or place. For example, the letter "A" is for grandma's hot apple pie. "B" is for warm buttered biscuits. I think you'll find that you'll never make it to the challenging letter Q. Another coping technique is to mentally reach out and embrace your crave. A crave cannot cut you, burn you, kill you, or make you bleed. Try being brave just once. In your mind, wrap your arms around the crave's anxiety energy and then watch as it slowly fizzles and dies while in your embrace. Yes, another trigger bites the dust and victory is once again yours! Recognize the fact that everything you did as a smoker you will learn to again comfortably do as an ex-smoker.  Meet, greet and defeat your triggers, don't hide from them. You need not give up anything except nicotine. Be extremely careful with early alcohol use during the first couple of weeks. Using an inhibition diminishing substance and then intentionally surrounding yourself with smoking smokers, while still engaged in early withdrawal, is a recipe for relapse. Get your quitting feet under you first. If you do use alcohol, once ready to challenge your drinking triggers, consider breaking the challenge down into manageable trigger segments. Try drinking at home first without smokers around, go out with smokers but refrain from drinking, or consider spacing your drinks further apart, or drinking water or juice between drinks. Have an escape plan, and a backup, and be fully prepared to use them both. Don't expect family or friends who have never been chemically dependent themselves to have any appreciation of your challenges or the time required to achieve substantial comfort. It simply isn't fair to them or you. Recognize that smoking nicotine cannot solve any crisis. There is absolutely no legitimate excuse for relapse, including an auto accident, financial crisis, divorce, job loss, a terrorist attack, a hurricane, or the eventual inevitable death of those we love most. Unlike a less than three-minute subconscious crave episode, we can consciously fixate on any thought of wanting to smoke for as long as we're able to maintain our concentration.  Don't try to run or hide from thoughts of wanting but instead place the thought under honest light. Flavor?  Are there any taste buds inside your lungs? Treat nicotine dependency recovery as if it were no different than alcoholism. Don't debate with yourself about wanting "a" cigarette. Instead, ask yourself how you'd feel about going back to your old level of consumption or greater. Save the money you usually spend on cigarettes and buy yourself something you really want after a week or a month. Save for a year and treat yourself to a vacation. Quickly climb from that deep smoker's rut by spending time in places where you couldn't smoke, such as movies, libraries and no smoking sections of restaurants, by engaging in activities lasting longer than an hour, and by ever so slightly pushing your normal limits of physical endurance in order to sample the amazing healing within. Tell people around you that you have quit smoking.  Fully commit to your recovery while taking pride in each and every hour and day of freedom from nicotine. Avoid crutches.  A crutch is any form of quitting reliance that you lean upon so heavily in supporting your quit (yes, a noun) that if quickly removed would likely result in relapse. Do not lean heavily upon a quitting buddy who quits at the same time as you, as their odds of successfully quitting for one year are extremely small. Instead ask an ex-smoker for support, call your local Lung Association, Cancer Society or Heart Association office, or visit a free online support forum such as WhyQuit.com's Freedom from Tobacco. Be prepared for an extremely vivid smoking dream as tobacco odors emitted from horizontal healing lungs are swept up bronchial tubes by rapidly healing cilia, and come in contact with a vastly enhanced sense of smell. See it as the wonderful sign of healing it reflects and nothing more. Your quitting means thousands of dollars in lost profits to the tobacco industry. They do not want to lose you. See store tobacco advertising and the hundreds of neatly aligned packs and cartons for what they truly reflect - bait. Behind the pretty colored boxes and among more than 600 flavor additives is  hidden what many dependency experts now consider earth's most captivating chemical. Regardless of how long you've smoked, how old you are, or how badly you've damaged your body, it's never too late to arrest your dependency, become its master, and commence the deepest and most intense period of healing that your body and mind have likely ever known. Study smokers closely.  They are not smoking nicotine to tease you. They do so because they must, in order to replenish a constantly falling blood-serum nicotine level. Most nicotine is smoked while on autopilot.  What cue triggered the public feeding you're now witnessing?  Watch acid-producing events such as stress or alcohol quickly neutralize their body's nicotine reserves. Witness their endless mandatory cycle of replenishment. There is a major distinction between thinking about smoking and wanting to smoke. Don't confuse the two.  After years of smoking you should expect to notice and smell smokers (especially in movies) but it doesn't necessarily mean that you want to smoke. As for thoughts of wanting, with each passing day they'll gradually grow shorter in duration, generally less intense and a bit further apart. What should you call yourself?  Although it's normal to want to consider ourselves non-smokers, there is a major distinction between a never-smoker and an ex-smoker. Only the ex-smoker need protect against relapse. Don't let complacency destroy your healing and glory. The ingredients for relapse are a failing memory of why we quit and of the early challenges, rewriting the law of addiction to exempt or exclude ourselves, and an excuse such stress, celebration, illness, finances, war, death, or even a cigar at the birth of a baby. Remember that there are only two good reasons to take a puff once you quit. You decide you want to go back to your old level of consumption until smoking cripples and then kills you, or, you decide you really enjoy withdrawal and you want to make it last forever.  As long as neither of these options appeals to you - no nicotine just one day at a time ... Never Take Another Puff!  XXX  The above collection of quit smoking tips was compiled by John R.

Most smokers try this strategystopping all at once without the help of medication , nicotine replacement methods, or any formal therapyon their first attempt to give up cigarettes. But only about 3% to 10% are actually able to kick the habit without help. "It is like tightrope-walking without a net," says Thomas Glynn, director of cancer science and trends at the American Cancer Society. "It is natural to want to try to quit independently. Most people think they can handle quitting on their own, but they typically underestimate how powerful nicotine dependence really is." Why is it so hard to quit cold turkey? Most smokers are both physically and psychologically addicted to cigarettes. As a result, when they give up smoking, their bodies experience withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, insomnia, and depression, which can last up to three months. "I Quit My Pack-a-Day Habit Cold Turkey" Peter worried that his social life would suffer Read more More about quitting smoking 97 Reasons to Quit Smoking Alternative Methods for Quitting Smoking: Hypnosis, Acupuncture, Meditation Don't Go It Alone: Quitting Smoking in Support Groups Medication or over-the-counter aids like nicotine patches or gums help to mitigate these effects, and can therefore double or even triple your chance of success. But when you quit cold turkey, there is nothing in your body to serve as a buffer for withdrawal symptoms. This is one reason why smokers who quit abruptly are more likely to fall off the wagon. "The withdrawal symptoms were unbearable," says Evan Rabinowitz, 28, from Brooklyn, N.Y., who has tried to quit cold turkey four times. "I became incredibly agitated and irritable every time I tried to quit." It's important to remember, however, that every smoker is differentand some may find it more manageable to stop smoking without any help. Some think it is easier to deal with acute withdrawal than it is to put up with more mild symptoms for an extended period of time. Others say that weaning themselves off cigarettes with a nicotine patch or gum teases them and they prefer a more black-and-white approach. Experts say chances of success depend on several factors, not just a person's willpower. The extent of your addiction, your daily habits and routines, and the amount of support you get from friends and family can all have a big effect. "It really depends on your personality," says Norman Edelman, MD, chief medical officer at the American Lung Association. "What works for one person doesnt necessarily work for someone else. If you are macho and think you can tough it out, then give it a try. If it doesnt work, try another approach." Next Page: The upshot? It's free! [ pagebreak ] Is there an upside to quitting cold turkey? Flying solo may not be the most successful way to quit, but it does have certain advantages. It takes less time and less work than going to counseling sessions , keeping appointments, and digging deep into the emotional and mental issues behind your smoking habit. The biggest upside for many smokers is that it is free. That was certainly why Rabinowitz decided to give it a try. "One of the primary motivations for quitting has been the financial cost of smoking," he says. "I am not inclined to try expensive cessation aids such as patches or medication." Tips to help you quit If you do decide to quit without any outside help, that doesn't mean you shouldn't at least have a plan. In fact, one of the reasons why unaided attempts fail so often, Glynn says, is because most smokers decide to quit on the spur of the moment or without adequate planning. "Quitting smoking is a process," he adds. "Cold-turkey quits would be much more successful if smokers prepared ahead of time." If you think you may want to try quitting cold turkey, there are some things you can do to boost your chances of success: Have a plan. Decide on a quit day and get rid of any items that remind you of smokinglike lighters and ashtraysahead of time. Inform your friends and family that you are going to quit and ask for their encouragement. Switch it up. Change your routine. If you always smoke when you go out with a certain group of friends, take a break from themor at least from activities related to smokinguntil your withdrawal symptoms subside. Keep your mouth busy. Experts say that keeping your mouth occupiedwith sugarless gum, cinnamon sticks, or even drug-free, imitation cigarettes can help you fight the urge to light up. Drink water. Rather than munching on food to satisfy your nicotine cravings (which can cause the weight gain that often accompanies smoking cessation), sipping water can keep your mouth occupied and will help you feel alert. Try carrying a water bottle around with you to keep yourself hydrated throughout the day. Avoid alcohol and coffee. Stay away from drinks that you may associate with lighting up. "For many smokers, cigarettes and alcohol are interconnected," says Glynn. "You want to break that connection for a while during quitting." Be active . Easing yourself into a light exercise routine can distract you from smoking, motivate you to stay healthy, and help you avoid post-cessation weight gain. Inspire yourself. Make a list of all the reasons why you want to quit and keep it in your pocket. Look at it when you get discouraged. If after all this you still find yourself struggling with cravings but dont want to resort to medication, get some support. Find an online smoking-cessation aid, such as the American Lung Associations Freedom from Smoking program or a local support group , such as Nicotine Anonymous .

Photograph: Yui Mok/PA     Success rates for smokers trying to give up have hit a record high in part thanks to the increasing use of e-cigarettes, figures reveal.  Nearly 20% of those who attempted to quit in the first half of 2017 managed to kick the habit, a University College London report shows.  By contrast, over the past decade the average has been 15.7%. UCL researchers defined successful quitting as not having smoked in the previous 12 months.  The increase in those giving up has been driven by a sharp increase in kicking the habit among the less well off. Success rates among poorer people have historically been low but, for the first time, smokers with manual jobs have practically the same chance of quitting as those in white collar jobs.  E-cigarettes have become the most popular method of quitting nationwide. In many ways, they mimic the experience of smoking a cigarette and are a far more attractive proposition for many people than putting on a nicotine patch. Their usage, combined with local stop smoking services, is the most effective way to give up.  The news comes as Public Health England (PHE) prepare to launch new TV adverts to encourage people to try e-cigarettes if they are struggling to quit regular smoking.  The UCL report gives a number of other reasons to explain why people are enjoying success in quitting smoking.      Ten years after the smoking ban, vaping is a £1bn business           Read more       The added restrictions on smoking in public places and elsewhere discourages the practice, the banning of the use of attractive brand imagery on tobacco packaging has seen sales fall sharply , plus there has been the development of a strong anti-smoking culture in England.  This has helped stop-smoking campaigns such as Stoptober , which runs through October, become so effective. Last year more than half (53%) of all those taking part in Stoptober used an e-cigarette as a quitting aid.  This year the TV ad for the campaign will promote e-cigarettes as an alternative to smoking while the campaign will do more to encourage smokers keen to try e-cigarettes to help them stop smoking.  Not everyone is convinced of the benefits of e-cigarettes though. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has issued new guidance that does not list e-cigarettes as an aid to stopping smoking.  It warns that patients should be told by doctors there is currently little evidence on the benefits or harms of e-cigarettes. They are, indeed, not a universal panacea and experts are keen to stress the challenges that lay ahead.  The deputy chief medical officer, Prof Gina Radford, said: “The battle against smoking is far from over – it is still the country’s biggest killer, causing 79,000 deaths a year. And for every death, another 20 smokers are suffering from a smoking-related disease.  “Far too many people are still dying as a result of smoking but there has never been a better time to quit – the culture has changed, strong legislation is in place and effective support is available.”    Topics     Smoking        E-cigarettes    Health    news         Share on Facebook           Share on Twitter           Share via Email           Share on LinkedIn           Share on Pinterest           Share on Google+           Share on WhatsApp           Share on Messenger               Reuse this content                             Most viewed                            UK    UK politics    Education    Media    Society    Law    Scotland    Wales    Northern Ireland          back to top                 jobs   become a supporter   make a contribution   guardian labs     about us   work for us   contact us   advertise with us     help   terms & conditions   privacy policy   cookie policy   securedrop   complaints & corrections     all topics   all contributors   Facebook   Twitter   subscribe   digital newspaper archive       © 2018 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Quitting smoking greatly reduces the risk of developing smoking-related diseases .  Tobacco/nicotine dependence is a condition that often requires repeated treatments, but there are helpful treatments and resources for quitting .  Smokers can and do quit smoking. In fact, today there are more former smokers than current smokers . 1     Nicotine Dependence   Most smokers become addicted to nicotine, a drug that is found naturally in tobacco. 2   More people in the United States are addicted to nicotine than to any other drug. 3 Research suggests that nicotine may be as addictive as heroin, cocaine, or alcohol. 1,2,4   Quitting smoking is hard and may require several attempts. 4,5 People who stop smoking often start again because of withdrawal symptoms, stress, and weight gain. 4,5,6   Nicotine withdrawal symptoms may include: 4,6  Feeling irritable, angry, or anxious  Having trouble thinking  Craving tobacco products  Feeling hungrier than usual        Health Benefits of Quitting    Tobacco smoke contains a deadly mix of more than 7,000 chemicals; hundreds are harmful, and about 70 can cause cancer. 1,4,7 Smoking increases the risk for serious health problems, many diseases, and death. 1,4  People who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk for disease and early death. Although the health benefits are greater for people who stop at earlier ages, there are benefits at any age. 1,4,8,9 You are never too old to quit .     Stopping smoking is associated with the following health benefits: 1,4,8,9    Lowered risk for lung cancer and many other types of cancer.  Reduced risk for heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease (narrowing of the blood vessels outside your heart).  Reduced heart disease risk within 1 to 2 years of quitting.  Reduced respiratory symptoms, such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. While these symptoms may not disappear, they do not continue to progress at the same rate among people who quit compared with those who continue to smoke.  Reduced risk of developing some lung diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also known as COPD, one of the leading causes of death in the United States).  Reduced risk for infertility in women of childbearing age. Women who stop smoking during pregnancy also reduce their risk of having a low birth weight baby.      Smokers’ Attempts to Quit  Among all current U.S. adult cigarette smokers, nearly 7 out of every 10 (68.0%) reported in 2015 that they wanted to quit completely. 10    Since 2002, the number of former smokers has been greater than the number of current smokers.   Percentage of adult daily cigarette smokers who stopped smoking for more than 1 day in 2015 because they were trying to quit: 10    More than 5 out of 10 (55.4%) of all adult smokers  Nearly 7 out of 10 (66.7%) smokers aged 18–24 years  Nearly 6 out of 10 (59.8%) smokers aged 25–44 years  More than 4 out of 10 (49.6%) smokers aged 45–64 years  About 4 out of 10 (47.2%) smokers aged 65 years or older   Percentage of high school cigarette smokers who tried to stop smoking in the past 12 months: 11    More than 4 out of 10 (45.5%) of all high school students who smoke      Ways to Quit Smoking  Most former smokers quit without using one of the treatments that scientific research has shown can work. 10 However, the following treatments are proven to be effective for smokers who want help to quit:   Brief help by a doctor (such as when a doctor takes 10 minutes or less to give a patient advice and assistance about quitting) 6   Individual, group, or telephone counseling 6   Behavioral therapies (such as training in problem solving) 6   Treatments with more person-to-person contact and more intensity (such as more or longer counseling sessions) 6   Programs to deliver treatments using mobile phones 12    Medications for quitting that have been found to be effective include the following:   Nicotine replacement products 6  Over-the-counter (nicotine patch [which is also available by prescription], gum, lozenge)  Prescription (nicotine patch, inhaler, nasal spray)    Prescription non-nicotine medications: bupropion SR (Zyban ® ), 6 varenicline tartrate (Chantix ® ) 6,13    Counseling and medication are both effective for treating tobacco dependence, and using them together is more effective than using either one alone. 6    More information is needed about quitting for people who smoke cigarettes and also use other types of tobacco. 1       Helpful Resources  Quitline Services  Call 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669) if you want help quitting .
