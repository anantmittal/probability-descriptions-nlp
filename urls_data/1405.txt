       The Probability of Collisions with Earth     The Probability of Collisions with Earth  Most bodies in the solar system with a visible solid surface exhibit craters.
On Earth we see very few because geological processes such as weathering and
erosion soon destroy the obvious evidence. On bodies with no atmosphere, such
as Mercury or the Moon, craters are everywhere. Without going into detail,
there is strong evidence of a period of intense cratering in the solar system
that ended about 3.9 billion years ago. Since that time cratering appears to
have continued at a much slower and fairly uniform rate. The cause of the
craters is impacts by comets and asteroids. Most asteroids follow simple
circular orbits between the planets Mars and Jupiter, but all of these
asteroids are perturbed, occasionally by each other and more regularly and
dramatically by Jupiter. As a result some find themselves in orbits that cross
that of Mars or even Earth. Comets on the other hand follow highly elongated
orbits that often come close to Earth or other major bodies to begin with.
These orbits are greatly affected if they come anywhere near Jupiter. Over the
eons every moon and planet finds itself in the wrong place in its orbit at the
wrong time and suffers the insult of a major impact. The Earth's atmosphere protects us from the multitude of small debris, the size
of grains of sand or pebbles, thousands of which pelt our planet every day. The
meteors in our night sky are visible evidence of this small debris burning up
high in the atmosphere. In fact, up to a diameter of about 10-meters (33 feet),
most stony meteoroids are destroyed in the atmosphere in thermal explosions.
Obviously some fragments do reach the ground, because we have stony meteorites
in our museums. Such falls are known to cause property damage from time to
time. On October 9, 1992, a fire ball was seen streaking across the sky all the
way from Kentucky to New York. A 27-pound stony meteorite (chondrite) from the
fireball fell in Peekskill, New York, punching a hole in the rear end of an
automobile parked in a driveway and coming to rest in a shallow depression
beneath it. Falls into a Connecticut dining room and an Alabama bedroom are
well documented incursions in this century. A 10-meter body typically has the
kinetic energy of about five nuclear warheads of the size dropped on Hiroshima,
however, and the shock wave it creates can do considerable damage even if
nothing but comparatively small fragments survive to reach the ground.
Many fragments of a 10-meter iron meteoroid will reach the ground. The only
well-studied example of such a fall in recent times took place in the
Sikhote-Alin Mountains of eastern Siberia on February 12, 1947. About 150 US
tons of fragments reached the ground, the largest intact fragment weighing
3,839 pounds. The fragments covered an area of about 1 x 2 kilometers (0.6 x
1.2 miles), within which there were 102 craters greater than 1 meter in
diameter, the largest of them 26.5 meters (87 feet), and about 100 more smaller
craters. If this small iron meteoroid had landed in a city, it obviously would
have created quite a stir. The effect of the larger pieces would be comparable
to having a car suddenly drop in at supersonic speeds! Such an event occurs
about once per decade somewhere on Earth, but most of them are never recorded,
occurring at sea or in some remote region such as Antarctica. It is a fact that
there is no record in modern times of any person being killed by a meteorite.
It is the falls larger than 10 meters that start to become really worrisome.
The 1908 Tunguska event was a stony meteorite in the 100-meter class. The
famous meteor crater in northern Arizona, some 1219 meters (4,000 feet) in
diameter and 183 meters (600 feet) deep, was created 50,000 years ago by a
nickel-iron meteorite perhaps 60 meters in diameter. It probably survived
nearly intact until impact, at which time it was pulverized and largely
vaporized as its 6-7 x 1016 joules* of kinetic energy were rapidly dissipated
in an explosion equivalent to some 15 million tons of TNT! Falls of this class
occur once or twice every 1000 years. There are now over 100 ring-like structures on Earth recognized as definite
impact craters. Most of them are not obviously craters, their identity masked
by heavy erosion over the centuries, but the minerals and shocked rocks present
make it clear that impact was their cause. The Ries Crater in Bavaria is a lush
green basin some 25 kilometers (15 miles) in diameter with the city of
Nordlingen in the middle. Fifteen million years ago a 1500-meter (5000 feet)
asteroid or comet hit there, excavating more than a trillion tons of material
and scattering it all over Europe. This sort of thing happens about once every
million years or so. Another step upward in size take us to Chicxulub, an event
that occurs once in 50-100 million years. Chicxulub is the largest crater known
which seems definitely to have an impact origin, but there are a few ring-like
structures that are 2-3 times larger yet about which geologists are uncertain.
There are now more than 150 asteroids known that come nearer to the Sun than
the outermost point of Earth's orbit. These range in diameter from a few meters
up to about 8 kilometers. A working group chaired by Dr. David Morrison, NASA
Ames Research Center, estimates that there are some 2,100 such asteroids larger
than 1 kilometer and perhaps 320,000 larger than 100 meters, the size that
caused the Tunguska event and the Arizona Meteor Crater. An impact by one of
these larger meteors in the wrong place would be a catastrophe, but it would
not threaten civilization. However, the working group concluded that an impact
by an asteroid larger than 1-2 kilometers could degrade the global climate,
leading to widespread crop failure and loss of life. Such global environmental
catastrophes, which place the entire population of the Earth at risk, are
estimated to take place several times per million years on average. A still
larger impact by an object larger than about 5 kilometers is damaging enough to
cause mass extinctions. In addition there are many comets in the 1-10 kilometer
class, 15 of them in short-period orbits that pass inside the Earth's orbit,
and an unknown number of long-period comets. Virtually any short-period comet
among the 100 or so not currently coming near the Earth could become dangerous
after a close passage by Jupiter. This all sounds pretty scary. However, as noted earlier, no human in the past
1000 years is known to have been killed by a meteorite or by the effects of one
impacting. (There are ancient Chinese records of such deaths.) An individual's
chance of being killed by a meteorite is small, but the risk increases with the
size of the impacting comet or asteroid, with the greatest risk associated with
global catastrophes resulting from impacts of objects larger than 1 kilometer.
NASA knows of no asteroid or comet currently on a collision course with Earth,
so the probability of a major collision is quite small. In fact, as best as we
can tell, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next
several hundred years. To be able to better calculate the statistics,
astronomers need to detect as many of the near-Earth objects as possible. It's
likely that we could identify a threatening near-Earth object large enough to
potentially cause catastrophic changes in the Earth's environment, and most
astronomers believe that a systematic approach to studying asteroids and comets
that pass close to the Earth makes good sense. It's too late for the dinosaurs,
but today astonomers are conducting ever-increasing searches to identify all of
the larger objects which pose an impact danger to Earth. * joule: a unit of measurement, the amount of energy corresponding to one watt

It’s time to test a deflector mission. It could save us all.  By Phil Plait                                               A meteorite trail is seen above an apartment block in Chelyabinsk, Russia, on Feb. 15, 2013.  Photo by Oleg Kargopolov/AFP/Getty Images       Your odds of dying in an asteroid impact are about one in 700,000 .    Surprising, isn’t it? That’s about the same chance you have of dying in a flood or a fireworks accident over your lifetime . It may be even more surprising when you consider that there has never even been a confirmed human death resulting from an impact. But this number involves something of a trick: A big enough impact will kill everyone on Earth . A smaller impact might devastate a local region on Earth, but a big one can wipe out entire species. Just ask the dinosaurs …        Phil Plait    Phil Plait writes Slate ’s Bad Astronomy blog and is an astronomer, public speaker, science evangelizer, and author of Death From the Skies!                For a global event, you get these odds roughly by dividing the time between impacts by the average human lifespan. But it’s still a little misleading because it’s similar to the lottery: The chance is 100 percent that someone will win the lottery, but the chances are extremely low that you specifically will. Your odds of dying in an impact event are pretty low, but the odds of some random person somewhere getting killed are higher.    Advertisement       Of course, asteroid impacts are a lottery you get to play whether you want to or not.    Today is a good day to think about all this: It’s the first anniversary of the Chelyabinsk impact over Russia. On Feb. 15, 2013 (it was still Feb. 14 in U.S. time), a rock the size of a house came screaming in from space. In a single moment, its huge energy of motion was converted into light and heat. The resulting explosion was the equivalent of a half-million tons of TNT detonating all at once. Even though it exploded dozens of kilometers above the Earth’s surface, the shock wave shook the ground, set off car alarms, and shattered windows. More than 1,000 people were injured, some seriously, by flying glass.         Amazingly, no one was killed, but it shows quite vividly that the threat of asteroid impacts is quite real.    So when will the Earth get hit again? And what can we do about it?    Advertisement       * * *    The Earth gets hit by about 100 tons of material every day, but that’s in the form of tiny pebbles that burn up high in the atmosphere and produce shooting stars.    Big impacts are rare. The Chelyabinsk asteroid was 19 meters (62 feet) in diameter, and, on average, we should expect an impact from an object that size somewhere on Earth about once every 25 years. (Because most of the planet is covered in water, many of these go unnoticed.)       A small chunk of Chelyabinsk meteorite, given to me by a friend.  Photo by Phil Plait       Bigger impacts are more rare. In 1908 an object 30 meters or so in diameter came across the Earth, exploding high over a swampy region of the Russian countryside near the Tunguska River . The yield was equivalent to a 15 megaton nuclear bomb! Something like this Tunguska event (as it’s now called) happens every few centuries on average.    Advertisement       You probably know that the dinosaurs were taken out by an asteroid or comet about 10 kilometers wide. Happily, those events are extremely rare, occurring on a timescale of tens of millions of years. As it happens, we’re pretty sure there’s no dinosaur-killer on its way to Earth for the next few centuries. But the lesson of Chelyabinsk and Tunguska is that it doesn’t take a flying mountain to ruin your whole day. A hill will do nicely.

Photo ITAR-TASS Itar-Tass Photos/Newscom       If we want to prevent asteroid impacts from happening, the first thing we need to do is spot these threats. And we’re working pretty hard on that.    Astronomers have built quite a few observatories dedicated to patiently scanning the heavens looking for blips of light. Thousands of near-Earth asteroids have been found this way, their orbits meticulously calculated, projected into the future, and determined to be potentially threatening or not.    As things stand now, we don’t have the capability to find them all. But we will, soon. The huge Pan-STARRS telescope is looking deep for threats and is already producing data. LSST is a planned monster 8-meter telescope specifically designed to look for near-Earth objects and is expected to catalog hundreds of thousands of them.         A chunk of the asteroid that exploded over Russia on Feb. 15, 2013, was extracted from the bottom of Lake Chebarkul.  Photo by Anton Melnikov/Reuters       Advertisement       To extend our vision, two spacecraft are currently in the works , too. They’ll have a better view above our turbulent atmosphere, and by using infrared detectors they can more easily spot the warm glow of rocks orbiting the Sun.    Even with all these eyes on the sky, there are roughly a million such rocks that could potentially, someday, impact the Earth. Eventually, it’s bound to happen: We’ll spot one with our name on it. What then?    * * *    You won’t like this answer much, but: nothing. As things currently stand, even if we had a few years’ warning, there’s little we could do to stop an impact. It takes time to plan a mission, build it, launch it, travel to the rock, and then do whatever it is you plan to do.    Advertisement       But let’s say we did have a rocket waiting to launch. What do we do with it?    If you watch movies, the answer is easy: Nuke it! But that might not be the best option. For one thing, it’s a bit ham-fisted and hard to control. You might hit the asteroid and shatter it, turning one big rock into a bunch of slightly smaller, still-dangerous (and radioactive!) ones. Also, timing is a problem; remember, these asteroids are moving at high speed, so detonating the bomb at just the right exact moment might prove tricky.    It helps to remember the goal: You want to make the asteroid not hit the Earth . When you think of it that way, a better solution is to change its velocity—speed it up or slow it down—so it’ll whiz past us without an impact.    For this, you don’t need a bomb, just the rocket itself. Literally aim the rocket directly at the asteroid and hit it as hard as you can! The purpose would be to use the momentum of the rocket to change the momentum of the rock enough to do the job.    Advertisement       The key to this trick is time. The Earth is 8,000 miles across, so at most you have to move the asteroid 4,000 miles to make it miss. If you have, say, two years of advance warning you need only change the velocity of the rock by one-fifth of a mile per hour to make it miss. That’s far less than walking speed! And the longer lead time you have, the less the change needs to be. For big rocks that’s still a problem, but again, finding them farther in advance is our best bet.    The B612 Foundation has made it its mission to do just this. The group includes scientists and engineers who investigate how best to stop an incoming asteroid or comet, and they have found this impactor method to be feasible. But they found a subtle problem: You might push the rock into an orbit that’ll just make it hit us at some other time . You’ve prevented an impact in two years, but now you’ve forced one to happen in, say, five years!     I love this idea. It’s right out of Star Trek ! And it’s actually doable.     You could hit it again, but then the same problem might occur, and rockets are expensive. This is where the B612 folks came up with a fantastic idea: a gravity tractor .    Instead of a single payload to whack the asteroid, you also send along a probe that has a lot of a mass, maybe a ton or so. It has some small amount of gravity that can be used to literally tow the asteroid into a safe orbit once the impactor has done its job. That way, you can ensure no impact from that rock will occur, ever.    I love this idea . It’s right out of Star Trek ! And it has the added bonus of being actually doable.    Mind you, we could build such a mission right now, since much of the tech is off-the-shelf. But it’s never been tested together in this way, and I think this should be a priority. Hitting a rock only a few hundred meters across at multiple times the speed of a rifle bullet is something I think we should test before it counts for the final grade. A mission like that might cost a billion or so dollars, but it’s worth it.    Think of it this way: It costs a fraction of a percent of the total price of a car to add seat belts. The cost of a mission to prevent an asteroid impact would be far less than that percentage of our national annual budget; it would be less than one percent of just NASA’s budget over the 10 years it would take to build and test it. You can drive your whole life and never need a seat belt, but given enough time there will be an asteroid impact big enough to cause major damage.    That sounds like a good investment to me.    The science-fiction author Larry Niven once said that the difference between us and the dinosaurs is that we have a space program.    I would add that while we do have a space program, we still haven’t made the choice to use it this way. The cost to do so is small, but the price to not do so is unthinkable.    So, we can now answer our original question: When will the Earth suffer its next big impact?    If we make the right choice, then the answer to our question is: never .

This is an artist's conception of an impact.  But that is a much bigger rock than anything that's hit Earth in a very long time.  Even the "dinosaur" killer was tiny compared to this illustration (more on that below).            What are the odds?  That was then, this is now  The Earth has been getting hit by asteroids and comets for its whole life. The planets formed from collisions of smaller objects, and even our water may have come largely from comets. Heavy bombardments may have continued until as recently as 4 billion years ago, making it difficult for life to get a foothold at all (the "Late Heavy Bombardment").  The odds today  There are a lot more small rocks than big ones. So while Earth is constantly being "hit" -- accumulating over 100 tons of matter ever day -- most of this is in the form of dust or tiny sand-grain sized meteors that appear as shooting stars.  By comparison, school bus-sized asteroids may hit every thousand years or so, medium sized (say 300 meter) asteroids might be once every 50,000 years, and extinction level events only every billion years. And those estimates are going down.  Making the world safer  The Spaceguard Survey is an attempt to locate and track as many near-Earth objects (NEOs) as possible.  Each time astronomers identify an asteroid that isn't on a collision course with Earth, the calculated odds of an impact go down a little bit. By the time the current survey is completed the estimated odds of dying in an asteroid impact will have decreased by a factor of 10, from 1 in 70,000 to 1 in 700,000.  Assuming, of course, that they don't find one that really is going to hit.  How big is big?  People tend to think that an "extinction level" asteroid or comet would look like the picture at the top of the page. But in reality it could be very, very small compared to Earth . The "dino killer" is estimated to have been between 5 and 15 kilometers across (3 to 10 miles). That's large compared to the rocks in your backyard, but tiny compared to Earth (check out the image on the right to see just how small it would be).  To lead to a global catastrophe, an asteroid or comet only has to be big enough to launch large amounts of dust in to the atmosphere.  That leads to the abrupt change in climate that wipes out species.  So what are the risks?  The odds of a major asteroid impact are very small. But the risk of you dying in an asteroid impact might be higher than you think. Why? Because while the odds of an impact are small, the number of people who would be killed is so high that the risk (impact odds times the number killed) isn't negligible. Check out our risk game and see how those odds compare to other risks.  What about Apophis?  Apophis is an asteroid about 270 meters across (almost three football fields). In 2029 it will pass very close to the Earth: within the orbits of our communication satellites. It won't hit; however there is a slight chance that this close pass will shift its orbit exactly the right amount to cause it to hit Earth on a second pass in 2036. The odds are small though: as of 2009 the odds are estimate at 1 in 250,000, but that estimate will continue to be refined.        We've added a properly scaled dino-killer  asteroid to this NASA Blue Marble image of Earth. Can you find it?    Drop some asteroids and comets on the city of your choice.

But before you panic, know that the chances are still quite slim: one in 63,000; NASA says it is 99.998% positive the asteroid will fly by us. It has already done so once: Ukrainian astronomers say the 1,345-foot asteroid came within 4.2 million miles of Earth on Sept. 16, but will come within one million miles on Aug. 26, 2032, CNN reports . But if it did hit, the impact would cause an explosion "50 times greater than the most powerful nuclear bomb ever used," the Telegraph reports . NASA's Don Yeomans notes that "this is a relatively new discovery. With more observations, I fully expect we will be able to significantly reduce, or rule out entirely, any impact probability for the foreseeable future." In the meantime, RT News points out 2013 TV135 has a danger rating of one on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale (which runs to 10), meaning there is "no cause for public attention or concern." Of course, it notes that only one asteroid currently has that rating; the rest are at zero. (In related news, scientists have spotted the remains of a water-rich asteroid orbiting a dying star about 170 light-years from Earth, and that has fascinating implications .)

Astronomists have analysed around 2,000 giant space rocks which are currently hurtling towards the Earth, predicting the odds of them actually hitting our planet.  Getty Images  And they have concluded that the next really big threat is from the star Gliese 710, which will "severely mess up our solar system" when it comes within just 77 light days from our planet.  But with Gliese 710 not due to reach the Earth for another 1.35million years, boffins think we should be safe until then.  Nasa has revealed an asteroid will fly very close to the Earth on February 25 , but there is virtually zero chance it could hit the planet as it will burn up in our atmosphere.

An asteroid measuring 500ft in diameter is the most likely to hit Earth, with a one in 625 chance of striking, the video explains. But it would be more than 160 years before the asteroid hit the planet.  The video reveals when asteroids are expected to reach the earth and the odds they will collide  The biggest threat is from star Gliese 710 but it's not expected to reach us for another 1.35million years  Another asteroid measuring 1,600ft wide has a 1 in 2,700 chance of hitting earth. And a larger asteroid, measuring 4,200ft in diameter, is the third most likely to hit - but only has a one in 8,333 chance of striking in the year 2880.  When Gliese 710 arrives at Earth in 1.35million years, it is expected to push asteroids from the outer reaches of the solar system towards Earth, having a potentially catastrophic impact.  Giant asteroids over 6.2 miles in size are capable of wiping out life on Earth, but the last one known to hit was 66 million years ago which destroyed 75 per cent of all life, including the dinosaurs.  On average, Earth is hit once a year by elephant-sized asteroids, while bigger asteroids measuring 25ft across hit around every four years.  These are rarely witnessed as they either burn up in the atmosphere or land in the sea.  Larger asteroids which are the size of a six-storey building hit Earth around twice a century.

By Elizabeth Howell   Published On 06/06/2017  4:41 PM EDT         Share on Facebook      Tweet this article       Email                  Earth may be threatened by a newly discovered branch of a stream of meteoroids, increasing the risk that the planet will be struck by a meteoroid or asteroid.   A team of astronomers from the Czech Academy of Sciences announced the findings on Tuesday after studying the Taurid meteoroid stream. The stream produces a meteor shower that usually has a long period of activity in October and November and produces a low number of meteors. The meteors — light phenomena that are seen when a meteoroid enters the planet’s atmosphere and vaporizes, also referred to as “shooting stars” — occur when Earth’s orbit plows into the stream of debris left behind by Comet Encke.   Most of these particles are quite tiny and pose no threat whatsoever, but the Czech astronomers have tracked a new branch of the stream from which particles are intersecting with the planet. The branch includes two asteroids with diameters of between 200 and 300 meters (roughly 650-1000 feet). These asteroids are not themselves on a collision course with Earth, but their identification suggests that there may be other asteroids of this size or larger lurking undiscovered within this stream.   As such, the astronomers are urging a concentrated search for more Taurid asteroids, to see if any potentially threatening ones exist.   “Since asteroids of sizes of tens to hundreds meters pose a threat to the ground even if they are intrinsically weak, impact hazard increases significantly when the Earth encounters the Taurid new branch every few years,” they write in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics . “Further studies leading to [a] better description of this real source of potentially hazardous objects, which can be large enough to cause significant regional or even continental damage on the Earth, are therefore extremely important.”   It’s worth noting, however, that no threatening objects have yet been discovered . Though the prospect of continental damage and regional catastrophe coming from space is alarming, more observations will be needed before drawing conclusions based on the Czech team’s research.    RELATED: What to Do With Nukes? Blow Up Dangerous Comets, of Course    NASA is regularly working to anticipate the possible collision of a massive cosmic particle with Earth and assess any potential impact risks. It operates a collision monitoring system called Sentry that routinely scans for asteroids and determines the likelihood of impact over the next 100 years. It also freely catalogs these rocky bodies at the JPL Small-Body Database Browser .   The debris stream from Comet Encke is influenced in part by the gravity of Jupiter, a massive gas giant planet that is known to influence the orbits of comets and asteroids in that region of the solar system. As such, from time Jupiter’s gravity can redirect the debris so that more particles hit the Earth.                   Share on Facebook      Tweet this article         A bright Taurid fireball is recorded at the NASA All Sky Fireball Network station in Tullahoma, Tennessee in 2014.  NASA      During one of these “enhanced” Taurid meteor showers in 2015 caused by Encke’s redirection, the astronomers from the Czech Academy of Sciences analyzed 144 Taurid fireballs — meteors that produce a large flash when they hit the atmosphere. Observations were taken from the European Fireball Network.   Of the analyzed fireballs, about 113 of them have common characteristics, including sharing approximately the same orbit. The astronomers concluded, based on previous showers, that these fireballs come from a new branch of the Taurid stream being redirected by Jupiter’s gravity.    RELATED: We're Planning to Shoot an Asteroid to See What Happens    Next, the astronomers analyzed the orbital paths of asteroids 2015 TX24 and 2005 UR. Due to their similarities to the newly discovered path of the Taurid fireballs, the astronomers in turn argued that these two asteroids — each about 200-300 meters in diameter — are also members of the new branch.   Analysis of the fireballs suggests that the large asteroids are weak in structure, although at larger sizes they would not break up easily in the Earth’s atmosphere.   A few years ago, NASA created a Planetary Defense Coordination Office to bring together the observations of all US networks looking for near-Earth asteroids, and to help come up with plans in the unlikely chance that the Earth is under threat. You can read more about the office’s work at its website . Other countries, such as the European Union, have similar asteroid observation networks in place.

However, new calculations made by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) show that Apophis' odds of Earth impact are lower than previously estimated.        "We cannot yet exclude the possibility that it could impact our planet, but we can calculate that the chance of Earth impact is only one-in-100,000 over the next century, which, of course, is extremely small," Paul Chodas, manager of JPL's Center for Near Earth Object Studies told Astrowatch.net.  Discovered in 2004, asteroid Apophis is slated to fly by Earth on April 13, 2029. Initial observations of this space rock indicated that it has one in 36 chance of hitting the Earth on that day, but additional monitoring of Apophis completely ruled out this possibility.  However, Alberto Cellino of the Observatory of Turin in Italy told Astrowatch.net in June that although the potential impact in 2029 was excluded, we cannot rule out such an event in the more distant future. Given the fact that NEO orbits are chaotic, what is not dangerous today can become a candidate impactor in the future.  That is why astronomers, including Chodas, emphasize the importance of detailed observations of Apophis and its constant monitoring, which could confirm that this asteroid poses no danger to us.  "Apophis is certainly a hazardous asteroid, and for that reason, it has been tracked extensively. And so we know its orbit very accurately. In all likelihood, further tracking measurements will eliminate even that possibility (one in 100,000)," Chodas noted.  Astronomers estimate that on April 13, 2029, Apophis will pass by the Earth at a distance of no closer than 18,300 miles (29,470 kilometers). The next close approach of this asteroid is expected in April 2036, when it will miss Earth at a much larger distance of approximately 30.5 million miles (49 million kilometers).  Currently, there are 1,803 potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) detected to date. PHAs are space rocks larger than approximately 100 meters that can come closer to Earth than 4.65 million miles (7.5 million kilometers). However, none of the known PHAs is on a collision course with Earth.

The probability that Apophis will hit the Earth sometime in the future is quite high.  There are three interesting ways humans can modify that probability.   1) Putting a sufficiently large mass in Apophis's path in 2029 could target the moon. It might not get there for a century or two, which is good, because it would allow a better choice. 2)  Do the same, but instead put it in orbit around the Earth.  In this case it would probably be intended as a carbon source for making a space elevator, and eventually the far anchor point. 3) Land an engine with a human or robot crew, and use it for trips between Earth and Mars.  The engine needed is not that big, the goal is to have Apophis pass near Earth and then Mars on a regular basis.  Any passengers would need to accelerate to catch it, then decelerate at the end of the trip.  Why?  To provide lots of radiation shielding during the trip.

Please no. 3) Land an engine with a human or robot crew, and use it for trips between Earth and Mars. Erm. Nope, no and not a chance. Check out the size (and specifically the mass) of Apophis. Then do some rough back-of-the-envelope calcs about the stuff you're suggesting. (Hint: Apophis is estimated to have roughly 10000 times the mass of a modern day aircraft carrier...Neeeeo. We're not gonna move this to Mars, to the Moon, or anywhere else with an 'engine not that big'. We're not gonna impress this sucker - even with a nuke. Or 10. Or 100.)

Hint: Changing the orbit of Apophis slightly when it is deep in the Earth's gravitational field amplifies the effect.  Changing Apophis' momentum/velocity vector slightly can send it deep into the Earth's gravitational field in the future.   There are a few hundred tons of otherwise dead or obsolete satellites in geosynch orbit that can be easily (in terms of delta-v) placed where they will be struck by Apophis.  You get much more delta-v than from flying an engine to Apophis.  Do the math. As for making Apophis a joint satellite of Earth and Mars, you again get to play with gravitational fields doing most of the work.  (I call these dynamic orbits.)  Well, computers do a lot of the work as well.       rrwillsj     1 / 5 (2)  Oct 10, 2017    Oh yeah!

But this was not a one-time occurrence.  Celestial bodies have hit Earth before and are bound to do so again . The billion dollar question is: Could the impact trigger another mass extinction?  To answer this question properly, we need to understand the origin of objects set on a collision course with our planet. Three best “sources“ of Earth-bound celestial material are the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, the Oort cloud and Kuiper belt. The Oort cloud is believed to be a thick bubble of icy debris that surrounds our solar system, and a probable origin of most of the long-period comets that have been observed. The Kuiper belt is a disc-shaped region populated with hundreds of thousands of icy bodies larger than 100 km (62 miles) in diameter, and an estimated one trillion or more comets beyond the orbit of Neptune.      William Crochot       These two regions, while both rich in gigantic space debris, contribute to the extinction scenarios in vastly different ways. While the Oort cloud is quite dense, consisting of billions of comets, it’s very unlikely that many of them jeopardized Earth in the past. In fact, simulations run by scientists confirm that in the past 500 million years, just two or three comets may have struck Earth, causing powerful meteor showers.  The Kuiper belt is next on our list of suspects. Its disc-like structure makes it easier for the comets to find their way to our solar system, but more often than not, they get pulled in by the Sun and evaporate.  Still, movements of both Oort cloud and Kuiper belt objects are complex, and their interactions with other celestial bodies are far from predictable and periodic. In fact, many of them can get pulled from their initial state into orbits of planets and various other celestial bodies, where they can be further slung toward our solar system. The majority of them leave the solar system, collide with other planets and moons, or simply evaporate, passing too close to our Sun. Those that do hit Earth either burn out in the atmosphere or lose a significant amount of their mass before actually hitting planet’s surface.  What about the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter?      Wikipedia       Out of 50,000 meteorites found on Earth to date, 99.8% are believed to have come from this region — including the “dinosaur-killer.” But because the asteroids that leave the belt don’t get replenished , as time passes, so does the danger. The proof of this theory can be found on celestial bodies such as Earth’s Moon or the planet Mercury, where older craters (created 3 -3.5 billion years ago) are the most numerous, with considerable fallout in frequency as we move further up the timeline.  Our solar system is also constantly moving along with our Sun, which revolves around the center of the galaxy, passing through various regions of the Milky Way on its 225 million-years long journey. During that period, also known as a cosmic year, occurring every 31 million years or so, we pass through the denser areas of the galaxy. Some claim that these periods coincide with mass extinctions in Earth's history, which means these extinctions are likely periodic. Yet this excellent article by astrophysicist Ethan Siegel shows that there is no scientific evidence to support that claim.         Still, don’t rest just yet. Complex movements of our solar system, paired with those of the galaxy, could excite asteroids and comets lying in wait in the Oort cloud or the Kuiper belt, sending them on a collision course with Earth. With billions of them out there, there’s a good chance a few could end up at our doorstep.  But, is there an increased risk of mass extinction such as the one Earth faced 65 million years ago? At this point, I don’t think so. That is not to say that there is no risk. The universe is complex, and the interactions between planets, asteroids, stars and galaxies are intricate and multi-layered. Anything can happen.

Rumors of a space rock accident in India raise the question of how common this is.                                      View Images      Authorities examine what some suspected was a meteorite crater on February 7 in Tamil Nadu in southern India. Other scientists have warned the scene appears to better resemble a ground-based explosion.    Photograph by STR/AFP/Getty Images            PUBLISHED February 9, 2016     As scientists investigate a reported death from a meteorite strike in southern India over the weekend, we wondered about the probability of such a fatal accident. Most people have the sense that meteorite strikes on people are exceedingly rare, but how rare? (As of Wednesday morning, NASA has cast serious doubt on the reports from India , saying the more likely culprit was a land-based explosion.)   Regardless of the final story in India, a meteorite is a piece of rock that strikes the Earth from outer space. The most famous case in the U.S. happened in 1954, when Ann Hodges was hit by a space rock in Sylacauga, Alabama .   The softball-sized hunk of black rock crashed through her ceiling while she was napping on her couch, hitting her in the side. Hodges later fought with her landlord over ownership of the rock and suffered a nervous breakdown.   In October 1992, a meteorite that caused a bright fireball across the sky hit a woman's parked car in Peekskill, New York . In 1825, people reported that a man was killed and a woman was injured by a meteorite in Oriang, India, although scholars have not been able to confirm the incident.   In 1827, a man was said to be injured after being struck in the arm by a space rock in Mhow, India. Other reports list cattle or horses killed by meteorites. A meteorite disrupted a wedding party in 1929 and a funeral in 1924 . Perhaps even more strangely, in 2007, Peruvian villagers were sickened after a meteorite impact released toxic arsenic fumes from the ground .   A large meteorite exploded above central Russia in 2013 with a force 20 to 30 times the Hiroshima bomb injured 1,200 people, mostly from broken glass, and caused $33 million in damage ( see pictures ).

( See pictures of shooting stars .)   "You have a better chance of getting hit by a tornado and a bolt of lightning and a hurricane all at the same time," Michael Reynolds , a Florida State College astronomer and author of the book Falling Stars: A Guide to Meteors & Meteorites , previously told National Geographic .   Doing the Math: Meteorite Strikes   Putting a probability number on the chances of being hit by a space rock is difficult, since the events are so rare. Still, Tulane University earth sciences professor Stephen A. Nelson published a paper in 2014 that made the effort. He put the lifetime odds of dying from a local meteorite, asteroid, or comet impact at 1 in 1,600,000.   Compared with 1 in 90 for a car accident, 1 in 250 for a fire, 1 in 60,000 for a tornado, 1 in 135,000 for lightning, 1 in 8 million for a shark attack , or 1 in 195 million for winning the PowerBall lottery.   Nelson put the risk of dying from a large, global asteroid or comet impact at 1 in 75,000. If that seems surprisingly high, it's because when massive objects have hit the Earth in the geologic past, they have wiped out millions of organisms, even whole species. Most of the creatures aren't killed from the direct impact, but from the aftereffects, which include heat, radiation, and dust that clouds out the sun.   Astronomer Alan Harris made a similar calculation , finding that a human being has a 1 in 700,000 chance of getting killed by an impact from space in their lifetime, with most of the risk coming from a large-scale event.   It's unclear what evidence will emerge from this week's incident in India, but if it does prove to have been a meteorite, it will be remembered as a highly unusual accident.

The Probability of Collisions with Earth     The Probability of Collisions with Earth  Most bodies in the solar system with a visible solid surface exhibit craters.
On Earth we see very few because geological processes such as weathering and
erosion soon destroy the obvious evidence. On bodies with no atmosphere, such
as Mercury or the Moon, craters are everywhere. Without going into detail,
there is strong evidence of a period of intense cratering in the solar system
that ended about 3.9 billion years ago. Since that time cratering appears to
have continued at a much slower and fairly uniform rate. The cause of the
craters is impacts by comets and asteroids. Most asteroids follow simple
circular orbits between the planets Mars and Jupiter, but all of these
asteroids are perturbed, occasionally by each other and more regularly and
dramatically by Jupiter. As a result some find themselves in orbits that cross
that of Mars or even Earth. Comets on the other hand follow highly elongated
orbits that often come close to Earth or other major bodies to begin with.
These orbits are greatly affected if they come anywhere near Jupiter. Over the
eons every moon and planet finds itself in the wrong place in its orbit at the
wrong time and suffers the insult of a major impact. The Earth's atmosphere protects us from the multitude of small debris, the size
of grains of sand or pebbles, thousands of which pelt our planet every day. The
meteors in our night sky are visible evidence of this small debris burning up
high in the atmosphere. In fact, up to a diameter of about 10-meters (33 feet),
most stony meteoroids are destroyed in the atmosphere in thermal explosions.
Obviously some fragments do reach the ground, because we have stony meteorites
in our museums. Such falls are known to cause property damage from time to
time. On October 9, 1992, a fire ball was seen streaking across the sky all the
way from Kentucky to New York. A 27-pound stony meteorite (chondrite) from the
fireball fell in Peekskill, New York, punching a hole in the rear end of an
automobile parked in a driveway and coming to rest in a shallow depression
beneath it. Falls into a Connecticut dining room and an Alabama bedroom are
well documented incursions in this century. A 10-meter body typically has the
kinetic energy of about five nuclear warheads of the size dropped on Hiroshima,
however, and the shock wave it creates can do considerable damage even if
nothing but comparatively small fragments survive to reach the ground.
Many fragments of a 10-meter iron meteoroid will reach the ground. The only
well-studied example of such a fall in recent times took place in the
Sikhote-Alin Mountains of eastern Siberia on February 12, 1947. About 150 US
tons of fragments reached the ground, the largest intact fragment weighing
3,839 pounds. The fragments covered an area of about 1 x 2 kilometers (0.6 x
1.2 miles), within which there were 102 craters greater than 1 meter in
diameter, the largest of them 26.5 meters (87 feet), and about 100 more smaller
craters. If this small iron meteoroid had landed in a city, it obviously would
have created quite a stir. The effect of the larger pieces would be comparable
to having a car suddenly drop in at supersonic speeds! Such an event occurs
about once per decade somewhere on Earth, but most of them are never recorded,
occurring at sea or in some remote region such as Antarctica. It is a fact that
there is no record in modern times of any person being killed by a meteorite.
It is the falls larger than 10 meters that start to become really worrisome.
The 1908 Tunguska event was a stony meteorite in the 100-meter class. The
famous meteor crater in northern Arizona, some 1219 meters (4,000 feet) in
diameter and 183 meters (600 feet) deep, was created 50,000 years ago by a
nickel-iron meteorite perhaps 60 meters in diameter. It probably survived
nearly intact until impact, at which time it was pulverized and largely
vaporized as its 6-7 x 1016 joules* of kinetic energy were rapidly dissipated
in an explosion equivalent to some 15 million tons of TNT! Falls of this class
occur once or twice every 1000 years. There are now over 100 ring-like structures on Earth recognized as definite
impact craters. Most of them are not obviously craters, their identity masked
by heavy erosion over the centuries, but the minerals and shocked rocks present
make it clear that impact was their cause. The Ries Crater in Bavaria is a lush
green basin some 25 kilometers (15 miles) in diameter with the city of
Nordlingen in the middle. Fifteen million years ago a 1500-meter (5000 feet)
asteroid or comet hit there, excavating more than a trillion tons of material
and scattering it all over Europe. This sort of thing happens about once every
million years or so. Another step upward in size take us to Chicxulub, an event
that occurs once in 50-100 million years. Chicxulub is the largest crater known
which seems definitely to have an impact origin, but there are a few ring-like
structures that are 2-3 times larger yet about which geologists are uncertain.
There are now more than 150 asteroids known that come nearer to the Sun than
the outermost point of Earth's orbit. These range in diameter from a few meters
up to about 8 kilometers. A working group chaired by Dr. David Morrison, NASA
Ames Research Center, estimates that there are some 2,100 such asteroids larger
than 1 kilometer and perhaps 320,000 larger than 100 meters, the size that
caused the Tunguska event and the Arizona Meteor Crater. An impact by one of
these larger meteors in the wrong place would be a catastrophe, but it would
not threaten civilization. However, the working group concluded that an impact
by an asteroid larger than 1-2 kilometers could degrade the global climate,
leading to widespread crop failure and loss of life. Such global environmental
catastrophes, which place the entire population of the Earth at risk, are
estimated to take place several times per million years on average. A still
larger impact by an object larger than about 5 kilometers is damaging enough to
cause mass extinctions. In addition there are many comets in the 1-10 kilometer
class, 15 of them in short-period orbits that pass inside the Earth's orbit,
and an unknown number of long-period comets. Virtually any short-period comet
among the 100 or so not currently coming near the Earth could become dangerous
after a close passage by Jupiter. This all sounds pretty scary. However, as noted earlier, no human in the past
1000 years is known to have been killed by a meteorite or by the effects of one
impacting. (There are ancient Chinese records of such deaths.) An individual's
chance of being killed by a meteorite is small, but the risk increases with the
size of the impacting comet or asteroid, with the greatest risk associated with
global catastrophes resulting from impacts of objects larger than 1 kilometer.
NASA knows of no asteroid or comet currently on a collision course with Earth,
so the probability of a major collision is quite small. In fact, as best as we
can tell, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next
several hundred years. To be able to better calculate the statistics,
astronomers need to detect as many of the near-Earth objects as possible. It's
likely that we could identify a threatening near-Earth object large enough to
potentially cause catastrophic changes in the Earth's environment, and most
astronomers believe that a systematic approach to studying asteroids and comets
that pass close to the Earth makes good sense. It's too late for the dinosaurs,
but today astonomers are conducting ever-increasing searches to identify all of
the larger objects which pose an impact danger to Earth. * joule: a unit of measurement, the amount of energy corresponding to one watt

It’s time to test a deflector mission. It could save us all.  By Phil Plait                                               A meteorite trail is seen above an apartment block in Chelyabinsk, Russia, on Feb. 15, 2013.  Photo by Oleg Kargopolov/AFP/Getty Images       Your odds of dying in an asteroid impact are about one in 700,000 .    Surprising, isn’t it? That’s about the same chance you have of dying in a flood or a fireworks accident over your lifetime . It may be even more surprising when you consider that there has never even been a confirmed human death resulting from an impact. But this number involves something of a trick: A big enough impact will kill everyone on Earth . A smaller impact might devastate a local region on Earth, but a big one can wipe out entire species. Just ask the dinosaurs …        Phil Plait    Phil Plait writes Slate ’s Bad Astronomy blog and is an astronomer, public speaker, science evangelizer, and author of Death From the Skies!                For a global event, you get these odds roughly by dividing the time between impacts by the average human lifespan. But it’s still a little misleading because it’s similar to the lottery: The chance is 100 percent that someone will win the lottery, but the chances are extremely low that you specifically will. Your odds of dying in an impact event are pretty low, but the odds of some random person somewhere getting killed are higher.    Advertisement       Of course, asteroid impacts are a lottery you get to play whether you want to or not.    Today is a good day to think about all this: It’s the first anniversary of the Chelyabinsk impact over Russia. On Feb. 15, 2013 (it was still Feb. 14 in U.S. time), a rock the size of a house came screaming in from space. In a single moment, its huge energy of motion was converted into light and heat. The resulting explosion was the equivalent of a half-million tons of TNT detonating all at once. Even though it exploded dozens of kilometers above the Earth’s surface, the shock wave shook the ground, set off car alarms, and shattered windows. More than 1,000 people were injured, some seriously, by flying glass.         Amazingly, no one was killed, but it shows quite vividly that the threat of asteroid impacts is quite real.    So when will the Earth get hit again? And what can we do about it?    Advertisement       * * *    The Earth gets hit by about 100 tons of material every day, but that’s in the form of tiny pebbles that burn up high in the atmosphere and produce shooting stars.    Big impacts are rare. The Chelyabinsk asteroid was 19 meters (62 feet) in diameter, and, on average, we should expect an impact from an object that size somewhere on Earth about once every 25 years. (Because most of the planet is covered in water, many of these go unnoticed.)       A small chunk of Chelyabinsk meteorite, given to me by a friend.  Photo by Phil Plait       Bigger impacts are more rare. In 1908 an object 30 meters or so in diameter came across the Earth, exploding high over a swampy region of the Russian countryside near the Tunguska River . The yield was equivalent to a 15 megaton nuclear bomb! Something like this Tunguska event (as it’s now called) happens every few centuries on average.    Advertisement       You probably know that the dinosaurs were taken out by an asteroid or comet about 10 kilometers wide. Happily, those events are extremely rare, occurring on a timescale of tens of millions of years. As it happens, we’re pretty sure there’s no dinosaur-killer on its way to Earth for the next few centuries. But the lesson of Chelyabinsk and Tunguska is that it doesn’t take a flying mountain to ruin your whole day. A hill will do nicely.

Photo ITAR-TASS Itar-Tass Photos/Newscom       If we want to prevent asteroid impacts from happening, the first thing we need to do is spot these threats. And we’re working pretty hard on that.    Astronomers have built quite a few observatories dedicated to patiently scanning the heavens looking for blips of light. Thousands of near-Earth asteroids have been found this way, their orbits meticulously calculated, projected into the future, and determined to be potentially threatening or not.    As things stand now, we don’t have the capability to find them all. But we will, soon. The huge Pan-STARRS telescope is looking deep for threats and is already producing data. LSST is a planned monster 8-meter telescope specifically designed to look for near-Earth objects and is expected to catalog hundreds of thousands of them.         A chunk of the asteroid that exploded over Russia on Feb. 15, 2013, was extracted from the bottom of Lake Chebarkul.  Photo by Anton Melnikov/Reuters       Advertisement       To extend our vision, two spacecraft are currently in the works , too. They’ll have a better view above our turbulent atmosphere, and by using infrared detectors they can more easily spot the warm glow of rocks orbiting the Sun.    Even with all these eyes on the sky, there are roughly a million such rocks that could potentially, someday, impact the Earth. Eventually, it’s bound to happen: We’ll spot one with our name on it. What then?    * * *    You won’t like this answer much, but: nothing. As things currently stand, even if we had a few years’ warning, there’s little we could do to stop an impact. It takes time to plan a mission, build it, launch it, travel to the rock, and then do whatever it is you plan to do.    Advertisement       But let’s say we did have a rocket waiting to launch. What do we do with it?    If you watch movies, the answer is easy: Nuke it! But that might not be the best option. For one thing, it’s a bit ham-fisted and hard to control. You might hit the asteroid and shatter it, turning one big rock into a bunch of slightly smaller, still-dangerous (and radioactive!) ones. Also, timing is a problem; remember, these asteroids are moving at high speed, so detonating the bomb at just the right exact moment might prove tricky.    It helps to remember the goal: You want to make the asteroid not hit the Earth . When you think of it that way, a better solution is to change its velocity—speed it up or slow it down—so it’ll whiz past us without an impact.    For this, you don’t need a bomb, just the rocket itself. Literally aim the rocket directly at the asteroid and hit it as hard as you can! The purpose would be to use the momentum of the rocket to change the momentum of the rock enough to do the job.    Advertisement       The key to this trick is time. The Earth is 8,000 miles across, so at most you have to move the asteroid 4,000 miles to make it miss. If you have, say, two years of advance warning you need only change the velocity of the rock by one-fifth of a mile per hour to make it miss. That’s far less than walking speed! And the longer lead time you have, the less the change needs to be. For big rocks that’s still a problem, but again, finding them farther in advance is our best bet.    The B612 Foundation has made it its mission to do just this. The group includes scientists and engineers who investigate how best to stop an incoming asteroid or comet, and they have found this impactor method to be feasible. But they found a subtle problem: You might push the rock into an orbit that’ll just make it hit us at some other time . You’ve prevented an impact in two years, but now you’ve forced one to happen in, say, five years!     I love this idea. It’s right out of Star Trek ! And it’s actually doable.     You could hit it again, but then the same problem might occur, and rockets are expensive. This is where the B612 folks came up with a fantastic idea: a gravity tractor .    Instead of a single payload to whack the asteroid, you also send along a probe that has a lot of a mass, maybe a ton or so. It has some small amount of gravity that can be used to literally tow the asteroid into a safe orbit once the impactor has done its job. That way, you can ensure no impact from that rock will occur, ever.    I love this idea . It’s right out of Star Trek ! And it has the added bonus of being actually doable.    Mind you, we could build such a mission right now, since much of the tech is off-the-shelf. But it’s never been tested together in this way, and I think this should be a priority. Hitting a rock only a few hundred meters across at multiple times the speed of a rifle bullet is something I think we should test before it counts for the final grade. A mission like that might cost a billion or so dollars, but it’s worth it.    Think of it this way: It costs a fraction of a percent of the total price of a car to add seat belts. The cost of a mission to prevent an asteroid impact would be far less than that percentage of our national annual budget; it would be less than one percent of just NASA’s budget over the 10 years it would take to build and test it. You can drive your whole life and never need a seat belt, but given enough time there will be an asteroid impact big enough to cause major damage.    That sounds like a good investment to me.    The science-fiction author Larry Niven once said that the difference between us and the dinosaurs is that we have a space program.    I would add that while we do have a space program, we still haven’t made the choice to use it this way. The cost to do so is small, but the price to not do so is unthinkable.    So, we can now answer our original question: When will the Earth suffer its next big impact?    If we make the right choice, then the answer to our question is: never .

This is an artist's conception of an impact.  But that is a much bigger rock than anything that's hit Earth in a very long time.  Even the "dinosaur" killer was tiny compared to this illustration (more on that below).            What are the odds?  That was then, this is now  The Earth has been getting hit by asteroids and comets for its whole life. The planets formed from collisions of smaller objects, and even our water may have come largely from comets. Heavy bombardments may have continued until as recently as 4 billion years ago, making it difficult for life to get a foothold at all (the "Late Heavy Bombardment").  The odds today  There are a lot more small rocks than big ones. So while Earth is constantly being "hit" -- accumulating over 100 tons of matter ever day -- most of this is in the form of dust or tiny sand-grain sized meteors that appear as shooting stars.  By comparison, school bus-sized asteroids may hit every thousand years or so, medium sized (say 300 meter) asteroids might be once every 50,000 years, and extinction level events only every billion years. And those estimates are going down.  Making the world safer  The Spaceguard Survey is an attempt to locate and track as many near-Earth objects (NEOs) as possible.  Each time astronomers identify an asteroid that isn't on a collision course with Earth, the calculated odds of an impact go down a little bit. By the time the current survey is completed the estimated odds of dying in an asteroid impact will have decreased by a factor of 10, from 1 in 70,000 to 1 in 700,000.  Assuming, of course, that they don't find one that really is going to hit.  How big is big?  People tend to think that an "extinction level" asteroid or comet would look like the picture at the top of the page. But in reality it could be very, very small compared to Earth . The "dino killer" is estimated to have been between 5 and 15 kilometers across (3 to 10 miles). That's large compared to the rocks in your backyard, but tiny compared to Earth (check out the image on the right to see just how small it would be).  To lead to a global catastrophe, an asteroid or comet only has to be big enough to launch large amounts of dust in to the atmosphere.  That leads to the abrupt change in climate that wipes out species.  So what are the risks?  The odds of a major asteroid impact are very small. But the risk of you dying in an asteroid impact might be higher than you think. Why? Because while the odds of an impact are small, the number of people who would be killed is so high that the risk (impact odds times the number killed) isn't negligible. Check out our risk game and see how those odds compare to other risks.  What about Apophis?  Apophis is an asteroid about 270 meters across (almost three football fields). In 2029 it will pass very close to the Earth: within the orbits of our communication satellites. It won't hit; however there is a slight chance that this close pass will shift its orbit exactly the right amount to cause it to hit Earth on a second pass in 2036. The odds are small though: as of 2009 the odds are estimate at 1 in 250,000, but that estimate will continue to be refined.        We've added a properly scaled dino-killer  asteroid to this NASA Blue Marble image of Earth. Can you find it?    Drop some asteroids and comets on the city of your choice.

(Photo: NASA) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE (NEWSER) – As far as chances go, it's a lot more likely that an asteroid named 2013 TV135 will smash into our planet in 2032 than it is that you'll win Powerball. But before you panic, know that the chances are still quite slim: one in 63,000; NASA says it is 99.998% positive the asteroid will fly by us. It has already done so once: Ukrainian astronomers say the 1,345-foot asteroid came within 4.2 million miles of Earth on Sept. 16, but will come within one million miles on Aug. 26, 2032, CNN reports . But if it did hit, the impact would cause an explosion "50 times greater than the most powerful nuclear bomb ever used," the Telegraph reports . NASA's Don Yeomans notes that "this is a relatively new discovery. With more observations, I fully expect we will be able to significantly reduce, or rule out entirely, any impact probability for the foreseeable future." In the meantime, RT News points out 2013 TV135 has a danger rating of one on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale (which runs to 10), meaning there is "no cause for public attention or concern." Of course, it notes that only one asteroid currently has that rating; the rest are at zero. (In related news, scientists have spotted the remains of a water-rich asteroid orbiting a dying star about 170 light-years from Earth, and that has fascinating implications .)

Astronomists have analysed around 2,000 giant space rocks which are currently hurtling towards the Earth, predicting the odds of them actually hitting our planet.  Getty Images  And they have concluded that the next really big threat is from the star Gliese 710, which will "severely mess up our solar system" when it comes within just 77 light days from our planet.  But with Gliese 710 not due to reach the Earth for another 1.35million years, boffins think we should be safe until then.  Nasa has revealed an asteroid will fly very close to the Earth on February 25 , but there is virtually zero chance it could hit the planet as it will burn up in our atmosphere.  And the 82-ft wide Asteroid 2017 BS32 flew past the Earth on Thursday evening after being spotted by eagle-eyed astronomers who say it's the planet's fourth close shave already in 2017.

An asteroid measuring 500ft in diameter is the most likely to hit Earth, with a one in 625 chance of striking, the video explains. But it would be more than 160 years before the asteroid hit the planet.  The video reveals when asteroids are expected to reach the earth and the odds they will collide  The biggest threat is from star Gliese 710 but it's not expected to reach us for another 1.35million years  Another asteroid measuring 1,600ft wide has a 1 in 2,700 chance of hitting earth. And a larger asteroid, measuring 4,200ft in diameter, is the third most likely to hit - but only has a one in 8,333 chance of striking in the year 2880.  When Gliese 710 arrives at Earth in 1.35million years, it is expected to push asteroids from the outer reaches of the solar system towards Earth, having a potentially catastrophic impact.  Giant asteroids over 6.2 miles in size are capable of wiping out life on Earth, but the last one known to hit was 66 million years ago which destroyed 75 per cent of all life, including the dinosaurs.  On average, Earth is hit once a year by elephant-sized asteroids, while bigger asteroids measuring 25ft across hit around every four years.  These are rarely witnessed as they either burn up in the atmosphere or land in the sea.  Larger asteroids which are the size of a six-storey building hit Earth around twice a century.

By Elizabeth Howell   Published On 06/06/2017  4:41 PM EDT         Share on Facebook      Tweet this article       Email                  Earth may be threatened by a newly discovered branch of a stream of meteoroids, increasing the risk that the planet will be struck by a meteoroid or asteroid.   A team of astronomers from the Czech Academy of Sciences announced the findings on Tuesday after studying the Taurid meteoroid stream. The stream produces a meteor shower that usually has a long period of activity in October and November and produces a low number of meteors. The meteors — light phenomena that are seen when a meteoroid enters the planet’s atmosphere and vaporizes, also referred to as “shooting stars” — occur when Earth’s orbit plows into the stream of debris left behind by Comet Encke.   Most of these particles are quite tiny and pose no threat whatsoever, but the Czech astronomers have tracked a new branch of the stream from which particles are intersecting with the planet. The branch includes two asteroids with diameters of between 200 and 300 meters (roughly 650-1000 feet). These asteroids are not themselves on a collision course with Earth, but their identification suggests that there may be other asteroids of this size or larger lurking undiscovered within this stream.   As such, the astronomers are urging a concentrated search for more Taurid asteroids, to see if any potentially threatening ones exist.   “Since asteroids of sizes of tens to hundreds meters pose a threat to the ground even if they are intrinsically weak, impact hazard increases significantly when the Earth encounters the Taurid new branch every few years,” they write in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics . “Further studies leading to [a] better description of this real source of potentially hazardous objects, which can be large enough to cause significant regional or even continental damage on the Earth, are therefore extremely important.”   It’s worth noting, however, that no threatening objects have yet been discovered . Though the prospect of continental damage and regional catastrophe coming from space is alarming, more observations will be needed before drawing conclusions based on the Czech team’s research.    RELATED: What to Do With Nukes? Blow Up Dangerous Comets, of Course    NASA is regularly working to anticipate the possible collision of a massive cosmic particle with Earth and assess any potential impact risks. It operates a collision monitoring system called Sentry that routinely scans for asteroids and determines the likelihood of impact over the next 100 years. It also freely catalogs these rocky bodies at the JPL Small-Body Database Browser .   The debris stream from Comet Encke is influenced in part by the gravity of Jupiter, a massive gas giant planet that is known to influence the orbits of comets and asteroids in that region of the solar system. As such, from time Jupiter’s gravity can redirect the debris so that more particles hit the Earth.                   Share on Facebook      Tweet this article         A bright Taurid fireball is recorded at the NASA All Sky Fireball Network station in Tullahoma, Tennessee in 2014.  NASA      During one of these “enhanced” Taurid meteor showers in 2015 caused by Encke’s redirection, the astronomers from the Czech Academy of Sciences analyzed 144 Taurid fireballs — meteors that produce a large flash when they hit the atmosphere. Observations were taken from the European Fireball Network.   Of the analyzed fireballs, about 113 of them have common characteristics, including sharing approximately the same orbit. The astronomers concluded, based on previous showers, that these fireballs come from a new branch of the Taurid stream being redirected by Jupiter’s gravity.    RELATED: We're Planning to Shoot an Asteroid to See What Happens    Next, the astronomers analyzed the orbital paths of asteroids 2015 TX24 and 2005 UR. Due to their similarities to the newly discovered path of the Taurid fireballs, the astronomers in turn argued that these two asteroids — each about 200-300 meters in diameter — are also members of the new branch.   Analysis of the fireballs suggests that the large asteroids are weak in structure, although at larger sizes they would not break up easily in the Earth’s atmosphere.   A few years ago, NASA created a Planetary Defense Coordination Office to bring together the observations of all US networks looking for near-Earth asteroids, and to help come up with plans in the unlikely chance that the Earth is under threat. You can read more about the office’s work at its website . Other countries, such as the European Union, have similar asteroid observation networks in place.

However, new calculations made by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) show that Apophis' odds of Earth impact are lower than previously estimated.        "We cannot yet exclude the possibility that it could impact our planet, but we can calculate that the chance of Earth impact is only one-in-100,000 over the next century, which, of course, is extremely small," Paul Chodas, manager of JPL's Center for Near Earth Object Studies told Astrowatch.net.  Discovered in 2004, asteroid Apophis is slated to fly by Earth on April 13, 2029. Initial observations of this space rock indicated that it has one in 36 chance of hitting the Earth on that day, but additional monitoring of Apophis completely ruled out this possibility.  However, Alberto Cellino of the Observatory of Turin in Italy told Astrowatch.net in June that although the potential impact in 2029 was excluded, we cannot rule out such an event in the more distant future. Given the fact that NEO orbits are chaotic, what is not dangerous today can become a candidate impactor in the future.  That is why astronomers, including Chodas, emphasize the importance of detailed observations of Apophis and its constant monitoring, which could confirm that this asteroid poses no danger to us.  "Apophis is certainly a hazardous asteroid, and for that reason, it has been tracked extensively. And so we know its orbit very accurately. In all likelihood, further tracking measurements will eliminate even that possibility (one in 100,000)," Chodas noted.  Astronomers estimate that on April 13, 2029, Apophis will pass by the Earth at a distance of no closer than 18,300 miles (29,470 kilometers). The next close approach of this asteroid is expected in April 2036, when it will miss Earth at a much larger distance of approximately 30.5 million miles (49 million kilometers).  Currently, there are 1,803 potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) detected to date. PHAs are space rocks larger than approximately 100 meters that can come closer to Earth than 4.65 million miles (7.5 million kilometers). However, none of the known PHAs is on a collision course with Earth.

The probability that Apophis will hit the Earth sometime in the future is quite high.  There are three interesting ways humans can modify that probability.   1) Putting a sufficiently large mass in Apophis's path in 2029 could target the moon. It might not get there for a century or two, which is good, because it would allow a better choice. 2)  Do the same, but instead put it in orbit around the Earth.  In this case it would probably be intended as a carbon source for making a space elevator, and eventually the far anchor point. 3) Land an engine with a human or robot crew, and use it for trips between Earth and Mars.  The engine needed is not that big, the goal is to have Apophis pass near Earth and then Mars on a regular basis.  Any passengers would need to accelerate to catch it, then decelerate at the end of the trip.  Why?  To provide lots of radiation shielding during the trip.

Got it.       antialias_physorg     not rated yet  Aug 17, 2017    1) Putting a sufficiently large mass in Apophis's path in 2029 could target the moon Erm...no. 2) Do the same, but instead put it in orbit around the Earth Erm...no. Please no. 3) Land an engine with a human or robot crew, and use it for trips between Earth and Mars. Erm. Nope, no and not a chance. Check out the size (and specifically the mass) of Apophis. Then do some rough back-of-the-envelope calcs about the stuff you're suggesting. (Hint: Apophis is estimated to have roughly 10000 times the mass of a modern day aircraft carrier...Neeeeo. We're not gonna move this to Mars, to the Moon, or anywhere else with an 'engine not that big'. We're not gonna impress this sucker - even with a nuke. Or 10. Or 100.)       StudentofSpiritualTeaching     not rated yet  Aug 19, 2017    The calculations for 2029 and 2036 are false. They will be corrected in the coming years. Get ready for the panic when that happens, as it will predict an impact in Europe. And on the means for interfering: an atomic explosion close enough for changing the trajectory but not to break the object apart.       eachus     not rated yet  Aug 24, 2017    (Hint: Apophis is estimated to have roughly 10000 times the mass of a modern day aircraft carrier...Neeeeo.

Hint: Changing the orbit of Apophis slightly when it is deep in the Earth's gravitational field amplifies the effect.  Changing Apophis' momentum/velocity vector slightly can send it deep into the Earth's gravitational field in the future.   There are a few hundred tons of otherwise dead or obsolete satellites in geosynch orbit that can be easily (in terms of delta-v) placed where they will be struck by Apophis.  You get much more delta-v than from flying an engine to Apophis.  Do the math. As for making Apophis a joint satellite of Earth and Mars, you again get to play with gravitational fields doing most of the work.  (I call these dynamic orbits.)  Well, computers do a lot of the work as well.       rrwillsj     1 / 5 (2)  Oct 10, 2017    Oh yeah!

But this was not a one-time occurrence.  Celestial bodies have hit Earth before and are bound to do so again . The billion dollar question is: Could the impact trigger another mass extinction?  To answer this question properly, we need to understand the origin of objects set on a collision course with our planet. Three best “sources“ of Earth-bound celestial material are the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, the Oort cloud and Kuiper belt. The Oort cloud is believed to be a thick bubble of icy debris that surrounds our solar system, and a probable origin of most of the long-period comets that have been observed. The Kuiper belt is a disc-shaped region populated with hundreds of thousands of icy bodies larger than 100 km (62 miles) in diameter, and an estimated one trillion or more comets beyond the orbit of Neptune.      William Crochot       These two regions, while both rich in gigantic space debris, contribute to the extinction scenarios in vastly different ways. While the Oort cloud is quite dense, consisting of billions of comets, it’s very unlikely that many of them jeopardized Earth in the past. In fact, simulations run by scientists confirm that in the past 500 million years, just two or three comets may have struck Earth, causing powerful meteor showers.  The Kuiper belt is next on our list of suspects. Its disc-like structure makes it easier for the comets to find their way to our solar system, but more often than not, they get pulled in by the Sun and evaporate.  Still, movements of both Oort cloud and Kuiper belt objects are complex, and their interactions with other celestial bodies are far from predictable and periodic. In fact, many of them can get pulled from their initial state into orbits of planets and various other celestial bodies, where they can be further slung toward our solar system. The majority of them leave the solar system, collide with other planets and moons, or simply evaporate, passing too close to our Sun. Those that do hit Earth either burn out in the atmosphere or lose a significant amount of their mass before actually hitting planet’s surface.  What about the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter?      Wikipedia       Out of 50,000 meteorites found on Earth to date, 99.8% are believed to have come from this region — including the “dinosaur-killer.” But because the asteroids that leave the belt don’t get replenished , as time passes, so does the danger. The proof of this theory can be found on celestial bodies such as Earth’s Moon or the planet Mercury, where older craters (created 3 -3.5 billion years ago) are the most numerous, with considerable fallout in frequency as we move further up the timeline.  Our solar system is also constantly moving along with our Sun, which revolves around the center of the galaxy, passing through various regions of the Milky Way on its 225 million-years long journey. During that period, also known as a cosmic year, occurring every 31 million years or so, we pass through the denser areas of the galaxy. Some claim that these periods coincide with mass extinctions in Earth's history, which means these extinctions are likely periodic. Yet this excellent article by astrophysicist Ethan Siegel shows that there is no scientific evidence to support that claim.         Still, don’t rest just yet. Complex movements of our solar system, paired with those of the galaxy, could excite asteroids and comets lying in wait in the Oort cloud or the Kuiper belt, sending them on a collision course with Earth. With billions of them out there, there’s a good chance a few could end up at our doorstep.  But, is there an increased risk of mass extinction such as the one Earth faced 65 million years ago? At this point, I don’t think so. That is not to say that there is no risk. The universe is complex, and the interactions between planets, asteroids, stars and galaxies are intricate and multi-layered. Anything can happen.

Rumors of a space rock accident in India raise the question of how common this is.                                      View Images      Authorities examine what some suspected was a meteorite crater on February 7 in Tamil Nadu in southern India. Other scientists have warned the scene appears to better resemble a ground-based explosion.    Photograph by STR/AFP/Getty Images            PUBLISHED February 9, 2016     As scientists investigate a reported death from a meteorite strike in southern India over the weekend, we wondered about the probability of such a fatal accident. Most people have the sense that meteorite strikes on people are exceedingly rare, but how rare? (As of Wednesday morning, NASA has cast serious doubt on the reports from India , saying the more likely culprit was a land-based explosion.)   Regardless of the final story in India, a meteorite is a piece of rock that strikes the Earth from outer space. The most famous case in the U.S. happened in 1954, when Ann Hodges was hit by a space rock in Sylacauga, Alabama .   The softball-sized hunk of black rock crashed through her ceiling while she was napping on her couch, hitting her in the side. Hodges later fought with her landlord over ownership of the rock and suffered a nervous breakdown.   In October 1992, a meteorite that caused a bright fireball across the sky hit a woman's parked car in Peekskill, New York . In 1825, people reported that a man was killed and a woman was injured by a meteorite in Oriang, India, although scholars have not been able to confirm the incident.   In 1827, a man was said to be injured after being struck in the arm by a space rock in Mhow, India. Other reports list cattle or horses killed by meteorites. A meteorite disrupted a wedding party in 1929 and a funeral in 1924 . Perhaps even more strangely, in 2007, Peruvian villagers were sickened after a meteorite impact released toxic arsenic fumes from the ground .   A large meteorite exploded above central Russia in 2013 with a force 20 to 30 times the Hiroshima bomb injured 1,200 people, mostly from broken glass, and caused $33 million in damage ( see pictures ).

( See pictures of shooting stars .)   "You have a better chance of getting hit by a tornado and a bolt of lightning and a hurricane all at the same time," Michael Reynolds , a Florida State College astronomer and author of the book Falling Stars: A Guide to Meteors & Meteorites , previously told National Geographic .   Doing the Math: Meteorite Strikes   Putting a probability number on the chances of being hit by a space rock is difficult, since the events are so rare. Still, Tulane University earth sciences professor Stephen A. Nelson published a paper in 2014 that made the effort. He put the lifetime odds of dying from a local meteorite, asteroid, or comet impact at 1 in 1,600,000.   Compared with 1 in 90 for a car accident, 1 in 250 for a fire, 1 in 60,000 for a tornado, 1 in 135,000 for lightning, 1 in 8 million for a shark attack , or 1 in 195 million for winning the PowerBall lottery.   Nelson put the risk of dying from a large, global asteroid or comet impact at 1 in 75,000. If that seems surprisingly high, it's because when massive objects have hit the Earth in the geologic past, they have wiped out millions of organisms, even whole species. Most of the creatures aren't killed from the direct impact, but from the aftereffects, which include heat, radiation, and dust that clouds out the sun.   Astronomer Alan Harris made a similar calculation , finding that a human being has a 1 in 700,000 chance of getting killed by an impact from space in their lifetime, with most of the risk coming from a large-scale event.   It's unclear what evidence will emerge from this week's incident in India, but if it does prove to have been a meteorite, it will be remembered as a highly unusual accident.
