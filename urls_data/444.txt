After all, there’s no harm in having a little daydream about your own chances of having twins. But then again, the idea of having twins may not appeal to you at all.  We all know we can’t pick our family. But when it comes to conceiving with a set of twins, having a family history of hyper ovulation, releasing more than one egg each month, does certainly help.  Reasons for wanting to increase the chances of having twins   Maternal age. For women who have left having their family until they are older, there is a tendency to want to have their children quickly.  The practical side of taking one period of time from work in order to raise a young family.  Having a family history of twins. If twins are familiar to you and already in your family then you may want to have your own.  Wanting a big family with siblings who are close in age.  Simply because the idea appeals to you. For no other reason than the idea of having two babies is just a lovely notion.   What will help boost my chances of having twins?  You’re already increasing your chances if you are a twin yourself or if you have siblings who are twins.  If you are lucky enough to come from a family with a pattern of having twins then genetically you are more likely to as well.  So if you, your mother or your maternal grandmother are or were fraternal (non-identical) twins then your chances of having twins may increase to as many as 1 in 7.  But if none of these apply to you and you’re keen to have twins, don’t despair.  Within the general population the chances of having twins is about one in every 89 births. Twin numbers have steadily increased since the 1980s. This is due in part, to the number of couples who have had and are having fertility assistance.  Just remember The chances of having identical or non-fraternal twins is the same for every woman, wherever she lives and no matter what her family history. Identical twinning is random and universal – it is not reliant on two eggs being released but one egg being fertilised by one sperm and then dividing into two. The chances of having identical twins are around 1 in every 285 pregnancies. Around one in every three sets of twins is identical.  Some statistics – just to get you thinking!   If you are over 45 your chances of having twins increases to around 17%. But you need to think very carefully if you want to have a baby if you are within this age group, let alone two.    By the time your twins are 21 you will be 66, so think very carefully if this will be right for you and your partner.  If you’re really keen to have twins, then leaving your dash to try conceiving until after you’re 50 will increase your chances to 1 in 9.  Don’t try to have your babies when you are less than 25 years. If you wait until after your 35th birthday then you will more than double your chances in this space of waiting 10 years.  Women who undergo fertility assistance and take drugs to stimulate their ovaries have more twins. This is because more eggs are released each month and with IVF , generally more than one embryo is put back into the uterus. Because of the improvement in fertility management, the rate of success with embryo transfers has never been better.  If you are from Nigeria then you are more likely to have twins than a Caucasian woman of the same age. Nigerian women enjoy the highest rate of twin pregnancies in the world. And because their rate is so high, around 1 in every 22 women, the genetic potential to keep twins occurring through the generations will become even more likely.  If you are overweight then you are more likely to have twins. Perhaps this is nature’s way of guaranteeing that the pregnant mother is able to provide sufficient nutrition to support a twin pregnancy. But women who are overweight or obese often have problems conceiving in the first place. One of the most common recommendations for women who are keen to fall pregnant is to stay within a healthy weight range. A healthy Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ) is 20-25. Women with a BMR of 30 or over tend to have more twins.  If you are tall, in the top 25th percentile for your height amongst women of the same age, then you are more likely to have twins. Again, this may be attributable to Mother Nature interpreting height (and weight) as a sign of good pregnancy material.

Home  Shop  Basket  Twins Tips          Resources Centre / Twins Tips Introduction / Twins Tips / What are the chances of having Twins.Triplets or Quads ?        You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Share          Expert Answer       The BabyCentre editorial team  Our panel of health writers     Non-identical (fraternal) twins tend to run in families. But identical twins don't.  Non-identical twins are the result of two separate eggs being fertilised by two separate sperm. There is a gene that makes a woman more likely to release two or more eggs during ovulation, and it's this gene that runs in families. Identical twins are the result of a single fertilised egg splitting, and this seems to be a random event.  So if you're a woman and non-identical twins run in your family, you're more likely to have a set yourself. It's estimated that you're about two and a half times more likely than average to have twins if you're a non-identical twin, or have siblings who are non-identical twins.  A man with a family history of twins may carry the gene, but it won't mean he can father a set of non-identical twins. The gene is only expressed through women who ovulate. If he has daughters, they may inherit the gene, and one day go on to have fraternal twins.  This may explain why some people think that twins skip a generation in families. You may have heard, for example, that if your mum or dad is a twin but you're not, you're more likely to have twins yourself. There's no evidence to support this. What can happen, though, is that a dad can pass on the non-identical twin gene to his daughters and this may make twins appear to skip a generation.  Your heritage can affect your chances of having twins. For example, non-identical twins are most common in women of Central African origin, and least common in women of South-East Asian and Latin American origin.  Aside from inheritance, age plays a big role in how likely you are to have twins. If you're a woman in your mid-30s or beyond, you have a greater chance than a younger woman of having twins or more. As you get older, you naturally produce more ovulation-stimulating hormones, which could trigger your ovaries to release several eggs each month.  The use of some fertility treatments also increases the likelihood of a woman having twins. All treatments that stimulate the ovaries to release eggs or involve two or more embryos being transferred to the womb increase the chance of multiple births.

What caused the increase in multiples?  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby?  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

So… the odds aren’t exactly with you. Or are they? Turns out, there are a number of factors that can affect your odds of getting pregnant with multiples and having twin babies. These include your age, diet, number of pregnancies you’ve had, ethnicity, location, body type, and more. So what are your chancing of having twins or multiples? Take our just-for-fun quiz to find out instantly!  1. Do you have fraternal twins in your family?

Nigerian  African  Caucasian  Hispanic or Asian  Other 4. Where do you live?  Nigeria  Central Africa  North America or Europe  Latin America or Asia  Other 5. Do you eat a high fat diet?  Yep, full fat pastured yogurt, coconut oil, and pastured bacon  Yes, but it mostly comes from conventional animal products  I try to limit my consumption of fat 6. Do you frequently eat large amounts of phytoestrogen foods such as soy, tempeh, flax, sesame seeds, oats, barley, dried beans, lentils, yams, alfalfa, and mung beans?  Yes, I eat large servings of those foods daily  Sure, but not daily  No, I hardly ever eat those foods 7. How old are you?  Under 35  35-39  Over 40 8. How many full-term pregnancies have you had (including your current pregnancy)?  This is my first  2  3  4+ 9. Did you use fertility treatments to conceive?  Yes, fertility drugs  No  Yes, IVF  Loading…            What is the birth rate for twins? Identical twins rates are equal to about 3.5 out of 1000 births, the birth rate for identical twins has not changed over the past few decades and is about the same nationwide. Worldwide, about 12-16 in 1000 people are naturally conceived twins. So, the chances of having twins are small. However,in 2010, births of twins in general in the U.S. were 33 in 1000 people. The birth rate for fraternal twins has risen by about 76% in the past 30 years. The obvious reason is fertility treatments but surprisingly, they are not the only reason. What factors affect the chances of having twins? The chances of a woman having identical twins are about the same for everyone, as identical twins do not tend to run in families. This is because identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting in two and this is a random, rare event. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, can be genetic. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs being fertilized by two sperm. Typically women only release one egg each cycle but women who conceive fraternal twins have released two. This is why fraternal twins can only be genetically connected through the mother, meaning the father’s genetics have nothing to do with twinning. Releasing more than one egg in a cycle is called hyper-ovulation and is controlled by certain genes. Women who conceive fraternal twins usually have high levels of these genes, which makes sense. So who is more likely to conceive fraternal twins? Your chances of having twins depend on six factors: 1. Body type Twins tend to be more common in larger women as well as woman who are tall. In one study, women with a BMI of 30 or above were nearly 1.5 times more likely to have twins than the women in the normal BMI range of 20 to 24.9. Those same women were more likely to have opposite sex twins than same sex twins as well. Researchers are still unsure why this is the case. 2. Ethnicity and location On the surface it appears that ethnicity plays a role in the chances of having twins, yet location seems to have a large part as well. The Yoruba tribe of Nigeria has the highest rate of twins at 45–50 twin sets (or 90–100 twins) per 1,000 live births, however being of Nigerian decent and living elsewhere doesn’t show the same correlation to twin births. In Central Africa there are 18–30 twin sets (or 36–60 twins) per 1,000 live births. North America and Europe (and caucasians in general) have intermediate rates of 9-16 twin sets per 1,000 live births Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (and hispanic and asian ethnicities in general) have the lowest rates of 6–9 twin sets per 1,000 live births. The difference in chances of having twins between geographic locations (more than ethnicity) begs the question of whether climate, diet, or lifestyle have more to do with the chances of having twins than anything else. 3. Diet We already know that diet does play a role. Women who eat full fat foods over non fat or low fat are more likely to conceive twins. This could be because fat is an important building block for pregnancy and those that eat more fat are better suited to carry two babies. It may also be that the difference in the amount of fat a woman eats affects hormones. Some information points to the daily consumption of yams being the reason Nigerian women have more chances of having twins. True yams contain a phytoestrogen that increases a woman’s follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and may cause hyper-ovulation. 4. Maternal Age Older woman tend to have a higher chance of fraternal twins. Women over 35 tend to produce more FSH than younger women and women with higher levels of these hormones are more likely to have twins. The increase in FSH levels also shows declining fertility, which means they are less likely to get pregnant, but more likely to have twins if they happen to conceive. 5. Number of Pregnancies The more pregnancies that a woman has had increase her chances of having twins. This could be a simple case of numbers. The more pregnancies you have the higher your chances of having twins. 6. Fertility Treatments Women who take certain types of fertility treatments have increased chances of having twins.  In vitro fertilization (IVF) increases your odds of having multiples by 20-40% depending on how many embryos are placed inside your womb. Some believe that IVF can also increase your chances of having identical twins but research doesn’t support this. Fertility drugs increase the odds of you releasing several eggs at the same time by stimulating your ovaries. These kinds of drugs increase your chances of having twins or multiples to 10% or higher, up to as much as 30%. Why twins are more common these days What has caused the rise in multiples? One possibility is that women are waiting until they are older to have babies. As we mentioned earlier, older women have higher chances of releasing more than one egg in a cycle, thus, increasing their chances of having twins. Another reason behind the rise in twins is the increased use of fertility drugs and other ways to assist a woman’s odds of conception. In the 1970’s when fertility treatment started becoming reliable, the incidence of twins almost doubled. Over the past decade, the rise in twins has steadied. This is probably due to the fact that fertility treatments have become more advanced and have lowered the risk for multiples while keeping the high possibility for conception. How will I know if I’m having twins? There are physical indicators like showing earlier than normal and higher HCG levels. Some women who have been pregnant with twins report higher than normal levels of morning sickness. However, an ultrasound is the only way to be sure. An ultrasound can usually detect twins as early as 8-14 weeks gestation. How about you? Did you dream of having twins while you were (or currently are!) pregnant?

I have your book and I LOVE IT! Thanks so much for all your work. Reply    Michele   Feb 25 at 6:06 am  Did you ever end up finding much?! I just found out we’re having twins and am having the same problem finding good information Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:23 pm  Hi my name is Theresa I see this is about fraternal twins but I have a question about the chances of having Identical twins. If you could tell me anything about it.  I know they say their not sure if it’s hereditary or not.  My sons wife is pregnant.  Her mother is an identical twin (her sister died at birth).  I have an identical twin sister.  My mother is an identical twin,  my father has identical twin sisters and my brother has identical twin girls.  Both sets of my great grand parents had twins also.  So the saying twins skip a generation are not true in our case. I have 4 boys ( no twins) I always felt that my son Zack ( the one that is expecting) would one day have identical twins.  They are just 12 weeks along so we don’t know yet if it is more than one.  I’d love to hear what you think or know about identicals thank you. Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:32 pm  Thank you I know they say identical twins are not hereditary or ran in family’s  but I think we could be a good case study because we have more then proven that they do!!! Reply    Deanne   Feb 1 at 7:04 pm  Quiz said I am unlikely to have twins–I have a set of fraternal twins! I have heard the gene for twinning is only expressed in women, but can be carried by men. My paternal grandfather was a twin, so I believe it! Reply    Briauna   Jan 1 at 9:02 pm  It said my chances of having twins were just average. I’m a 22 year old African American, 5’0 inches tall, living in California, my mother is the only fraternal twin I know about in my family and this is my first pregnancy. But surprisingly I’m having identical twin girls & I’m currently 30 weeks. Anything can happen ladies. ? Reply    HeatherM   Dec 24 at 11:41 pm  This quiz should be altered to include breastfeeding an older child when you became pregnant. http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=15924 Reply    Samantha McEwen   Nov 6 at 6:29 pm  For number 2 i answered that yes i am overweight/taller than average and i got an X for it, but even the reasoning for how to have better chances on getting twins said overweight/taller is favorable. So it shouldn’t have been an X. Reply     Genevieve    Nov 8 at 9:54 am  Sorry, it’s a little confusing with how we display that, but the math is correct. We have it set up so there’s no “right” answer, so both options display an X for that question. But we assign a much higher point value to a “yes” answer.

There are some signs of pregnancy that may make you wonder if you are carrying twins or multiples. Your odds of conceiving twins increase due to certain factors such as your family history, height, weight, body type, ethnicity, and your dietary choices. To rule out your sneaking suspicion, you can take this 12-question free twin pregnancy quiz to find your chances of having doubles. START QUIZ  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  What is your age ?  Below 30  Between 30-35  Above 35  How tall are you ?  Less than 5’5”  Greater than 5’5”  What is your BMI ?  Below 30  30 and above  Do you have a high-fat diet ?  Yes, full of yogurt, coconut oil, and meat  No, I take limited fat  How is your weight gain during pregnancy ?  The weight gain is normal  There is quite an increase in weight  How many full-term pregnancies you had so far (that includes your on-going pregnancy) ?  The current one is the first  2  3+  Did you take fertility treatments for conception ?  Yes  No  Have you already had twins before ?  Yes  No  Is there any history of multiple pregnancies in your family ?  Yes, on my mother’s side  Yes, I am one of the identical twins  Yes, on my father’s side  No  What is your ethnicity ?  African/American  Other  Do you feel very sick in the morning ?  Yes  No  Did you get pregnant while breastfeeding ?  Yes  No    How do you know if you are carrying twins? Although women expecting multiples experience similar symptoms as those carrying a single baby, there are some indications, which you may not miss (1) . i. Blood test results may vary: hCG hormonal levels are higher in your early blood test, indicating you could be carrying more than one baby. However, this is not definitive because sometimes even singleton pregnancies may show a spike in hormonal levels. ii. Exaggerated pregnancy symptoms: If you are pregnant with twins, you will experience more severe symptoms related to hormonal elevations. You may have more severe nausea and vomiting than those carrying a single baby. Women carrying twins will have extreme morning sickness known as hyperemesis gravidarum. The condition is so severe that you may require intravenous injections and other medical assistance. iii. Bigger bump: Though the increased size and weight cannot be a definitive measure of twin pregnancy, most twin mothers have quickly growing bellies earlier in the pregnancy.  How are identical and fraternal twins formed ? Identical twins are monozygotic twins, and are formed when a single fertilized egg (ovum) splits and develops into two babies. They share the same genetic information and look alike. Fraternal twins are dizygotic twins, and are formed when two separate eggs (ova) are fertilized by two separate sperms. They do not share the same genes nor look alike. What are my chances of having fraternal or identical twins ? You will have increased chances of fraternal twins if you yourself have a twin or if you have siblings who are twins. Your chances increase with your increasing age and body mass index, number of children, and your height. Identical twins are random irrespective of heredity, maternal age, number of births, etc. The chances of conceiving identical twins will be around one in every 285 pregnancies (2) . One in three sets of twins is identical (3) .  START QUIZ Most Frequently Asked Questions Q. Do identical twins have identical fingerprints ? No, identical twins will not have identical fingerprints although their genes have similar patterns. From the very early weeks of pregnancy, when a baby is developing fingerprints, there would be minor differences in the intrauterine environment to give each twin baby different fingerprints. Q. How can I confirm twin/multiple pregnancy ? The symptoms mentioned above may indicate twin pregnancy, but an ultrasound can confirm it. An ultrasound scan can detect twins as early as six to seven weeks of your pregnancy. Q. Does MomJunction’s twin quiz help me determine twin pregnancy ? Before you go for an ultrasound, you may take up this quiz. The questions in the quiz are based on the common signs of multiple pregnancies and can help you determine if you are carrying twins or multiples. If your score is above a certain probability, there is a chance of twins. Q. If I miscarry one twin will the other survive, resulting in a successful pregnancy ? Yes, it is possible to miscarry one fetus and remain pregnant with the other, resulting in a successful pregnancy. Moreover, the abortion of one fetus does not create or increase the risk for the other baby. Q. What are polar body twins ? Polar body twins develop when an unfertilized ovum splits into unequal parts, and each part fertilizes by two different sperms. Usually, at the end of ovulation, the developing egg splits into two unequal cells with the same number of chromosomes. The bigger cell is called egg while the smaller cell is called the polar body. In most cases, the polar body degenerates and dies. However, in rare cases, the polar body is also fertilized by a sperm the same time when the egg is fertilized by another sperm. It, therefore, results in twins who share 75% of their genes (from the mother) and differ in the remaining 25% (due to two different sperms from the father) (4) . Q. What precautions should be taken in twin pregnancy ? The precautions you need to take in pregnancy are the same irrespective of the number of babies you carry. They include: • Eat balanced diet • Do gentle exercises • Drink enough fluids • Go for regular antenatal appointments • Take rest • Avoid lifting weights • Avoid travel and mental stress  Disclaimer: However, do remember that this quiz does not give 100% accurate result on your twin pregnancy. If your answers indicate there is a high chance of having twins, you should see your healthcare provider to confirm that.

Home  Shop  Basket  Twins Tips          Resources Centre / Twins Tips Introduction / Twins Tips / Am I Having Twins or Triplets Quiz ?        Assess your chances of having twins.  It happens to nearly every woman during her pregnancy. Some sign or indication causes her to pause and ponder. "Could it be twins? Or MORE?" Perhaps you have some reason to believe you're having twins or triplets. such as enhanced symptoms. a family history. or fertility treatment. Or maybe you just have a sneaking suspicion that something is different. Either way. this quiz will help you assess your chances.  This quiz is designed to have fun and give you a look at some of the "risk" factors that we look for when it comes to twin or multiple birth. It in no way replaces good medical care from your doctor or midwife. But it can help you think in terms of the likelihood that you're having (possibly) more than one baby. It's also important to note that you can have zero risk factors and still be pregnant with twins. Listen to your body and get the care you need!   Q1: Are you a twin or a multiple?  Yes I am an identical twin. Yes I am a fraternal twin. Yes I am a triplet or other higher order multiple. No I am not a twin or a multiple.   Note: only fraternal twins (non-identical/dizygotic) are influenced by heredity. and then only in some cases. If your mother or maternal grandmother was or had fraternal twins. you might have inherited a gene for hyperovulation. increasing your chances of conceiving twins also.  Q2: Do you have a history of twins or multiples in your family?  Yes. one or more of my mother's relatives are fraternal twins. Yes. one or more of my father's relatives are fraternal twins. Yes. I am related to identical twins. No. I do not have any twins or multiples in my family.    See above answer  Q3: Have you already had a multiple pregnancy ?  Yes No    Once you have had a multiple pregnancy. you are significantly more likely to conceive -- and deliver -- twins again! (fraternal) Some estimates suggest that mothers of twins are four times more likely to have twins again than a woman who has never been pregnant. or who only had a singleton.    Q4: How old are you?  Under 25. Between 25 and 30. Between 30 and 35. Over 35.    Note: Older mothers are more likely to conceive twins than their younger counterparts. It's thought that the body accelerates ovulation as the biological clock starts ticking faster. Twinning rates for mothers over 35 increase significantly and if you are over 45 then your chances rise dramatically.  Q5: How many previous pregnancies have you had?  None. One. Two to Four. More than Four.    Note: The more kids you have. the more likely you are to conceive twins in a subsequent pregnancy. No one knows the magic limit that triggers a multiple pregnancy. so you'll just have to keep trying until it happens.    Q6: Were you breastfeeding when you got pregnant ?  Yes No  Note: Some research has supported the theory that the chance of twins or multiples is increased if a woman conceives while breastfeeding.  Q7: Have you received treatment for infertility?  Yes. drugs like Clomid or Metrodin. Yes. an ART procedure such as IVF. GIFT or ZIFT. No. I got pregnant without assistance.    Note: On average. 20 to 25 percent of women taking fertility drugs will become pregnant with twins and the chances are about the same if you get pregnant through IVF . because several embryos will be inserted into your womb to increase the odds that you'll conceive. Other fertility techniques such as GIFT (gamete intrafallopian transfer) and ZIFT (zygote intrafallopian transfer) are also more likely to result in multiple-baby pregnancies.     Q8: Rate your experience with morning sickness in your current pregnancy.  Little to none. Moderate. Extreme.    Note: About 50% of pregnant women experience some amount of vomiting or nausea associated with their pregnancy. Moms of multiples certainly aren't exempt. but neither are they doomed to a double dose. Enhanced morning sickness symptoms can be an indicator of a  multiple pregnancy but experiences vary widely -- some do. some don't.  Q9: Assess your level of energy during your current pregnancy.  Extreme exhaustion. can't stay awake. Feeling somewhat tired. taking more naps than usual. About the same as pre-pregnancy. Increased energy and stamina. I feel great!    Note: This is the most commonly reported complaint during pregnancy with multiples. Sleepiness. lethargy and exhaustion during the first trimester can be enhanced because the body is working overtime to nurture more than one baby. In some cases. the fatigue can be attributed to other factors (work. stress. poor nutrition. having other children). but it can also be an indication of multiples.  Q10: Have you taken an AFP (Alphafetoprotein) test?  Yes. the results were normal. Yes. the results were high. Yes. the results were low. No. I have not taken this test. or I do not know the results.    Note: AFP (Alphafetoprotein) screening is a blood test performed on pregnant mothers during the second trimester used to identify increased risks of certain birth defects. A twin pregnancy can produce an usually high -- or "positive - result.    Q11: How much weight have you gained during this pregnancy?  Not much. I'm careful about what I eat and have been exercising. Some. I'm right on track according to my doctor. Quite a bit. I can't believe how fast I outgrew my clothes!    Note: Just as a multiple pregnancy may cause a mother to measure large. it may also result in an increased weight gain. How much weight a woman gains can vary depending on her height. body type and how much she weighed pre-pregnancy. Increased or rapid weight  gain more than likely reflects eating choices rather than twins; generally. mothers of twins only gain about 10 lbs. more than singleton mothers.    Q12: How early and how often do you feel your baby(ies) move?  I could feel movement in the first trimester. I haven't felt any movement. I started to feel something in the second trimester.    Note: Feeling a baby -- or babies -- move inside the womb is one of the most thrilling aspects of pregnancy. Although many mums of multiples do experience more frequent or earlier fetal movement. there is considerable disagreement among medical professionals on the subject. For some women. recognizable feelings of movement occur earlier in subsequent pregnancies. whether there is one baby or more.    Q13: I am measuring:  Bigger than I should. Smaller than I should Just right  Note: Throughout the pregnancy. the doctor or midwife may measure the height of the uterine fundus (from the top of the pubic bone to the top of the uterus) as a way of indicating gestational age. A twin or multiple pregnancy may cause the mother's uterus to expand beyond the range of a single pregnancy. However. other factors may also increase the measurements   Q14: Have you had any of the following?  Dreams about having multiples. People telling me I might have multiples. A weird feeling that there's more than one. All of the above plus other suspicious signs.    Note: While the other items in this list refer to some kind of visible evidence -- exaggerated symptoms. abnormal test results. etc. -- we can't disregard the power of a mother's intuition. A family history of multiples. or a powerful hunch can be convincing indicators.    Q15: have you had an ultrasound.  Yes. after six weeks gestation.  Yes. after twelve weeks gestation. No. I have not had an ultrasound.    Seeing is believing... the only way to indisputably confirm a twin or multiple pregnancy is to see it -- via ultrasound. An ultrasound image can indicate without a doubt if there is more than one fetus. Ultimately. no matter what other signs or symptoms you have. the only way you'll know for sure is to have an ultrasound. In recent years. enhanced use of ultrasound early in pregnancy has increased the frequency of diagnosis of twin pregnancy. and unfortunately. has produced a heightened awareness of the phenomenon of Vanishing Twin Syndrome (VTS). VTS is when one of a set of twin fetuses apparently disappears from the womb during pregnancy. usually resulting in a normal singleton pregnancy.    Well. are you having twins ? The questions are based around the common indicators of a multiple pregnancy and the notes below help as a guide for you to assess whether or not you may be expecting more than one. If you suspect you are having twins then talk to your doctor to have it confirmed.

How old are you (the mother-to-be)?             I’m in my 20s. I’ve got youth on my side.              Just entered my 30s. Life is getting good.              I’m 35 or older. Gaining confidence and oh-so-wise.       2. Do you have any fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family?             Nope, no non-identical twins in either of our families.              Yes, on the maternal side.              Yes, on the paternal side.              Actually, we have non-identical twins on both sides!       3. How tall are you?             Got a step stool in our kitchen! I’m 5’4” or shorter.              If I want it, I can reach it. I’m 5’5” or taller.       4. When I step on the scale, I imagine the scale saying...             “Hello, anyone there?” I’m kind of underweight.              “Looking fine today, girl.” My weight is just right.              “You know, curves are the new sexy.” I’m slightly overweight.              “Big and beautiful, your sexy just overflows!” I’m obese.       5. How many children do you have?             I don’t have any children yet.              We’ve got a one and only.              We’ve got two, nice and even.              We’re outnumbered! We have three kids.              At least four... but there may be more. Every time I turn around, another pops up.       6. Are you African-American?             Yes              No       7. Will you be breastfeeding when you conceive?             No, not nursing any little ones here.              Yes. We may even tandem nurse if another one (or two!) come along! We’ll see.       8. Will you be using fertility treatments to conceive?             Hopefully not! We’re trying for au naturel.              Yes, we’re taking Clomid or Letrozole.              Yes, we’re using injectable fertility drugs.              Yes, we’re doing IVF.              Yes, but we’re not using any fertility drugs.         Are Your Odds of Conceiving Twins Higher Than Most?  You got: I Don’t See Twins In Your Future, But...    Henrik Sorensen / Getty Images   When I gaze into my crystal ball, I don’t see twins in your future. You don’t have any attributes that would increase your odds over the average .  However, the view is foggy. I could be wrong!  About 1 in 100 naturally conceived pregnancies are twins.  Who knows, you might be that 1 in 100!  Some say that getting a very early positive pregnancy test , having really bad morning sickness or pregnancy symptoms , or having high hCG levels can indicate a twin pregnancy.  But this isn’t true. You can have all of those signs and not be pregnant with twins. (You can also have none of those signs and be pregnant with twins!)  Are you wondering if you’re pregnant with twins right now? The only way to know for certain is with an ultrasound .  If you’ve only got one in there, try not to be disappointed. Twin pregnancies come with risks to you and your babies . While there are wonderful things about twins , not everything is sunshine and butterflies.  Often times, having just one bun in the oven is best.   THIS TOOL DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE.

Wondering if all that movement going on in your belly might be from four little arms and four little legs? Take our quiz and find out if twins might be in your future.              1   Do you feel huge … no, really huge?      Yes, I feel like I've swallowed a water buffalo     No, I'm not feeling big at all          2   In your first trimester did you experience rapid weight gain?      Yes, I'm ballooning faster than Violet Beauregarde in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (and come to think of it, I'm craving blueberries, too)     No, I'm gaining weight slowly and steadily          3   Have your labs come back with highly elevated hCG or AFP values?      Yes, very high levels (the nurse told me to sit down before sharing them with me)     No, everything is considered "normal"          4   Is there a ping-pong tournament going on in your belly?      Yes, definitely. We're talking Olympic-level sporting event here     No, more like a Sunday afternoon golf tourney (with an occasional misfired drive here and there)          5   Are you experiencing extreme pregnancy symptoms (fatigue, morning sickness, moodiness, breast tenderness)?      I'd answer if I could, I'm too tired to reach the keyboard     No, I'm feeling really good (gotta go, time for my prenatal yoga class)          6   Do twins run in your family?      Yes     No          7   Are you a fraternal twin?      Yes, how'd you know?     No, I'm not a twin (that I know of!)     Actually, I'm an identical twin          8   Have you previously given birth to twins?      Yes, how could I forget!     No, I've not given birth to twins (yet!)          9   Is this your third, fourth, or greater pregnancy?      Hmmm ... I think so. I've been pregnant so many times, I forget     No, this is my first or second pregnancy          10   Are you over 35 years of age?      Yes, but .... shhhh ... please don't tell anyone!     Nope! I'm under 35          11   Is your uterus measuring large?      Yes, it is! My nurse tells me I have the biggest uterus she's seen (wait, is that not normal?)     No, evidently my uterus is not too small, not too big, but just the right size          12   Did you get pregnant right after going off the pill?      Yes ... BANG! What a surprise     No, it took a while to conceive          13   Have you had infertility treatments?

Share on Facebook Share on Pinterest Share on Twitter    Take this quiz again!       Chances are that twins are not in your future  However, the best way to know for sure if you need to buy double of all your baby supplies is to have an ultrasound. Between 8 and 12 weeks, you’ll have your first ultrasound. As early as 6 weeks your doctor will be able to discern if you are expecting twins or a single baby in the next nine months. Whether twins are on their way or not, congratulations on your pregnancy!     Share on Facebook Share on Pinterest Share on Twitter    Take this quiz again!

After all, there’s no harm in having a little daydream about your own chances of having twins. But then again, the idea of having twins may not appeal to you at all.  We all know we can’t pick our family. But when it comes to conceiving with a set of twins, having a family history of hyper ovulation, releasing more than one egg each month, does certainly help.  Reasons for wanting to increase the chances of having twins   Maternal age. For women who have left having their family until they are older, there is a tendency to want to have their children quickly.  The practical side of taking one period of time from work in order to raise a young family.  Having a family history of twins. If twins are familiar to you and already in your family then you may want to have your own.  Wanting a big family with siblings who are close in age.  Simply because the idea appeals to you. For no other reason than the idea of having two babies is just a lovely notion.   What will help boost my chances of having twins?  You’re already increasing your chances if you are a twin yourself or if you have siblings who are twins.  If you are lucky enough to come from a family with a pattern of having twins then genetically you are more likely to as well.  So if you, your mother or your maternal grandmother are or were fraternal (non-identical) twins then your chances of having twins may increase to as many as 1 in 7.  But if none of these apply to you and you’re keen to have twins, don’t despair.  Within the general population the chances of having twins is about one in every 89 births. Twin numbers have steadily increased since the 1980s. This is due in part, to the number of couples who have had and are having fertility assistance.  Just remember The chances of having identical or non-fraternal twins is the same for every woman, wherever she lives and no matter what her family history. Identical twinning is random and universal – it is not reliant on two eggs being released but one egg being fertilised by one sperm and then dividing into two. The chances of having identical twins are around 1 in every 285 pregnancies. Around one in every three sets of twins is identical.  Some statistics – just to get you thinking!   If you are over 45 your chances of having twins increases to around 17%. But you need to think very carefully if you want to have a baby if you are within this age group, let alone two.    By the time your twins are 21 you will be 66, so think very carefully if this will be right for you and your partner.  If you’re really keen to have twins, then leaving your dash to try conceiving until after you’re 50 will increase your chances to 1 in 9.  Don’t try to have your babies when you are less than 25 years. If you wait until after your 35th birthday then you will more than double your chances in this space of waiting 10 years.  Women who undergo fertility assistance and take drugs to stimulate their ovaries have more twins. This is because more eggs are released each month and with IVF , generally more than one embryo is put back into the uterus. Because of the improvement in fertility management, the rate of success with embryo transfers has never been better.  If you are from Nigeria then you are more likely to have twins than a Caucasian woman of the same age. Nigerian women enjoy the highest rate of twin pregnancies in the world. And because their rate is so high, around 1 in every 22 women, the genetic potential to keep twins occurring through the generations will become even more likely.  If you are overweight then you are more likely to have twins. Perhaps this is nature’s way of guaranteeing that the pregnant mother is able to provide sufficient nutrition to support a twin pregnancy. But women who are overweight or obese often have problems conceiving in the first place. One of the most common recommendations for women who are keen to fall pregnant is to stay within a healthy weight range. A healthy Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ) is 20-25. Women with a BMR of 30 or over tend to have more twins.  If you are tall, in the top 25th percentile for your height amongst women of the same age, then you are more likely to have twins. Again, this may be attributable to Mother Nature interpreting height (and weight) as a sign of good pregnancy material.

This is an intriguing question that 
many will ponder even before they plan on starting a family.  People are
 fascinated by twins in general and so, of course, any woman trying to 
conceive will likely wonder what her chances of having twins are.  There
 is  a lot of gray area when it comes to figuring out the true 
probability on conceiving twins because there are so many different 
factors involved.  We will discuss these here to try and give you a much
 better picture of the odds of having twins. First off you should know that twin birth has been on the rise since the 80's.  Many of the factors we will go over are actually directly related to this rise. 
Will they increase your odds?  Lets see...  Our List of the Odds of Having Twins:  In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) . If you are undergoing IVF to try and conceive, your chances of having twins are about 32% (at 
least in the U.S.).  Because two or more fertilized eggs are routinely 
implanted at one time, the increase in odds is substantial. The Use Of Clomid . Clomid is a fertility drug that aids in ovulation.  Women undergoing 
this type of treatment have about a 10% increase in their chances of 
having twins because clomid can cause hyper-ovulation (the release of 
more than one egg).  Maternal Age . Studies have found that there is an increase hyper-ovulation in women over the age of 35.
Because so many women are waiting until later in life to start their families, we have seen a rise in the twinning rate overall. Hereditary Factors . If fraternal twins run in your family, you may have increased odds of having twins yourself.
This is because the hyper-ovulation gene can be passed on from mother to daughter.  True statistics are not clear on this.        Height & Weight . Some more recent studies have concluded that the fraternal twinning rate
 increases substantially in obese women, as well as women with an above 
average height.  Although the reasons are not completely clear there is 
some sort of correlation. Eating Dairy Products . Another study done a few years ago has shown that women who consume dairy products, 
as opposed to those who don't seem to be five times more likely to get 
pregnant with twins.  
Probably linked to the insulin-like growth factor (IGF).  Already Having A Set Of Twins . It seems that women who have already had a set of fraternal twins are a 
bit more likely to have another set of twins as opposed to a woman who 
has only had singletons.  This may be linked to the hyper-ovulation 
gene.  You might have noticed that there is a constant reference to fraternal 
twins when talking about the odds of having twins.  There is much to 
learn about the differences between identical and fraternal twins and what causes them.  We recommend that you check out our extensive article regarding this remarkable topic to learn more.
  And remember, you might just have twins by sheer luck.  In this sense,
 we all have the same chances!      Home ›  HCG Levels  ›

You’re already increasing your chances if you are a twin yourself or if you have siblings who are twins.  If you are lucky enough to come from a family with a pattern of having twins then genetically you are more likely to as well.  So if you, your mother or your maternal grandmother are or were fraternal (non-identical) twins then your chances of having twins may increase to as many as 1 in 7.  But if none of these apply to you and you’re keen to have twins, don’t despair.  Within the general population the chances of having twins is about one in every 89 births. Twin numbers have steadily increased since the 1980s. This is due in part, to the number of couples who have had and are having fertility assistance.  Just remember The chances of having identical or non-fraternal twins is the same for every woman, wherever she lives and no matter what her family history. Identical twinning is random and universal – it is not reliant on two eggs being released but one egg being fertilised by one sperm and then dividing into two. The chances of having identical twins are around 1 in every 285 pregnancies. Around one in every three sets of twins is identical.  Some statistics – just to get you thinking!   If you are over 45 your chances of having twins increases to around 17%. But you need to think very carefully if you want to have a baby if you are within this age group, let alone two.    By the time your twins are 21 you will be 66, so think very carefully if this will be right for you and your partner.  If you’re really keen to have twins, then leaving your dash to try conceiving until after you’re 50 will increase your chances to 1 in 9.  Don’t try to have your babies when you are less than 25 years. If you wait until after your 35th birthday then you will more than double your chances in this space of waiting 10 years.  Women who undergo fertility assistance and take drugs to stimulate their ovaries have more twins. This is because more eggs are released each month and with IVF , generally more than one embryo is put back into the uterus. Because of the improvement in fertility management, the rate of success with embryo transfers has never been better.  If you are from Nigeria then you are more likely to have twins than a Caucasian woman of the same age. Nigerian women enjoy the highest rate of twin pregnancies in the world. And because their rate is so high, around 1 in every 22 women, the genetic potential to keep twins occurring through the generations will become even more likely.  If you are overweight then you are more likely to have twins. Perhaps this is nature’s way of guaranteeing that the pregnant mother is able to provide sufficient nutrition to support a twin pregnancy. But women who are overweight or obese often have problems conceiving in the first place. One of the most common recommendations for women who are keen to fall pregnant is to stay within a healthy weight range. A healthy Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ) is 20-25. Women with a BMR of 30 or over tend to have more twins.  If you are tall, in the top 25th percentile for your height amongst women of the same age, then you are more likely to have twins. Again, this may be attributable to Mother Nature interpreting height (and weight) as a sign of good pregnancy material.

Home  Shop  Basket  Twins Tips          Resources Centre / Twins Tips Introduction / Twins Tips / What are the chances of having Twins.Triplets or Quads ?        You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Share          Expert Answer       The BabyCentre editorial team  Our panel of health writers     Non-identical (fraternal) twins tend to run in families. But identical twins don't.  Non-identical twins are the result of two separate eggs being fertilised by two separate sperm. There is a gene that makes a woman more likely to release two or more eggs during ovulation, and it's this gene that runs in families. Identical twins are the result of a single fertilised egg splitting, and this seems to be a random event.  So if you're a woman and non-identical twins run in your family, you're more likely to have a set yourself. It's estimated that you're about two and a half times more likely than average to have twins if you're a non-identical twin, or have siblings who are non-identical twins.  A man with a family history of twins may carry the gene, but it won't mean he can father a set of non-identical twins. The gene is only expressed through women who ovulate. If he has daughters, they may inherit the gene, and one day go on to have fraternal twins.  This may explain why some people think that twins skip a generation in families. You may have heard, for example, that if your mum or dad is a twin but you're not, you're more likely to have twins yourself. There's no evidence to support this. What can happen, though, is that a dad can pass on the non-identical twin gene to his daughters and this may make twins appear to skip a generation.  Your heritage can affect your chances of having twins. For example, non-identical twins are most common in women of Central African origin, and least common in women of South-East Asian and Latin American origin.  Aside from inheritance, age plays a big role in how likely you are to have twins. If you're a woman in your mid-30s or beyond, you have a greater chance than a younger woman of having twins or more. As you get older, you naturally produce more ovulation-stimulating hormones, which could trigger your ovaries to release several eggs each month.  The use of some fertility treatments also increases the likelihood of a woman having twins. All treatments that stimulate the ovaries to release eggs or involve two or more embryos being transferred to the womb increase the chance of multiple births.

What caused the increase in multiples?  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby?  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

So… the odds aren’t exactly with you. Or are they? Turns out, there are a number of factors that can affect your odds of getting pregnant with multiples and having twin babies. These include your age, diet, number of pregnancies you’ve had, ethnicity, location, body type, and more. So what are your chancing of having twins or multiples? Take our just-for-fun quiz to find out instantly!  1. Do you have fraternal twins in your family?  Not that I know of  Yes, on my dad’s side  Yes, on my mom’s side  Yes, more than one set on my mom’s side 2. Are you overweight and/or taller than average?  Yes  No 3. What is your ethnicity?  Nigerian  African  Caucasian  Hispanic or Asian  Other 4. Where do you live?  Nigeria  Central Africa  North America or Europe  Latin America or Asia  Other 5. Do you eat a high fat diet?  Yep, full fat pastured yogurt, coconut oil, and pastured bacon  Yes, but it mostly comes from conventional animal products  I try to limit my consumption of fat 6. Do you frequently eat large amounts of phytoestrogen foods such as soy, tempeh, flax, sesame seeds, oats, barley, dried beans, lentils, yams, alfalfa, and mung beans?  Yes, I eat large servings of those foods daily  Sure, but not daily  No, I hardly ever eat those foods 7. How old are you?  Under 35  35-39  Over 40 8. How many full-term pregnancies have you had (including your current pregnancy)?  This is my first  2  3  4+ 9. Did you use fertility treatments to conceive?  Yes, fertility drugs  No  Yes, IVF  Loading…            What is the birth rate for twins? Identical twins rates are equal to about 3.5 out of 1000 births, the birth rate for identical twins has not changed over the past few decades and is about the same nationwide. Worldwide, about 12-16 in 1000 people are naturally conceived twins. So, the chances of having twins are small. However,in 2010, births of twins in general in the U.S. were 33 in 1000 people. The birth rate for fraternal twins has risen by about 76% in the past 30 years. The obvious reason is fertility treatments but surprisingly, they are not the only reason. What factors affect the chances of having twins? The chances of a woman having identical twins are about the same for everyone, as identical twins do not tend to run in families. This is because identical twins come from a single fertilized egg splitting in two and this is a random, rare event. Fraternal twins, on the other hand, can be genetic. Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs being fertilized by two sperm. Typically women only release one egg each cycle but women who conceive fraternal twins have released two. This is why fraternal twins can only be genetically connected through the mother, meaning the father’s genetics have nothing to do with twinning. Releasing more than one egg in a cycle is called hyper-ovulation and is controlled by certain genes. Women who conceive fraternal twins usually have high levels of these genes, which makes sense. So who is more likely to conceive fraternal twins? Your chances of having twins depend on six factors: 1. Body type Twins tend to be more common in larger women as well as woman who are tall. In one study, women with a BMI of 30 or above were nearly 1.5 times more likely to have twins than the women in the normal BMI range of 20 to 24.9. Those same women were more likely to have opposite sex twins than same sex twins as well. Researchers are still unsure why this is the case. 2. Ethnicity and location On the surface it appears that ethnicity plays a role in the chances of having twins, yet location seems to have a large part as well. The Yoruba tribe of Nigeria has the highest rate of twins at 45–50 twin sets (or 90–100 twins) per 1,000 live births, however being of Nigerian decent and living elsewhere doesn’t show the same correlation to twin births. In Central Africa there are 18–30 twin sets (or 36–60 twins) per 1,000 live births. North America and Europe (and caucasians in general) have intermediate rates of 9-16 twin sets per 1,000 live births Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (and hispanic and asian ethnicities in general) have the lowest rates of 6–9 twin sets per 1,000 live births. The difference in chances of having twins between geographic locations (more than ethnicity) begs the question of whether climate, diet, or lifestyle have more to do with the chances of having twins than anything else. 3. Diet We already know that diet does play a role. Women who eat full fat foods over non fat or low fat are more likely to conceive twins. This could be because fat is an important building block for pregnancy and those that eat more fat are better suited to carry two babies. It may also be that the difference in the amount of fat a woman eats affects hormones. Some information points to the daily consumption of yams being the reason Nigerian women have more chances of having twins. True yams contain a phytoestrogen that increases a woman’s follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and may cause hyper-ovulation. 4. Maternal Age Older woman tend to have a higher chance of fraternal twins. Women over 35 tend to produce more FSH than younger women and women with higher levels of these hormones are more likely to have twins. The increase in FSH levels also shows declining fertility, which means they are less likely to get pregnant, but more likely to have twins if they happen to conceive. 5. Number of Pregnancies The more pregnancies that a woman has had increase her chances of having twins. This could be a simple case of numbers. The more pregnancies you have the higher your chances of having twins. 6. Fertility Treatments Women who take certain types of fertility treatments have increased chances of having twins.  In vitro fertilization (IVF) increases your odds of having multiples by 20-40% depending on how many embryos are placed inside your womb. Some believe that IVF can also increase your chances of having identical twins but research doesn’t support this. Fertility drugs increase the odds of you releasing several eggs at the same time by stimulating your ovaries. These kinds of drugs increase your chances of having twins or multiples to 10% or higher, up to as much as 30%. Why twins are more common these days What has caused the rise in multiples? One possibility is that women are waiting until they are older to have babies. As we mentioned earlier, older women have higher chances of releasing more than one egg in a cycle, thus, increasing their chances of having twins. Another reason behind the rise in twins is the increased use of fertility drugs and other ways to assist a woman’s odds of conception. In the 1970’s when fertility treatment started becoming reliable, the incidence of twins almost doubled. Over the past decade, the rise in twins has steadied. This is probably due to the fact that fertility treatments have become more advanced and have lowered the risk for multiples while keeping the high possibility for conception. How will I know if I’m having twins? There are physical indicators like showing earlier than normal and higher HCG levels. Some women who have been pregnant with twins report higher than normal levels of morning sickness. However, an ultrasound is the only way to be sure. An ultrasound can usually detect twins as early as 8-14 weeks gestation. How about you? Did you dream of having twins while you were (or currently are!) pregnant?

I am told you will need to eat more but when does that start? There does not seem to be a lot of information on twins and how you deal with health and changes over a single birth! I have your book and I LOVE IT! Thanks so much for all your work. Reply    Michele   Feb 25 at 6:06 am  Did you ever end up finding much?! I just found out we’re having twins and am having the same problem finding good information Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:23 pm  Hi my name is Theresa I see this is about fraternal twins but I have a question about the chances of having Identical twins. If you could tell me anything about it.  I know they say their not sure if it’s hereditary or not.  My sons wife is pregnant.  Her mother is an identical twin (her sister died at birth).  I have an identical twin sister.  My mother is an identical twin,  my father has identical twin sisters and my brother has identical twin girls.  Both sets of my great grand parents had twins also.  So the saying twins skip a generation are not true in our case. I have 4 boys ( no twins) I always felt that my son Zack ( the one that is expecting) would one day have identical twins.  They are just 12 weeks along so we don’t know yet if it is more than one.  I’d love to hear what you think or know about identicals thank you. Reply    Theresa Medlin   Jul 21 at 12:32 pm  Thank you I know they say identical twins are not hereditary or ran in family’s  but I think we could be a good case study because we have more then proven that they do!!! Reply    Deanne   Feb 1 at 7:04 pm  Quiz said I am unlikely to have twins–I have a set of fraternal twins! I have heard the gene for twinning is only expressed in women, but can be carried by men. My paternal grandfather was a twin, so I believe it! Reply    Briauna   Jan 1 at 9:02 pm  It said my chances of having twins were just average. I’m a 22 year old African American, 5’0 inches tall, living in California, my mother is the only fraternal twin I know about in my family and this is my first pregnancy. But surprisingly I’m having identical twin girls & I’m currently 30 weeks. Anything can happen ladies. ? Reply    HeatherM   Dec 24 at 11:41 pm  This quiz should be altered to include breastfeeding an older child when you became pregnant. http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=15924 Reply    Samantha McEwen   Nov 6 at 6:29 pm  For number 2 i answered that yes i am overweight/taller than average and i got an X for it, but even the reasoning for how to have better chances on getting twins said overweight/taller is favorable. So it shouldn’t have been an X. Reply     Genevieve    Nov 8 at 9:54 am  Sorry, it’s a little confusing with how we display that, but the math is correct. We have it set up so there’s no “right” answer, so both options display an X for that question. But we assign a much higher point value to a “yes” answer.

There are some signs of pregnancy that may make you wonder if you are carrying twins or multiples. Your odds of conceiving twins increase due to certain factors such as your family history, height, weight, body type, ethnicity, and your dietary choices. To rule out your sneaking suspicion, you can take this 12-question free twin pregnancy quiz to find your chances of having doubles. START QUIZ  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  What is your age ?  Below 30  Between 30-35  Above 35  How tall are you ?  Less than 5’5”  Greater than 5’5”  What is your BMI ?  Below 30  30 and above  Do you have a high-fat diet ?  Yes, full of yogurt, coconut oil, and meat  No, I take limited fat  How is your weight gain during pregnancy ?  The weight gain is normal  There is quite an increase in weight  How many full-term pregnancies you had so far (that includes your on-going pregnancy) ?  The current one is the first  2  3+  Did you take fertility treatments for conception ?  Yes  No  Have you already had twins before ?  Yes  No  Is there any history of multiple pregnancies in your family ?  Yes, on my mother’s side  Yes, I am one of the identical twins  Yes, on my father’s side  No  What is your ethnicity ?  African/American  Other  Do you feel very sick in the morning ?  Yes  No  Did you get pregnant while breastfeeding ?  Yes  No    How do you know if you are carrying twins? Although women expecting multiples experience similar symptoms as those carrying a single baby, there are some indications, which you may not miss (1) . i. Blood test results may vary: hCG hormonal levels are higher in your early blood test, indicating you could be carrying more than one baby. However, this is not definitive because sometimes even singleton pregnancies may show a spike in hormonal levels. ii. Exaggerated pregnancy symptoms: If you are pregnant with twins, you will experience more severe symptoms related to hormonal elevations. You may have more severe nausea and vomiting than those carrying a single baby. Women carrying twins will have extreme morning sickness known as hyperemesis gravidarum. The condition is so severe that you may require intravenous injections and other medical assistance. iii. Bigger bump: Though the increased size and weight cannot be a definitive measure of twin pregnancy, most twin mothers have quickly growing bellies earlier in the pregnancy.  How are identical and fraternal twins formed ? Identical twins are monozygotic twins, and are formed when a single fertilized egg (ovum) splits and develops into two babies. They share the same genetic information and look alike. Fraternal twins are dizygotic twins, and are formed when two separate eggs (ova) are fertilized by two separate sperms. They do not share the same genes nor look alike. What are my chances of having fraternal or identical twins ? You will have increased chances of fraternal twins if you yourself have a twin or if you have siblings who are twins. Your chances increase with your increasing age and body mass index, number of children, and your height. Identical twins are random irrespective of heredity, maternal age, number of births, etc. The chances of conceiving identical twins will be around one in every 285 pregnancies (2) . One in three sets of twins is identical (3) .  START QUIZ Most Frequently Asked Questions Q. Do identical twins have identical fingerprints ? No, identical twins will not have identical fingerprints although their genes have similar patterns. From the very early weeks of pregnancy, when a baby is developing fingerprints, there would be minor differences in the intrauterine environment to give each twin baby different fingerprints. Q. How can I confirm twin/multiple pregnancy ? The symptoms mentioned above may indicate twin pregnancy, but an ultrasound can confirm it. An ultrasound scan can detect twins as early as six to seven weeks of your pregnancy. Q. Does MomJunction’s twin quiz help me determine twin pregnancy ? Before you go for an ultrasound, you may take up this quiz. The questions in the quiz are based on the common signs of multiple pregnancies and can help you determine if you are carrying twins or multiples. If your score is above a certain probability, there is a chance of twins. Q. If I miscarry one twin will the other survive, resulting in a successful pregnancy ? Yes, it is possible to miscarry one fetus and remain pregnant with the other, resulting in a successful pregnancy. Moreover, the abortion of one fetus does not create or increase the risk for the other baby. Q. What are polar body twins ? Polar body twins develop when an unfertilized ovum splits into unequal parts, and each part fertilizes by two different sperms. Usually, at the end of ovulation, the developing egg splits into two unequal cells with the same number of chromosomes. The bigger cell is called egg while the smaller cell is called the polar body. In most cases, the polar body degenerates and dies. However, in rare cases, the polar body is also fertilized by a sperm the same time when the egg is fertilized by another sperm. It, therefore, results in twins who share 75% of their genes (from the mother) and differ in the remaining 25% (due to two different sperms from the father) (4) . Q. What precautions should be taken in twin pregnancy ? The precautions you need to take in pregnancy are the same irrespective of the number of babies you carry. They include: • Eat balanced diet • Do gentle exercises • Drink enough fluids • Go for regular antenatal appointments • Take rest • Avoid lifting weights • Avoid travel and mental stress  Disclaimer: However, do remember that this quiz does not give 100% accurate result on your twin pregnancy. If your answers indicate there is a high chance of having twins, you should see your healthcare provider to confirm that.

Home  Shop  Basket  Twins Tips          Resources Centre / Twins Tips Introduction / Twins Tips / Am I Having Twins or Triplets Quiz ?        Assess your chances of having twins.  It happens to nearly every woman during her pregnancy. Some sign or indication causes her to pause and ponder. "Could it be twins? Or MORE?" Perhaps you have some reason to believe you're having twins or triplets. such as enhanced symptoms. a family history. or fertility treatment. Or maybe you just have a sneaking suspicion that something is different. Either way. this quiz will help you assess your chances.  This quiz is designed to have fun and give you a look at some of the "risk" factors that we look for when it comes to twin or multiple birth. It in no way replaces good medical care from your doctor or midwife. But it can help you think in terms of the likelihood that you're having (possibly) more than one baby. It's also important to note that you can have zero risk factors and still be pregnant with twins. Listen to your body and get the care you need!   Q1: Are you a twin or a multiple?  Yes I am an identical twin. Yes I am a fraternal twin. Yes I am a triplet or other higher order multiple. No I am not a twin or a multiple.   Note: only fraternal twins (non-identical/dizygotic) are influenced by heredity. and then only in some cases. If your mother or maternal grandmother was or had fraternal twins. you might have inherited a gene for hyperovulation. increasing your chances of conceiving twins also.  Q2: Do you have a history of twins or multiples in your family?  Yes. one or more of my mother's relatives are fraternal twins. Yes. one or more of my father's relatives are fraternal twins. Yes. I am related to identical twins. No. I do not have any twins or multiples in my family.    See above answer  Q3: Have you already had a multiple pregnancy ?  Yes No    Once you have had a multiple pregnancy. you are significantly more likely to conceive -- and deliver -- twins again! (fraternal) Some estimates suggest that mothers of twins are four times more likely to have twins again than a woman who has never been pregnant. or who only had a singleton.    Q4: How old are you?  Under 25. Between 25 and 30. Between 30 and 35. Over 35.    Note: Older mothers are more likely to conceive twins than their younger counterparts. It's thought that the body accelerates ovulation as the biological clock starts ticking faster. Twinning rates for mothers over 35 increase significantly and if you are over 45 then your chances rise dramatically.  Q5: How many previous pregnancies have you had?  None. One. Two to Four. More than Four.    Note: The more kids you have. the more likely you are to conceive twins in a subsequent pregnancy. No one knows the magic limit that triggers a multiple pregnancy. so you'll just have to keep trying until it happens.    Q6: Were you breastfeeding when you got pregnant ?  Yes No  Note: Some research has supported the theory that the chance of twins or multiples is increased if a woman conceives while breastfeeding.  Q7: Have you received treatment for infertility?  Yes. drugs like Clomid or Metrodin. Yes. an ART procedure such as IVF. GIFT or ZIFT. No. I got pregnant without assistance.    Note: On average. 20 to 25 percent of women taking fertility drugs will become pregnant with twins and the chances are about the same if you get pregnant through IVF . because several embryos will be inserted into your womb to increase the odds that you'll conceive. Other fertility techniques such as GIFT (gamete intrafallopian transfer) and ZIFT (zygote intrafallopian transfer) are also more likely to result in multiple-baby pregnancies.     Q8: Rate your experience with morning sickness in your current pregnancy.  Little to none. Moderate. Extreme.    Note: About 50% of pregnant women experience some amount of vomiting or nausea associated with their pregnancy. Moms of multiples certainly aren't exempt. but neither are they doomed to a double dose. Enhanced morning sickness symptoms can be an indicator of a  multiple pregnancy but experiences vary widely -- some do. some don't.  Q9: Assess your level of energy during your current pregnancy.  Extreme exhaustion. can't stay awake. Feeling somewhat tired. taking more naps than usual. About the same as pre-pregnancy. Increased energy and stamina. I feel great!    Note: This is the most commonly reported complaint during pregnancy with multiples. Sleepiness. lethargy and exhaustion during the first trimester can be enhanced because the body is working overtime to nurture more than one baby. In some cases. the fatigue can be attributed to other factors (work. stress. poor nutrition. having other children). but it can also be an indication of multiples.  Q10: Have you taken an AFP (Alphafetoprotein) test?  Yes. the results were normal. Yes. the results were high. Yes. the results were low. No. I have not taken this test. or I do not know the results.    Note: AFP (Alphafetoprotein) screening is a blood test performed on pregnant mothers during the second trimester used to identify increased risks of certain birth defects. A twin pregnancy can produce an usually high -- or "positive - result.    Q11: How much weight have you gained during this pregnancy?  Not much. I'm careful about what I eat and have been exercising. Some. I'm right on track according to my doctor. Quite a bit. I can't believe how fast I outgrew my clothes!    Note: Just as a multiple pregnancy may cause a mother to measure large. it may also result in an increased weight gain. How much weight a woman gains can vary depending on her height. body type and how much she weighed pre-pregnancy. Increased or rapid weight  gain more than likely reflects eating choices rather than twins; generally. mothers of twins only gain about 10 lbs. more than singleton mothers.    Q12: How early and how often do you feel your baby(ies) move?  I could feel movement in the first trimester. I haven't felt any movement. I started to feel something in the second trimester.    Note: Feeling a baby -- or babies -- move inside the womb is one of the most thrilling aspects of pregnancy. Although many mums of multiples do experience more frequent or earlier fetal movement. there is considerable disagreement among medical professionals on the subject. For some women. recognizable feelings of movement occur earlier in subsequent pregnancies. whether there is one baby or more.    Q13: I am measuring:  Bigger than I should. Smaller than I should Just right  Note: Throughout the pregnancy. the doctor or midwife may measure the height of the uterine fundus (from the top of the pubic bone to the top of the uterus) as a way of indicating gestational age. A twin or multiple pregnancy may cause the mother's uterus to expand beyond the range of a single pregnancy. However. other factors may also increase the measurements   Q14: Have you had any of the following?  Dreams about having multiples. People telling me I might have multiples. A weird feeling that there's more than one. All of the above plus other suspicious signs.    Note: While the other items in this list refer to some kind of visible evidence -- exaggerated symptoms. abnormal test results. etc. -- we can't disregard the power of a mother's intuition. A family history of multiples. or a powerful hunch can be convincing indicators.    Q15: have you had an ultrasound.  Yes. after six weeks gestation.  Yes. after twelve weeks gestation. No. I have not had an ultrasound.    Seeing is believing... the only way to indisputably confirm a twin or multiple pregnancy is to see it -- via ultrasound. An ultrasound image can indicate without a doubt if there is more than one fetus. Ultimately. no matter what other signs or symptoms you have. the only way you'll know for sure is to have an ultrasound. In recent years. enhanced use of ultrasound early in pregnancy has increased the frequency of diagnosis of twin pregnancy. and unfortunately. has produced a heightened awareness of the phenomenon of Vanishing Twin Syndrome (VTS). VTS is when one of a set of twin fetuses apparently disappears from the womb during pregnancy. usually resulting in a normal singleton pregnancy.    Well. are you having twins ? The questions are based around the common indicators of a multiple pregnancy and the notes below help as a guide for you to assess whether or not you may be expecting more than one. If you suspect you are having twins then talk to your doctor to have it confirmed.

How old are you (the mother-to-be)?             I’m in my 20s. I’ve got youth on my side.              Just entered my 30s. Life is getting good.              I’m 35 or older. Gaining confidence and oh-so-wise.       2. Do you have any fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family?             Nope, no non-identical twins in either of our families.

You got: I Don’t See Twins In Your Future, But...    Henrik Sorensen / Getty Images   When I gaze into my crystal ball, I don’t see twins in your future. You don’t have any attributes that would increase your odds over the average .  However, the view is foggy. I could be wrong!  About 1 in 100 naturally conceived pregnancies are twins.  Who knows, you might be that 1 in 100!  Some say that getting a very early positive pregnancy test , having really bad morning sickness or pregnancy symptoms , or having high hCG levels can indicate a twin pregnancy.  But this isn’t true. You can have all of those signs and not be pregnant with twins. (You can also have none of those signs and be pregnant with twins!)  Are you wondering if you’re pregnant with twins right now? The only way to know for certain is with an ultrasound .  If you’ve only got one in there, try not to be disappointed. Twin pregnancies come with risks to you and your babies . While there are wonderful things about twins , not everything is sunshine and butterflies.  Often times, having just one bun in the oven is best.   THIS TOOL DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE.

Wondering if all that movement going on in your belly might be from four little arms and four little legs? Take our quiz and find out if twins might be in your future.              1   Do you feel huge … no, really huge?      Yes, I feel like I've swallowed a water buffalo     No, I'm not feeling big at all          2   In your first trimester did you experience rapid weight gain?      Yes, I'm ballooning faster than Violet Beauregarde in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (and come to think of it, I'm craving blueberries, too)     No, I'm gaining weight slowly and steadily          3   Have your labs come back with highly elevated hCG or AFP values?      Yes, very high levels (the nurse told me to sit down before sharing them with me)     No, everything is considered "normal"          4   Is there a ping-pong tournament going on in your belly?      Yes, definitely. We're talking Olympic-level sporting event here     No, more like a Sunday afternoon golf tourney (with an occasional misfired drive here and there)          5   Are you experiencing extreme pregnancy symptoms (fatigue, morning sickness, moodiness, breast tenderness)?      I'd answer if I could, I'm too tired to reach the keyboard     No, I'm feeling really good (gotta go, time for my prenatal yoga class)          6   Do twins run in your family?

I've been pregnant so many times, I forget     No, this is my first or second pregnancy          10   Are you over 35 years of age?      Yes, but .... shhhh ... please don't tell anyone!     Nope!

After all, there’s no harm in having a little daydream about your own chances of having twins. But then again, the idea of having twins may not appeal to you at all.  We all know we can’t pick our family. But when it comes to conceiving with a set of twins, having a family history of hyper ovulation, releasing more than one egg each month, does certainly help.  Reasons for wanting to increase the chances of having twins   Maternal age. For women who have left having their family until they are older, there is a tendency to want to have their children quickly.  The practical side of taking one period of time from work in order to raise a young family.  Having a family history of twins. If twins are familiar to you and already in your family then you may want to have your own.  Wanting a big family with siblings who are close in age.  Simply because the idea appeals to you. For no other reason than the idea of having two babies is just a lovely notion.   What will help boost my chances of having twins?  You’re already increasing your chances if you are a twin yourself or if you have siblings who are twins.  If you are lucky enough to come from a family with a pattern of having twins then genetically you are more likely to as well.  So if you, your mother or your maternal grandmother are or were fraternal (non-identical) twins then your chances of having twins may increase to as many as 1 in 7.  But if none of these apply to you and you’re keen to have twins, don’t despair.  Within the general population the chances of having twins is about one in every 89 births. Twin numbers have steadily increased since the 1980s. This is due in part, to the number of couples who have had and are having fertility assistance.  Just remember The chances of having identical or non-fraternal twins is the same for every woman, wherever she lives and no matter what her family history. Identical twinning is random and universal – it is not reliant on two eggs being released but one egg being fertilised by one sperm and then dividing into two. The chances of having identical twins are around 1 in every 285 pregnancies. Around one in every three sets of twins is identical.  Some statistics – just to get you thinking!   If you are over 45 your chances of having twins increases to around 17%. But you need to think very carefully if you want to have a baby if you are within this age group, let alone two.    By the time your twins are 21 you will be 66, so think very carefully if this will be right for you and your partner.  If you’re really keen to have twins, then leaving your dash to try conceiving until after you’re 50 will increase your chances to 1 in 9.  Don’t try to have your babies when you are less than 25 years. If you wait until after your 35th birthday then you will more than double your chances in this space of waiting 10 years.  Women who undergo fertility assistance and take drugs to stimulate their ovaries have more twins. This is because more eggs are released each month and with IVF , generally more than one embryo is put back into the uterus. Because of the improvement in fertility management, the rate of success with embryo transfers has never been better.  If you are from Nigeria then you are more likely to have twins than a Caucasian woman of the same age. Nigerian women enjoy the highest rate of twin pregnancies in the world. And because their rate is so high, around 1 in every 22 women, the genetic potential to keep twins occurring through the generations will become even more likely.  If you are overweight then you are more likely to have twins. Perhaps this is nature’s way of guaranteeing that the pregnant mother is able to provide sufficient nutrition to support a twin pregnancy. But women who are overweight or obese often have problems conceiving in the first place. One of the most common recommendations for women who are keen to fall pregnant is to stay within a healthy weight range. A healthy Basal Metabolic Rate ( BMR ) is 20-25. Women with a BMR of 30 or over tend to have more twins.  If you are tall, in the top 25th percentile for your height amongst women of the same age, then you are more likely to have twins. Again, this may be attributable to Mother Nature interpreting height (and weight) as a sign of good pregnancy material.

This is an intriguing question that 
many will ponder even before they plan on starting a family.  People are
 fascinated by twins in general and so, of course, any woman trying to 
conceive will likely wonder what her chances of having twins are.  There
 is  a lot of gray area when it comes to figuring out the true 
probability on conceiving twins because there are so many different 
factors involved.  We will discuss these here to try and give you a much
 better picture of the odds of having twins. First off you should know that twin birth has been on the rise since the 80's.  Many of the factors we will go over are actually directly related to this rise. 
Will they increase your odds?  Lets see...  Our List of the Odds of Having Twins:  In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) . If you are undergoing IVF to try and conceive, your chances of having twins are about 32% (at 
least in the U.S.).  Because two or more fertilized eggs are routinely 
implanted at one time, the increase in odds is substantial. The Use Of Clomid . Clomid is a fertility drug that aids in ovulation.  Women undergoing 
this type of treatment have about a 10% increase in their chances of 
having twins because clomid can cause hyper-ovulation (the release of 
more than one egg).  Maternal Age . Studies have found that there is an increase hyper-ovulation in women over the age of 35.
Because so many women are waiting until later in life to start their families, we have seen a rise in the twinning rate overall. Hereditary Factors . If fraternal twins run in your family, you may have increased odds of having twins yourself.
This is because the hyper-ovulation gene can be passed on from mother to daughter.  True statistics are not clear on this.        Height & Weight . Some more recent studies have concluded that the fraternal twinning rate
 increases substantially in obese women, as well as women with an above 
average height.  Although the reasons are not completely clear there is 
some sort of correlation. Eating Dairy Products . Another study done a few years ago has shown that women who consume dairy products, 
as opposed to those who don't seem to be five times more likely to get 
pregnant with twins.  
Probably linked to the insulin-like growth factor (IGF).  Already Having A Set Of Twins . It seems that women who have already had a set of fraternal twins are a 
bit more likely to have another set of twins as opposed to a woman who 
has only had singletons.  This may be linked to the hyper-ovulation 
gene.  You might have noticed that there is a constant reference to fraternal 
twins when talking about the odds of having twins.  There is much to 
learn about the differences between identical and fraternal twins and what causes them.  We recommend that you check out our extensive article regarding this remarkable topic to learn more.
  And remember, you might just have twins by sheer luck.  In this sense,
 we all have the same chances!      Home ›  HCG Levels  ›
