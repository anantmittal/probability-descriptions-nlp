Scroll down for the answers to these and other questionsand for tips and procedures to protect yourself and your property against one of nature's most lethal phenomena.  Lightning is a giant discharge of electricity accompanied by a brilliant flash of light and a loud crack of thunder. The spark can reach over five miles (eight kilometers) in length, raise the temperature of the air by as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,700 degrees Celsius), and contain a hundred million electrical volts.  Some scientists think that lightning may have played a part in the evolution of living organisms. The immense heat and other energy given off during a stroke has been found to convert elements into compounds that are found in organisms.  Lightning detection systems in the United States monitor an average of 25 million strokes of lightning from clouds to ground during some 100,000 thunderstorms every year. It is estimated that Earth as a whole is struck by an average of more than a hundred lightning bolts every second.   The odds of becoming a lightning victim in the U.S. in any one year is 1 in 700,000. The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.  Lightning can kill people (3,696 deaths were recorded in the U.S. between 1959 and 2003) or cause cardiac arrest. Injuries range from severe burns and permanent brain damage to memory loss and personality change. About 10 percent of lightning-stroke victims are killed, and 70 percent suffer serious long-term effects. About 400 people survive lightning strokes in the U.S. each year.  Lightning is not confined to thunderstorms. It's been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes.   Ice in a cloud may be key in the development of lightning. Ice particles collide as they swirl around in a storm, causing a separation of electrical charges. Positively charged ice crystals rise to the top of the thunderstorm, and negatively charged ice particles and hailstones drop to the lower parts of the storm. Enormous charge differences develop.

It can possess more power than a nuclear reactor. Rolf Maeder, Photography Sedona Somewhere in the sky, in the guts of a storm, lightning is forming. Although it's rare, with the odds of getting struck in your lifetime being roughly 1 in 12,000 , every now and then a human will provide an attractive target for lightning bolts to unleash their power. And of the roughly 500 people who are struck by lightning each year, about 90% survive. Here's what you should expect if you ever find yourself in the path of lightning. How lightning forms Although we're still not sure what causes it, scientists believe that ice particles bumping together inside a cloud can cause an excess of negative charge to collect at the bottom of the cloud. This charge can be so powerful that it repels electrons, negatively charged particles, on the ground beneath it, causing the ground to become positively charged. As an insanely strong electrical field roils in the cloud above, an intense attraction builds between the cloud and the ground. Lightning is the runaway force that discharges this field. It races toward the ground at nearly 300,000 kilometers per hour, striking the ground with a power of 300 kV, up to 150 times stronger than an industrial shock. It can even exceed the power of a nuclear reactor . When the lightning hits the ground, it causes a trail of plasma that lights the sky with those telltale zigzags of blueish white light that we see as lightning. The first three milliseconds Lichtenberg figures are a type of scarring that can occur when you've been struck by lightning. Winston Kemp A lot can happen in the three milliseconds it takes for a lightning bolt to course through your body. As the lightning strikes and then exits your body, it will leave you with deep wounds, often accompanied with third degree burns. Your hair and clothing might singe or catch fire. Your cl othes might even be shredded by the explosive force of the surrounding air being superheated to up to 50,000 degrees F ( five times hotter than the surface of the sun ). If you happen to be wearing any metal objects, like necklaces or a piercings, they could channel the electric current, superheating and searing your skin. And if the lightning exits through your feet, the force could literally knock your shoes off . Blood vessels bursting from the electric discharge and heat might create something called a Lichtenberg figure on your skin. This is a pattern of scars that branches out across your body like the limbs of a tree, likely tracing the path the electricity took as it traveled through you. It's not uncommon for the blast to rupture your eardrums, possibly leading to hearing loss. And, of course, you can expect a whole world of pain. One victim recalled it as " the pain of a thousand wasps stinging from within ." In the wake of a lightning strike Immediately after being struck, the disruption the lightning would have caused to your heart's electrical rhythm could result in cardiac arrest , one of the leading causes of death in lightning strike victims. The shock could also cause seizures or respiratory arrest. If the electric current enters your skull, it could literally cook your brain, resulting in brain damage or putting you in a coma. The strike could even cause temporary or permanent paralysis. But it doesn't end there. In the wake of a lightning attack, you might be faced with a lifetime of neurological afflictions for reasons that scientists still don't fully understand. Some scientists believe that the lightning scrambles your internal circuitry , altering the behavior of your cells. You might undergo personality changes, mood swings, and memory loss. It's also possible that you will suffer from chronic pain and constant Parkinson's-like muscle twitches. In some cases, however, a lightning strike can lead to strange super talents. In a blog post for Psychology Today, University of Miami neuroscientist Berit Brogaard writes about an incident where an orthopedic surgeon who was struck by lightning developed an urge to learn to play the piano. He began to compose music he had mysteriously started hearing in his head since the strike. After a few months he abandoned his career as a surgeon and became a classical musician. This type of phenomenon baffles scientists. One theory that Brogaard says is currently being tested is that cell death caused by being struck by lightning could cause a one-time flooding of the brain with neurotransmitters that are released from the dying neurons. This causes a rewiring of neurons, providing access to areas of the brain that were previously inaccessible. But as cool as it would be, you shouldn't count on that stray bolt of electricity turning you into a prodigy in one swift flash. The overwhelming majority of consequences of being struck by lightning are painful and debilitating, and could stay with you for the rest of your life. While your chances of being struck by lightning are low, you can stay safe by tossing aside that fishing pole or golf club when you see clouds forming and heading indoors.

(Kevin Ambrose)   Do you remember those horrible driver’s education videos from high school that would depict the aftermath of car accidents with lots of blood, mangled cars, and bad actors?  Those videos were meant to scare us into following safe driving practices so we wouldn’t end up looking like the victims in the videos.  Well, this post won’t be as bad as those videos, but it will describe what can happen if you’re struck by lightning.  Hopefully, it will scare a few of you into following lightning safety practices a little more closely during future thunderstorms.  Let’s start with the lightning bolt.  It can pack up to 300kV of energy and can heat the surrounding air to 50,000 degrees F, which is five times hotter than the surface of the sun. Try to imagine something that powerful and hot striking your body.  Well, I’ll admit, it’s kind of hard to comprehend encountering lightning.  We just don’t see or handle 50,000 degree objects in our everyday life.  So, let me describe what can happen if you do have the misfortune of a 50,000 degree burst of energy slamming into your body.  Here’s a list of ten possible outcomes:  1) Deep entry and exit wounds can occur where the lightning strikes the body and then exits the body.   The wounds are sometimes accompanied by severe burns .  Also, Lichtenberg scarring can occur over large areas of the body, often in bizarre fractal patterns, as a result of bursting blood vessels.  2) The heat associated with the lightning strike can cause clothing to catch on fire.  In addition, clothes can be shredded by the explosive force of air being superheated by the lightning bolt.  3) The force of lightning exiting a person’s foot can easily blow off shoes .  4) The electric discharge of a lightning strike can instantly stop the heart and cause cardiac arrest.  This happened to a concert-goer at RFK during the 1998 Tibetan Freedom Concert.  5) Brain damage and comas can occur if the electric current enters the skull .  The associated heat from the electric current literally cooks brain cells.     A lightning bolt strikes near the Washington Monument. (Kevin Ambrose)   6) Nerves can be damaged or destroyed by the lightning’s electric discharge which can then lead to permanent paralysis or numbness in limbs.  7) Ruptured ear drums are very common with lightning strike victims.  8) Large pieces of jewelry, chains, and under wire bras may channel the electric current from a lightning strike .  If the metallic items described above encounter lightning, the metal can superheat which will often burn and sear the skin.  9) Some victims are left with constant muscle twitches and Parkinson’s Disease type symptoms.  10) And, of course, death can occur.  The majority of lightning strike victims do survive, but many will experience one or more of the issues described above.     Lightning strikes the Washington Monument, July 1, 2005. (Kevin Ambrose)   OK, most of us know the basics of lightning safety.  If you see lightning or hear thunder, take cover inside of a building with walls and a roof, or inside of a car or vehicle.  As the National Weather Service states, “When thunder roars, go indoors.” Stay indoors for 30 to 45 minutes after thunder subsides.  Many of us, however, tend to get a little careless with lightning safety.  I am guilty.  Most of my lightning photos were taken from inside a building or car, but I sometimes step outside too soon after the thunder subsides.  I also see this happen with people at the ball field, pool, golf course, or with their walks to and from cars and buildings during thunderstorms.  Hopefully, an education of the potential consequences of a lightning strike can motivate us to follow lightning safety practices a little more closely.  Much like how the drivers education videos scared us into safe driving, imagine that lightning bolt up close and personal.  No thanks!  I’ll be a little more careful.  I hope you will be more careful too.  Do you have any stories about lightning or information about lightning safety that you would like to share?  Let us know.

Rumors of a space rock accident in India raise the question of how common this is.                                      View Images      Authorities examine what some suspected was a meteorite crater on February 7 in Tamil Nadu in southern India. Other scientists have warned the scene appears to better resemble a ground-based explosion.    Photograph by STR/AFP/Getty Images            PUBLISHED February 9, 2016     As scientists investigate a reported death from a meteorite strike in southern India over the weekend, we wondered about the probability of such a fatal accident. Most people have the sense that meteorite strikes on people are exceedingly rare, but how rare? (As of Wednesday morning, NASA has cast serious doubt on the reports from India , saying the more likely culprit was a land-based explosion.)   Regardless of the final story in India, a meteorite is a piece of rock that strikes the Earth from outer space. The most famous case in the U.S. happened in 1954, when Ann Hodges was hit by a space rock in Sylacauga, Alabama .   The softball-sized hunk of black rock crashed through her ceiling while she was napping on her couch, hitting her in the side. Hodges later fought with her landlord over ownership of the rock and suffered a nervous breakdown.   In October 1992, a meteorite that caused a bright fireball across the sky hit a woman's parked car in Peekskill, New York . In 1825, people reported that a man was killed and a woman was injured by a meteorite in Oriang, India, although scholars have not been able to confirm the incident.   In 1827, a man was said to be injured after being struck in the arm by a space rock in Mhow, India. Other reports list cattle or horses killed by meteorites. A meteorite disrupted a wedding party in 1929 and a funeral in 1924 . Perhaps even more strangely, in 2007, Peruvian villagers were sickened after a meteorite impact released toxic arsenic fumes from the ground .   A large meteorite exploded above central Russia in 2013 with a force 20 to 30 times the Hiroshima bomb injured 1,200 people, mostly from broken glass, and caused $33 million in damage ( see pictures ).

( See pictures of shooting stars .)   "You have a better chance of getting hit by a tornado and a bolt of lightning and a hurricane all at the same time," Michael Reynolds , a Florida State College astronomer and author of the book Falling Stars: A Guide to Meteors & Meteorites , previously told National Geographic .   Doing the Math: Meteorite Strikes   Putting a probability number on the chances of being hit by a space rock is difficult, since the events are so rare. Still, Tulane University earth sciences professor Stephen A. Nelson published a paper in 2014 that made the effort. He put the lifetime odds of dying from a local meteorite, asteroid, or comet impact at 1 in 1,600,000.   Compared with 1 in 90 for a car accident, 1 in 250 for a fire, 1 in 60,000 for a tornado, 1 in 135,000 for lightning, 1 in 8 million for a shark attack , or 1 in 195 million for winning the PowerBall lottery.   Nelson put the risk of dying from a large, global asteroid or comet impact at 1 in 75,000. If that seems surprisingly high, it's because when massive objects have hit the Earth in the geologic past, they have wiped out millions of organisms, even whole species. Most of the creatures aren't killed from the direct impact, but from the aftereffects, which include heat, radiation, and dust that clouds out the sun.   Astronomer Alan Harris made a similar calculation , finding that a human being has a 1 in 700,000 chance of getting killed by an impact from space in their lifetime, with most of the risk coming from a large-scale event.   It's unclear what evidence will emerge from this week's incident in India, but if it does prove to have been a meteorite, it will be remembered as a highly unusual accident.

The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.  Lightning can kill people (3,696 deaths were recorded in the U.S. between 1959 and 2003) or cause cardiac arrest. Injuries range from severe burns and permanent brain damage to memory loss and personality change. About 10 percent of lightning-stroke victims are killed, and 70 percent suffer serious long-term effects. About 400 people survive lightning strokes in the U.S. each year.  Lightning is not confined to thunderstorms. It's been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes.   Ice in a cloud may be key in the development of lightning. Ice particles collide as they swirl around in a storm, causing a separation of electrical charges. Positively charged ice crystals rise to the top of the thunderstorm, and negatively charged ice particles and hailstones drop to the lower parts of the storm. Enormous charge differences develop.

The year was 1969 when Steve Marshburn was struck by lightning. He wasn’t out golfing or fishing, he was working inside a bank. Lightning found a path through an underground speaker at the drive-through window and worked its way to the stool where he sat. "I still have the migraines," Marshburn told NPR . "The lightning – when it hit my back, it went up my spine, went to the left side of my brain and scorched it, came down, went out my right hand that was holding a metal teller stamp." Which goes to show, lightning is an unruly beast; heard to predict and filled with surprises. And according to the National Weather Service, so far this year lightning strikes have killed at least 20 people in the United States, which is almost double the norm. Behind those strikes are some pretty wild facts. Consider the following: 1. Lightning strikes the United States about 25 million times a year. Although most lightning occurs in the summer, people can be struck at any time of year. 2. The idea of a lightning bolt finding and striking a person directly seems so random, but in fact, most people who were hurt or injured weren’t struck directly . People can fall victim to lightning striking a nearby object when the current jumps, as well as through conduction and ground current. 3. Because ground current strikes affect a much larger area than the other causes of lightning casualties – the current travels over the surface of the ground – this type causes the most lightning deaths and injuries. It's especially bad for livestock. 4. As evidenced by Marshburn’s experience, you don't have to be outside to be harmed by nearby lightning. 5. Brain injuries are the more common injury – rather than burns – from lightning strikes. 6. Lightning strikes can create enduring lifelong discomfort because they cause nerve damage that makes the nerves misfire, which the brain reads as pain. 7. Even though strikes are up this year, the number is much less than in the 1940s when 300 to 400 people died annually. John Jensenius from the National Weather Service explains, "Most homes had corded phones. So a corded phone, when people held it right up to their head, was a direct connection with wires outside." Also, more farmers sitting on open tractors added to the numbers. 8. While people think golfers are at highest risk, between 2006 and 2014 , people fishing accounted for more than three times as many deaths as golfers, while camping and boating each were responsible for almost two times as many deaths as golf. 9. During the same period, the majority of victims were male between the ages of 10 to 60; almost two thirds of them were engaged in outdoor leisure activities before being struck. 10. To measure the distance of lightning, count the seconds between flash and thunder and divide by five; the number is how many miles the lightning is from you. 11. During thunderstorms, lightning can strike up to 10 miles away. That distance is when you can just begin to hear thunder, which is why safety experts urge us to go inside as soon as we hear a distant rumble. Many victims have been either heading to safety at the time of the fatal strike or were just steps away from safety. In addition, follow these safety tips from the National Weather Service: When you hear thunder, immediately move to safe shelter: a substantial building with electricity or plumbing or an enclosed, metal-topped vehicle with windows up. Stay in safe shelter at least 30 minutes after you hear the last sound of thunder. Stay off corded phones, computers and other electrical equipment that put you in direct contact with electricity. Avoid plumbing, including sinks, baths and faucets. Stay away from windows and doors, and stay off porches. Do not lie on concrete floors, and do not lean against concrete walls. If you are caught outside with no safe shelter anywhere nearby the following actions may reduce your risk: Immediately get off elevated areas such as hills, mountain ridges or peaks. Never lie flat on the ground. Never shelter under an isolated tree. Never use a cliff or rocky overhang for shelter. Immediately get out and away from ponds, lakes and other bodies of water. Stay away from objects that conduct electricity (barbed wire fences, power lines, windmills, etc.). And in a story on lightning in The Week , Charlotte Huff also recommends to "look for a ravine or a depression. Spread out your group, with at least 20 feet between each person, to reduce the risk of multiple injuries. Don't lie down, which boosts your exposure to ground current. There's even a recommended lightning position: crouched down, keeping the feet close together." This updated story was originally published in 2015.

An average of three people in the UK are killed every year as a result of a lightning strike  By Jennifer Newton 25th August 2017, 2:28 pm Updated: 25th August 2017, 2:29 pm BRITISH summer brings warm sunny weather (sometimes!) but along with the sun often comes lightning, thunder and torrential downpours.  It is an often-said phrase, but what are the actual chances of being struck by lightning and how can you avoid it? Here's what you need to know...  Alamy A bolt of lightning over Canary Wharf in London during a fierce thunderstorm  How likely am I to be struck my lightning?  A lightning strike is when an electric discharge from the atmosphere is sent down into an earth-bound object.  Most lightning strikes do not touch humans and the odds of being struck by lightning are very low.  In fact the chances of being struck by lightning are 300,000 to one and it is estimated that 24,000 people are killed each year worldwide as a result of lightning.  In the UK, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) say that on average three people are killed each year by lightning - making the odds 66 times shorter than the global average.  What happens if I am struck by lightning during a thunderstorm?  Although lightning strikes can be fatal, around 90 per cent of people who are struck do survive.  But it can cause serious injuries, that should be treated as soon as possible.  The main risk from lightning is that the electrical surge can cause third degree burns and even set a person on fire.  IslandVisions/BNPS Lightning colours the night sky over the Isle of Wight. In the UK, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents say that on average three people are killed each year by lightning  The electrical discharge can also cause your blood vessels to burst and cause a series of scars across the skin.  It can also disrupt the heart's rhythm, causing cardiac and respiratory arrest, while if the electrical current enters your skull, it can literally cook your brain.  If you see someone struck by lightning, you should immediately call 999 to seek urgent medical attention.  You can also give them any first aid they require as there is no need to worry about receiving an electric shock yourself - the current won't affect you.  Meanwhile interesting research has shown that 80 per cent of people that are struck by lightning are men.  How can I protect myself from being struck by lightning?  Although there is no absolute protection from a lightning strike, there are steps you can take to reduce the risk - especially if you work outdoors.  This includes seeking shelter at the first sign of lightning or a heavy thunderstorm.  According to the RoSPA, you should seek shelter inside a large building or car and quickly move away from wide open spaces.  If there is nowhere to shelter, you should crouch down on the ground and make yourself as small as possible to make yourself less of a target - lightning will seek the quick route to Earth, so if you need to minimise the chances of being made a shortcut.  DanielWretham/BNPS Storm clouds gather over Bournemouth pier. Lightning often strikes close to water  If you are at the top of an exposed hill when lightning starts to strike, the best advice is start to descend quickly and try to make sure there is higher ground above you.  For builders and construction workers caught up in lightning, they are advised to ditch any belts they are wearing containing metal tools and immediately climb down from any metal ladders or scaffolding.  The inside of a car is a safe shelter as if it is struck, the electrical current will travel through the car's metal exterior and earth through the rubber tyres.  However, a motorbike cannot give the same shelter, despite its rubber tyres. This is because a bike has no metal frame around the top of rider and the electrical current will route through the person as it travels towards the ground.  If you are playing golf when lightning strikes, move far away from your clubs and crouch down in a bunker.  PA:Press Association Lightning flashes during a fierce thunderstorm in the UK near the Spinnaker Tower in Posrtmouth  You should never stand under tall isolated trees as they are a prime target for bolts of lightning.  Meanwhile if you are in water, experts say you should get out immediately and head to the shore.  If you are on a beach, move as far away from the water as possible as lightning often strikes close to it.  How can I tell how far away lightning is?  One of the best ways to avoid being struck by lightning is to judge how far away it is so you can work out whether you need immediate shelter.  A way of doing this is using the 30/30 rule, which says that if the time between a flash of lightning and a rumble of thunder is 30 seconds or less, you should immediately seek shelter.  Once you are safely indoors, it is then advised that you should stay there for at least 30 minutes after the last clap of thunder.  Experts say by this time the storm should have passed making it safer to venture out in open space again.

Apparently, the chances are 300,000 to one, according to David Hand in his new book: The Improbability Principle. But while 300,000 to one looks like a minor risk for an individual, there are lots of people on the planet.  Small Data  A series on curious numbers cropping up in the news, by stats watcher Anthony Reuben  As a result, about 24,000 people are killed by lightning each year. Remember, you don't have to be struck by lightning to be killed by it - you could be in a house that's struck by lightning and burns down with you inside. Indeed, with seven billion people on the planet, what would be really, really unlikely would be that nobody was killed by lightning. Of course, 300,000 to one is an average - people in the developing world who spend less time indoors and have fewer tall buildings and more flammable ones are much more likely to be killed by lightning than people in developed ones. On average, three people are killed each year by lightning in the UK, according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, which are odds 66 times shorter than the global average. Hand's book sets out to explain why things that are considered to be very unlikely keep on happening. It's not just that people win the lottery. Again, while that's unlikely for an individual, it's pretty likely that someone will win it each week. No, we're talking about really unlikely things, like the lottery drawing the same numbers in two consecutive weeks, as happened on the Bulgarian Lottery in 2009. So, if you wait around long enough, it looks like you'll get to see almost anything happen. But not a man being struck by lightning twice in succession, seen on a security camera. The video of that, which Hand showed as part of a talk to the Royal Statistical Society on Thursday, is widely described on the internet as having been a fake. Maybe we'll have to wait a bit longer to see that.

Click here to get 30 days free!      We’ve all heard the reality check before: “You have a better chance of being struck by lightning than winning the lottery.”  To most of us, the odds of being struck by lightning, “ 1 in a million ,” are a convenient measuring rod for all things unlikely. Whether it’s winning the lottery or dying in a plane crash, if something is less likely to happen to you than being struck by lightning, then, as the logic goes, it’s probably not worth holding your breath for or worrying about very much (discussions along these very lines can be found here and here ).    ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT       Lightning Odds…Not So Simple…  The odds of being struck by lightning, however, are not as simple as we would have them to be. The answer to the question, “What are the odds of being struck by lightning?” is actually, “It depends.”    The Numbers Behind '1 in a Million' That the odds of being struck by lightning are approximately 1 in a million is perhaps one of the most well-known statistics out there. This statistic is nonetheless, an average of the odds of being struck by lightning in the United States. According to the U.S. National Weather Service, this statistic is based on averages of reported lightning deaths and injuries along a U.S. population estimate: Estimated U.S. population as of 2011: 310,000,000 Average Annual Reported U.S. Lightning Deaths and Injures, 2001-2010: 280 Odds of being struck by lightning in a given year  (reported deaths + injuries) =1 in (310,000,000/280) = 1 in 1,107,143 =  Approximately 1 in a million  What’s particularly noteworthy is that depending on which state you’re in within the United States, your odds of being struck by lightning this year can be much higher or much lower than that 1 in a million figure mentioned above. For example, based on lightning data (courtesy StruckByLightning.org ) and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for 2011 presented in the map below, if you live in Montana, your odds of being struck by lightning are roughly 1 in 249,550, considerably higher than the the national average of 1 in a million. Towards the other end of the spectrum, in California, your odds of being struck by lightning are far lower at 1 in 7,538,382.  Lightning Map The Odds of Being Struck By Lightning, By State Click on this map to see the odds of being struck by lightning in your state (based on 2011 lightning data).  Clearly, the odds of being struck by lightning are not the same for everyone, everywhere, but why?  We face varying odds of being struck by lightning because of a few key factors. These essentially location-specific factors include: Cloud-to-ground lightning density rates, population size, indoor vs. outdoor activity setting and safety adherence. Now Available on Amazon  Struck by Lightning: The Curious World of Probabilities by Jeffrey Rosenthal From terrorist attacks to big money jackpots, Struck by Lightning  deconstructs the odds and oddities of chance, examining both the relevant and irreverent role of randomness in our everyday lives..airplanes crash, bridges collapse, and we never know if we’ll be that one in a million statistic. A basic understanding of the rules of probability theory, applied to real-life circumstances, can help us to make sense of these situations, to avoid unnecessary fear, to seize the opportunities that randomness presents to us, and to actually enjoy the uncertainties we face. In this entertaining yet sophisticated look at the world of probabilities, author Jeffrey Rosenthal–an improbably talented math professor–explains the mechanics of randomness and teaches us how to develop an informed perspective on probability. U.S. Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Density This Vaisala National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) map shows the average annual lightning flash density within the continental U.S. from 1997-2011. In terms of cloud-to-ground lightning averages, Florida ranks highest, with an average of 1,414,284 flashes per year (24.7 flashes per square mile). Historically, Florida has also experienced the highest lightning number of lightning deaths in the United States, with 425 deaths occurring there from 1950-2003. Washington has the lowest cloud-to-ground lightning averages, 20,510 flashes per year (0.3 flashes per square mile). Population State population plays in a key role in determining your odds of being struck by lightning. Florida tops all the states both in terms of cloud-to-ground lightning density and the number of lightning casualties reported annually (31 in 2011), but because of Florida’s population size, an estimated 19,057,542 for 2011, the odds of being struck by lightning there were 1 in 614,759. These odds are lower  than Montana’s 1 in 249,550, even though Montana had only 4 lightning casualties, because in comparison, Montana’s estimated 2011 population was much smaller: 998,199. Indoor vs. Outdoor Simply put, more time spent outdoors increases the odds of being struck by lightning. In places where people work and engage in more activities outdoors, the odds of being struck by lightning tend to be higher. Lightning Fatalities: What Are the Odds of Being Killed by Lightning? According to U.S. NWS Storm Data for the 30 year period spanning the years 1984-2013, about 10% of people, or 1 in 10, struck by lightning are killed  . A recent report, A Detailed Analysis of Lightning Deaths in the United States from 2006 through 2013 , by lightning safety specialist, John S. Jensenius, Jr. at the National Weather Service, NOAA, revealed the following insights into lightning deaths:    Males accounted for 81% of lightning fatalities.  More than 70% of lightning deaths occurred in the months of June, July and August.  Slightly more lightning deaths happened on Saturdays and Sundays than other days of the week.  Individuals in the age range of 10-60 comprised the greatest number of lightning fatalities, with the 20-29 age bracket having the highest concentration of lightning fatalities.  64% of lightning deaths were related to leisure activities, followed by 17% of lightning deaths related to daily routine and 15% related to work.   Did You Know? As discussed in a USA Today article by Doyle Rice, there has been an overall decline in lightning fatalities in the U.S. since 1940, largely due to the impact of public education efforts and increased public recognition of the value of following safety principles.  Lightning Safety The U.S. National Weather Service cautions that when there is a thunderstorm in the area, no place outside that is safe. Moreover, if you can hear thunder, that means that lightning is, in fact, close enough to strike you . If you are outdoors when you hear thunder, seek safe shelter. In short, when it comes to lightning, the message that lightning experts and organizations regard as being the most crucial is to go indoors when there is a thunderstorm in the area. Thus, the National Weather Service , StruckByLighting.org and others have worked hard to get the simple message out: “ When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors!” Featured Image Credit: Brilhasti1/Flickr     Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Email Print    Leave a Reply Cancel reply   Your email address will not be published.

Supposing you live to be 85, that's 2 million people in your lifetime. On 7 billion people alive today, that's a lifetime chance of 1 in 3500 -- your chances are pretty slim anyway :)  But, to be more elaborate: your chances of being struck depend entirely on your surroundings. As you indicated, you're going to be near your house, which is of course much higher than your body height, and thus closer to any lightning cloud, and thus a much more likely target for lightning to strike. Provided you have a lightning rod (or similar) installed, the rod is the most direct way for a bolt to go into the ground, and will therefore considerably decrease your chances of being struck (NOT reduce it to zero though -- lightning is pretty predictable, until it's not).  There are a few caveats here -- if you do not have a lightning rod, your house is all wet from the rain, and you're touching a doorknob or standing near a pillar or something, a bolt may choose to use your body as a "least resistance" path to the ground (although water lines or power lines inside your wall still form a much more likely candidate). When a storm is directly overhead, alway open doors, windows, etc. with your right hand, while standing on your right leg -- this reduces the chances of the current moving through your heart in the (unlikely) event you are struck this way.  Also, if the bolt is conducted into the ground by a rod (or a tree or power line or similar), and you're standing near the point of entry, there may be secondary effects that can harm you (indirect impact). These are on average much less severe than a direct hit, but are known to have been lethal in some cases.  If you're NOT going to be near your house, make sure you're going to stand near tall things ( NEAR , not under). Be sure to stay well out of the region where the tall thing might reach you should it be struck, break and fall.  Suppose worst comes to worst: you find yourself in the middle of a severe thunderstorm in an open field. In that case -- if you can find a (few) long stick(s), or have one of those tents supported by fiberglass sticks with you, stick them in the ground, straight up, in a large circular pattern, before the storm is directly overhead. If there is no time, just skip it! Then (in the center of the circle) make yourself as small as you possibly can, while also making as little contact with the ground as possible. That is, crouch down, keep your head low between your knees, standing on the balls of your feet, keep your feet close together, and start praying. Stay that way until the worst of the storm has passed. Don't even look up until you are sure that the average time between lightning and thunder is at least a second.  But the very best thing you can do is of course avoid these situations all together. Inside your house, or a cafeteria, motel, pub, any place inside you can find, is the safest place to be. Inside a car is also perfectly safe due to it being an effective Farraday cage. Really anything you can find, a bus stop, stable, a cave (if you're in the mountains, God forbid), hunter's cabin, anything.  This is what I always got as advice from guides I met on hiking trips. I always stuck to it, but actually, I never verified any of it :) (aside from the odd documentary on TV).     share | improve this answer     answered Jul 12 '12 at 9:40       Rody Oldenhuis   556 6 8                  Great first post, +1! – berry120  Jul 12 '12 at 11:18            My dad would always take us to a mostly open field so we could enjoy the lightening storm better.

 full week of June each year.  Lightning is one of the leading weather-related causes of death and injury in the United States. Most people do not realize that they can be struck by lightning even when the center of a thunderstorm is 10 miles (16 kilometers) away and there are blue skies overhead.

And what does it mean if your hair starts to stand on end during a thunderstorm? Scroll down for the answers to these and other questionsand for tips and procedures to protect yourself and your property against one of nature's most lethal phenomena.  Lightning is a giant discharge of electricity accompanied by a brilliant flash of light and a loud crack of thunder. The spark can reach over five miles (eight kilometers) in length, raise the temperature of the air by as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,700 degrees Celsius), and contain a hundred million electrical volts.  Some scientists think that lightning may have played a part in the evolution of living organisms. The immense heat and other energy given off during a stroke has been found to convert elements into compounds that are found in organisms.  Lightning detection systems in the United States monitor an average of 25 million strokes of lightning from clouds to ground during some 100,000 thunderstorms every year. It is estimated that Earth as a whole is struck by an average of more than a hundred lightning bolts every second.   The odds of becoming a lightning victim in the U.S. in any one year is 1 in 700,000. The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.  Lightning can kill people (3,696 deaths were recorded in the U.S. between 1959 and 2003) or cause cardiac arrest. Injuries range from severe burns and permanent brain damage to memory loss and personality change. About 10 percent of lightning-stroke victims are killed, and 70 percent suffer serious long-term effects. About 400 people survive lightning strokes in the U.S. each year.  Lightning is not confined to thunderstorms. It's been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes.   Ice in a cloud may be key in the development of lightning. Ice particles collide as they swirl around in a storm, causing a separation of electrical charges. Positively charged ice crystals rise to the top of the thunderstorm, and negatively charged ice particles and hailstones drop to the lower parts of the storm. Enormous charge differences develop.

It can possess more power than a nuclear reactor. Rolf Maeder, Photography Sedona Somewhere in the sky, in the guts of a storm, lightning is forming. Although it's rare, with the odds of getting struck in your lifetime being roughly 1 in 12,000 , every now and then a human will provide an attractive target for lightning bolts to unleash their power. And of the roughly 500 people who are struck by lightning each year, about 90% survive. Here's what you should expect if you ever find yourself in the path of lightning. How lightning forms Although we're still not sure what causes it, scientists believe that ice particles bumping together inside a cloud can cause an excess of negative charge to collect at the bottom of the cloud. This charge can be so powerful that it repels electrons, negatively charged particles, on the ground beneath it, causing the ground to become positively charged. As an insanely strong electrical field roils in the cloud above, an intense attraction builds between the cloud and the ground. Lightning is the runaway force that discharges this field. It races toward the ground at nearly 300,000 kilometers per hour, striking the ground with a power of 300 kV, up to 150 times stronger than an industrial shock. It can even exceed the power of a nuclear reactor . When the lightning hits the ground, it causes a trail of plasma that lights the sky with those telltale zigzags of blueish white light that we see as lightning. The first three milliseconds Lichtenberg figures are a type of scarring that can occur when you've been struck by lightning. Winston Kemp A lot can happen in the three milliseconds it takes for a lightning bolt to course through your body. As the lightning strikes and then exits your body, it will leave you with deep wounds, often accompanied with third degree burns. Your hair and clothing might singe or catch fire. Your cl othes might even be shredded by the explosive force of the surrounding air being superheated to up to 50,000 degrees F ( five times hotter than the surface of the sun ). If you happen to be wearing any metal objects, like necklaces or a piercings, they could channel the electric current, superheating and searing your skin. And if the lightning exits through your feet, the force could literally knock your shoes off . Blood vessels bursting from the electric discharge and heat might create something called a Lichtenberg figure on your skin. This is a pattern of scars that branches out across your body like the limbs of a tree, likely tracing the path the electricity took as it traveled through you. It's not uncommon for the blast to rupture your eardrums, possibly leading to hearing loss. And, of course, you can expect a whole world of pain. One victim recalled it as " the pain of a thousand wasps stinging from within ." In the wake of a lightning strike Immediately after being struck, the disruption the lightning would have caused to your heart's electrical rhythm could result in cardiac arrest , one of the leading causes of death in lightning strike victims. The shock could also cause seizures or respiratory arrest. If the electric current enters your skull, it could literally cook your brain, resulting in brain damage or putting you in a coma. The strike could even cause temporary or permanent paralysis. But it doesn't end there. In the wake of a lightning attack, you might be faced with a lifetime of neurological afflictions for reasons that scientists still don't fully understand. Some scientists believe that the lightning scrambles your internal circuitry , altering the behavior of your cells. You might undergo personality changes, mood swings, and memory loss. It's also possible that you will suffer from chronic pain and constant Parkinson's-like muscle twitches. In some cases, however, a lightning strike can lead to strange super talents. In a blog post for Psychology Today, University of Miami neuroscientist Berit Brogaard writes about an incident where an orthopedic surgeon who was struck by lightning developed an urge to learn to play the piano. He began to compose music he had mysteriously started hearing in his head since the strike. After a few months he abandoned his career as a surgeon and became a classical musician. This type of phenomenon baffles scientists. One theory that Brogaard says is currently being tested is that cell death caused by being struck by lightning could cause a one-time flooding of the brain with neurotransmitters that are released from the dying neurons. This causes a rewiring of neurons, providing access to areas of the brain that were previously inaccessible. But as cool as it would be, you shouldn't count on that stray bolt of electricity turning you into a prodigy in one swift flash. The overwhelming majority of consequences of being struck by lightning are painful and debilitating, and could stay with you for the rest of your life. While your chances of being struck by lightning are low, you can stay safe by tossing aside that fishing pole or golf club when you see clouds forming and heading indoors.

(Kevin Ambrose)   Do you remember those horrible driver’s education videos from high school that would depict the aftermath of car accidents with lots of blood, mangled cars, and bad actors?  Those videos were meant to scare us into following safe driving practices so we wouldn’t end up looking like the victims in the videos.  Well, this post won’t be as bad as those videos, but it will describe what can happen if you’re struck by lightning.  Hopefully, it will scare a few of you into following lightning safety practices a little more closely during future thunderstorms.  Let’s start with the lightning bolt.  It can pack up to 300kV of energy and can heat the surrounding air to 50,000 degrees F, which is five times hotter than the surface of the sun. Try to imagine something that powerful and hot striking your body.  Well, I’ll admit, it’s kind of hard to comprehend encountering lightning.  We just don’t see or handle 50,000 degree objects in our everyday life.  So, let me describe what can happen if you do have the misfortune of a 50,000 degree burst of energy slamming into your body.  Here’s a list of ten possible outcomes:  1) Deep entry and exit wounds can occur where the lightning strikes the body and then exits the body.   The wounds are sometimes accompanied by severe burns .  Also, Lichtenberg scarring can occur over large areas of the body, often in bizarre fractal patterns, as a result of bursting blood vessels.  2) The heat associated with the lightning strike can cause clothing to catch on fire.  In addition, clothes can be shredded by the explosive force of air being superheated by the lightning bolt.  3) The force of lightning exiting a person’s foot can easily blow off shoes .  4) The electric discharge of a lightning strike can instantly stop the heart and cause cardiac arrest.  This happened to a concert-goer at RFK during the 1998 Tibetan Freedom Concert.  5) Brain damage and comas can occur if the electric current enters the skull .  The associated heat from the electric current literally cooks brain cells.     A lightning bolt strikes near the Washington Monument. (Kevin Ambrose)   6) Nerves can be damaged or destroyed by the lightning’s electric discharge which can then lead to permanent paralysis or numbness in limbs.  7) Ruptured ear drums are very common with lightning strike victims.  8) Large pieces of jewelry, chains, and under wire bras may channel the electric current from a lightning strike .  If the metallic items described above encounter lightning, the metal can superheat which will often burn and sear the skin.  9) Some victims are left with constant muscle twitches and Parkinson’s Disease type symptoms.  10) And, of course, death can occur.  The majority of lightning strike victims do survive, but many will experience one or more of the issues described above.     Lightning strikes the Washington Monument, July 1, 2005. (Kevin Ambrose)   OK, most of us know the basics of lightning safety.  If you see lightning or hear thunder, take cover inside of a building with walls and a roof, or inside of a car or vehicle.  As the National Weather Service states, “When thunder roars, go indoors.” Stay indoors for 30 to 45 minutes after thunder subsides.  Many of us, however, tend to get a little careless with lightning safety.  I am guilty.  Most of my lightning photos were taken from inside a building or car, but I sometimes step outside too soon after the thunder subsides.  I also see this happen with people at the ball field, pool, golf course, or with their walks to and from cars and buildings during thunderstorms.  Hopefully, an education of the potential consequences of a lightning strike can motivate us to follow lightning safety practices a little more closely.  Much like how the drivers education videos scared us into safe driving, imagine that lightning bolt up close and personal.  No thanks!  I’ll be a little more careful.  I hope you will be more careful too.  Do you have any stories about lightning or information about lightning safety that you would like to share?  Let us know.

Rumors of a space rock accident in India raise the question of how common this is.                                      View Images      Authorities examine what some suspected was a meteorite crater on February 7 in Tamil Nadu in southern India. Other scientists have warned the scene appears to better resemble a ground-based explosion.    Photograph by STR/AFP/Getty Images            PUBLISHED February 9, 2016     As scientists investigate a reported death from a meteorite strike in southern India over the weekend, we wondered about the probability of such a fatal accident. Most people have the sense that meteorite strikes on people are exceedingly rare, but how rare? (As of Wednesday morning, NASA has cast serious doubt on the reports from India , saying the more likely culprit was a land-based explosion.)   Regardless of the final story in India, a meteorite is a piece of rock that strikes the Earth from outer space. The most famous case in the U.S. happened in 1954, when Ann Hodges was hit by a space rock in Sylacauga, Alabama .   The softball-sized hunk of black rock crashed through her ceiling while she was napping on her couch, hitting her in the side. Hodges later fought with her landlord over ownership of the rock and suffered a nervous breakdown.   In October 1992, a meteorite that caused a bright fireball across the sky hit a woman's parked car in Peekskill, New York . In 1825, people reported that a man was killed and a woman was injured by a meteorite in Oriang, India, although scholars have not been able to confirm the incident.   In 1827, a man was said to be injured after being struck in the arm by a space rock in Mhow, India. Other reports list cattle or horses killed by meteorites. A meteorite disrupted a wedding party in 1929 and a funeral in 1924 . Perhaps even more strangely, in 2007, Peruvian villagers were sickened after a meteorite impact released toxic arsenic fumes from the ground .   A large meteorite exploded above central Russia in 2013 with a force 20 to 30 times the Hiroshima bomb injured 1,200 people, mostly from broken glass, and caused $33 million in damage ( see pictures ).

( See pictures of shooting stars .)   "You have a better chance of getting hit by a tornado and a bolt of lightning and a hurricane all at the same time," Michael Reynolds , a Florida State College astronomer and author of the book Falling Stars: A Guide to Meteors & Meteorites , previously told National Geographic .   Doing the Math: Meteorite Strikes   Putting a probability number on the chances of being hit by a space rock is difficult, since the events are so rare. Still, Tulane University earth sciences professor Stephen A. Nelson published a paper in 2014 that made the effort. He put the lifetime odds of dying from a local meteorite, asteroid, or comet impact at 1 in 1,600,000.   Compared with 1 in 90 for a car accident, 1 in 250 for a fire, 1 in 60,000 for a tornado, 1 in 135,000 for lightning, 1 in 8 million for a shark attack , or 1 in 195 million for winning the PowerBall lottery.   Nelson put the risk of dying from a large, global asteroid or comet impact at 1 in 75,000. If that seems surprisingly high, it's because when massive objects have hit the Earth in the geologic past, they have wiped out millions of organisms, even whole species. Most of the creatures aren't killed from the direct impact, but from the aftereffects, which include heat, radiation, and dust that clouds out the sun.   Astronomer Alan Harris made a similar calculation , finding that a human being has a 1 in 700,000 chance of getting killed by an impact from space in their lifetime, with most of the risk coming from a large-scale event.   It's unclear what evidence will emerge from this week's incident in India, but if it does prove to have been a meteorite, it will be remembered as a highly unusual accident.

According to the NWS Storm Data , over the last    30 years (1987-2016)   the U.S. has averaged 47 reported lightning fatalities per year.  Only about 10% of people who are struck by lightning    are  killed, leaving 90% with various degrees of disability.  More recently, in the last 10 years (2007-2016), the U.S. has averaged 30 lightning fatalities.

And what does it mean if your hair starts to stand on end during a thunderstorm? Scroll down for the answers to these and other questionsand for tips and procedures to protect yourself and your property against one of nature's most lethal phenomena.  Lightning is a giant discharge of electricity accompanied by a brilliant flash of light and a loud crack of thunder. The spark can reach over five miles (eight kilometers) in length, raise the temperature of the air by as much as 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit (27,700 degrees Celsius), and contain a hundred million electrical volts.  Some scientists think that lightning may have played a part in the evolution of living organisms. The immense heat and other energy given off during a stroke has been found to convert elements into compounds that are found in organisms.  Lightning detection systems in the United States monitor an average of 25 million strokes of lightning from clouds to ground during some 100,000 thunderstorms every year. It is estimated that Earth as a whole is struck by an average of more than a hundred lightning bolts every second.   The odds of becoming a lightning victim in the U.S. in any one year is 1 in 700,000. The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.  Lightning can kill people (3,696 deaths were recorded in the U.S. between 1959 and 2003) or cause cardiac arrest. Injuries range from severe burns and permanent brain damage to memory loss and personality change. About 10 percent of lightning-stroke victims are killed, and 70 percent suffer serious long-term effects. About 400 people survive lightning strokes in the U.S. each year.  Lightning is not confined to thunderstorms. It's been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes.   Ice in a cloud may be key in the development of lightning. Ice particles collide as they swirl around in a storm, causing a separation of electrical charges. Positively charged ice crystals rise to the top of the thunderstorm, and negatively charged ice particles and hailstones drop to the lower parts of the storm. Enormous charge differences develop.

The year was 1969 when Steve Marshburn was struck by lightning. He wasn’t out golfing or fishing, he was working inside a bank. Lightning found a path through an underground speaker at the drive-through window and worked its way to the stool where he sat. "I still have the migraines," Marshburn told NPR . "The lightning – when it hit my back, it went up my spine, went to the left side of my brain and scorched it, came down, went out my right hand that was holding a metal teller stamp." Which goes to show, lightning is an unruly beast; heard to predict and filled with surprises. And according to the National Weather Service, so far this year lightning strikes have killed at least 20 people in the United States, which is almost double the norm. Behind those strikes are some pretty wild facts. Consider the following: 1. Lightning strikes the United States about 25 million times a year. Although most lightning occurs in the summer, people can be struck at any time of year. 2. The idea of a lightning bolt finding and striking a person directly seems so random, but in fact, most people who were hurt or injured weren’t struck directly . People can fall victim to lightning striking a nearby object when the current jumps, as well as through conduction and ground current. 3. Because ground current strikes affect a much larger area than the other causes of lightning casualties – the current travels over the surface of the ground – this type causes the most lightning deaths and injuries. It's especially bad for livestock. 4. As evidenced by Marshburn’s experience, you don't have to be outside to be harmed by nearby lightning. 5. Brain injuries are the more common injury – rather than burns – from lightning strikes. 6. Lightning strikes can create enduring lifelong discomfort because they cause nerve damage that makes the nerves misfire, which the brain reads as pain. 7. Even though strikes are up this year, the number is much less than in the 1940s when 300 to 400 people died annually. John Jensenius from the National Weather Service explains, "Most homes had corded phones. So a corded phone, when people held it right up to their head, was a direct connection with wires outside." Also, more farmers sitting on open tractors added to the numbers. 8. While people think golfers are at highest risk, between 2006 and 2014 , people fishing accounted for more than three times as many deaths as golfers, while camping and boating each were responsible for almost two times as many deaths as golf. 9. During the same period, the majority of victims were male between the ages of 10 to 60; almost two thirds of them were engaged in outdoor leisure activities before being struck. 10. To measure the distance of lightning, count the seconds between flash and thunder and divide by five; the number is how many miles the lightning is from you. 11. During thunderstorms, lightning can strike up to 10 miles away. That distance is when you can just begin to hear thunder, which is why safety experts urge us to go inside as soon as we hear a distant rumble. Many victims have been either heading to safety at the time of the fatal strike or were just steps away from safety. In addition, follow these safety tips from the National Weather Service: When you hear thunder, immediately move to safe shelter: a substantial building with electricity or plumbing or an enclosed, metal-topped vehicle with windows up. Stay in safe shelter at least 30 minutes after you hear the last sound of thunder. Stay off corded phones, computers and other electrical equipment that put you in direct contact with electricity. Avoid plumbing, including sinks, baths and faucets. Stay away from windows and doors, and stay off porches. Do not lie on concrete floors, and do not lean against concrete walls. If you are caught outside with no safe shelter anywhere nearby the following actions may reduce your risk: Immediately get off elevated areas such as hills, mountain ridges or peaks. Never lie flat on the ground. Never shelter under an isolated tree. Never use a cliff or rocky overhang for shelter. Immediately get out and away from ponds, lakes and other bodies of water. Stay away from objects that conduct electricity (barbed wire fences, power lines, windmills, etc.). And in a story on lightning in The Week , Charlotte Huff also recommends to "look for a ravine or a depression. Spread out your group, with at least 20 feet between each person, to reduce the risk of multiple injuries. Don't lie down, which boosts your exposure to ground current. There's even a recommended lightning position: crouched down, keeping the feet close together." This updated story was originally published in 2015.

An average of three people in the UK are killed every year as a result of a lightning strike  By Jennifer Newton 25th August 2017, 2:28 pm Updated: 25th August 2017, 2:29 pm BRITISH summer brings warm sunny weather (sometimes!) but along with the sun often comes lightning, thunder and torrential downpours.  It is an often-said phrase, but what are the actual chances of being struck by lightning and how can you avoid it? Here's what you need to know...  Alamy A bolt of lightning over Canary Wharf in London during a fierce thunderstorm  How likely am I to be struck my lightning?  A lightning strike is when an electric discharge from the atmosphere is sent down into an earth-bound object.  Most lightning strikes do not touch humans and the odds of being struck by lightning are very low.  In fact the chances of being struck by lightning are 300,000 to one and it is estimated that 24,000 people are killed each year worldwide as a result of lightning.  In the UK, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) say that on average three people are killed each year by lightning - making the odds 66 times shorter than the global average.  What happens if I am struck by lightning during a thunderstorm?  Although lightning strikes can be fatal, around 90 per cent of people who are struck do survive.  But it can cause serious injuries, that should be treated as soon as possible.  The main risk from lightning is that the electrical surge can cause third degree burns and even set a person on fire.  IslandVisions/BNPS Lightning colours the night sky over the Isle of Wight. In the UK, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents say that on average three people are killed each year by lightning  The electrical discharge can also cause your blood vessels to burst and cause a series of scars across the skin.  It can also disrupt the heart's rhythm, causing cardiac and respiratory arrest, while if the electrical current enters your skull, it can literally cook your brain.  If you see someone struck by lightning, you should immediately call 999 to seek urgent medical attention.  You can also give them any first aid they require as there is no need to worry about receiving an electric shock yourself - the current won't affect you.  Meanwhile interesting research has shown that 80 per cent of people that are struck by lightning are men.  How can I protect myself from being struck by lightning?  Although there is no absolute protection from a lightning strike, there are steps you can take to reduce the risk - especially if you work outdoors.  This includes seeking shelter at the first sign of lightning or a heavy thunderstorm.  According to the RoSPA, you should seek shelter inside a large building or car and quickly move away from wide open spaces.  If there is nowhere to shelter, you should crouch down on the ground and make yourself as small as possible to make yourself less of a target - lightning will seek the quick route to Earth, so if you need to minimise the chances of being made a shortcut.  DanielWretham/BNPS Storm clouds gather over Bournemouth pier. Lightning often strikes close to water  If you are at the top of an exposed hill when lightning starts to strike, the best advice is start to descend quickly and try to make sure there is higher ground above you.  For builders and construction workers caught up in lightning, they are advised to ditch any belts they are wearing containing metal tools and immediately climb down from any metal ladders or scaffolding.  The inside of a car is a safe shelter as if it is struck, the electrical current will travel through the car's metal exterior and earth through the rubber tyres.  However, a motorbike cannot give the same shelter, despite its rubber tyres. This is because a bike has no metal frame around the top of rider and the electrical current will route through the person as it travels towards the ground.  If you are playing golf when lightning strikes, move far away from your clubs and crouch down in a bunker.  PA:Press Association Lightning flashes during a fierce thunderstorm in the UK near the Spinnaker Tower in Posrtmouth  You should never stand under tall isolated trees as they are a prime target for bolts of lightning.  Meanwhile if you are in water, experts say you should get out immediately and head to the shore.  If you are on a beach, move as far away from the water as possible as lightning often strikes close to it.  How can I tell how far away lightning is?  One of the best ways to avoid being struck by lightning is to judge how far away it is so you can work out whether you need immediate shelter.  A way of doing this is using the 30/30 rule, which says that if the time between a flash of lightning and a rumble of thunder is 30 seconds or less, you should immediately seek shelter.  Once you are safely indoors, it is then advised that you should stay there for at least 30 minutes after the last clap of thunder.  Experts say by this time the storm should have passed making it safer to venture out in open space again.

Apparently, the chances are 300,000 to one, according to David Hand in his new book: The Improbability Principle. But while 300,000 to one looks like a minor risk for an individual, there are lots of people on the planet.  Small Data  A series on curious numbers cropping up in the news, by stats watcher Anthony Reuben  As a result, about 24,000 people are killed by lightning each year. Remember, you don't have to be struck by lightning to be killed by it - you could be in a house that's struck by lightning and burns down with you inside. Indeed, with seven billion people on the planet, what would be really, really unlikely would be that nobody was killed by lightning. Of course, 300,000 to one is an average - people in the developing world who spend less time indoors and have fewer tall buildings and more flammable ones are much more likely to be killed by lightning than people in developed ones. On average, three people are killed each year by lightning in the UK, according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, which are odds 66 times shorter than the global average. Hand's book sets out to explain why things that are considered to be very unlikely keep on happening. It's not just that people win the lottery. Again, while that's unlikely for an individual, it's pretty likely that someone will win it each week. No, we're talking about really unlikely things, like the lottery drawing the same numbers in two consecutive weeks, as happened on the Bulgarian Lottery in 2009. So, if you wait around long enough, it looks like you'll get to see almost anything happen. But not a man being struck by lightning twice in succession, seen on a security camera. The video of that, which Hand showed as part of a talk to the Royal Statistical Society on Thursday, is widely described on the internet as having been a fake. Maybe we'll have to wait a bit longer to see that.

We’ve all heard the reality check before: “You have a better chance of being struck by lightning than winning the lottery.”  To most of us, the odds of being struck by lightning, “ 1 in a million ,” are a convenient measuring rod for all things unlikely. Whether it’s winning the lottery or dying in a plane crash, if something is less likely to happen to you than being struck by lightning, then, as the logic goes, it’s probably not worth holding your breath for or worrying about very much (discussions along these very lines can be found here and here ).    ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT       Lightning Odds…Not So Simple…  The odds of being struck by lightning, however, are not as simple as we would have them to be. The answer to the question, “What are the odds of being struck by lightning?” is actually, “It depends.”    The Numbers Behind '1 in a Million' That the odds of being struck by lightning are approximately 1 in a million is perhaps one of the most well-known statistics out there. This statistic is nonetheless, an average of the odds of being struck by lightning in the United States. According to the U.S. National Weather Service, this statistic is based on averages of reported lightning deaths and injuries along a U.S. population estimate: Estimated U.S. population as of 2011: 310,000,000 Average Annual Reported U.S. Lightning Deaths and Injures, 2001-2010: 280 Odds of being struck by lightning in a given year  (reported deaths + injuries) =1 in (310,000,000/280) = 1 in 1,107,143 =  Approximately 1 in a million  What’s particularly noteworthy is that depending on which state you’re in within the United States, your odds of being struck by lightning this year can be much higher or much lower than that 1 in a million figure mentioned above. For example, based on lightning data (courtesy StruckByLightning.org ) and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for 2011 presented in the map below, if you live in Montana, your odds of being struck by lightning are roughly 1 in 249,550, considerably higher than the the national average of 1 in a million. Towards the other end of the spectrum, in California, your odds of being struck by lightning are far lower at 1 in 7,538,382.

Clearly, the odds of being struck by lightning are not the same for everyone, everywhere, but why?  We face varying odds of being struck by lightning because of a few key factors. These essentially location-specific factors include: Cloud-to-ground lightning density rates, population size, indoor vs. outdoor activity setting and safety adherence. Now Available on Amazon  Struck by Lightning: The Curious World of Probabilities by Jeffrey Rosenthal From terrorist attacks to big money jackpots, Struck by Lightning  deconstructs the odds and oddities of chance, examining both the relevant and irreverent role of randomness in our everyday lives..airplanes crash, bridges collapse, and we never know if we’ll be that one in a million statistic. A basic understanding of the rules of probability theory, applied to real-life circumstances, can help us to make sense of these situations, to avoid unnecessary fear, to seize the opportunities that randomness presents to us, and to actually enjoy the uncertainties we face. In this entertaining yet sophisticated look at the world of probabilities, author Jeffrey Rosenthal–an improbably talented math professor–explains the mechanics of randomness and teaches us how to develop an informed perspective on probability. U.S. Cloud-to-Ground Lightning Density This Vaisala National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) map shows the average annual lightning flash density within the continental U.S. from 1997-2011. In terms of cloud-to-ground lightning averages, Florida ranks highest, with an average of 1,414,284 flashes per year (24.7 flashes per square mile). Historically, Florida has also experienced the highest lightning number of lightning deaths in the United States, with 425 deaths occurring there from 1950-2003. Washington has the lowest cloud-to-ground lightning averages, 20,510 flashes per year (0.3 flashes per square mile). Population State population plays in a key role in determining your odds of being struck by lightning. Florida tops all the states both in terms of cloud-to-ground lightning density and the number of lightning casualties reported annually (31 in 2011), but because of Florida’s population size, an estimated 19,057,542 for 2011, the odds of being struck by lightning there were 1 in 614,759. These odds are lower  than Montana’s 1 in 249,550, even though Montana had only 4 lightning casualties, because in comparison, Montana’s estimated 2011 population was much smaller: 998,199. Indoor vs. Outdoor Simply put, more time spent outdoors increases the odds of being struck by lightning. In places where people work and engage in more activities outdoors, the odds of being struck by lightning tend to be higher. Lightning Fatalities: What Are the Odds of Being Killed by Lightning? According to U.S. NWS Storm Data for the 30 year period spanning the years 1984-2013, about 10% of people, or 1 in 10, struck by lightning are killed  . A recent report, A Detailed Analysis of Lightning Deaths in the United States from 2006 through 2013 , by lightning safety specialist, John S. Jensenius, Jr. at the National Weather Service, NOAA, revealed the following insights into lightning deaths:    Males accounted for 81% of lightning fatalities.  More than 70% of lightning deaths occurred in the months of June, July and August.  Slightly more lightning deaths happened on Saturdays and Sundays than other days of the week.  Individuals in the age range of 10-60 comprised the greatest number of lightning fatalities, with the 20-29 age bracket having the highest concentration of lightning fatalities.  64% of lightning deaths were related to leisure activities, followed by 17% of lightning deaths related to daily routine and 15% related to work.   Did You Know? As discussed in a USA Today article by Doyle Rice, there has been an overall decline in lightning fatalities in the U.S. since 1940, largely due to the impact of public education efforts and increased public recognition of the value of following safety principles.  Lightning Safety The U.S. National Weather Service cautions that when there is a thunderstorm in the area, no place outside that is safe. Moreover, if you can hear thunder, that means that lightning is, in fact, close enough to strike you . If you are outdoors when you hear thunder, seek safe shelter. In short, when it comes to lightning, the message that lightning experts and organizations regard as being the most crucial is to go indoors when there is a thunderstorm in the area. Thus, the National Weather Service , StruckByLighting.org and others have worked hard to get the simple message out: “ When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors!” Featured Image Credit: Brilhasti1/Flickr     Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Email Print    Leave a Reply Cancel reply   Your email address will not be published.

Supposing you live to be 85, that's 2 million people in your lifetime. On 7 billion people alive today, that's a lifetime chance of 1 in 3500 -- your chances are pretty slim anyway :)  But, to be more elaborate: your chances of being struck depend entirely on your surroundings. As you indicated, you're going to be near your house, which is of course much higher than your body height, and thus closer to any lightning cloud, and thus a much more likely target for lightning to strike. Provided you have a lightning rod (or similar) installed, the rod is the most direct way for a bolt to go into the ground, and will therefore considerably decrease your chances of being struck (NOT reduce it to zero though -- lightning is pretty predictable, until it's not).  There are a few caveats here -- if you do not have a lightning rod, your house is all wet from the rain, and you're touching a doorknob or standing near a pillar or something, a bolt may choose to use your body as a "least resistance" path to the ground (although water lines or power lines inside your wall still form a much more likely candidate). When a storm is directly overhead, alway open doors, windows, etc. with your right hand, while standing on your right leg -- this reduces the chances of the current moving through your heart in the (unlikely) event you are struck this way.  Also, if the bolt is conducted into the ground by a rod (or a tree or power line or similar), and you're standing near the point of entry, there may be secondary effects that can harm you (indirect impact). These are on average much less severe than a direct hit, but are known to have been lethal in some cases.  If you're NOT going to be near your house, make sure you're going to stand near tall things ( NEAR , not under). Be sure to stay well out of the region where the tall thing might reach you should it be struck, break and fall.  Suppose worst comes to worst: you find yourself in the middle of a severe thunderstorm in an open field. In that case -- if you can find a (few) long stick(s), or have one of those tents supported by fiberglass sticks with you, stick them in the ground, straight up, in a large circular pattern, before the storm is directly overhead. If there is no time, just skip it! Then (in the center of the circle) make yourself as small as you possibly can, while also making as little contact with the ground as possible. That is, crouch down, keep your head low between your knees, standing on the balls of your feet, keep your feet close together, and start praying. Stay that way until the worst of the storm has passed. Don't even look up until you are sure that the average time between lightning and thunder is at least a second.  But the very best thing you can do is of course avoid these situations all together. Inside your house, or a cafeteria, motel, pub, any place inside you can find, is the safest place to be. Inside a car is also perfectly safe due to it being an effective Farraday cage. Really anything you can find, a bus stop, stable, a cave (if you're in the mountains, God forbid), hunter's cabin, anything.  This is what I always got as advice from guides I met on hiking trips. I always stuck to it, but actually, I never verified any of it :) (aside from the odd documentary on TV).     share | improve this answer     answered Jul 12 '12 at 9:40       Rody Oldenhuis   556 6 8                  Great first post, +1! – berry120  Jul 12 '12 at 11:18            My dad would always take us to a mostly open field so we could enjoy the lightening storm better.
