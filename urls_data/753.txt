        Everywoman's Health Centre       Condoms    A male or external condom is a covering that fits over an erect penis, almost like a second skin. A female, or internal condom, is a soft, loose-fitting nitrile pouch that is inserted into the vagina before intercourse.   Both prevent pregnancy and STIs when used vaginally and can also be used for anal sex to provide protection against STIs . If used perfectly, male/external condoms can be up to 98% effective at preventing pregnancy . In reality they are only 85% effective – an average of 15 people out of 100 get pregnant when using condoms as their only form of protection for a year. Female/internal condoms are slightly less effective – 95% effective when used perfectly and 79% in reality. On average 21 out of 100 people get pregnant when using them for a year.  Condoms need to be used every time and from the very beginning of intercourse to most effectively prevent pregnancy. If you are only using condoms sometimes or on certain days of your cycle or if you start having intercourse and then put on a condom before ejaculation then you will  be at higher risk of pregnancy. Condoms can also be used in combination with other contraceptive methods – such as the birth control pill, patch, ring or shot, or an IUD – to provide stronger protection against pregnancy.  If you need strong protection or if you or your partner is not willing to use condoms every time you have sex then condoms on their own may not be the right choice for you.  Condoms protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and HIV. Other contraceptive methods do not prevent STIs.  Are condoms all you need?  Although on their own condoms have a relatively high failure rate, condoms are an excellent method to use in combination with something else. For example:   Spermicides: Spermicides can be used to make condoms more effective. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) before intercourse is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry on the package and read the instructions.  Fertility Awareness Method: the Rhythm method (counting safe days and using condoms on the “unsafe” days) has a relatively high failure rate, because you can ovulate (release an egg) at different times each month. Fertility Awareness Method – which in addition to counting days also includes checking ones cervical mucous and body temperature every day to determine when ovulation is occurring – can provide more protection. The most effective way to use this method is with condoms during “safer” times (when you are less likely to be fertile) and having no sex during less safe times (when you are more likely to be fertile).  Withdrawal or “the Pull-Out Method”: this involves withdrawing the penis and ejaculating away from the vagina. This method has a relatively high failure rate on its own – it is only 73% effective in actual use, meaning that 27 people out of 100 will get pregnant while using it for a year. However, using this with a condom (ejaculating into a condom away from the vagina or pulling out after using an internal condom) makes condom use more effective.  Birth Control Pill, Patch, Ring or Shot: Because the pill, patch, and ring have room for human error, eight people out of 100 will get pregnant while using them for a year. Using these methods with condoms makes them extremely effective at preventing pregnancy. Condoms will also reduce the small risk of pregnancy with the Depo Shot.  IUDS: IUDs are small devices a doctor implants into the uterus, and are extremely effective methods of birth control (over 99% in actual use). Condoms used with an IUD lower the chances of getting pregnant even further. Copper IUDs are also the most effective emergency birth control. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.  Plan B/Emergency Pills: Plan B is the most common form of emergency contraceptive pill (sometimes called the “morning after pill”) available in Canada at pharmacies without a prescription. It is about 50% effective overall. Ella, which is slightly more effective at 60% is also available by prescription. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.   What kind of condoms should you use?   All brands of condoms are quality tested in Canada, so will be of high quality. However, sometimes condoms are novelty or joke items. Always look to see if the package says the condom will protect against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV.  Male/external condoms are available in different sizes. Regular sized condoms will fit most people, but if condoms are breaking or slipping off regularly then you may need larger or smaller sized condoms. Sometimes this problem can be solved with more lubrication (see the section about “using a male/external condom” for more information).  Most condoms are made of latex. Some people have latex allergies or sensitivities, so there are condoms made with different materials that you can try. The most common latex alternative is polyurethane (all female/internal condoms are made from polyurethane and some male/external ones are too). There are also some condoms made from animal skin – however, these only protect against pregnancy and not against STIs.  Male condoms are the most commonly used. However, with female or internal condoms , women can have more control over condom use. They can even sometimes be used without a partner knowing, if negotiating condom use is difficult. They are also less likely to break and transfer heat better which for some people can increase sensation. However, they are slightly less effective, more expensive and can also sometimes make noise during intercourse.   Before using a condom   Get familiar with condoms ahead of time. It is best if the first time you see, touch or use a condom is before rather than during sex. Take a condom out of its package, get used to it, try putting it on yourself or on a vegetable or fruit. The more comfortable you are with condoms, the better chance you will be able to use them successfully.  Condoms are most effective when both partners are familiar with them and how they are used.  Communicate with your partner about birth control and condoms before, during and after sex. It is best to make sure you are on the same page about condom use and the amount of risk you are comfortable with ahead of time. It is also important that both of you know that a condom is being used and if it has broken or slipped off so that you can take extra precautions if needed (see the section on about if a condom breaks or slips off).  Store condoms somewhere cool and dry. Heat and sunlight can damage condoms.  Always check the expiry date before using a condom. If the expiry date has passed do not use the condom.  “Pillow test” the condom – before opening it, fold and squeeze the package together into a U-shape. If air escapes and the package goes flat rather than pillowy when folded, then do not use it as there may be tears in the package.  Open the package down the jagged edge and remove it gently. Using teeth or long nails can tear a condom.  Look at the condom to make sure there is no discolouration or flakiness. If there is, throw it away.  Think about whether you would like to use another form of birth control along with condoms – for more information on this, please see our website at ca  Consider whether you would prefer to use male/external condoms (which this handout focuses on) , or female /internal ones. Female/internal condoms go inside the vagina (or can be used anally as well) rather than on the penis.  If you want more information about the female/internal condom, see our website at ca    Using a male/external condom         Use water-based lubricant (lube) to help condoms feel better and be less likely to break or slip off. Start with a lubricated condom and add more to the outside of the condom as well as a few drops in the tip before it is rolled on.  Do not get oil-based products (ex. hand lotion, Vaseline, and lipstick or lip balm) on a condom or it may break.  Put the condom onto the tip of the penis with the rolled up rim facing outward . If you put the condom on the wrong way, it will not roll down. If this happens, discard it because there might already be fluid on it (preejaculate or precum) that can get someone pregnant or give them an STI.  Pinch the tip so that there is no air inside and room for the ejaculate (semen).  Roll the condom down to the base of the penis.  Spermicides can make condoms more effective at preventing pregnancy. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry date, read the instructions, and follow them closely.  It can be good to check the condom during sex to make sure it is not breaking or slipping off.  This can be done regularly throughout intercourse, when shifting positions and/or if the sensation changes (i.e. you start having more or less feeling, the condom feels pulled tight or so on).           Removing and discarding a male/external condom           Withdraw the penis while it is still hard so there is less chance of fluids leaking and move away from the vagina before taking the condom off.  Hold the condom while slowly pulling it off bit by bit, keeping the semen inside. Do not pull from the tip.  Check the condom to see if it is broken. Observe whether fluids are leaking out or if it has any obvious tears.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.            Using a female/internal condom             Insert the condom before intercourse begins – it can be inserted up to 6 hours before, but most people insert it between 2 to 20 minutes before.  Squeeze the loose inner ring together and insert the closed end of the condom high in the vagina.  The outside ring of the condom then lies against the outer lips of the vagina , providing additional protection against STIs.  Hold the outside ring when the penis is first inserted to ensure it goes inside the condom (not along the side) and to prevent the condom from being pushed into the vagina.  If the condom makes noise during sex try changing positions or adding lubricant inside the condom.              Removing and discarding a female/internal condom             After intercourse is finished and before standing up, squeeze and twist the outer ring to keep fluids inside and pull the condom out gently. Be careful not to spill semen near the vagina when you are removing the condom.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.             If a condom breaks or slips off         Discard condom (see above). Use a new condom if you are going to continue having intercourse.  Emergency Pills: Back up with an emergency pill like Plan B or Ella. Plan B and other progestin emergency pills are available at pharmacies without a prescription and you can buy it in advance to have at home. It is approximately 50% effective overall and can be taken up to 5 days after sex, but the sooner you take it the more likely it is to work. Ella is available by prescription. It is more effective overall (approximately 60%) and does not lose effectiveness as quickly over time. They cost $20-$40.  Copper IUD:  : a Copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency birth control – it is over 99% effective at preventing a pregnancy if inserted any time within 7 days after unprotected sex. If you leave the IUD in, it will continue to provide very effective (over 99%) protection. If you do not like it or want to get pregnant, you can have it taken out any time after your next period.  Reassess: if a condom breaks or slips off, it can be a good time to think about whether you want to do something differently with regards to birth control. Is there something you could do to make condoms work better for you? Do you need a more effective method of contraception or something to use in combination with condoms         Questions about condom use or birth control?

But what if you’re messing up—and you don’t even know it?       by Erin Stevens                  Previous story 10 things she says to her friends about you       Next story How soon is too soon to say I love you?                 Shutterstock          Share    Tweet       Print    +/-    Comments       You’re about six beers deep and finally—after several overpriced dinners and cocktails —you’ve convinced a super hot chick that you’re the all-around awesome guy she initially hoped you'd be. Score! So as you head back to your place and things get heated, there’s no shot you’re killing the mood with a condom ...right?       Bad idea. Terrible idea. In fact, that logic is so flawed we’re going to go ahead and counter it with the ultimate mood killer: In the first year of a baby’s life—between doctor visits, clothing, food, and everything else, a parent can expect to spend more than $10,000. (Yeah. Let that sink in.)         So unless you’re ready to trade beer for baby formula, read this—our expansive guide to making sure you don’t knock her up. Because even if you play it safe most of the time, you’re probably screwing up in ways you didn’t even know were possible. And like your old man always said, it only takes one mistake.          Sexual health   Sex myths she believes    These need to be set straight—STAT.      1. The mistake: You think having sex standing up prevents pregnancy  The potential damage: We couldn’t believe that nearly 1 in 5 of men buy into this, but according to a 2010 study , it's true. Yikes. “The law of gravity is not a contraceptive,” says Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., the co-director of The Center for Sexual Health Promotion. That’s a seemingly obvious assessment, right? Use it.  2. The mistake: You blindly grab some lube  The potential damage: Always, always, always check what your lube is made out of—otherwise, that condom might do jack. “Oil-based or petroleum-based lubricants like mineral oil or massage lotion can destroy condoms, making them more likely to break,” says sexologist and sexuality educator Megan Andelloux .  3. The mistake: Your hands are sweaty, so one of you tears the condom package with your teeth  The potential damage: Using items like knives or scissors—even your teeth—to open a wrapper will make it very easy to mistakenly poke a hole in the condom. (In one study , dudes who did so were about three times more likely to encounter breakage.) Think about it—do you really want sharp objects coming anywhere near the super-thin barrier that stands between you and fatherhood?          Relationships   How to live with your girlfriend    13 tips to keep the sex hot, independence intact, and love alive.      4. The mistake: You put the condom on—but don’t leave any space in the tip  The potential damage: If you covered up a faucet with your hand and turned it on full blast, where would the water go? See what we’re sayin’? It’s not rocket science. So leave approximately half an inch at the top of the condom to properly “catch” your sperm, says Herbenick; without this wiggle room, you’re risking breakage.  5. The mistake: You don’t use a condom because she’s on the pill  The potential damage: If you’re in a relationship, you should trust that she’s true to her word. But for a one-night stand? It’s not worth the risk. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , birth control pills are between 91-99% effective in preventing pregnancy—but the pill plus a condom gives you close-to-perfect protection. Your call.  6. The mistake: You were wasted and couldn’t find a condom...so you didn’t use one  The potential damage: Sure, it’s an understandably awkward situation if you’re about to “get it in” and can’t figure out where the hell you put the condom. But is it more awkward than becoming a daddy if you’re not ready for a kid? Get off your ass and search a little harder, or walk to the store and pick up an extra pack. According to the World Health Organization , with perfect use, condoms prevent pregnancy 98% of the time. That’s pretty damn good.          Relationships   Sex positions that won't get her off    Steer clear of these 4 sex positions that won't get her off.      7. The mistake: You’ve had the same condom hanging out in your wallet forever  The potential damage: Using a condom that hasn’t been properly stored might get you into a situation worse than the sexual slump you just endured. According to Herbenick, extreme heat or cold can damage the latex used in condoms, so the best spot for stashing them is a cool, dark, dry place—like in your nightstand—or a small, hard case (think: one made for business cards). And if you’re really trying to be a douche about the whole thing, there's alwasy this $200 Swarovski crystal condom compact .  8. The mistake: You’re not putting lube inside the condom  The potential damage: Those marathon sex sessions you’ve been having (nice work, bro) are bound to wear down the condom, making it dry and prone to ripping. “Always use lube inside the condom. It prevents breakage and, plus, it actually feels so much better for the condom-wearer,” says Andelloux. Remember: Check the type of lube before you apply, and just use a drop—too much can make the condom slip off.  9. The mistake: You take the condom off before the sex is over  The potential damage: If you're patting yourself on the back for using a condom in the first place...don't. Taking a condom off too early on into sex "can directly compromise the efficacy of condom use," according to a recent study from The Journal of Sexual Health . But you know that, silly! So if you play by the rules and keep that sucker on the entire time, it's 98% certain ( see no. 6 ) you won't have to worry about becoming a daddy. (Just be sure you hold the base of the condom during withdrawal to make sure it doesn't slip off or leak you-know-what.)          Relationships   How much sex is too much?    Can you get too much of a good thing? Doctors weigh in.       10. The mistake: You don’t need condoms—you’re a “pull-out pro”  The potential damage: You might think you have impeccable timing, but even if you do pull out in time, it’s still possible to get her pregnant. How? According to Planned Parenthood , your pre-ejaculate can pick up enough sperm left in your pipes from your last ejaculation to fertilize an egg. Whoa. Now, urinating between ejaculations might help, but as they say, it’s always safer to wrap it before you tap it—and the risk-taking for your non -sexual adventures.

A male reader asks about the risk of pregnancy even when using a condom while having sex with his girlfriend  By  Debby Herbenick, PhD, MPH | November 29, 2006  Like Tweet  Email Print  More     More on Birth Control   Subscribe to Birth Control          Question: My girlfriend and I are both virgins. I want to have sex with my girlfriend but she is afraid of getting pregnant. I told her that I will use condoms during sex. My question is, if I am using condoms and if I ejaculate in the condom when my penis is in my girlfriend’s vagina, is there any chance of getting her pregnant? Thanks for your time.  The short answer is: yes. There is a chance of pregnancy.  “Correct and Consistent” vs. “Typical”  With correct and consistent (read: every single time you have sex) condom use, condoms are about 97% effective in preventing pregnancy. However, their effectiveness drops considerably (to about 84% effective ) when one considers actual, typical use of condoms. One reason for the difference in effectiveness rates is that people who say they are condom users don’t always use condoms; sometimes they forget or choose not to use one.  Incomplete condom use (e.g., when two people start having sex without a condom and then add one mid-intercourse; or when two people remove a condom part way through intercourse) also contributes to a lower effectiveness rate – not because there is anything wrong with the condom, but because people sometimes use condoms incorrectly. [See these two  research studies for more information.]  To learn how to use condoms correctly, visit www.plannedparenthood.com or read the package insert enclosed in boxes of condoms. And if you two both decide together, without any pressure at all (feeling pressured into having sex is associated with a greater likelihood of regretting it later ), that you are interested in and ready to have sex together, you might consider using hormonal contraception (such as the IUD, implant, birth control pill, shot, or ring) in addition to condoms to further reduce your pregnancy risk.  Readiness To Have Sex  The longer answer is this: your sex dilemma may be about more than meets the eye. Often when people say that they do not want to have sex because of fill-in-the-blank (e.g., fear of pregnancy, fear of infection, etc), there may be other reasons that they do not yet want to have sex either at that point in their life, or with a specific partner, or at that time in a relationship.  If your girlfriend does not want to be sexual in this way with you, it may have nothing to do with you. If you feel like you two need to have sex in order to be in the relationship, then that is your issue (not hers) and you need to be able to find another way to deal with it other than to try and convince a hesitant partner to have sex with you.  Fear of pregnancy may be a very real reason why your girlfriend does not want to have sex yet. But considering that there are a range of highly effective birth control options available (including birth control pills, patches, rings, and shots, as well as correct and consistent condom use), technically the two of you could work together to figure out a safe, reliable and effective means of contraception.  It may be that there are other reasons that she does not yet want to have intercourse, and it is worth exploring how you feel about each other, your expectations for commitment and exclusivity, and your feelings about the relationship and what you mean to each other.  Don’t Pressure Her  It is important not to pressure your girlfriend into having sex with you if she is not yet ready to. Sex can be fantastic, pleasurable and relationship-building when it is shared with a partner who not only agrees to have sex with you, but who very much wants and desires to have sex with you.  On the other hand, sex can feel empty, meaningless or even scary (emotionally scary and, in terms of pregnancy or infection risk, physically scary) when one or both partners is uncertain about having sex.  As you probably realize, many women and men get mixed messages about sexuality in our culture. Some family, cultural and religious messages suggest that sex is dirty or sinful or only open to certain people (e.g., married adults interested in procreation) whereas others construct sexuality as being intimate, beautiful and open to any adults (regardless of sexual orientation, interest in having children or marital status).  Women often get a sense from popular culture that they should dress and act sexy and available, yet at the same time they may run the risk of being labeled sluts or whores if they act in sexual ways of which others (like their parents, friends or fellow students) disapprove.  Men are often encouraged to go out and have sex with anyone who will have sex with them, even at the expense of their own values or feelings about relationships or how to treat partners.  Given the range of messages that we get from different sources, it is no wonder that sexual decision making can be challenging for individuals and couples. Therefore, we would encourage you to take time with each other, and to be careful with each other’s feelings, when making this big decision.

Recently, at or near climax during vaginal sex my condom slipped off completely. I didn’t know this until I reached to hold onto it as I withdrew. My girlfriend hadn’t felt it either. It was difficult to retrieve and went near her cervix.  http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/385/510276/18693401/WFIU_18693401.mp3 Podcast: Play in new window | Download Subscribe: Android | RSS  Comments are closed.

Have you had a noticible shift in weight? Have you been stressed out? Traveled? Been sick? The list can go on hehe there's a lot that can delay ovulation in any given cycle which can make your cycle longer so you appear late.

Failure rates - Know the risks  There are many different types of contraceptive available, and though no method is 100% reliable, some are more so than others. Contraceptive effectiveness is measured by calculating the failure rate; the percentage of women experiencing an unintended pregnancy during the first year of use. Most methods have two different failure rates: there's “perfect” use, for when the contraceptive always is properly applied, and “typical” use, which takes in to account mistakes like forgetting to take a pill or a broken condom.  For example, when used correctly the male condom is 98% effective, but that's not to say there is a 2% chance of becoming pregnant every time you use one. A 2% failure rate actually means that for every 100 woman using the contraceptive method for an entire year, two will experience an unintended pregnancy. The effectiveness of some common methods are listed in the following table.       Method    Effectiveness      Typical use    Perfect use      No contraceptive used    15.0%    15.0%      Combined oral contraceptives AKA “the pill    92.0%    99.7%      Female condoms    79.0%    95.0%      Male condoms    85.0%    98.0%              Two is better than one  Although the statistics show that condoms are less effective than the pill, they are the only form of contraception that can prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To make sure you are protected against both the risk of pregnancy and contracting an STI, you should combine condoms with another type of contraception.  Thanks to the laws of probability, using two contraceptive methods at the same time boosts their effectiveness. Remember, if two events A and B are independent, the probability of both occurring is P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B). If you use both a condom and the pill they work independently, because if one method fails it has no impact on the other. That means the failure rate of the combined condom and pill method is the product of their separate failure rates. For perfect use of the male condom and pill, that's 0.02 x 0.003 = 0.00006, or 0.006%. In other words, the combined method is over 99.99% effective when used perfectly.  The figure for “typical” use of the combined method is also much higher than using either method on its own. With failure rates of 15% for the male condom and 8% for the pill it pays to use them together, since 0.15 x 0.08 = 0.012, or 1.2%. With this rating of 98.8% effectiveness, using the combined method is clearly much safer. No one expects you to get out a calculator before you have sex, but you should always understand the risks involved and choose the right contraceptive methods for you.

" Zocdoc › Answers › Can you still get pregnant if you use a condom when having sex? Question I'm 18 and just started having sex with my boyfriend. We use a condom but I do not take the birth control pill. Is there still a chance I can get pregnant? My bf says theres no way if we use condoms. Answer A condom is a barrier contraceptive device used to prevent pregnancy and reduce transmission of sexually transmitted infections. They are highly recommended for their indication and work relatively well, however like most things, nothing is perfect 100 % of the time. Condoms, when used exactly as directed have a 1-2% risk of failing per year. Most of this comes from condom breakage or slippage after or during sex. 

In addition, if condoms are used improperly, the failure rate goes up to 10-14% of failure per year. 

That being said, condoms are very effective in birth control and reduction of sexually transmitted infections. Many times, causes for failure can be readily detected. For example, you and/or your partner will notice if a condom breaks or slips off. If that is the case, then an emergency contraception pill (also known as the "morning after pill," or "plan B pill") can be used within 48 hours of intercourse to try to minimize the likelihood of becoming pregnant. Such emergency contraceptive pills can be obtained from a local pharmacy and do NOT require a prescription if the patient is 18 years old. Patients 16 and under require a prescription. 

Please consult your primary care physician/pediatrician/sex counselor for further details or questions regarding condoms, emergency contraception, as well as other forms of contraception such as the birth control pill, Intrauterine devices, etc. Need more info?

Privacy Terms of Use Español               Everywoman's Health Centre       Condoms    A male or external condom is a covering that fits over an erect penis, almost like a second skin. A female, or internal condom, is a soft, loose-fitting nitrile pouch that is inserted into the vagina before intercourse.   Both prevent pregnancy and STIs when used vaginally and can also be used for anal sex to provide protection against STIs . If used perfectly, male/external condoms can be up to 98% effective at preventing pregnancy . In reality they are only 85% effective – an average of 15 people out of 100 get pregnant when using condoms as their only form of protection for a year. Female/internal condoms are slightly less effective – 95% effective when used perfectly and 79% in reality. On average 21 out of 100 people get pregnant when using them for a year.  Condoms need to be used every time and from the very beginning of intercourse to most effectively prevent pregnancy. If you are only using condoms sometimes or on certain days of your cycle or if you start having intercourse and then put on a condom before ejaculation then you will  be at higher risk of pregnancy. Condoms can also be used in combination with other contraceptive methods – such as the birth control pill, patch, ring or shot, or an IUD – to provide stronger protection against pregnancy.  If you need strong protection or if you or your partner is not willing to use condoms every time you have sex then condoms on their own may not be the right choice for you.  Condoms protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and HIV. Other contraceptive methods do not prevent STIs.  Are condoms all you need?  Although on their own condoms have a relatively high failure rate, condoms are an excellent method to use in combination with something else. For example:   Spermicides: Spermicides can be used to make condoms more effective. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) before intercourse is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry on the package and read the instructions.  Fertility Awareness Method: the Rhythm method (counting safe days and using condoms on the “unsafe” days) has a relatively high failure rate, because you can ovulate (release an egg) at different times each month. Fertility Awareness Method – which in addition to counting days also includes checking ones cervical mucous and body temperature every day to determine when ovulation is occurring – can provide more protection. The most effective way to use this method is with condoms during “safer” times (when you are less likely to be fertile) and having no sex during less safe times (when you are more likely to be fertile).  Withdrawal or “the Pull-Out Method”: this involves withdrawing the penis and ejaculating away from the vagina. This method has a relatively high failure rate on its own – it is only 73% effective in actual use, meaning that 27 people out of 100 will get pregnant while using it for a year. However, using this with a condom (ejaculating into a condom away from the vagina or pulling out after using an internal condom) makes condom use more effective.  Birth Control Pill, Patch, Ring or Shot: Because the pill, patch, and ring have room for human error, eight people out of 100 will get pregnant while using them for a year. Using these methods with condoms makes them extremely effective at preventing pregnancy. Condoms will also reduce the small risk of pregnancy with the Depo Shot.  IUDS: IUDs are small devices a doctor implants into the uterus, and are extremely effective methods of birth control (over 99% in actual use). Condoms used with an IUD lower the chances of getting pregnant even further. Copper IUDs are also the most effective emergency birth control. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.  Plan B/Emergency Pills: Plan B is the most common form of emergency contraceptive pill (sometimes called the “morning after pill”) available in Canada at pharmacies without a prescription. It is about 50% effective overall. Ella, which is slightly more effective at 60% is also available by prescription. See the section on “If a condom breaks or slips off” for more information.   What kind of condoms should you use?   All brands of condoms are quality tested in Canada, so will be of high quality. However, sometimes condoms are novelty or joke items. Always look to see if the package says the condom will protect against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV.  Male/external condoms are available in different sizes. Regular sized condoms will fit most people, but if condoms are breaking or slipping off regularly then you may need larger or smaller sized condoms. Sometimes this problem can be solved with more lubrication (see the section about “using a male/external condom” for more information).  Most condoms are made of latex. Some people have latex allergies or sensitivities, so there are condoms made with different materials that you can try. The most common latex alternative is polyurethane (all female/internal condoms are made from polyurethane and some male/external ones are too). There are also some condoms made from animal skin – however, these only protect against pregnancy and not against STIs.  Male condoms are the most commonly used. However, with female or internal condoms , women can have more control over condom use. They can even sometimes be used without a partner knowing, if negotiating condom use is difficult. They are also less likely to break and transfer heat better which for some people can increase sensation. However, they are slightly less effective, more expensive and can also sometimes make noise during intercourse.   Before using a condom   Get familiar with condoms ahead of time. It is best if the first time you see, touch or use a condom is before rather than during sex. Take a condom out of its package, get used to it, try putting it on yourself or on a vegetable or fruit. The more comfortable you are with condoms, the better chance you will be able to use them successfully.  Condoms are most effective when both partners are familiar with them and how they are used.  Communicate with your partner about birth control and condoms before, during and after sex. It is best to make sure you are on the same page about condom use and the amount of risk you are comfortable with ahead of time. It is also important that both of you know that a condom is being used and if it has broken or slipped off so that you can take extra precautions if needed (see the section on about if a condom breaks or slips off).  Store condoms somewhere cool and dry. Heat and sunlight can damage condoms.  Always check the expiry date before using a condom. If the expiry date has passed do not use the condom.  “Pillow test” the condom – before opening it, fold and squeeze the package together into a U-shape. If air escapes and the package goes flat rather than pillowy when folded, then do not use it as there may be tears in the package.  Open the package down the jagged edge and remove it gently. Using teeth or long nails can tear a condom.  Look at the condom to make sure there is no discolouration or flakiness. If there is, throw it away.  Think about whether you would like to use another form of birth control along with condoms – for more information on this, please see our website at ca  Consider whether you would prefer to use male/external condoms (which this handout focuses on) , or female /internal ones. Female/internal condoms go inside the vagina (or can be used anally as well) rather than on the penis.  If you want more information about the female/internal condom, see our website at ca    Using a male/external condom         Use water-based lubricant (lube) to help condoms feel better and be less likely to break or slip off. Start with a lubricated condom and add more to the outside of the condom as well as a few drops in the tip before it is rolled on.  Do not get oil-based products (ex. hand lotion, Vaseline, and lipstick or lip balm) on a condom or it may break.  Put the condom onto the tip of the penis with the rolled up rim facing outward . If you put the condom on the wrong way, it will not roll down. If this happens, discard it because there might already be fluid on it (preejaculate or precum) that can get someone pregnant or give them an STI.  Pinch the tip so that there is no air inside and room for the ejaculate (semen).  Roll the condom down to the base of the penis.  Spermicides can make condoms more effective at preventing pregnancy. Applying a spermicidal foam, film, gel or sponge close to the cervix (the opening of the uterus at the top of the vagina) is more effective than having spermicide on the actual condom. Always check the expiry date, read the instructions, and follow them closely.  It can be good to check the condom during sex to make sure it is not breaking or slipping off.  This can be done regularly throughout intercourse, when shifting positions and/or if the sensation changes (i.e. you start having more or less feeling, the condom feels pulled tight or so on).           Removing and discarding a male/external condom           Withdraw the penis while it is still hard so there is less chance of fluids leaking and move away from the vagina before taking the condom off.  Hold the condom while slowly pulling it off bit by bit, keeping the semen inside. Do not pull from the tip.  Check the condom to see if it is broken. Observe whether fluids are leaking out or if it has any obvious tears.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.            Using a female/internal condom             Insert the condom before intercourse begins – it can be inserted up to 6 hours before, but most people insert it between 2 to 20 minutes before.  Squeeze the loose inner ring together and insert the closed end of the condom high in the vagina.  The outside ring of the condom then lies against the outer lips of the vagina , providing additional protection against STIs.  Hold the outside ring when the penis is first inserted to ensure it goes inside the condom (not along the side) and to prevent the condom from being pushed into the vagina.  If the condom makes noise during sex try changing positions or adding lubricant inside the condom.              Removing and discarding a female/internal condom             After intercourse is finished and before standing up, squeeze and twist the outer ring to keep fluids inside and pull the condom out gently. Be careful not to spill semen near the vagina when you are removing the condom.  Throw the condom away in the garbage. Do not flush it down the toilet.             If a condom breaks or slips off         Discard condom (see above). Use a new condom if you are going to continue having intercourse.  Emergency Pills: Back up with an emergency pill like Plan B or Ella. Plan B and other progestin emergency pills are available at pharmacies without a prescription and you can buy it in advance to have at home. It is approximately 50% effective overall and can be taken up to 5 days after sex, but the sooner you take it the more likely it is to work. Ella is available by prescription. It is more effective overall (approximately 60%) and does not lose effectiveness as quickly over time. They cost $20-$40.  Copper IUD:  : a Copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency birth control – it is over 99% effective at preventing a pregnancy if inserted any time within 7 days after unprotected sex. If you leave the IUD in, it will continue to provide very effective (over 99%) protection. If you do not like it or want to get pregnant, you can have it taken out any time after your next period.  Reassess: if a condom breaks or slips off, it can be a good time to think about whether you want to do something differently with regards to birth control.

But what if you’re messing up—and you don’t even know it?       by Erin Stevens                  Previous story 10 things she says to her friends about you       Next story How soon is too soon to say I love you?                 Shutterstock          Share    Tweet       Print    +/-    Comments       You’re about six beers deep and finally—after several overpriced dinners and cocktails —you’ve convinced a super hot chick that you’re the all-around awesome guy she initially hoped you'd be. Score! So as you head back to your place and things get heated, there’s no shot you’re killing the mood with a condom ...right?       Bad idea. Terrible idea. In fact, that logic is so flawed we’re going to go ahead and counter it with the ultimate mood killer: In the first year of a baby’s life—between doctor visits, clothing, food, and everything else, a parent can expect to spend more than $10,000. (Yeah. Let that sink in.)         So unless you’re ready to trade beer for baby formula, read this—our expansive guide to making sure you don’t knock her up. Because even if you play it safe most of the time, you’re probably screwing up in ways you didn’t even know were possible. And like your old man always said, it only takes one mistake.          Sexual health   Sex myths she believes    These need to be set straight—STAT.      1. The mistake: You think having sex standing up prevents pregnancy  The potential damage: We couldn’t believe that nearly 1 in 5 of men buy into this, but according to a 2010 study , it's true. Yikes. “The law of gravity is not a contraceptive,” says Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., the co-director of The Center for Sexual Health Promotion. That’s a seemingly obvious assessment, right? Use it.  2. The mistake: You blindly grab some lube  The potential damage: Always, always, always check what your lube is made out of—otherwise, that condom might do jack. “Oil-based or petroleum-based lubricants like mineral oil or massage lotion can destroy condoms, making them more likely to break,” says sexologist and sexuality educator Megan Andelloux .  3. The mistake: Your hands are sweaty, so one of you tears the condom package with your teeth  The potential damage: Using items like knives or scissors—even your teeth—to open a wrapper will make it very easy to mistakenly poke a hole in the condom. (In one study , dudes who did so were about three times more likely to encounter breakage.) Think about it—do you really want sharp objects coming anywhere near the super-thin barrier that stands between you and fatherhood?          Relationships   How to live with your girlfriend    13 tips to keep the sex hot, independence intact, and love alive.      4. The mistake: You put the condom on—but don’t leave any space in the tip  The potential damage: If you covered up a faucet with your hand and turned it on full blast, where would the water go? See what we’re sayin’? It’s not rocket science. So leave approximately half an inch at the top of the condom to properly “catch” your sperm, says Herbenick; without this wiggle room, you’re risking breakage.  5. The mistake: You don’t use a condom because she’s on the pill  The potential damage: If you’re in a relationship, you should trust that she’s true to her word. But for a one-night stand? It’s not worth the risk. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , birth control pills are between 91-99% effective in preventing pregnancy—but the pill plus a condom gives you close-to-perfect protection. Your call.  6. The mistake: You were wasted and couldn’t find a condom...so you didn’t use one  The potential damage: Sure, it’s an understandably awkward situation if you’re about to “get it in” and can’t figure out where the hell you put the condom. But is it more awkward than becoming a daddy if you’re not ready for a kid? Get off your ass and search a little harder, or walk to the store and pick up an extra pack. According to the World Health Organization , with perfect use, condoms prevent pregnancy 98% of the time. That’s pretty damn good.          Relationships   Sex positions that won't get her off    Steer clear of these 4 sex positions that won't get her off.      7. The mistake: You’ve had the same condom hanging out in your wallet forever  The potential damage: Using a condom that hasn’t been properly stored might get you into a situation worse than the sexual slump you just endured. According to Herbenick, extreme heat or cold can damage the latex used in condoms, so the best spot for stashing them is a cool, dark, dry place—like in your nightstand—or a small, hard case (think: one made for business cards). And if you’re really trying to be a douche about the whole thing, there's alwasy this $200 Swarovski crystal condom compact .  8. The mistake: You’re not putting lube inside the condom  The potential damage: Those marathon sex sessions you’ve been having (nice work, bro) are bound to wear down the condom, making it dry and prone to ripping. “Always use lube inside the condom. It prevents breakage and, plus, it actually feels so much better for the condom-wearer,” says Andelloux. Remember: Check the type of lube before you apply, and just use a drop—too much can make the condom slip off.  9. The mistake: You take the condom off before the sex is over  The potential damage: If you're patting yourself on the back for using a condom in the first place...don't. Taking a condom off too early on into sex "can directly compromise the efficacy of condom use," according to a recent study from The Journal of Sexual Health . But you know that, silly! So if you play by the rules and keep that sucker on the entire time, it's 98% certain ( see no. 6 ) you won't have to worry about becoming a daddy. (Just be sure you hold the base of the condom during withdrawal to make sure it doesn't slip off or leak you-know-what.)          Relationships   How much sex is too much?    Can you get too much of a good thing? Doctors weigh in.       10. The mistake: You don’t need condoms—you’re a “pull-out pro”  The potential damage: You might think you have impeccable timing, but even if you do pull out in time, it’s still possible to get her pregnant. How? According to Planned Parenthood , your pre-ejaculate can pick up enough sperm left in your pipes from your last ejaculation to fertilize an egg. Whoa. Now, urinating between ejaculations might help, but as they say, it’s always safer to wrap it before you tap it—and the risk-taking for your non -sexual adventures.

A male reader asks about the risk of pregnancy even when using a condom while having sex with his girlfriend  By  Debby Herbenick, PhD, MPH | November 29, 2006  Like Tweet  Email Print  More     More on Birth Control   Subscribe to Birth Control          Question: My girlfriend and I are both virgins. I want to have sex with my girlfriend but she is afraid of getting pregnant. I told her that I will use condoms during sex. My question is, if I am using condoms and if I ejaculate in the condom when my penis is in my girlfriend’s vagina, is there any chance of getting her pregnant? Thanks for your time.  The short answer is: yes. There is a chance of pregnancy.  “Correct and Consistent” vs. “Typical”  With correct and consistent (read: every single time you have sex) condom use, condoms are about 97% effective in preventing pregnancy. However, their effectiveness drops considerably (to about 84% effective ) when one considers actual, typical use of condoms. One reason for the difference in effectiveness rates is that people who say they are condom users don’t always use condoms; sometimes they forget or choose not to use one.  Incomplete condom use (e.g., when two people start having sex without a condom and then add one mid-intercourse; or when two people remove a condom part way through intercourse) also contributes to a lower effectiveness rate – not because there is anything wrong with the condom, but because people sometimes use condoms incorrectly. [See these two  research studies for more information.]  To learn how to use condoms correctly, visit www.plannedparenthood.com or read the package insert enclosed in boxes of condoms. And if you two both decide together, without any pressure at all (feeling pressured into having sex is associated with a greater likelihood of regretting it later ), that you are interested in and ready to have sex together, you might consider using hormonal contraception (such as the IUD, implant, birth control pill, shot, or ring) in addition to condoms to further reduce your pregnancy risk.  Readiness To Have Sex  The longer answer is this: your sex dilemma may be about more than meets the eye. Often when people say that they do not want to have sex because of fill-in-the-blank (e.g., fear of pregnancy, fear of infection, etc), there may be other reasons that they do not yet want to have sex either at that point in their life, or with a specific partner, or at that time in a relationship.  If your girlfriend does not want to be sexual in this way with you, it may have nothing to do with you. If you feel like you two need to have sex in order to be in the relationship, then that is your issue (not hers) and you need to be able to find another way to deal with it other than to try and convince a hesitant partner to have sex with you.  Fear of pregnancy may be a very real reason why your girlfriend does not want to have sex yet. But considering that there are a range of highly effective birth control options available (including birth control pills, patches, rings, and shots, as well as correct and consistent condom use), technically the two of you could work together to figure out a safe, reliable and effective means of contraception.  It may be that there are other reasons that she does not yet want to have intercourse, and it is worth exploring how you feel about each other, your expectations for commitment and exclusivity, and your feelings about the relationship and what you mean to each other.  Don’t Pressure Her  It is important not to pressure your girlfriend into having sex with you if she is not yet ready to. Sex can be fantastic, pleasurable and relationship-building when it is shared with a partner who not only agrees to have sex with you, but who very much wants and desires to have sex with you.  On the other hand, sex can feel empty, meaningless or even scary (emotionally scary and, in terms of pregnancy or infection risk, physically scary) when one or both partners is uncertain about having sex.  As you probably realize, many women and men get mixed messages about sexuality in our culture. Some family, cultural and religious messages suggest that sex is dirty or sinful or only open to certain people (e.g., married adults interested in procreation) whereas others construct sexuality as being intimate, beautiful and open to any adults (regardless of sexual orientation, interest in having children or marital status).  Women often get a sense from popular culture that they should dress and act sexy and available, yet at the same time they may run the risk of being labeled sluts or whores if they act in sexual ways of which others (like their parents, friends or fellow students) disapprove.  Men are often encouraged to go out and have sex with anyone who will have sex with them, even at the expense of their own values or feelings about relationships or how to treat partners.  Given the range of messages that we get from different sources, it is no wonder that sexual decision making can be challenging for individuals and couples. Therefore, we would encourage you to take time with each other, and to be careful with each other’s feelings, when making this big decision.

By  Debby Herbenick, PhD, MPH | December 6, 2007  I am a sexually active, heterosexual male in a monogamous relationship. Recently, at or near climax during vaginal sex my condom slipped off completely. I didn’t know this until I reached to hold onto it as I withdrew. My girlfriend hadn’t felt it either. It was difficult to retrieve and went near her cervix.  http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/385/510276/18693401/WFIU_18693401.mp3 Podcast: Play in new window | Download Subscribe: Android | RSS  Comments are closed.

I dont want to be disappointed if i'm not. j  jewelsface @kissycastaneda  I just watched that episode this week!! I love that season of friends!! J  JLE2009 @KandG09  According to about.com, condoms are 85% effective in preventing pregnancy with "typical" use, which means 15 in 100 women will get pregnant using condoms in the "typical" manner. Â With perfect use, condoms can be 98% effective. Â So... it can happen. :-) K  KandG09 so...i tested and it was negative. still no period, tomorrow will be a week late. any advice? should i try testing again tomorrow? r  rivershere @KandG09  my aunt got pregnant BOTH time while on BC and using a condom lol K  KandG09 Well I am now a week late... t  thevioletfemme @KandG09  There are other reasons besides pregnancy you might be late. Have you had a noticible shift in weight? Have you been stressed out? Traveled? Been sick? The list can go on hehe there's a lot that can delay ovulation in any given cycle which can make your cycle longer so you appear late. Just thought I'd offer that as a suggestion since your test was - K  KandG09 tested again this morning...another negative. K  KandG09 well i started my period today...2 weeks late. VERY heavy. its weird. Related Articles & Discussions Is It Safe to Use Frozen Condoms for Postpartum Pain?

Failure rates - Know the risks  There are many different types of contraceptive available, and though no method is 100% reliable, some are more so than others. Contraceptive effectiveness is measured by calculating the failure rate; the percentage of women experiencing an unintended pregnancy during the first year of use. Most methods have two different failure rates: there's “perfect” use, for when the contraceptive always is properly applied, and “typical” use, which takes in to account mistakes like forgetting to take a pill or a broken condom.  For example, when used correctly the male condom is 98% effective, but that's not to say there is a 2% chance of becoming pregnant every time you use one. A 2% failure rate actually means that for every 100 woman using the contraceptive method for an entire year, two will experience an unintended pregnancy. The effectiveness of some common methods are listed in the following table.       Method    Effectiveness      Typical use    Perfect use      No contraceptive used    15.0%    15.0%      Combined oral contraceptives AKA “the pill    92.0%    99.7%      Female condoms    79.0%    95.0%      Male condoms    85.0%    98.0%              Two is better than one  Although the statistics show that condoms are less effective than the pill, they are the only form of contraception that can prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To make sure you are protected against both the risk of pregnancy and contracting an STI, you should combine condoms with another type of contraception.  Thanks to the laws of probability, using two contraceptive methods at the same time boosts their effectiveness. Remember, if two events A and B are independent, the probability of both occurring is P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B). If you use both a condom and the pill they work independently, because if one method fails it has no impact on the other. That means the failure rate of the combined condom and pill method is the product of their separate failure rates. For perfect use of the male condom and pill, that's 0.02 x 0.003 = 0.00006, or 0.006%. In other words, the combined method is over 99.99% effective when used perfectly.  The figure for “typical” use of the combined method is also much higher than using either method on its own. With failure rates of 15% for the male condom and 8% for the pill it pays to use them together, since 0.15 x 0.08 = 0.012, or 1.2%. With this rating of 98.8% effectiveness, using the combined method is clearly much safer. No one expects you to get out a calculator before you have sex, but you should always understand the risks involved and choose the right contraceptive methods for you.

" Zocdoc › Answers › Can you still get pregnant if you use a condom when having sex? Question I'm 18 and just started having sex with my boyfriend. We use a condom but I do not take the birth control pill. Is there still a chance I can get pregnant? My bf says theres no way if we use condoms. Answer A condom is a barrier contraceptive device used to prevent pregnancy and reduce transmission of sexually transmitted infections. They are highly recommended for their indication and work relatively well, however like most things, nothing is perfect 100 % of the time. Condoms, when used exactly as directed have a 1-2% risk of failing per year. Most of this comes from condom breakage or slippage after or during sex. 

In addition, if condoms are used improperly, the failure rate goes up to 10-14% of failure per year. 

That being said, condoms are very effective in birth control and reduction of sexually transmitted infections. Many times, causes for failure can be readily detected. For example, you and/or your partner will notice if a condom breaks or slips off. If that is the case, then an emergency contraception pill (also known as the "morning after pill," or "plan B pill") can be used within 48 hours of intercourse to try to minimize the likelihood of becoming pregnant. Such emergency contraceptive pills can be obtained from a local pharmacy and do NOT require a prescription if the patient is 18 years old. Patients 16 and under require a prescription. 

Please consult your primary care physician/pediatrician/sex counselor for further details or questions regarding condoms, emergency contraception, as well as other forms of contraception such as the birth control pill, Intrauterine devices, etc. Need more info?
