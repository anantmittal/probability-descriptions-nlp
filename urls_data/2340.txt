       SEARCH  HOME       Math Central Quandaries & Queries          Question from tabyia, a student:  The common deck of 52 cards has 26 black cards (13 spades and 13 clubs) and 26 red cards (13 hearts and 13 diamonds).  Each suit consists of ace, king, queen, jack, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three and deuce.  13in all.  A single card is chosen at random.  Find the odds against its being a red queen?  How many cards will I have to draw to be absolutely certain that I have drawn three black cards       Tabyia,  I'm going to find the odds against drawing a jack.  There are 4 jacks in the deck of 52 cards so the probability of of drawing a jack is 4/52 = 1/13. Hence the probability of not drawing a jack is 1 - (1/13) = 12/13. Therefore, in the long run, if you select a card many times you expect that, on the average, 12 of every 13 times you don't draw a jack and 1 of every 13 times you do draw a jack. Thus the odds against selecting a jack is 12:1. (This is read as 12 to 1.)  Use the same procedure to find the odds against drawing a red queen.

This type of information is of little use to the working performer. The answer is likely much more complex than I am thinking, and perhaps be directed to someone like Persi Diaconis. The short answer is with 52 cards in a standard deck, the odds of choosing any one specific cards is one in 52. It seems to me that opening the parameters to select one of a kind e.g., any of the kings, from a standard deck is 4 in 52. I guess the odds of picking a different specific value, i.e., Queens, afterwards is 4 in 51. Jacks would be 4 in 50. There is likely some other factor involved that bigger brains than mine can help direct you. 2.2k Views · Answer requested by  Thomas Cook promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

There are 52 cards total in the deck. The probability of getting a queen first would be [math]\frac{4}{52}[/math] , but since we want to know the probability of getting a king after that assuming the queen wasn’t replaced, all we need to do is multiply it out: P(king | queen not replaced) = [math]\frac{4}{52} * \frac{4}{51} = \frac{16}{2652}[/math] We get [math]\frac{4}{51}[/math] for the second fraction because there are still 4 kings in the deck, but since the queen wasn’t put back in the pile, it reduces the number of cards in the deck by one, giving us 51.

"Neither card is red" is the same as "both cards are black".\nThe probability that the first card is black is 26 out of 52, or 1/2.  Given that the first card is black, there are 51 cards remaining, of which 25 are black; thus the conditional probability that the second card is also black is 25/51.  The probability that both cards are black is the product of these two probabilities: 1/2 * 25/51 = 25/102, or about 24.51%.            Is there 52 cards in a pack without joker?

[original answer] four in 52!    ====    The question is not fully stated, but I assume what is being asked is "What are the chances of pulling all four aces out of 52 cards when four cards are drawn".     The answer is 1 / 270725 = 0.00000369 = 0.000369%. Approximately four out of one million.     The chances are (4*3*2*1) / (52*51*50*49) = 24 / 649700 = 1 / 270725. That is, on the first draw there is a 4/52 chance of drawing one of the four aces out of the full pack; In the 48 out of 52 cases where an ace isn't drawn, "you lose".   In the 4/52 cases where an ace is drawn first, there is a 3/51 chance of drawing one of the remaining three aces from the remaining 51 cards. If that happens, there is a 2/50 chance of drawing one of the remaining two aces from the remaining 50 cards; and then a 1/49 chance of drawing the last ace out of the remaining 49 cards.   [ If the question is "What are the chances of pulling any of the aces out of 52 cards in one draw" then "four in 52" is correct. ]               Alex146  49,465 Contributions      What are the chances that you get 2 red cards and then a black card dealt randomly out of a 52 card deck?  The probability of getting a red card out of a standard 52 card deck is 26 in 52, or 0.5.. 
The probability of getting a second red card is 25 in 51, or 0.490, because one red card is missing, and the deck is short by one card.. 
The probability of getting a black card next is 26 in 50, or 0.52, because the deck is short by two cards, but all the black cards are there.. 
Multiply these probabilities together, and you get about 0.127, or about 1 in 8, so the probability of getting 2 red cards and then a black card in a random 52 card deck is about 1 in 8.

Queen Hypothesis. --The "Red Queen"
hypothesis is used to describe two similar ideas, which are both
based on coevolution. The original idea is that coevolution could
lead to situations for which the probability of extinction is
relatively constant over millions of years (Van Valen 1973). The
gist of the idea is that, in tightly coevolved interactions, evolutionary
change by one species (e.g., a prey or host) could lead to extinction
of other species (e.g. a predator or parasite), and that the probability
of such changes might be reasonably independent of species age.
Van Valen named the idea "the Red Queen hypothesis,"
because, under this view, species had to "run" (evolve)
in order to stay in the same place (extant). ( Show
me the data. )  The other idea is that
coevolution, particularly between hosts and parasites, could lead
to sustained oscillations in genotype frequencies (Fig. 1). This
idea forms the core for one of the leading hypotheses for the
persistence of sexual reproduction see Bell 1982). In species
where asexual reproduction is possible (as in many plants and
invertebrates), coevolutionary interactions with parasites may
select for sexual reproduction in hosts as a way to reduce the
risk of infection in offspring. There have been many important
contributors to the Red Queen hypothesis as it applies to sex.
W.D. Hamilton and John Jaenike were among the earliest pioneers
of the idea.       Figure 1. Red Queen dynamics: results from a computer simulation for host-parasite
      coevolution. The blue line gives the frequency of one host genotype;
      the red line gives the frequency of the parasite genotype that
      can infect it. Note that both genotypes oscillate over time,
      as if they were "running" in circles. The model assumes
      that hosts have self-nonself recognition systems, which can detect
      foreign organisms. The model also assumes that hosts and parasites
      both reproduce sexually.     The phrase "Red
Queen hypothesis" comes from Chapter 2 in Through the Looking
Glass (Carroll 1872). In Alice's dream about the looking glass
house, she first finds that things appear left-to-right, as if
shown in a mirror. She then finds that chess pieces are alive.
She will later encounter several of these pieces (most notably
the Red Queen), after she leaves the looking glass house to see
the garden.  Alice decides that it
would be easier to see the garden if she first climbs the hill,
to which there appears to be a very straight path. However, as
she follows the path, she finds that it leads her back to the
house. When she tries to speed up, she not only returns to the
house, she crashes into it. Hence, forward movement takes Alice
back to her starting point (Red Queen dynamics), and rapid movement
causes abrupt stops (extinction).  Eventually, Alice finds
herself in a patch of very vocal and opinionated flowers; the
rose is especially vocal. The flowers tell Alice that someone
like her (the Red Queen) often passes through, and Alice decides
to seek this person, mostly as a way to escape more verbal abuse.
When Alice spots the Red Queen, she begins moving toward her.
But, the Red Queen quickly disappears from sight. Alice decides
to follow the advice of the rose, and go the other way ("I
should advise you to walk the other way"). Immediately she
comes face-to-face with the Red Queen (see Lythgoe and Read 1998).  The Red Queen then leads
Alice directly to the top of the hill. Along the way, the Red
Queen explains that hills can become valleys, which confuses Alice.
Already, in this world, straight can become curvy, and progress
can be made only by going the opposite direction; now, according
to the Red Queen, hills can become valleys and valleys can become
hills.  At the top of the hill,
the Red Queen begins to run, faster and faster. Alice runs after
the Red Queen, but is further perplexed to find that neither one
seems to be moving. When they stop running, they are in exactly
the same place. Alice remarks on this, to which the Red Queen
responds: "Now, here , you see, it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place". And so it may
be with coevolution. Evolutionary change may be required to stay
in the same place. Cessation of change may result in extinction.    References  Carrol, L. 1872. Through

The first and second cards are not independent, but it doesn't matter because you don't care about the first card at all.

Now calculate the probability that either (first card is queen and second card  is queen) or (first card is not queen and second card is queen).

As those $13$ events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, their probabilities add up to one: $P(E_1)+P(E_2)+\cdots+P(E_{12})+P(E_{13})=1$. Now, if you can only manage to convince yourself that those probabilities are all equal, you can deduce that $P(E_{12})=\frac1{13}.$ Well, which do you think is more likely, getting a queen or getting a jack on the second draw? – bof  May 18 '15 at 9:39         7      As with the Monty Hall problem, it's useful to extend the logic to the extreme. What if you take 51 cards and then the last card? What's the chance that the last card is a queen? In general, what's the chance p(N) that the N'th card is a queen? Obviously after 52 cards you must have had 4 queens to the chances better add up to 4.0. If the chance p(N) would decrease with N, p(1) would be the biggest and p(52) the smallest, so p(0) must be greater than 1/13 ! – MSalters  May 18 '15 at 15:38        |  show 5 more comments          15 Answers 15     active  oldest  votes            up vote  63  down vote  accepted      There are two cases here:  Case 1: First card chosen is a queen  $$\frac{4}{52}*\frac{3}{51}=\frac{1}{221}$$  Case 2: First card chosen is not a queen.  $$\frac{48}{52}*\frac{4}{51}=\frac{16}{221}$$  Adding both the cases, we get $\frac{17}{221}$ = $\frac{4}{52}$ = $\frac{1}{13}$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 18 '15 at 5:02       marwalix   12.7k 1 21 36        answered May 18 '15 at 4:41       A.J.

The point of this answer is to get the reader to understand that in the absence of any information about the first card drawn, the second card drawn has an equal chance of being any card in the deck, just as in a shuffled deck the second card in the deck has an equal chance of being any card. – Hammerite  May 18 '15 at 11:06        3      This is a good way of looking at it. The probability of any card in the deck being a queen is 4/52. The probability over a high enough number of runs doesn't change after drawing any number of other cards first. If you add the probabilities of all the cards in the deck you get 4 which is obviously correct because there are four queens in the pack! What is confusing is that when you draw a card and look at it, you forget that there was the other possibility. – CJ Dennis  May 18 '15 at 12:11        add a comment |             up vote  32  down vote      A slightly more intuitive way of looking at this:  The probability that the second card is a queen should be the same as the probability that the second card is an ace, and the same as the probability that the second card is a 2 etc. There are $ 13 $ possibilities for the card number/letter, so the answer is $ \frac{1}{13} $     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 12:45       Esteemator   1,075 7 12              3      This is the cleverest answer I have seen to this question.

So the probability of getting each is the same. Similary the probability of getting any chosen value (4, 10 or King alike) at any pre-selected position (be it second or eleventh, or first or fifty-second) is the same. So for 13 possible values it is... what Cliff said. – CiaPan  May 19 '15 at 8:44        1      @Tony - If the first card is an ace, then it is less likely that the 2nd card is an ace. From a card player's perspective, that's true. But, what happens when the first card is not an ace? Then, it is more likely that the second card is an ace. 1/13th of the time the probability will go down, while 12/13ths of the time the probability will go up. In the end, the numbers cancel out, and we're back to 1/13th. A.J.'s answer has the actual values. – J.R.

You're interested in the probability that card B is a queen.  Now consider a different experiment: draw a pair of cards as before, but this time call the first one card B, and the second one card A. I claim that these two experiments are identical. The reason is that for any two cards X,Y, the probability to draw X then Y is the same as the probability to draw Y then X.  The second experiment makes it clear that the probability that card B is a queen is 4/52, since there are 4 queens out of 52 cards.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 5:14       Yuval Filmus   46.7k 3 67 140                  This is good.

Let's try a more feeling-based approach:   Take a deck of cards  Shuffle the cards  Flip over the second card of the deck and check if it is a queen, while leaving the first card on the deck   Perhaps you can see how the chance is the exact same ($\frac{4}{52}$) if you had picked the top card instead of the second to top. Chance, after all, does not play favorites between the two cards.  Then, consider the following set of actions:   Take a deck of cards  Shuffle the cards  Draw the first card  Draw the second card and check if it is a queen   Now, you should be able to see that the chances for the two cases are the exact same. After you shuffle the deck, it doesn't matter if you draw two cards and check the second or you just check the second card without looking at the first; if the second card is a queen, it's a queen, if it's not, it's not.  The flip side of the feeling-based approach is the math to back it up. Let's start with the simple case: you have 52 cards, and want a queen on the second draw. (This has also been done by other answers, but I'll repeat it here.)  You draw a queen on the second draw if:   You draw a queen on the first draw and one on the second
$$\frac{4}{52}*\frac{3}{51}=\frac{12}{2652}=\frac{1}{221}$$  You draw something other than a queen on the first draw and a queen on the second
$$\frac{48}{52}*\frac{4}{51}=\frac{192}{2652}=\frac{16}{221}$$   So in total, the chance is:  $$\frac{1}{221}+\frac{16}{221}=\frac{17}{221}=\frac{4}{52}$$  Now, let's up the ante a little bit. Rather than wanting to know something about queens in a complete deck, I want to know about the more general case. I have a pile of $n$ shuffled cards. In that pile, I know there are $p$ cards that I "like". What I want to know is: what is the chance I draw a card I like.  For the first card, it's simple. The chance simply is $\frac{p}{n}$.  For the second card, we once again have two options:   I like both the first and second card
$$\frac{p}{n}*\frac{p-1}{n-1}=\frac{p^2-p}{n^2-n}$$  I like the second card, but not the first
$$\frac{n - p}{n}*\frac{p}{n-1}=\frac{pn-p^2}{n^2-n}$$   Adding the two, you get:  $$\frac{p^2-p}{n^2-n}+\frac{pn-p^2}{n^2-n}=\frac{p^2+pn-p^2-p}{n^2-n}=\frac{pn-p}{n^2-n}$$  Moving things around a bit more:  $$\frac{pn-p}{n^2-n}=\frac{p(n-1)}{n(n-1)}=\frac{p}{n}$$  Which is the same as the chances for the first card. So, now I can say that no matter the deck size or the amount of cards that represent "success", it doesn't matter if I look to the first or second card to determine success. (Of course, if I look at the second card, it's important that I don't care what the first card is at all.)  I could actually repeat the experiment for each different card in the deck, and then I could draw the conclusion that in general: it doesn't matter if I look at the first or second card, the chances for the card to be a specific one are equal.  The next step could be to proof that the the other cards (third, fourth, etc) have the same chance as well, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.  Disclaimer: my proof probably isn't elegant, optimal or nice, but I do believe it to be correct.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '15 at 15:17             answered May 18 '15 at 15:21       Jasper   181 3                  As pointed out by user CiaPan, a simpler way to proceed after "Moving things around a bit more:" is $\dfrac{pn-p}{n^2 - n} = \dfrac{p(n-1)}{n(n-1)} = \dfrac{p}{n}$. – epimorphic  May 19 '15 at 13:38             To CiaPan: Simplifications are probably best communicated in the comments, given the prohibition against "drastic" edits to non-CW posts authored by others and given that one of the purposes of comments is to "suggest improvements".

If we observed that the first card drawn was a queen, then that would give us a lowered probability of the second card being a queen of $3/51$. However, this is not the same probability as the one asked of in the problem, but the conditional probability given the first card being a queen.  If we instead had had the first card not be a queen, then the conditional probability would have been heightened to $4/51$. The prior probability could then be calculated using the probability of both cases as $$\frac{4}{52}\cdot\frac{3}{51}+\frac{48}{52}\cdot\frac{4}{51}=\frac{4}{52}$$  However, the problem can be simplified as what is important isn't the drawing of the card from the deck, but the observation of the value of the card.  As the value of the first card is never considered in the problem, it can simply be considered as not being drawn at all, which brings us to a second point; If instead of drawing two cards from the deck, you simply fanned out the cards and drew the second card from the top, you would still get the same probabilities as if you chose the top card.  In fact, you would get the same probabilities even if you chose the tenth card or even a card at random. There is nothing special about the top card of the deck unless you choose to do something with it.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 19 '15 at 19:00       PassingStranger   171 3              add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      Consider a more complete event:  When drawing all 52 cards, what is the probability that the second card is a queen?  The reason of changing the original question to this is because this is an expanded process, in other words, if you do draw all cards you certainly drop the first two ones. To solve the new problem is not difficult. One way is to consider every card of the 52 has an equal chance be at the second place. So the probability is 4/52.  It is equal to the same probability that the first card, the 3rd card or the 27th card etc. is a queen, or any other type of card.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 9:02       Serena973   31 2                  If the first card you draw is a queen than the second has a different probability. – hownowbrowncow  May 18 '15 at 13:06            @hownowbrowncow - how, now? – GalacticCowboy  May 18 '15 at 14:13            @GalacticCowboy because then there would be 3 queens within the deck :D – hownowbrowncow  May 18 '15 at 14:21        1      @David  The author didn't specify that one would replace the drawn card back into the deck and therefore, I would assume, one would not.

What if the problem stated draw all cards and what is the probability that the last card drawn is a queen then what would your answer be? You might think it is close to 0 because in 51 cards drawn, there is a very good chance that all queens would be already drawn by then.  However, the answer should still be 4/52 because there are 4 queens in the deck and each has an equal chance of being the last card drawn just as all the other cards have.  Also, if you notice on TV when they have Texas Hold 'em, they "waste" the top card when drawing community cards (turn, river...) so if that changed the probability, it would likely be disallowed.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 11:46       David   318 8 30              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      Imagine you buy a ticket in a lottery, where a fraction $p$ of the tickets will win. (From the comments I gather that there are some people who are confused by all kinds of newfangled games with different rules, such as being able to compose the number on one's own ticket; I therefore emphasise this is just an old fashioned lottery with a fixed set of tickets established beforehand, all distinct and all sold before the drawing; drawing then determines a subset of the tickets as winners, with the size of that subset being $p$ times the total number of tickets.) What is your chance of winning? It would be hard to argue that it is anything other then $p$.  But now let us add that before buying a ticket, you had to wait in line, and you happen to notice that the person before you also bought a ticket for the same lottery. Of course you don't know whether her ticket will win, but what is the chance that your ticket will win? It is still $p$. But what if her ticket actually wins? Well with that new information your chances will no doubt be less, but you don't have that information. If her ticket actually looses, that will slightly improve your odds, but you don't know that either. In fact you can be sure that there are hundreds of people who also bought tickets, but as long as you know nothing about their results (and you won't until the winning lots are drawn), it will not affect your chances the slightest bit.  The situation you describe is entirely similar to this.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '15 at 12:28             answered May 18 '15 at 10:34       Marc van Leeuwen   83.1k 4 88 200                  Why would my chances of winning a lottery be less if I know the person in front of me in line already won?  Many lotteries share the jackpot if there are multiple winners.  In that case, my winnings will be reduced but not my chance of winning.  Also if that person loses it will not increase my chance of winning at all. The only exception is if I choose the same numbers as some other person in a lottery (such as 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30). Then if I know that person won then my chances of winning are likely affected (depending on the type of lottery).

For example, if people put their name on a piece of paper and place it into a container to be drawn.  It would depend if they fold it and how and also when they put it in the container since they may not be mixed well before being drawn.

Obviously if I know another ticket that wins, that will decrease the chances that my ticket too is among the winners (in an extreme example there is only one winning ticket, and knowing another ticket wins ensures tha mine won't; but even if there are say 2 wins out of 100, then $\frac1{99}$ is worse than $p=\frac2{100}$). I don't know what kind of lottery you are thinking of that would not see my chances diminished by knowing a winner that is not my ticket. – Marc van Leeuwen  May 18 '15 at 12:55             @David: Re-reading what you wrote, I really cannot see what you are worrying about, you must have a strange idea of a lottery. It is not about writing anything on tickets, or putting them in a container, and there cannot be "identical" tickets. Tickets are simply a fixed known collection, say numbers $1$ to $n$, and when all are sold then some $k$ of these numbers are "drawn" (from a separate copy of those numbers) to be winning numbers. The chance of winning with one ticket is $p=\frac kn$. Also  I don't see what complaining about biased-ness in real-world lotteries has to do with this. – Marc van Leeuwen  May 18 '15 at 13:10         |  show 3 more comments            up vote  1  down vote      put the first card back in the deck; now you've only drawn one card. the chance it's queen 4/52     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 17:57       Thanos Tintinidis   257 1 5              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Can I convince you of this statement:  If I draw two cards, the probability that the first card is a queen is the same as the probability that the second card is a queen.  If you believe this, then your question has the same probability as the following the situation:  What is the probability that, if I draw two cards, the first card is a queen?  It is clear now that the second card pull in this case has no effect on the first, just as how the first card pull has no effect on the second in your case.  So the problem breaks down into:  What is the probability that, if I draw a card from a standard deck, the card is a queen?  which of course is $\frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 19 '15 at 19:10       MCT   13.9k 4 23 61              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Let us find out, the $E$ be the event of drawing a queen in the second draw. Let $X_1$ be the event of drawing a queen at the first draw and $X_2$ is a card other than queen in the first draw. So the total probability is $P(E|X_1)+P(E|X_2)= 4/52*3/51+48/52*4/51=4/52$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 4:42       baharampuri   830 6 15              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Key word is independent.  Probability of nth card being a queen is 4/52.  The question is to teach independent .  Which means that the chances don't change because of the first draw . (whatever card is drawn , it should be put back in the stack) otherwise the second draw is dependent on the first draw.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '15 at 21:04       Willemien   3,351 2 17 57        answered May 18 '15 at 21:32       Scott   9 1              1      How is independence used in this question or answer? – JiK  May 19 '15 at 10:49        add a comment |             up vote  -3  down vote      This is basically the Monty Hall problem -- as long as you are talking in advance of the draw, the probability is unchanged, once you draw the odds adjust.  You have two goats and a car, if you open two doors, what is the chance that there is a goat behind the second door?  What is the chance it is a car? 2/3 and 1/3 respectively.  After you open the first door, and find that it is a car, you can say that there is zero chance that there is a car behind the second door.  But at that point, they are no longer independent events, which is why in the Monty Hall problem you always switch.  In this case you are effectively saying that the second card is a queen, and you are doing this before you know what the first card was . The chance that that is correct is 1/13.  It (the chance you were correct) will remain 1 in 13 until either the second card is revealed or the position of all queens have been determined, at which point it is not a matter of probability.  In both cases the odds of you having identified the card is unchanged, what changes is the current odds of that card being a queen (ie is this one of the 1 in 13 times where you were correct).  This is where people go wrong with the Monty Hall problem, they confuse the current odds of the car being behind the door with the odds that they correctly identified the door with the car.  In this instance the confusion is between having identified the card vs the card actually being.  Here's another way of looking at it.  Your odds of correctly predicting card 2 is 1 in 13.  So take 4 decks of cards, divide them into 13 rows by   suit (throwing away the 3 extra suits).  Then pick a value for the 2nd card in each row.  Now start randomly revealing cards until each row has been determined -- do you expect this random reveal to result in you having correctly guessed more than the expected 1 row?  Is it any different from just revealing the 2nd card of each row?  Now, suppose that someone who knows what the cards are does the reveal, revealing each card  until there are only 2 cards left per row -- when you do the final reveal for each row, how many rows would you expect to have guessed correctly?  Your chance of predicting the card in advance is 1 in 13 for each row, and it remains 1 in 13 -- revealing cards doesn't change the odds of your having guessed correctly. Your guess is in the past and is now fixed, forever unchanging .  Either it was right or it wasn't.   What changes (assuming random reveal) is my current odds of guessing whether you were right or not .  As with the related Deal Or No Deal game, I get additional information with each random reveal.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 5 '17 at 12:30             answered May 18 '15 at 15:04       jmoreno   341 1 6              2      You start by saying that this is basically the Monty Hall problem, and then you explain that the Monty Hall problem is different from this. I don't understand your explanation; in the Monty Hall problem, no doors with a car are opened first. – JiK  May 19 '15 at 10:52            @JiK: The surface elements, cards vs goats, and the number of items, 3 vs 52 are different, but the basic "probability of original guess remains unchanged despite wrong guesses being removed" is the same. – jmoreno  Nov 5 '17 at 12:43        add a comment |             up vote  -6  down vote      I would think it would be slightly below 1/13 since 1/13 is the probability for the first pick being a queen then the second round should account for the possibility of there only being 3 queens in the deck.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 14:58       tHemAcHoNe   1              2      As noted, the same logic holds for a jack, so it's chance also would have to be < 1/13 because there might be only  3 jacks left. That means the chance of drawing any second card are <1.0 - it literally doesn't add up. – MSalters  May 18 '15 at 15:34        add a comment |         protected by Zev Chonoles  May 19 '15 at 19:06   Thank you for your interest in this question.

So now, regarding your answer to the problem about the first red queen in the deck, I have to ask: Have you lost your mind? (July 11, 2010) The two red queens are as likely to be in positions #51 and #52 as anywhere else. Thus, the first card has a 1 in 51 chance of being the first red queen, as does the second card, and the third, etc. In other words, every one of the first 51 cards has a 1 in 51 chance of being the first red queen. Please tell me I’m wrong, and that you’ve still got it. If not, I want your job.  Marilyn responds: You’re wrong. Maybe the following letters will help to convince you.  Ken Rimer of Fairfax, Virginia, writes:         Marilyn: When you get thousands of emails saying that you are wrong about the first red queen problem, please publish my explanation: If you were to make a list of all the possible decks, noting the position of the two red queens, the list containing red queens at #51, #52 would be the shortest. The next would contain #50, #51 and #50, #52. The list containing #1, #2 would be the longest list of all, with one more entry than the list starting with #2, #3  #2, #4  #2, #5, etc. Ray Gallucci of Frederick, Maryland, writes:  Marilyn: A math explanation of your card problem follows: The probability of the first card being one of the two red queens is 2/52 (= 1/26). The probability of the second, but not the first, being a red queen is 2/51 x 50/52 = 1/26 x 50/51 because there are 50 other cards that could be the first. For the third card, but neither the first nor second, to be a red queen, the probability is 2/50 x 50/52 x 49/51 = 1/26 x 49/51 because there are 50 other cards that could be the first, then 49 that could be the second. For the fourth card, 2/49 x 50/52 x 49/51 x 48/50 = 1/26 x 48/51. The recursion formula for the nth card being the first red queen becomes 1/26 x (52-N)/51, N = 1 through 51. Thus, as you indicated, the maximum probability occurs for the first card (1/26), and the minimum probability for the 51st card (1/26 x 1/51).                      Leave A Comment      Uh-oh!

<       SEARCH  HOME       Math Central Quandaries & Queries          Question from tabyia, a student:  The common deck of 52 cards has 26 black cards (13 spades and 13 clubs) and 26 red cards (13 hearts and 13 diamonds).  Each suit consists of ace, king, queen, jack, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three and deuce.  13in all.  A single card is chosen at random.  Find the odds against its being a red queen?  How many cards will I have to draw to be absolutely certain that I have drawn three black cards       Tabyia,  I'm going to find the odds against drawing a jack.  There are 4 jacks in the deck of 52 cards so the probability of of drawing a jack is 4/52 = 1/13. Hence the probability of not drawing a jack is 1 - (1/13) = 12/13. Therefore, in the long run, if you select a card many times you expect that, on the average, 12 of every 13 times you don't draw a jack and 1 of every 13 times you do draw a jack. Thus the odds against selecting a jack is 12:1. (This is read as 12 to 1.)  Use the same procedure to find the odds against drawing a red queen.  Harley                Math Central is supported by the University of Regina and The Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences.             SOLUTION: How do you solve:

This type of information is of little use to the working performer. The answer is likely much more complex than I am thinking, and perhaps be directed to someone like Persi Diaconis. The short answer is with 52 cards in a standard deck, the odds of choosing any one specific cards is one in 52. It seems to me that opening the parameters to select one of a kind e.g., any of the kings, from a standard deck is 4 in 52. I guess the odds of picking a different specific value, i.e., Queens, afterwards is 4 in 51. Jacks would be 4 in 50. There is likely some other factor involved that bigger brains than mine can help direct you. 2.2k Views · Answer requested by  Thomas Cook promoted  by Wharton Executive Education Learn business analytics online with Wharton Executive Education.

There are 52 cards total in the deck. The probability of getting a queen first would be [math]\frac{4}{52}[/math] , but since we want to know the probability of getting a king after that assuming the queen wasn’t replaced, all we need to do is multiply it out: P(king | queen not replaced) = [math]\frac{4}{52} * \frac{4}{51} = \frac{16}{2652}[/math] We get [math]\frac{4}{51}[/math] for the second fraction because there are still 4 kings in the deck, but since the queen wasn’t put back in the pile, it reduces the number of cards in the deck by one, giving us 51. Reducing the result we get: [math]\frac{4}{663}[/math] . 1.2k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions What is the probability of successive drawing of an ace, king, queen, and a jack from a pack of 52 cards?

"Neither card is red" is the same as "both cards are black".\nThe probability that the first card is black is 26 out of 52, or 1/2.  Given that the first card is black, there are 51 cards remaining, of which 25 are black; thus the conditional probability that the second card is also black is 25/51.  The probability that both cards are black is the product of these two probabilities: 1/2 * 25/51 = 25/102, or about 24.51%.            Is there 52 cards in a pack without joker?

[original answer] four in 52!    ====    The question is not fully stated, but I assume what is being asked is "What are the chances of pulling all four aces out of 52 cards when four cards are drawn".     The answer is 1 / 270725 = 0.00000369 = 0.000369%. Approximately four out of one million.     The chances are (4*3*2*1) / (52*51*50*49) = 24 / 649700 = 1 / 270725. That is, on the first draw there is a 4/52 chance of drawing one of the four aces out of the full pack; In the 48 out of 52 cases where an ace isn't drawn, "you lose".   In the 4/52 cases where an ace is drawn first, there is a 3/51 chance of drawing one of the remaining three aces from the remaining 51 cards. If that happens, there is a 2/50 chance of drawing one of the remaining two aces from the remaining 50 cards; and then a 1/49 chance of drawing the last ace out of the remaining 49 cards.   [ If the question is "What are the chances of pulling any of the aces out of 52 cards in one draw" then "four in 52" is correct. ]               Alex146  49,465 Contributions      What are the chances that you get 2 red cards and then a black card dealt randomly out of a 52 card deck?  The probability of getting a red card out of a standard 52 card deck is 26 in 52, or 0.5.. 
The probability of getting a second red card is 25 in 51, or 0.490, because one red card is missing, and the deck is short by one card.. 
The probability of getting a black card next is 26 in 50, or 0.52, because the deck is short by two cards, but all the black cards are there.. 
Multiply these probabilities together, and you get about 0.127, or about 1 in 8, so the probability of getting 2 red cards and then a black card in a random 52 card deck is about 1 in 8.

What are the chances of not picking a club out of 52 cards?  One quarter of the pack are CLUB cards. Three quarters of the pack are NOT CLUB cards. So the chance (probability) of picking a CLUB card is 1 out of 4  =  0.25 The chance (probability) of picking a NOT CLUB card is 3 out of 4  =  0.75 Adding the various probabilities the answer must always be 1.0, which is true here. If the probability of something happening is 1.0, that means the probability is "certainty". It is bound to happen.

The probability is 0 if you pick the the card from one end of a mint pack (2 of clubs) and 1 if you pick it from the other end (A spades). Also, if you pick 49 cards without replacement, the probability is 1.  So, the answer depends on how many cards are drawn, and whether or not they are drawn from a well shuffled pack. The probability of getting an ace when one card is randomly picked from a pack is 4/52 = 1/13.

Queen Hypothesis. --The "Red Queen"
hypothesis is used to describe two similar ideas, which are both
based on coevolution. The original idea is that coevolution could
lead to situations for which the probability of extinction is
relatively constant over millions of years (Van Valen 1973). The
gist of the idea is that, in tightly coevolved interactions, evolutionary
change by one species (e.g., a prey or host) could lead to extinction
of other species (e.g. a predator or parasite), and that the probability
of such changes might be reasonably independent of species age.
Van Valen named the idea "the Red Queen hypothesis,"
because, under this view, species had to "run" (evolve)
in order to stay in the same place (extant). ( Show
me the data. )  The other idea is that
coevolution, particularly between hosts and parasites, could lead
to sustained oscillations in genotype frequencies (Fig. 1). This
idea forms the core for one of the leading hypotheses for the
persistence of sexual reproduction see Bell 1982). In species
where asexual reproduction is possible (as in many plants and
invertebrates), coevolutionary interactions with parasites may
select for sexual reproduction in hosts as a way to reduce the
risk of infection in offspring. There have been many important
contributors to the Red Queen hypothesis as it applies to sex.
W.D. Hamilton and John Jaenike were among the earliest pioneers
of the idea.       Figure 1. Red Queen dynamics: results from a computer simulation for host-parasite
      coevolution. The blue line gives the frequency of one host genotype;
      the red line gives the frequency of the parasite genotype that
      can infect it. Note that both genotypes oscillate over time,
      as if they were "running" in circles. The model assumes
      that hosts have self-nonself recognition systems, which can detect
      foreign organisms. The model also assumes that hosts and parasites
      both reproduce sexually.     The phrase "Red
Queen hypothesis" comes from Chapter 2 in Through the Looking
Glass (Carroll 1872). In Alice's dream about the looking glass
house, she first finds that things appear left-to-right, as if
shown in a mirror. She then finds that chess pieces are alive.
She will later encounter several of these pieces (most notably
the Red Queen), after she leaves the looking glass house to see
the garden.  Alice decides that it
would be easier to see the garden if she first climbs the hill,
to which there appears to be a very straight path. However, as
she follows the path, she finds that it leads her back to the
house. When she tries to speed up, she not only returns to the
house, she crashes into it. Hence, forward movement takes Alice
back to her starting point (Red Queen dynamics), and rapid movement
causes abrupt stops (extinction).  Eventually, Alice finds
herself in a patch of very vocal and opinionated flowers; the
rose is especially vocal. The flowers tell Alice that someone
like her (the Red Queen) often passes through, and Alice decides
to seek this person, mostly as a way to escape more verbal abuse.
When Alice spots the Red Queen, she begins moving toward her.
But, the Red Queen quickly disappears from sight. Alice decides
to follow the advice of the rose, and go the other way ("I
should advise you to walk the other way"). Immediately she
comes face-to-face with the Red Queen (see Lythgoe and Read 1998).  The Red Queen then leads
Alice directly to the top of the hill. Along the way, the Red
Queen explains that hills can become valleys, which confuses Alice.
Already, in this world, straight can become curvy, and progress
can be made only by going the opposite direction; now, according
to the Red Queen, hills can become valleys and valleys can become
hills.  At the top of the hill,
the Red Queen begins to run, faster and faster. Alice runs after
the Red Queen, but is further perplexed to find that neither one
seems to be moving. When they stop running, they are in exactly
the same place. Alice remarks on this, to which the Red Queen
responds: "Now, here , you see, it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place". And so it may
be with coevolution. Evolutionary change may be required to stay
in the same place. Cessation of change may result in extinction.    References  Carrol, L. 1872. Through

The first and second cards are not independent, but it doesn't matter because you don't care about the first card at all.

As those $13$ events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, their probabilities add up to one: $P(E_1)+P(E_2)+\cdots+P(E_{12})+P(E_{13})=1$. Now, if you can only manage to convince yourself that those probabilities are all equal, you can deduce that $P(E_{12})=\frac1{13}.$ Well, which do you think is more likely, getting a queen or getting a jack on the second draw? – bof  May 18 '15 at 9:39         7      As with the Monty Hall problem, it's useful to extend the logic to the extreme. What if you take 51 cards and then the last card? What's the chance that the last card is a queen? In general, what's the chance p(N) that the N'th card is a queen? Obviously after 52 cards you must have had 4 queens to the chances better add up to 4.0. If the chance p(N) would decrease with N, p(1) would be the biggest and p(52) the smallest, so p(0) must be greater than 1/13 ! – MSalters  May 18 '15 at 15:38        |  show 5 more comments          15 Answers 15     active  oldest  votes            up vote  63  down vote  accepted      There are two cases here:  Case 1: First card chosen is a queen  $$\frac{4}{52}*\frac{3}{51}=\frac{1}{221}$$  Case 2: First card chosen is not a queen.  $$\frac{48}{52}*\frac{4}{51}=\frac{16}{221}$$  Adding both the cases, we get $\frac{17}{221}$ = $\frac{4}{52}$ = $\frac{1}{13}$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 18 '15 at 5:02       marwalix   12.7k 1 21 36        answered May 18 '15 at 4:41       A.J.

The point of this answer is to get the reader to understand that in the absence of any information about the first card drawn, the second card drawn has an equal chance of being any card in the deck, just as in a shuffled deck the second card in the deck has an equal chance of being any card. – Hammerite  May 18 '15 at 11:06        3      This is a good way of looking at it. The probability of any card in the deck being a queen is 4/52. The probability over a high enough number of runs doesn't change after drawing any number of other cards first. If you add the probabilities of all the cards in the deck you get 4 which is obviously correct because there are four queens in the pack! What is confusing is that when you draw a card and look at it, you forget that there was the other possibility. – CJ Dennis  May 18 '15 at 12:11        add a comment |             up vote  32  down vote      A slightly more intuitive way of looking at this:  The probability that the second card is a queen should be the same as the probability that the second card is an ace, and the same as the probability that the second card is a 2 etc. There are $ 13 $ possibilities for the card number/letter, so the answer is $ \frac{1}{13} $     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 12:45       Esteemator   1,075 7 12              3      This is the cleverest answer I have seen to this question.

So the probability of getting each is the same. Similary the probability of getting any chosen value (4, 10 or King alike) at any pre-selected position (be it second or eleventh, or first or fifty-second) is the same. So for 13 possible values it is... what Cliff said. – CiaPan  May 19 '15 at 8:44        1      @Tony - If the first card is an ace, then it is less likely that the 2nd card is an ace. From a card player's perspective, that's true. But, what happens when the first card is not an ace? Then, it is more likely that the second card is an ace. 1/13th of the time the probability will go down, while 12/13ths of the time the probability will go up. In the end, the numbers cancel out, and we're back to 1/13th. A.J.'s answer has the actual values. – J.R.

You're interested in the probability that card B is a queen.  Now consider a different experiment: draw a pair of cards as before, but this time call the first one card B, and the second one card A. I claim that these two experiments are identical. The reason is that for any two cards X,Y, the probability to draw X then Y is the same as the probability to draw Y then X.  The second experiment makes it clear that the probability that card B is a queen is 4/52, since there are 4 queens out of 52 cards.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 5:14       Yuval Filmus   46.7k 3 67 140                  This is good.

Let's try a more feeling-based approach:   Take a deck of cards  Shuffle the cards  Flip over the second card of the deck and check if it is a queen, while leaving the first card on the deck   Perhaps you can see how the chance is the exact same ($\frac{4}{52}$) if you had picked the top card instead of the second to top. Chance, after all, does not play favorites between the two cards.  Then, consider the following set of actions:   Take a deck of cards  Shuffle the cards  Draw the first card  Draw the second card and check if it is a queen   Now, you should be able to see that the chances for the two cases are the exact same. After you shuffle the deck, it doesn't matter if you draw two cards and check the second or you just check the second card without looking at the first; if the second card is a queen, it's a queen, if it's not, it's not.  The flip side of the feeling-based approach is the math to back it up. Let's start with the simple case: you have 52 cards, and want a queen on the second draw. (This has also been done by other answers, but I'll repeat it here.)  You draw a queen on the second draw if:   You draw a queen on the first draw and one on the second
$$\frac{4}{52}*\frac{3}{51}=\frac{12}{2652}=\frac{1}{221}$$  You draw something other than a queen on the first draw and a queen on the second
$$\frac{48}{52}*\frac{4}{51}=\frac{192}{2652}=\frac{16}{221}$$   So in total, the chance is:  $$\frac{1}{221}+\frac{16}{221}=\frac{17}{221}=\frac{4}{52}$$  Now, let's up the ante a little bit. Rather than wanting to know something about queens in a complete deck, I want to know about the more general case. I have a pile of $n$ shuffled cards. In that pile, I know there are $p$ cards that I "like". What I want to know is: what is the chance I draw a card I like.  For the first card, it's simple. The chance simply is $\frac{p}{n}$.  For the second card, we once again have two options:   I like both the first and second card
$$\frac{p}{n}*\frac{p-1}{n-1}=\frac{p^2-p}{n^2-n}$$  I like the second card, but not the first
$$\frac{n - p}{n}*\frac{p}{n-1}=\frac{pn-p^2}{n^2-n}$$   Adding the two, you get:  $$\frac{p^2-p}{n^2-n}+\frac{pn-p^2}{n^2-n}=\frac{p^2+pn-p^2-p}{n^2-n}=\frac{pn-p}{n^2-n}$$  Moving things around a bit more:  $$\frac{pn-p}{n^2-n}=\frac{p(n-1)}{n(n-1)}=\frac{p}{n}$$  Which is the same as the chances for the first card. So, now I can say that no matter the deck size or the amount of cards that represent "success", it doesn't matter if I look to the first or second card to determine success. (Of course, if I look at the second card, it's important that I don't care what the first card is at all.)  I could actually repeat the experiment for each different card in the deck, and then I could draw the conclusion that in general: it doesn't matter if I look at the first or second card, the chances for the card to be a specific one are equal.  The next step could be to proof that the the other cards (third, fourth, etc) have the same chance as well, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.  Disclaimer: my proof probably isn't elegant, optimal or nice, but I do believe it to be correct.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '15 at 15:17             answered May 18 '15 at 15:21       Jasper   181 3                  As pointed out by user CiaPan, a simpler way to proceed after "Moving things around a bit more:" is $\dfrac{pn-p}{n^2 - n} = \dfrac{p(n-1)}{n(n-1)} = \dfrac{p}{n}$. – epimorphic  May 19 '15 at 13:38             To CiaPan: Simplifications are probably best communicated in the comments, given the prohibition against "drastic" edits to non-CW posts authored by others and given that one of the purposes of comments is to "suggest improvements".

If we observed that the first card drawn was a queen, then that would give us a lowered probability of the second card being a queen of $3/51$. However, this is not the same probability as the one asked of in the problem, but the conditional probability given the first card being a queen.  If we instead had had the first card not be a queen, then the conditional probability would have been heightened to $4/51$. The prior probability could then be calculated using the probability of both cases as $$\frac{4}{52}\cdot\frac{3}{51}+\frac{48}{52}\cdot\frac{4}{51}=\frac{4}{52}$$  However, the problem can be simplified as what is important isn't the drawing of the card from the deck, but the observation of the value of the card.  As the value of the first card is never considered in the problem, it can simply be considered as not being drawn at all, which brings us to a second point; If instead of drawing two cards from the deck, you simply fanned out the cards and drew the second card from the top, you would still get the same probabilities as if you chose the top card.  In fact, you would get the same probabilities even if you chose the tenth card or even a card at random. There is nothing special about the top card of the deck unless you choose to do something with it.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 19 '15 at 19:00       PassingStranger   171 3              add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      Consider a more complete event:  When drawing all 52 cards, what is the probability that the second card is a queen?  The reason of changing the original question to this is because this is an expanded process, in other words, if you do draw all cards you certainly drop the first two ones. To solve the new problem is not difficult. One way is to consider every card of the 52 has an equal chance be at the second place. So the probability is 4/52.  It is equal to the same probability that the first card, the 3rd card or the 27th card etc. is a queen, or any other type of card.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 9:02       Serena973   31 2                  If the first card you draw is a queen than the second has a different probability. – hownowbrowncow  May 18 '15 at 13:06            @hownowbrowncow - how, now? – GalacticCowboy  May 18 '15 at 14:13            @GalacticCowboy because then there would be 3 queens within the deck :D – hownowbrowncow  May 18 '15 at 14:21        1      @David  The author didn't specify that one would replace the drawn card back into the deck and therefore, I would assume, one would not.  Thus changing the probability with each additional drawing of a card (the second draw would also have 51 cards within the deck, btw).  Perhaps there is replacement and perfect shuffling after every draw then it's 4/52 all the way down the line. – hownowbrowncow  May 18 '15 at 14:27         1      @hownowbrowncow - A.J.'s answer demonstrates that, even if you consider the first card, the overall probability of card #2 being a queen is still the same. – GalacticCowboy  May 18 '15 at 14:31        |  show 1 more comment            up vote  3  down vote      2 things to consider.  What if the problem stated draw all cards and what is the probability that the last card drawn is a queen then what would your answer be? You might think it is close to 0 because in 51 cards drawn, there is a very good chance that all queens would be already drawn by then.  However, the answer should still be 4/52 because there are 4 queens in the deck and each has an equal chance of being the last card drawn just as all the other cards have.  Also, if you notice on TV when they have Texas Hold 'em, they "waste" the top card when drawing community cards (turn, river...) so if that changed the probability, it would likely be disallowed.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 11:46       David   318 8 30              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      Imagine you buy a ticket in a lottery, where a fraction $p$ of the tickets will win. (From the comments I gather that there are some people who are confused by all kinds of newfangled games with different rules, such as being able to compose the number on one's own ticket; I therefore emphasise this is just an old fashioned lottery with a fixed set of tickets established beforehand, all distinct and all sold before the drawing; drawing then determines a subset of the tickets as winners, with the size of that subset being $p$ times the total number of tickets.) What is your chance of winning? It would be hard to argue that it is anything other then $p$.  But now let us add that before buying a ticket, you had to wait in line, and you happen to notice that the person before you also bought a ticket for the same lottery. Of course you don't know whether her ticket will win, but what is the chance that your ticket will win? It is still $p$. But what if her ticket actually wins? Well with that new information your chances will no doubt be less, but you don't have that information. If her ticket actually looses, that will slightly improve your odds, but you don't know that either. In fact you can be sure that there are hundreds of people who also bought tickets, but as long as you know nothing about their results (and you won't until the winning lots are drawn), it will not affect your chances the slightest bit.  The situation you describe is entirely similar to this.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 19 '15 at 12:28             answered May 18 '15 at 10:34       Marc van Leeuwen   83.1k 4 88 200                  Why would my chances of winning a lottery be less if I know the person in front of me in line already won?  Many lotteries share the jackpot if there are multiple winners.  In that case, my winnings will be reduced but not my chance of winning.  Also if that person loses it will not increase my chance of winning at all. The only exception is if I choose the same numbers as some other person in a lottery (such as 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30). Then if I know that person won then my chances of winning are likely affected (depending on the type of lottery).  You didn't say a fixed fraction will win. – David  May 18 '15 at 11:38             It wouldn't be p if the lottery/drawing is biased (which some are).  For example, if people put their name on a piece of paper and place it into a container to be drawn.  It would depend if they fold it and how and also when they put it in the container since they may not be mixed well before being drawn.  I've actually seen this happen in real life where some last minute entry won because they were not mixed well and they just drew her name from the top. – David  May 18 '15 at 11:51            @David "Imagine you buy a ticket in a lottery, where a fraction p of the tickets will win." <-> "You didn't say a fixed fraction will win." Please elaborate. – Alexander  May 18 '15 at 12:18            @David: I'm using a very simple lottery model, where all tickets are sold, and then a fraction $p$ is drawn as winning lots. Obviously if I know another ticket that wins, that will decrease the chances that my ticket too is among the winners (in an extreme example there is only one winning ticket, and knowing another ticket wins ensures tha mine won't; but even if there are say 2 wins out of 100, then $\frac1{99}$ is worse than $p=\frac2{100}$). I don't know what kind of lottery you are thinking of that would not see my chances diminished by knowing a winner that is not my ticket. – Marc van Leeuwen  May 18 '15 at 12:55             @David: Re-reading what you wrote, I really cannot see what you are worrying about, you must have a strange idea of a lottery. It is not about writing anything on tickets, or putting them in a container, and there cannot be "identical" tickets. Tickets are simply a fixed known collection, say numbers $1$ to $n$, and when all are sold then some $k$ of these numbers are "drawn" (from a separate copy of those numbers) to be winning numbers. The chance of winning with one ticket is $p=\frac kn$. Also  I don't see what complaining about biased-ness in real-world lotteries has to do with this. – Marc van Leeuwen  May 18 '15 at 13:10         |  show 3 more comments            up vote  1  down vote      put the first card back in the deck; now you've only drawn one card. the chance it's queen 4/52     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 18 '15 at 17:57       Thanos Tintinidis   257 1 5              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Can I convince you of this statement:  If I draw two cards, the probability that the first card is a queen is the same as the probability that the second card is a queen.  If you believe this, then your question has the same probability as the following the situation:  What is the probability that, if I draw two cards, the first card is a queen?  It is clear now that the second card pull in this case has no effect on the first, just as how the first card pull has no effect on the second in your case.

You have two goats and a car, if you open two doors, what is the chance that there is a goat behind the second door?  What is the chance it is a car? 2/3 and 1/3 respectively.  After you open the first door, and find that it is a car, you can say that there is zero chance that there is a car behind the second door.  But at that point, they are no longer independent events, which is why in the Monty Hall problem you always switch.  In this case you are effectively saying that the second card is a queen, and you are doing this before you know what the first card was . The chance that that is correct is 1/13.  It (the chance you were correct) will remain 1 in 13 until either the second card is revealed or the position of all queens have been determined, at which point it is not a matter of probability.  In both cases the odds of you having identified the card is unchanged, what changes is the current odds of that card being a queen (ie is this one of the 1 in 13 times where you were correct).  This is where people go wrong with the Monty Hall problem, they confuse the current odds of the car being behind the door with the odds that they correctly identified the door with the car.  In this instance the confusion is between having identified the card vs the card actually being.  Here's another way of looking at it.  Your odds of correctly predicting card 2 is 1 in 13.  So take 4 decks of cards, divide them into 13 rows by   suit (throwing away the 3 extra suits).  Then pick a value for the 2nd card in each row.  Now start randomly revealing cards until each row has been determined -- do you expect this random reveal to result in you having correctly guessed more than the expected 1 row?  Is it any different from just revealing the 2nd card of each row?  Now, suppose that someone who knows what the cards are does the reveal, revealing each card  until there are only 2 cards left per row -- when you do the final reveal for each row, how many rows would you expect to have guessed correctly?  Your chance of predicting the card in advance is 1 in 13 for each row, and it remains 1 in 13 -- revealing cards doesn't change the odds of your having guessed correctly. Your guess is in the past and is now fixed, forever unchanging .  Either it was right or it wasn't.   What changes (assuming random reveal) is my current odds of guessing whether you were right or not .  As with the related Deal Or No Deal game, I get additional information with each random reveal.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 5 '17 at 12:30             answered May 18 '15 at 15:04       jmoreno   341 1 6              2      You start by saying that this is basically the Monty Hall problem, and then you explain that the Monty Hall problem is different from this.

So now, regarding your answer to the problem about the first red queen in the deck, I have to ask: Have you lost your mind? (July 11, 2010) The two red queens are as likely to be in positions #51 and #52 as anywhere else. Thus, the first card has a 1 in 51 chance of being the first red queen, as does the second card, and the third, etc. In other words, every one of the first 51 cards has a 1 in 51 chance of being the first red queen. Please tell me I’m wrong, and that you’ve still got it. If not, I want your job.  Marilyn responds: You’re wrong. Maybe the following letters will help to convince you.  Ken Rimer of Fairfax, Virginia, writes:         Marilyn: When you get thousands of emails saying that you are wrong about the first red queen problem, please publish my explanation: If you were to make a list of all the possible decks, noting the position of the two red queens, the list containing red queens at #51, #52 would be the shortest. The next would contain #50, #51 and #50, #52. The list containing #1, #2 would be the longest list of all, with one more entry than the list starting with #2, #3  #2, #4  #2, #5, etc. Ray Gallucci of Frederick, Maryland, writes:  Marilyn: A math explanation of your card problem follows: The probability of the first card being one of the two red queens is 2/52 (= 1/26). The probability of the second, but not the first, being a red queen is 2/51 x 50/52 = 1/26 x 50/51 because there are 50 other cards that could be the first. For the third card, but neither the first nor second, to be a red queen, the probability is 2/50 x 50/52 x 49/51 = 1/26 x 49/51 because there are 50 other cards that could be the first, then 49 that could be the second. For the fourth card, 2/49 x 50/52 x 49/51 x 48/50 = 1/26 x 48/51. The recursion formula for the nth card being the first red queen becomes 1/26 x (52-N)/51, N = 1 through 51. Thus, as you indicated, the maximum probability occurs for the first card (1/26), and the minimum probability for the 51st card (1/26 x 1/51).                      Leave A Comment      Uh-oh!
