      Why Evolution Is True       « Hitchens fêted in London  Another paper on “symbiotic speciation” by Donald Williamson is retracted »    What’s the probability that you exist?   Ali Binazir went to a Tedx talk in San Francisco and heard some probabilities being bandied about that he considered dubious:  One of the talks was by Mel Robbins , a riotously funny self-help author and life coach with a syndicated radio show.  In it, she mentioned that scientists calculate the probability of your existing as you, today, at about one in 400 trillion (4×10 14 ).  “That’s a pretty big number,” I thought to myself.  If I had 400 trillion pennies to my name, I could probably retire.  Previously, I had heard the Buddhist version of the probability of ‘this precious incarnation’.  Imagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean and there is exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere.  The probability that you came about and exist today is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water — into the middle of that life preserver. On one try.  Like a good skeptic, Binazir first calculated the turtle-head-into-life-preserver probability, making due allowances for the area of the world’s oceans and the area of the hole in a life preserver. That turns out to be 1 in 6.82×10 14 , or about 1 in 700 trillion. Pretty close to the probability-that-you-exist-figure.  But when Binazir calculated the second figure, he found out that Robbins was off. Way off. But Binazir made that calculation, too, which of course involves some ancillary assumptions and calculations. The probability that you’d exist on Earth today includes the probability that your parents would meet 20 years ago, that they’d have a relationship that would result in pregnancy, and of course that the right egg would meet the right sperm.  But it also includes the probability that your parents would also have existed with the genes they have, which means calculating that every one of your ancestors would have reproduced successfully , and that for each pair of them the right egg would have met the right sperm as well.  He comes up with this probability that you’d exist (by “you”, of course, he means those individuals resulting from the concatenation of a sperm and egg genetically to those who formed your zygote:  Probability of your existing at all: 1 in 10 2,685,000  As a comparison, the number of atoms in the body of an average male (80kg, 175 lb) is 10 27 .  The number of atoms making up the earth is about 10 50 .  The number of atoms in the known universe is estimated at 10 80 .  So what’s the probability of your existing?  It’s the probability of 2 million people getting together – about the population of San Diego – each to play a game of dice with trillion-sided dice. They each roll the dice, and they all come up the exact same number – say, 550,343,279,001.  A miracle is an event so unlikely as to be almost impossible.  By that definition, I’ve just shown that you are a miracle.  Now go forth and feel and act like the miracle that you are.  Well, somebody’s going to point out to me that although the specific genetic “you” who exists is improbable, the probability that some you, that is, some offspring of your lineage that could be reading this piece, is much higher. Others will pick nits and question Binazir’s calculations. (Given that the number of chromosomes is limited, the probability of getting an individual nearly identical to you is higher.)  But the principle is still the same: it shows the fallacy of the anthropic principle—or of Douglas Adams’s self-reflecting puddle .  But it’s still a cool calculation nonetheless. The read probablity that you exist, of course, is 1.  Ali Binazir’s website, Smart ideas for smart living , is here .  h/t: Matthew Cobb  Share this: Tweet Like this: Like  Loading...

I wonder if they sell great big clubs with Bayes’ theorem printed on the business end.          Orlando   Posted November 11, 2011 at 8:38 am |  Permalink   It reminds me of the court cases on TV where the prosecution argues that the odds of another person having the same DNA is several billion to one and therefore not possible.  Well, by that argument, if the odds of winning a lottery are several billion to one and you win, then you must give up your winnings because the odds are so high it was impossible.  They confuse improbable with impossible and over long periods of time or with large enough numbers, the very improbable does happen.          Dr. I. Needtob Athe   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:26 am |  Permalink   It may seem like a nit-pick, but when the odds of something happening are several billion to one, that means it’s extremely likely, not unlikely. If the odds AGAINST something happening are high then that means it’s improbable.  To put it in mathematical terms, if you subtract one from the reciprocal of the probability that something will happen, you get the odds that it won’t happen.              chance   Posted November 11, 2011 at 7:58 am |  Permalink   *the REAL probability that you exist (typo in the final sentence there, you can delete this post once you fix it 😮          Julien Rousseau   Posted November 11, 2011 at 4:34 pm |  Permalink   But he must first read your post to correct the typo read for real.

This is why a god makes no sense – it would have to have more information than the universe. Am I along the right lines here?          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 8:10 am |  Permalink   It’s basic set theory.  The omnimax gods are indistinguishable from “the set of all sets.” I mean, that’s the whole point of such gods. Yet it was long ago demonstrated that “the set of all sets” is as meaningless a concept as “the largest (prime) number.”  The best you can do is a pantheist-style equation of “God” with Sagan’s “Cosmos.” But that just leads to confusion, so why bother?  Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:10 am |  Permalink   I find this argument very strange.  What you are saying is this:  P1 Some things are in principle unknowable. P2 Omniscience, the notion of knowing everything, includes knowing things that are in principle unknowable. P3 This is incoherent. Ergo, there is no god.  The problem lies in P2.  Why does omniscience have to consist of knowing things that are in principle unknowable?  How has it come to be that you have defined omniscience to mean the set of all sets?  And what makes you think that this principle applies to a deity, which is by definition outside of the laws of the universe?  I am not a theist, nor a deist, and I think the arguments presented by religionists are wrong.  I am an atheist.  But your argument is of the same form as those sophistical paradoxes you see online sometimes: “could god create a rock so heavy even he couldn’t lift it?”  And those are not good arguments.  We could just define omniscience to mean “knowing all things that can in principle be known”.  That is not destroyed by your argument, especially if it means, for instance, knowing the absolute position and momentum of every particle in the universe from beginning to end, which a being unconstrained by the laws of the universe could ‘know’, whatever it means to know something under those conditions.  And that certainly sounds like an attribute a supposed deity would have, even if it can’t count to infinity.  It would also enable that deity to have the knowledge to make moral judgements – so your rejection of the notion of omniscience that you have come up with does no damage to the conventional notion of a deity.  You have attached a strong meaning to the word ‘omniscience’ that enables you to make the a priori judgement that it isn’t coherent.  But perhaps you need to read Quine, “Two Dogmas of Empiricism” (yes, I know – philosophy!), to understand why your argument is actually not a good one, and why your a priori rejection of any deity on the grounds of rejecting a strange supposition, wholly linguistic, of Christian theologians is not reasonable.  There are plenty of excellent arguments against all kinds of deities.  Yours is unfortunately not very good.          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:25 am |  Permalink   We could just define omniscience to mean “knowing all things that can in principle be known”.  In so doing, you destroy the meaning of the word, “omnipotence.”  I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers. But because it is impossible for me to know such things, and your definition of “omniscience” excludes that which it is impossible for the individual in question to know, my ignorance of tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers cannot be held against my claim of omniscience.  I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know the precise number of C14 atoms in some random rock on some random planet circling some random star in the Andromeda galaxy. This ignorance, too, does not disprove my claim of omniscience (using your definition).  Continue down the line, and you quickly discover that, everything that I do not know, it is in principle impossible for me to know. I might well be able to learn it at some point in the future, but my current self cannot, in principle, know such things today.  Therefore, by your definition, I, Ben Goren, am omniscient.  Once you start making excuses for a god’s inability to perform a miracle, those same excuses must be applied to all other entities as well. And, as soon as you start handing out those get-out-of-jail-free cards to all comers, it becomes apparent that, once again, the properties attributed to the gods are meaningless.  Besides. Of what point is a miracle if it’s not an instance of the impossible? Jesus didn’t walk on water because it’s something that a space alien with repulsor sandals could do. He did it because nobody can do it. But, if he really walked on water, then it really was possible…and therefore merely impressive, not miraculous.  Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:36 am |  Permalink   Your point about miracles is a non-sequitur.  And you need to revise your definition of “in principle”.  You are stating that you cannot in principle know a number of things that you can, in principle, know.  I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers.  Yes, you can in principle know that. In principle .  You don’t know it (and if you do, then please let me know asap).  But you could, in principle know that.  Heisenberg has some good arguments about the nature of time that rest on a notion of “in principle” that you reject.  Perhaps you should read his Physics and Philosophy to discover what “in principle” can be taken to mean.  In so doing, you destroy the meaning of the word, “omnipotence.”  No – that is only true if you assume that a deity is both omnipotent and omniscient, and while this is certainly the standard formulation, it doesn’t rule out many kinds of deity.  It just means that a deity that is omniscient is not also omnipotent, and while that has obvious implications (ie, there is no Christian god) it doesn’t rule out a deity that i) created the universe, ii) knows everything knowable, iii) makes moral judgements about actions based on knowledge of knowable things, and iv) consigns people to hell for transgressing its moral judgements.  Apart from the notion that god has the power to rain thunderbolts on your head and give you boils, you’ve left some notion of a deity reasonably intact.  And I think we already knew that omniscience, omnipotence, etc, are incompatible – hence theodicy!  That is the primary problem theologians have (apart from, you know, the utter non-existence of their subject matter).  All you’ve done is to restate this problem and say that it is not resolvable.  You may be right, but that’s not a revelation, and it’s certainly not the best argument for atheism, I’m afraid.          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:50 am |  Permalink   You can try to bring all the quantum woo into it you like, but I’m sure Heisenberg, were he here, would assure you that nothing he demonstrated would make possible knowledge outside of one’s relativistic light cone. Tomorrow’s lottery numbers are most emphatically outside that cone.  But never mind that. Permit me to simplify things further.  The very principle of personal knowledge is that one can only know that which is recorded in one’s brain. The process by which such information is recorded is very well known and limited. Once one eliminates that which has not been recorded (or subsequently forgotten) along with that which has never presented the possibility for being recorded, one is left with the set of that which an individual knows being perfectly congruent with the set of that which an individual can, in principle, know. Therefore, by your definition, because there’s no way in principle that the individual could possibly know anything else, everybody is omniscient.  And your claim that it’s possible for an individual to be omniscient (using the traditional naïve definition, not your castrated version) but not omnipotent, but not vice-versa, also falls flat. An omnipotent individual could “use his omnipotence” to make himself omniscient. An omniscient individual would know how to make herself omniscient. Indeed, the two properties are indistinguishable.  Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:07 am |  Permalink   And your claim that it’s possible for an individual to be omniscient (using the traditional naïve definition, not your castrated version) but not omnipotent, but not vice-versa, also falls flat. An omnipotent individual could “use his omnipotence” to make himself omniscient. An omniscient individual would know how to make herself omniscient. Indeed, the two properties are indistinguishable.  First of all, I didn’t say ‘not vice versa’.  Nor did I say that an ‘individual’ could be omniscient.  Given the attenuated definition of omniscience that I discussed – one that is still undeniably the property of a ‘deity’ – it is not possible to know how to make yourself omnipotent, because that is in principle unknowable.  But even given your strong version of omniscience, it does not follow than an omniscient being would be able to make itself omnipotent.  It might actually know how, but knowledge of how to do something doesn’t equal capability to do that thing.  It could know how to make itself omnipotent without actually being able to do it.  Either way, it doesn’t hold.  If we define ‘omniscience’ as being ‘knowledge of the position and momentum of every particle in the universe from beginning to end’, which is in principle knowable (ie, it doesn’t turn into knowledge of incoherent things like the largest prime number or the set of all sets), then this is a coherent property, even if it is impossible in the universe (materially, due to recursion).  That means that you can’t reject it due to a priori speculation.  To provide an example of a deity that is not both omniscient and omnipotent, and one that was worshipped for thousands of years by the world’s most powerful empire, I give you Ahura Mazda (or, in Middle Persian, Ohrmazd), benevolent deity of the Zoroastrian religion, state religion of the Achaemenid, Arsacid, and Sasanid empires.  Hardly inconsequential!  Ahura Mazda is supposed to have created the universe; it is supposed to know everything; it is supposed to make moral judgements; but it is not supposed to be omnipotent, because it has no control over ‘evil’ things, which are the domain of Angra Manyu (MP Ahriman).  There was a religious movement in the Sasanian era to confound this – this was notably after the rise of Christianity.  An omnipotent deity was proposed, named Zurvan, who was supposed to have created both Angra Manyu and Ahura Madza.  There was a schism, of course.  There always is.  My point is, if that argument is all you have to go on (and I’m sure it’s not, but….), then you couldn’t be a Zurvanite, but you could be a Zoroastrian.          Chris V.   Posted November 11, 2011 at 2:45 pm |  Permalink   Wait what? Omniscient means “all-knowing”, right? You cannot circumscribe that. The largest prime is not “unknowable”, it simply does not exist. That’s the answer that your omniscient being would give you. The same with your set-of-all-sets; it is simply recursive. It may cause problems for your garden-variety omnipotent being, but not your omniscient ones.            Occam   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:46 pm |  Permalink   “I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know the precise number of C14 atoms in some random rock on some random planet…”  Small matter of principle indeed, Ben: 14C-isotopes are only assimilated by carbon-based life forms, and therefore found only in fossilised remains thereof (or of their rejections, such as coprolites) or carbonate deposits, and only down to a detection limit of 10-15 half lives, i.e. 55-75 Ky, after which there is hardly any radiocarbon left. Hence, unless carbon-based life forms would have existed whithin that time frame on that random planet around that random star in the Andromeda galaxy, the detectable number of 14C-isotopes on a random “rock” there (organic fossil or piece of carbonate sediment, rather) would be ~zero. An omniscient being would have known that 🙂            Gabrielle Guichard   Posted November 11, 2011 at 1:37 pm |  Permalink   (Outside the topic) I wonder how many believers think that what defines a deity is to be “outside of the laws of the universe”. Most think that a god cannot be defined.          David Gerard   Posted November 11, 2011 at 1:42 pm |  Permalink   I’m really not convinced they think that far. “Sophisticated theology” is actually a rarity, for all its practitioners hide behind it. Most believers have a very simple theology based on God being the being with the power of magic. God as “undefinable” is a very recent invention, starting when science really started kicking religion’s ass.

I was going to make a similar comment regarding God being the “set of all sets” argument being made above.  I was raised with a lot of religious training (currently an atheist!), so I know that a common faith-based reply to these arguments would indeed be: God is outside the bounds of our limited knowledge of the rules of the universe, and is able to revise those rules if He sees fit.

Actually, there are set theories which do have  a “universal set” (a set of all sets, including itself), for example Quine’s New Foundations set theory.  And many set theories which lack a set of all sets do have a “proper class” of all sets, where “proper classes” are entities larger than “sets”.

Hence a QA that uses the observable universe would access more information than the universe contains.  I think Dawkins, as so many times, nailed it – design theory demands that a creator has more information than the created, and the infinite regress of creators is hence absurd twice over (infinite and infinitely demanding).

But at the same time, getting *any* specific hand is improbable too, given the number of cards and ways they can be arranged.  Its just that we find certain patterns to be ‘random’ and certain patterns to be meaningful.  The same could be considered with each human being born.

Sastra   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:14 am |  Permalink   The Fine Tuning Argument for God has always seemed to me to be one of the weakest and silliest of the arguments. Yet I’ve seen wised and learned atheists spending plenty of time on it, doing calculations and invoking multiple universes — all to get that number down so that the life-allowing properties of the universe becomes less ‘extraordinary’ and therefore more probable.  Doesn’t the whole argument fail before you even get to the calculations and odds, though? I’m not a statistician, but it may not be a matter of statistics. Mel Robbin’s talk on ‘this precious incarnation’ or whatever helps to highlight why.  Here’s the basic set-up of the FTA:  1.) Pick out something that YOU think is special and important — for any reason you want. It could be the life-allowing properties of the universe; it could be life itself; it could be you; it could be the elephant’s trunk; it could be a leaf falling on a particular spot on the sidewalk at 12:05 pm; it could be a single speck of sand on a planet in another galaxy; it could be the speck of sand to the right of that one. Whatever. Select it with reverence.  2.)Now, going back to the beginning of time (or as far as possible), think of all the things that might have happened to prevent this special, important thing from happening. Consider all the different ways things could have been, for all you know. Invoke the multiverse, if you want, as well as all the quantum events and their clouds of probability.  3.) Come up with some calculation of the odds against the special, important thing. For the sake of brevity, we could say it’s going to be something perilously close to ‘infinity to the infinity power …minus one.’  4.) Good. Gape in awe at your discovery: this special, important thing was clearly selected with reverence … by someone . WHO could that someone BE? Who might have picked out something they thought was special and important in advance of what we find after the fact?  Ummmm… can we look at step 1 and hazard a guess?  The whole damn process just seems circular to me. It wouldn’t seem to matter what was selected and what the probabilities are or how they are calculated. The results will be the same. The whole weight and purpose and import of Fine Tuning or ‘precious incarnation’ or any other process that looks at the odds and calculates a miracle is in that first step . In an elaborate and unnecessary scenario, something you select is discovered to have been something selected. A=A.  Am I missing something more critical here?          Tim Martin   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:09 pm |  Permalink   No! I said the same thing here .  “Isn’t the fine tuning argument BS to being with? It’s my understanding that even if the universe is fine-tuned to support life, we are a biased sample because we would have to be alive to think about it. Further, improbable stuff happens all the time, and we don’t even know the prior probability of getting our universe, so our universe is either not improbable, or it is but that doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen.  In other words, the multiverse hypothesis is completely unnecessary in answering the fine-tuning argument, cause it’s a shit argument.”  It’s Statistics 101 that stuff with a very low prior probability happens all the time.

However then there is also a sensible answer, which turns out to be bad for believers: the likelihood for any form of livable conditions is actually rather high. And in any case the weak anthropic principle, as it applies in such cases of changing parameters, would circumvent any small a priori probabilities.            Dr. I.

It’s actually a reasonable question: do I actually exist?

Look up “mereological nihilism” on wiki, for instance, or find Trenton Merricks’ book, Objects and Persons .  It is not such a wacky idea that you do not exist, even if it seems it.

Is the you that exists today the same you that existed yesterday, or five minutes ago, or will exist (hopefully) in ten days time, or the same you that was birthed by your mother?  I don’t doubt that is a causal connection between all of these states, and that the stuff that made up them all actually does exist, but unless they are all exactly the same thing, you cannot say that “you” exist, because your exact properties, including causal properties, are not always the same.  You reduce to a number of parts which are not you – and so you are at most a fleeting composite.  That is not ‘existence’ in the same way that a lepton ‘exists’, and so the terms are not interchangeable salva veritate.  So we need more terms.  Either the lepton can be said to exist, or you can, but not both without considerable ambiguity or even nonsense.  Leptons exist; you… supervene?  I don’t know.  Any term will do.  But yeah, you’re right.  Dismiss it because it’s philosophy, and philosophy, as everyone knows (surely!), is just stupid.

How you have managed to derive the notion that I believe in an immaterial soul from this is beyond my powers – it seems like madness.  It is the absolute direct opposite of what I have just said, which is that I probably don’t exist as an independent entity in the universe.  The lepton is also constantly changing — it is always in motion, it might be part of different atomic configurations, and so on.  Yes – but the lepton is the part , not the thing composed.  That is the difference.          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:51 am |  Permalink   I’m sorry, but you’re making even less sense now.  I’ve never made any claim that the self is irreducible to little parts, and I laughed at the idiocy of souls in the post you’re replying to. And now you’re declaring that leptons are somehow not “things.”  Regrettably, every conversation I’ve ever had with a philosophy evangelist quickly deteriorates into such incomprehensible blather. How quickly it degenerates from all-knowing immaterial minds that can’t know what it’s like to forget something and all-powerful ghosts that can’t feel powerless to subatomic particles that apparently now don’t exist, either.  You’ll excuse me when I categorize all this as yet another religion, closely related to the religion of Theology, and dismiss it as an utter waste of time. Or maybe you won’t excuse me. I really don’t care.  Cheers,  b&            Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:05 pm |  Permalink   The reason you think I’m making less sense is because you’ve decide to mutilate my points and misunderstand them, seemingly on purpose.  Only that could allow for the crazy things you’ve just said.  Leptons are things – they are elementary particles, and they are irreducible (at least at present).  Their properties are constant, especially their causal properties.  Leptons exist, unambiguously and without qualification.  The same cannot be said for human beings, which have constantly changing properties made up of and reducing to a series of smaller parts with their own properties.  That is the argument that is being made.  Do you see anything in there about souls?  I don’t, and I have no idea how you managed to come up with that.  There are no souls.  There are no essences.  There are elementary particles in various quantities, arranged in certain ways, with their own properties.  Those exist.  Everything else… well, it’s somewhat more debatable.  And I’m not a ‘philosophy evangelist’.  The fact remains that you see fit to pontificate on philosophical issues while having the capability at abstract thinking, it seems, of a sponge.  Philosophy is not a religion.  It isn’t even a thing.  It’s just the name for this kind of abstract thinking.  I note, also, that you haven’t bothered to defend your claim that you unambiguously exist.  I assume that is because it would require that you outline your belief in an essence or soul, something that defines who you are without reference to properties or causal states or anything real.          DV   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:51 pm |  Permalink   “so you are at most a fleeting composite”  Do composites exist? If yes then you exist. What’s the problem?          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 1:08 pm |  Permalink   First of all, it’s not as simple as that.  I stated it too simply.  You are not simply one composite: you are a great series of incredibly complex composites, each different from the last in properties, from birth to death.  So even if composites, or wholes, can be held to exist, then the issue is still not settled for human beings.  If we say that “I exist” because we can accept that some wholes might exist, then we’re jumping the gun.  You could be a whole, but in a moment your component parts will be different, and so will the arrangement of those parts.  So even if composites ‘exist’, we have a number of composites rather than just one.  And to talk about all of these composites, whose causal properties might reduce to their component parts, as being the same thing – hmm, no dice.  Secondly, if we use the same word, “exist”, for both the irreducible things that make up the whole and the whole itself, then we are being ambiguous.  Third, the discussion comes down to causal properties.  An electron always has the same properties.  One electron is interchangeable in every way with another, because the causal properties of electrons are always the same.  They are little bits of the universe that do not reduce to other bits, and the properties of things made up of electrons fundamentally reduce to the properties of the electrons (or other elementary particles, etc).  If there is something with causal properties that are more than the sum of its parts, then we can talk unambiguously about that thing existing.  Some people have argued that people have causal properties that are more than the sum of their parts while accepting mereological nihilism in every other aspect.  This is called partial mereological nihilism .  Its chief proponent is Trenton Merricks, IIRC.  His book Objects and Persons outlines the idea of mereological nihilism as well as the possibility that consciousness and intention are causal properties that do not reduce to component parts – and that therefore, people can be said to exist, in a sense, albeit not one that allows for personal identity in the way we expect.  I am on the fence about that.  But regardless, it is hardly an easy topic, nor one that can be dismissed out of hand.

It refers to the study of part/whole relations, and it’s a branch of mathematics as well as a philosophical branch.  I suggest consulting wiki – there is doubtless an article on mereology, and probably one on partial mereological nihilism.  Mereological nihilism is the view that only irreducible parts exist; anything consisting of irreducible parts with no new causal properties is not a thing, and cannot be spoken of as existing.  It is a popular view, because it seems to be the most reasonable, but it comes in a few flavours.  Partial mereological nihilism is that only a limited number of special things exist beyond their constituent parts.

Tim Martin   Posted November 11, 2011 at 2:36 pm |  Permalink   The probability of anything is based on what you already know of it.  If you ask what was the probability of a person with your genetic code coming into existence at the moment your dad ejaculated inside your mom, the answer would be 1/280 million or less, since the sperm that became you was one of 280 million in that ejaculate (and there was always the possibility that none of them would have fertilized the egg, or the embryo would not have implanted, thus 1/280 million or less ).  If you ask what was the probability of a person with your genetic code coming into existence at any time before that moment, we have to calculate the probability of that moment occurring (and the moment that led to that moment occurring, and so on), so the chances just get worse and worse the more unknowns you let into the equation.  There is no single answer to the question “what is the probability of X?” It depends on what you know about the problem. And if you know that X has already happened, then the probability of X are exactly 1, every time.          Tom Dobrzeniecki   Posted November 12, 2011 at 6:32 am |  Permalink   Chet: I would disagree. To the extent that it makes sense to speak of the probability of an event that has already happened, the probability of the die being a “6” after it is rolled and has come up as “6” is one.  The probability of a another “6” coming up on SUBSEQUENT rolls is 1/6.  Those are two different things.  As Mr. Gerard wrote in comment #1, probability really deals with the state of knowledge of the observer with regard to some future event.  I already know the first roll has come up “6”.  I DON’T know how future rolls will come up, so the probability is 1/6 for those.

RFW   Posted November 12, 2011 at 5:28 am |  Permalink   It seems to me that the question is deeply flawed. At the very least “you” and “exist” are not clearly and objectively defined. And I’m not even sure that “probability” is a valid concept in the present context.  Jerry, in one of his earlier paragraphs, posits a definition of “you” that includes parentage back to the beginning of time, but from where I sit, a more reasonable definition is that “you” is distinguished by a particular combination of genes. [Note that this leaves out of the question non-genetic aspects of development, but if the definition of “you” includes “did your mother eat a lot of peanut butter during pregnancy?” then the whole issue falls to the ground in a welter of meaninglessness.]  The question, as I see it, thus becomes (a) how many genes are there in the human genome and (b) how many alleles does each gene have? IOW, how many genetically distinct humans are possible? The probability — if the concept is meaningful in this context — then becomes 1/(number of possible genetically distinct individuals).  I have no idea how many genes there are in the H. sap. genome, nor how many alleles there are for each one. Even if we just have an average number of alleles per gene, an approximation is possible. Anyone have the numbers handy?  PS: In this formulation of the question, note that “you” is not necessarily unique. In particular, identical twins are the same “you”.          sailor1031   Posted November 12, 2011 at 6:57 am |  Permalink   Best not to overthink this.

But the principle is still the same: it shows the fallacy of the anthropic principle—or of Douglas Adams’s self-reflecting puddle.  Those are two different things, the a posteriori scientific anthropic principle and the a priori religious anthropic argument. The fallacy belongs to the latter, while the former is untouched by it.  I would like for scientists to acknowledge what physics have to say about this. The weak anthropic principle is the observation that if parameter varies, the likeliest spot to find observers is where the parameters are compatible with them. That is why, for example, we found life on Earth and not on the Moon.  The anthropic argument is a large number argument fallacy: large number, therefore gods. It is based on the scam that a priori probabilities has anything to say on a posteriori probabilities. Or in other word that we should find life on both Earth and the Moon.  In this context, I would think that applying WAP on an individual, let us call it the Coyne Anthropic Principle, would say that it is likeliest to find Coyne’s parents and not other couples as responsible for Coyne’s birth. Which seems like something with a likelihood on the order of ~ 1. =D  The WAP, in the form of generalized environmental principles (looking for star or dust production) is currently the most predictive theories post-standard cosmology.

In order for our Universe to exist, it must have a finite probability of creation, given a multiverse.      In order for you to exist, a great many unlikely events needed to unfold in exactly the way that they did. The exact sperm cell and egg cell needed to meet to create you with the DNA sequence that encoded you, and brought you into existence; a one-in-250 million chance for a sperm cell alone. That needed to happen each time in an unbroken string for millions of generations of your ancestors, going back to well before they were human beings or even hominids of any type. Other unlikely events needed to occur as well: life needed to take hold on Earth, Earth needed to form as a habitable planet with the right ingredients for life out of the ashes of previously dead stars, the laws of physics needed to be such that they permitted life, and the Universe itself must have unfolded in such a way as to make all of this possible.     NASA/CXC/M.Weiss      A standard cosmic timeline of our Universe's history. A series of extremely unlikely events all needed to occur in order so that you would exist.      Yet there's one thing we can be sure of in this entire series of unlikely events, occurring one after the other: nothing that occurred at any point had an infinitesimal likelihood. Instead, every single event, including:     the mutations and meiosis crossovers in the DNA of each of your ancestors,  the survival of every one of them to reproductive age,  the finding of the particular mate needed to give rise to the next generation of your particular ancestors,  the creation of this exact planet with the exact extinction history that it's had,  the formation of stars and galaxies in the Milky Way to create the environment in which Earth formed,  the creation of the original, initial density conditions of the Universe that make it possible for gravity to create us,  the realization of the laws of nature that they would be exactly sufficient to create us,  and that our Universe would have come to exist out of the great abyss of nothingness that came before,   must have had finite odds of occurring. Even the emergence of our Universe from the Multiverse couldn't have had an infinitely small probability.

How do we know this, you ask? It isn't physics that tells us this is so, but rather a more fundamental theorem about basic probability itself: Bayes' theorem . This mathematical idea is devastatingly simple, but its consequences are incredibly complex. On its own, Bayes' theorem is simply a rule to tell you the probability that something is true, given knowledge of conditions that are related to that thing you're trying to measure. For example, perhaps you're hungry right now and perhaps you're not, and one possibly related factor is the time of day. If you know the time of day and the time of day is related to your hunger, you can more accurately assess whether you're likely to be hungry or not, probabilistically, than if you didn't know the time of day. Bayes' theorem tells you that and a whole lot more.     mattbuck of Wikimedia Commons      One of the most fundamental and useful rules in probability is Bayes' theorem, mathematically expressed in blue neon at the offices of Autonomy in Cambridge.      What it does is take any two events, like being hungry ( A ) and the time of day ( B ), and relates them by saying:   The probability that A is true if B is given is equal to the probability that B is true if A is given, multiplied by the probability that A is true (independent of B ) and divided by the probability that B is true (independent of A ).   You can apply that to your hunger based on time, the creation of you based on your biological parents' genetic material, the existence of Earth based on the interstellar environment where our Solar System formed, or the existence of this Universe based on the conditions that came beforehand. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical rule that can be applied to any system at all, in principle.     Bock et al. (2006, astro-ph/0604101); modifications by E. Siegel      The history of our Universe is filled with a number of fantastic events, but they all must have occurred exactly as they did in order to give rise to the Universe as we observe it today.      But there's a fun, important, and underappreciated consequence of Bayes' theorem that can tell us something vital about any of these steps: the odds of any one of them happening, no matter how small, could not have been infinitesimal. If you want to create our Universe with our laws of physics, our local group, our Sun, our Earth, and every one of us, given all the conditions that existed before the Big Bang, that probability may be very, very small, but it can't be infinitely small. If it were, our model for the conditions that existed before the Big Bang could be ruled out immediately, with no need to gather data or make measurements.     Max Pixel / public domain      Rolling five 'sixes' in a single dice roll of five dice is an unlikely outcome, which will only happen one out of 7,776 rolls, on average, but given an infinite number of rolls., you'd get an infinite number of results like this.      The reason is that the probability of A  not happening, given B , must then be equal to 1, or 100%. If the probability of A happening (regardless of B ) goes to zero, then the probability of "not A " happening goes to 1. At a fundamental level, our Universe is based in probabilities, as quantum mechanics uncomfortably taught us in the 20th century. It's only the act of observing, interacting, measuring or otherwise "determining" the state of a system that forces any system into a particular state. With every measurement we make, we can be sure that the outcome of our experiment, however unlikely, still had a finite, non-zero probability of occurring.     Dr. Tonomura and Belsazar of Wikimedia Commons      The wave pattern for electrons passing through a double slit, one-at-a-time. Each electron's results have a finite probability of occurring. If you measure “which slit” the electron goes through, however, you destroy the quantum interference pattern shown here.      Scientists often argue over cosmic inflation, the model for the origin of our Universe , with some contending that a major problem of inflation is that it gives an infinite number of possible outcomes, all of which are equally likely. But if that were true, and the odds of a Universe turning out like ours were completely infinitesimal, then that model could be immediately ruled out. If there were an infinite number of other possible outcomes that occurred 100% of the time, then there would be no way to obtain our own Universe.     E. Siegel      Even though inflation may continue for an infinite amount of time and over an infinite volume of space, the odds of inflation ending and giving rise to a Universe like ours, any point in time, must be finite.      This is true for all types of probabilities! So the next time something unlikely happens, or you realize that something very unlikely must have already occurred, remember that no matter how unlikely it is, the odds of it happening weren't infinitely small. Its existence, just like our existence, already disproves that possibility!   Thanks to Eiichiro Komatsu, Ben Wandelt and many others for publicly making and sharing this line of reasoning.

Posted December 31, 2011 by Dan Falk in Philosophy of science , Probability science    Have you ever wondered how  likely – or unlikely – it is that you exist?  Although  it may sound pie-in-the-sky, it’s really a scientific problem, though  you don’t have to be a scientist to be captivated by it.  Take, for example, the wonderfully-named Cosmicomics of 20 th -century Italian writer Italo  Calvino – a collection of whimsical, science-fiction-flavoured short  stories.  One of the stories, called “How Much Shall We Bet,”  involves two characters, the narrator (with the unpronounceable name  “Qfwfq”) and someone named “Dean (k)yK.”  The two men seem  to have existed since the before the beginning of the universe – somehow separate from the universe, whatever that could mean – and they  seem to be immortal.  All they do is make an endless series of  bets regarding what sorts of things will happen in their cosmos.  As you might imagine, the series  of events that they bet on, and the series of events that actually unfold,  are rather familiar:  They seem to resemble the actual events that  have unfolded in the history of our own universe.  Their first  bet is on the formation of atoms; the narrator bets for it, while Dean  bets against it.  They go on betting on the formation of various  chemical elements, and, looking billions of years ahead, they bet as  to whether the Assyrians will invade Mesopotamia.  We’re told that  Dean always bets no, “not because he believed the Assyrians wouldn’t  do it, but because he refused to think there would ever be Assyrians  and Mesopotamia and the Earth and a human race.”  Let’s begin with the big  philosophical questions:  First there’s the issue of determinism – roughly, whether the “stuff that happens” in the universe is  largely, or perhaps completely, determined by what came before.   This is something that thinkers have wrestled with for 2,500 years,  and I won’t attempt to add to that discussion here; but it is worth  mentioning that most versions of determinism seem to place free will  in jeopardy, making them rather unappetizing (though not necessarily  wrong).  (But I would say that, wouldn’t, if I were destined  to say it?)  Secondly, assuming that the  future is not fully determined by the present, there’s the  string of probabilities associated with each development along the way  to “us.”  Thinking again of Calvino’s story:  Before you  can have Assyrians, you have to have human beings, and before you can  have human beings you have to have life, and before you can have life  you have to have a habitable planet orbiting a star at just the right  distance… it does sound like a leaning tower of improbabilities, doesn’t  it?  In my next blog post, I’ll  explore what I think is the weakest link in that chain – the  appearance of intelligent life.  But first, let’s have  some more fun with the ideas and the numbers.  Certainly, the more specific  the outcome, more improbable it seems.  If you consider some particular state of affairs, and then ask what the odds are, starting  from today and going back even a short time (let alone the 3.8 billion  years to when life first appeared on this planet), that particular state  will seem extraordinarily unlikely.  For example, imagine turning  the clock back five years.  From that perspective, what were the  odds that, on this particular day, you would be sitting in this particular  room, in this city, reading this particular sentence?  And what something even more  basic – say, your own existence?  A couple of months ago,  a “probability chart” produced by Harvard Law School blogger  Ali Binazir went somewhat viral, encouraging people to contemplate this  very question.  In the chart, Binazir calculates just how improbable  it was that the right sperm from your father hooked up with the right  egg produced by your mother – by his estimate, it’s about one chance  in 400 quadrillion (that number seems only slightly more tame in scientific  notation: 4 x 10^17).  And that’s hardly the whole battle:   To even get to that stage, all of your ancestors, going all the way  back to the beginning of life on Earth, had to survive to reproductive  age.  Multiplying the string of probabilities together, he concludes  that the odds of your existence are an astronomical one in 10^2,685.000.   (As you can imagine, not everyone in the blogosphere was kind to Binazir;  one asked if it was painful to pull those numbers out of you-know-where.)  To be sure, we can quibble  about the precise figures.  But I’m sure we can agree that the  chances of anything specific happening, viewed from a remote  enough point in the past, seem absurdly low.  And yet, for some  reason, we often weave stories in which historical events have a flavour  of inevitability to them.  Think how many science fiction stories  you’ve read on the theme of time travel, in which the time traveller  attempts to “change history,” only to find that what was going to  happen, happens anyway.  Push history, and it pushes back.  If you’re a Stephen King  fan, you’ll know that his latest book, 11-22-63 , involves a  time traveller who attempts to prevent the Kennedy assassination (which  of course took place on the date that gives the book its title).   As you might guess, even with several years lead-time, preventing the  fatal shot from being fired from the Dallas book depository is no simple  task.  As filmmaker Errol Morris puts it in his review of King’s  book :  “What if history is too forceful to redirect?   What if jiggering the engine produces no favourable outcome – merely  a postponement of the inevitable?  If he had lived, Kennedy might  not have escalated the war in Vietnam, and might have kept America out  of a bloody mire.  But we don’t know.  What if we were headed  there anyway?  Then our tampering might only make things worse.   It is not historical inevitability, but something close.”  These kinds of questions, about  the inevitability (or otherwise) of history, have made their way into  our popular culture, so I’m happy to give the last word to Lisa Simpson.   I’m thinking of a Halloween episode in which Lisa had lost  a tooth; as part of an experiment for a science fair project, she leaves  the tooth in a glass of cola overnight.  Sure enough, the next  morning she sees a peculiar mould growing on it; and looking through  her microscope, she sees that she’s crated little cave men.   Some hours later she looks again, and the little people are undergoing  what appears to be the Renaissance; soon, one of the little people is  seen nailing something to the cathedral door.  She gasps:  “I’ve  created Lutherans!”  More on likelihood of life  – and intelligent life in particular – next time.

Credit: David Aguilar, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics     When life originates on a planet, whether Earth or a distant world, the newborn life-forms may have to overcome incredible odds to come into existence — and a new equation lays out exactly how overwhelming those odds may be.  The creators of the equation hope it can connect diverse areas of research that aim to answer long-standing questions about the origins of life, much like how the famous Drake equation pulled together research concerning communications from intelligent life.  "The idea of the equation, at some level, is to try to connect the unknown, presumably microscopic events that … give rise to the first thing that we would call a living system — to connect those microscopic components to the macroscopic fact of whether a planet has life starting on it," Caleb Scharf, an astrophysicist at Columbia University and lead author of the new work, told Space.com. [ 8 Newfound Alien Worlds Could Potentially Support Life ]  The Drake equation, originally penned by astronomer Frank Drake in the 1960s, laid out a series of terms estimating how many intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations likely exist in the Milky Way. The equation takes into account factors such as the rate of star formation in the galaxy, the fraction of planets where life emerges, and the fraction of that life that gains intelligence and the capability to broadcast its presence into space. Over the years, the equation has acted as a road map for researchers searching for communications signals created by intelligent civilizations beyond Earth. Scharf and his co-author Lee Cronin, a chemist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, hope to provide a similar road map to researchers trying to work out how — and how often — life forms on a given planet.  "It came out of a moment in the field where we were trying to bring some cohesion to this study of origins of life," which is notorious for its disparate areas of focus, Scharf said. "To my mind, what this equation is trying to do, or at least trying to prompt people to think about, is how you make that connection — how do you go from some story about how life may have originated on Earth to a quantitative assessment of the probability that that happened, and what that means for life elsewhere in the universe," he said.  Series of steps  The new equation breaks down the process of abiogenesis — the formation of life from nonliving components — into a series of simpler factors. Those factors incorporate the planet's conditions, the ingredients needed to form life and the likelihood of those ingredients getting into the right configuration for life to emerge. As with the Drake equation, each of the terms is straightforward to describe, but each hides additional complexity and room for new research.  Here is the equation:       The average number of origin-of-life events for a given planet = (number of building blocks on planet) × 1/(average [mean] number of building blocks needed per "organism") × (availability of building blocks during time t) × (probability of assembly in a given time) × time.  Credit: Caleb Scharf and Lee Cronin    On the left, the equation considers the average (mean) expected number of origin-of-life events for a given planet. To get there, it takes into account the number of potential "building blocks" for life on the planet, the average number of building blocks needed to create a living system, the availability of those building blocks during a given time and the probability of that assembly happening during that time.  On Earth, building blocks for life take the form of amino acids, lipids and certain essential metals. Somewhere else, though, an entirely different set of ingredients could create enough complexity to form life — the equation doesn't assume any specific set is necessary.  "We're being kind of sneaky," Scharf said. "I think it's one of the beautiful things about it: If you write the equation this way, you don't necessarily have to worry about all the fine, fine details, but what you do do is, you start to break open the factors that you might be able to put some numbers to."  For instance, if you know the size of a planet and its composition, you can begin to estimate how many potential building blocks for life there are on the planet. To calculate whether those building blocks are actually available to form life, you'd have to know more about the conditions on the planet, such as its temperature, which could render some of the blocks unusable or inaccessible.  For example, these blocks could be unusable or inaccessible if they're always in gaseous form or if water is not readily available — although future research might show that life could emerge in more scenarios than scientists currently know about.  In that way, the equation "links where people in exoplanetary science may actually begin to get some data, on the size of planets, the composition, and so on, to the piece that we still don't really understand but we know must have some kind of probability of happening": how it is that life first begins, Scharf said.  A trillion test tubes  The value P a , which is the probability that life will assemble out of those particular building blocks over a given time, is murkier — and much more interesting. If the value of P a is very low, it's extremely unlikely that life will form even when the ingredients are there — potentially explaining why humans haven't yet happened to create life in the lab , even if scientists have used the right ingredients, Scharf said. But a planet-wide "lab" would increase the odds that life-creating events will occur.  "We might have to wait 100 million years for it to fall into place just in a test tube," Scharf said. "Whereas on a planet scale, you've got a trillion test tubes — probably even more than that. It's conceivable that, using this equation, playing these games, is hinting at a possible explanation for why we haven't seen life miraculously appearing in our laboratories, that … there's some subtle thing that has to happen that really doesn't happen often."  And if the scale is larger than planetary, Scharf said, that could further increase the likelihood of life forming. Early Earth and Mars, for example, were cultivating their own, separate chemistries, but the early solar system was chaotic ; impacts with other solar system bodies could have resulted in material exchanges between the two planets. That would have led to even more "test tubes" — the chemical mixing could have allowed even more interactions to occur, potentially hitting the right combination, Scharf said.  If multiple planets exchange materials, it could lead to a sort of "chemical amplification [that] could, in principle, be hugely important," he said. "It could be all the difference between getting life to occur or not, especially when we're dealing with such tiny, tiny probabilities on the microscopic scale of something going right," he added.  Factoring our ignorance  Scharf hopes that the new equation can bring together the different areas of research that relate to each of the equation's terms. For instance, the equation provides an opportunity to combine detailed examinations of far-off exoplanets, chemical research about how different molecules in different physical states can interact to generate complexity, and investigations of the smallest possible units that can exhibit living traits. Combining these areas of research, in turn, could help to link scientists' large-scale understanding of exoplanets to the microscopic chemical interactions, Scharf said.  "It's not an answer; it's a new tool for trying to think about the issues involved," Ed Turner, an astronomer at Princeton University, told Space.com. Turner was not involved in the work, but the paper's definition of the left-hand probability — the expected number of origin-of-life events — draws heavily from his work to allow for incorporating scientists' uncertainty about the origins of life based on observations of life on Earth (and how much weight to give those observations ).  "To really put numbers on those, to think very specifically about a lot of the factors in their equation, will require a lot more knowledge about exoplanets than we have now," Turner said. "We may be decades off from being able to talk about things like the total mass of building blocks on a planet's surface and things like that."  Turner pointed out that the same was true about the Drake equation: Scientists have been able to quantify only some of the terms recently, such as the number of potentially habitable planets. Therefore, the equation could become more useful as the science progresses, he said. In the meantime, it can act to "divide our ignorance into different factors" and focus research on those different components, Turner added. [ The Father of SETI: Q&A with Astronomer Frank Drake ]  But some of the factors — especially biological ones, such as the switch from nonliving to living organisms — may not be understood anytime soon, he said.  Paul Davies, an astrobiologist at Arizona State University who was not involved in the study, also said that the term that incorporates the probability of nonlife becoming life will be among the hardest to define.  "We don't know the mechanism whereby nonlife turns into life, so we have no way of estimating the odds … It may be one in a trillion trillion (it's easy to imagine that), in which case, Earth life may be unique in the observable universe," Davies told Space.com in an email. "But P a may be quite large. We simply can't say."  "Setting that aside, I think the remaining terms are discussed in a very useful way as a conceptual framework for research," he added.  To get a grip on that probability, humanity would have to encounter another instance of life's emergence beyond our own for comparison. Future observatories that can see exoplanets in more detail, like the James Webb Space Telescope , may be able to detect signatures from life in earlier forms than Drake might have thought we'd spot — life on the microscopic scale rather than life actively communicating with humanity. That kind of data could help illustrate what other forms life can take.  The work also mentions the possibility of life arising multiple times using different building blocks — for instance, that some form of life that previously existed on Earth, or one that exists currently but is unknown to science, came into being separately from our brand of life with a totally different chemical vocabulary. Davies said that a good step toward narrowing down the likelihood would be to investigate Earth's own organisms for evidence of this possibility.  "We just need one other sample of life (second genesis) and the field is transformed, because we would know P a can't be exceedingly small," Davies said. "And that sample might be right here on Earth. Frankly, almost nobody has looked."  The new work was detailed July 4 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Briggs            Menu            The Probability Of Your Existence   September 4, 2017 by Briggs 23 Comments on The Probability Of Your Existence Statistics        On Labor Day, it’s well to ponder your existence. A version of this column originally ran 7 July 2014.  To the nearest order of magnitude, there have existed, including us, about 100 billion human beings.  This proves what was always, until our day, quite obvious: that people are good at breeding. Or were, before discovering contraception, abortion, and sexual dissipation of course.  That’s a lot of people in a relatively short period of time, geologically speaking, considering the human species has only existed some few hundred thousand years.  According to Harvard Law blogger Ali Binazir , author of Awaken Your Genius, you, dear reader, only have a “1 in 10 2,685,000 ” chance of existing.  Pretty small, no?  But since there’s been so many of us, each one of us being next to impossible according to these odds, something has gone wrong in the calculations or in our thinking about them.  Nothing better illustrates the truth that all probability is conditional than Binazir’s calculation. It’s sort of a Drake equation for individual human existence. The Drake equation is a probability-like calculation which gives the chances of other life forms like us, i.e. beings possessed on intellect and will, existing on other planets. It is notorious in its liquidity: it won’t stay solid. Binzair’s calculations suffer from the same flaws. He’s unable to keep straight which side of the equation he’s on.  Given you’re reading this post, the probability you exist is 1, i.e. it is certain. That’s because there must be a you to read. But Binazir tells us that the probability you exist is a number practically 0, the other end of the probability spectrum.  Both probabilities can be right, since all probabilities depend on the premises used. And it depends on the meaning of those premises, too. Does “to exist” mean “being made” or “alive and functioning now”?  Alive and functioning now is easy: you exist certainly. But how did you get made?  Well, mom met dad and they did what came naturally. Out came you. You, logic insists, could not be other than you.  This is necessary to emphasize.  The probability your parents had any kids is also 1, because you are one of them. But the probability that two mated humans reproduce is different. That probability doesn’t exist because no premises have been specified. One possible premise: both male and female are over 80 years old. Another: one is sterile, by natural or artificial means. Another: One belongs to the push-up club and eats his clams. And on and on.  Now each time the mates attempt to reproduce, either a baby is produced or it isn’t, a tautology. In either case, something caused the baby to be made or to stop it from being made. We (typically) won’t be in the position of knowing these exact causes, so we say the creation or lack of it is “random”, which is just another label of our ignorance of the causes. But if we assume these causes are “regular”, and are careful to specify the kind of mates to which they apply (say, 20-30 year-olds, of this and such background, etc.), then we can use probability to express our incomplete knowledge and make reasonable predictions over groups of mates.  In any case, we are not asking what is the probability your parents had kids, because they obviously did. We asking the probability of you yourself coming into being.  Assuming each of your mom’s and dad’s gametes were unique (are male gametes like snowflakes? has anybody checked? I ask in ignorance), then each mating could make a different baby. But each mating will have a list of causes which either make or stop the baby.  So again we’re not talking about what causes the individual gametes to meet.  What premises to use? On those for any individual attempt? If so, there are a number of male gametes and a fixed female gamete. In ignorance of the causes, and assuming conception, there are n male gametes and one female, thus the probability is 1/n that this male gamete meets this fixed female one. Is that newly created baby you or somebody else?  Assuming no conception, then no you and no anybody else either. What is the probability of no conception? Well, what premises do we assume?  You can see this is getting nowhere slow.  The problem is in the question. What is the probability you exist? This is not what is the probability somebody else exists, or the probability somebody in your place exists.  It isn’t even the probability some other human exists—which is one by the plain meaning of the question. Why? Because people exist.  You exist, too. Therefore it must be the probability you exist is 1. That you might not have existed is a counterfactual question, which is perfectly comprehensible as long as we supply the premises under which you would not have existed. Say, you imagine your dad got called away on a business trip during the time in which your parents conceived you.  Or that your dad never met your mom. Then, given those premises, the probability would not have existed is also 1, because there would have been no causal way of you coming into existence.  Face it. Probability is never as easy as you hope it is.  ————————————————————————————-  Thanks to The Carolina Cowbody for suggesting this topic.

I ask in ignorance)  Very probably (heh) yes.  The process of meiosis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis includes a step called “crossing over” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover where the chromosomes exchange genetic material and making each eventual gamete unique.  The process essentially mixes up the DNA from both parents of the individual producing the gametes which has the benefit of passing genetic diversity (a good thing) to the next generation.          Gary  says:     July 7, 2014 at 10:40 am      Shouldn’t the question be what is the probability of predicting correctly that a specific person will exist?  Which, too, depends on the details of the specification.  Merely male, ~ 0.5.  Male American, ~ 0.025.

I felt good when I saw the title of the post I thought the probability of me existing is 1.  Now, back to the weekly humbling that is me trying to understand the Sunday posts on Aquinas.  At least that’s what’s happening now.  I mean right now.          Hans Erren  says:     July 7, 2014 at 4:25 pm      and now the probability of the universe…          Jersey McJones  says:     July 7, 2014 at 6:08 pm      Given all the stuff there is in the universe, and given that we are made of all the same stuff as the rest of it (proof you don’t need God to make us, as we’re not made of anything that isn’t around us), I’d say we’re not all that surprising.  I’m sure there are lots of weird critters around the universe.  That we have certain features, that would narrow things, but again, I’m sure there are all sorts of weird features out there too.  JMJ          MattS  says:     July 7, 2014 at 8:02 pm      “Given all the stuff there is in the universe, and given that we are made of all the same stuff as the rest of it (proof you donâ€™t need God to make us, as weâ€™re not made of anything that isnâ€™t around us)”  One of the very first principles discovered by science is that life does not arise spontaneously from non-living matter.  So, unless you are arguing that we aren’t really alive, the mere fact that we are made of the same materials as the rest of the universe is not proof that we don’t need God to make us.          Jersey McJones  says:     July 7, 2014 at 9:04 pm      “One of the very first principles discovered by science is that life does not arise spontaneously from non-living matter.”  No.  There is no such principle.  Silliness.  JMJ          Sander van der Wal  says:     July 7, 2014 at 11:44 pm      Most of the universe is made of spacetime. We are not made of spacetime.  Almost all particles in the universe are Dark Matter particles. We are not made of Dark Matter particles.  There are a few fermions (quarks and electrons) around. We are made of fermions.  So we are made of the rarest stuff in the universe.

Joseph Hertzlinger  says:     July 10, 2014 at 11:30 pm      If there have been 100 billion human beings, that means only 93% of all humans have died. In other words, the theory that “all men are mortal” is no longer established to within a 95% confidence interval.          Joy  says:     September 4, 2017 at 9:36 am      Joseph Hertzinger makes a good point in humour.  That ‘all men are mortal’ is taken to be true (for purposes of explanation) because nobody has seen any  other type.  Oh yes, and we understand the essence of man, slugs and snails and puppy dog tails, DNA and all that.  If all that is required to be included in the set is ‘being a man’ then Jesus fulfils the which means that to be true ‘man’ needs to be more accurately qualified.  …but never mind, as long as the calculator knows what he’s talking about.  If the robot is told ‘all men are moral’ who is it to question? it won’t know to question the statement and will churn out an answer based on the arithmetic. Robots are very trusting, being not free to do anything else.  Probability is only as hard as you make it.  If you pretend, for argument’s sake, the universe is a casino and use algebra for added truthiness it will fool a lot of people, most of the time.          Gary  says:     September 4, 2017 at 10:04 am      Assuming each of your mom’s and dad’s gametes were unique (are male gametes like snowflakes? has anybody checked? I ask in ignorance), then each mating could make a different baby. The process of meiosis does indeed produce unique gametes at a point where a pair of homologous chromosomes exchange their DNA.  Because an individual’s chromosomes are not identical (one comes from each parent) this trading of material makes them different yet again.  Considering that the exchange location can occur at very many places and each one of the 23 human chromosome set can perform this trick, the genetic material of each gamete is for all practical purposes unique. Wikipedia provides a technical explanation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis          Rexx Shelton  says:     September 4, 2017 at 11:42 am      I am glad that you decided to go over this again, I wounder what brought you back to it, I had let it fall out of my mind completely.          Bob Kurland  says:     September 4, 2017 at 3:40 pm      Interesing!! now it isn’t only the DNA, but it’s the way the DNA expresses itself.  That’s epigenesis and is affected by the environment.   That’s why “identical twins” (same DNA from a split fertilized egg) aren’t actually identical.  So what’s the probability of twin A vs twin B???          Bob Kurland  says:     September 4, 2017 at 3:41 pm      I didn’t check the “get new comments” box          FilipG  says:     September 9, 2017 at 1:30 pm      Hey, you should read “De Impossibilitate Vitae” and “De Impossibilitate Prognoscendi” by Cezar Kouska.

All probabilities exist in the same way that nothing exists.  There isn’t a 1 without a 0.  The real question may be the definition of “exist” or the “here and now”.

Cody Fenwick , Alternet  The probability of human existence, calculated “The Copernicus Complex” explores new scientific discoveries informing and guiding our estimates John Horgan , The Scientific American 2014-11-23T15:00:00Z • 2014-11-23T15:00:00Z This article was originally published by Scientific American . I’m writing this post for two reasons. One is to recommend a new book by Columbia astrobiologist Caleb Scharf (who also writes a terrific Scientific American blog, “ Life, Unbounded “), and the other is to defend an old book of mine.  In his new book Caleb Scharf writes: "So are we unusual or not?... Neither side is yet a winner. But we are much, much closer to an answer than we have ever been in the history of the human species; we are on the cusp of knowing."  Scharf’s book is The Copernicus Complex: Our Cosmic Significance in a Universe of Planets and Probabilities . I loved Scharf’s book, and so I brought him to my school, Stevens Institute of Technology, to talk about it this week. Here’s how I introduced him: “The Copernicus Complex addresses some of the deepest questions humans have ever asked. How weird are we? Was our existence highly probable, or improbable? Even miraculous? You can break this question down into more specific questions: How probable was our universe? Our galaxy? Solar system? Planet? How probable was life? And how probable were creatures like us, who can ponder their probability? For thousands of years, anyone could speculate about our weirdness, from Plato to pot-smoking college kids, because no one had any answers. It was just philosophy, pure guesswork. But new scientific discoveries are informing and guiding estimates of our probability. This is the story that Caleb Scharf tells brilliantly in The Copernicus Complex .” “Pure guesswork” was a gratuitous jab at my Stevens philosophy buddies. Otherwise, I meant everything I said in my introduction, especially the last sentence. Scharf provides an exceptionally clear, entertaining, up-to-date report on observations and conjectures bearing on what I call our “weirdness.” Scharf delves into exoplanets (4,000 discovered so far), and also microbiomes, Bayesian inference, planetary dynamics, multiverses, the anthropic principle, the Fermi Paradox, the RNA world theory and lots of other fascinating topics. All this work is provoking reconsideration of the Copernicus Principle, which holds, as Scharf puts it, that “we are not the center of all existence; we are not ‘special.’” Now I come to the second reason for writing this post. In The Guardian , journalist Tim Radford praises Copernicus Complex as “an intoxicating collection of questions answered with other questions. A couple of decades ago, physicists spoke confidently of a theory of everything, and one or two even proposed an end to science. All has now changed. The mysteries have multiplied.” I don’t know any physicists who proposed “an end to science” two decades ago, but I did. In my 1996 book The End of Science , I argued that “pure” science, which I defined as the “quest to understand the universe and our place in it,” may be drawing to a close. “Further research may yield no more revelations or revolutions but only diminishing returns.” I addressed the same questions that Scharf does in Copernicus Complex . I examined physicists’ efforts to explain how our universe came to be, and why it took a form that allowed us to exist. I also looked at attempts by “chaoplexologists,” notably Stuart Kauffman (also mentioned by Scharf), to estimate the probability of life, including intelligent, multicellular creatures like us. (I coined the term “chaoplexity” to describe research into chaos and complexity, which are virtually indistinguishable.) I did not anticipate the thrilling recent surge in discoveries of exoplanets, which have revealed that planetary systems are quite common. Those observations, as I said when introducing Scharf, are “informing and guiding”—that is, enriching–discussions about our probability. But answers to the biggest questions remain as elusive as ever.  Scientists still don’t have a clue why our universe has the form we observe, or how life began on the Earth some 3.6 billion years ago, or whether life exists elsewhere. During his talk at Stevens, Scharf acknowledged that we may never observe exoplanets in sufficient detail to know, with certainty, that they harbor life. In the “Afterword” of the paperback version of The End of Science, I noted that scientists, lacking data that can fully resolve questions about our probability, choose answers for philosophical and even emotional reasons. I wrote: “Unfortunately, you cannot determine the probability of the universe or of life on Earth when you have only one universe and one history of life to contemplate. Statistics require more than one data point. The utter lack of empirical data does not stop scientists and philosophers from holding strong opinions on these matters. On one side are inevitabilists, who take comfort in theories portraying reality as the highly probable and even necessary outcome of immutable laws. Most scientists are inevitabilists. Perhaps the most prominent was Einstein, who rejected quantum mechanics because it implied that God ‘plays dice with the universe.’ On the other side are the anti-inevitabilists–notably Karl Popper, Stephen Jay Gould and Ilya Prigogine–who see scientific determinism as a threat to human freedom. We are either pawns of destiny or wildly improbable flukes. Take your pick.” I hope this situation changes, but I fear it won’t, in spite of continued research in cosmology, astrobiology, chaoplexity and other fields. Scharf writes toward the end of his book: “So are we unusual or not?… Neither side is yet a winner. But we are much, much closer to an answer than we have ever been in the history of the human species; we are on the cusp of knowing.” We may be on the cusp of knowing, and yet still infinitely far away.

But just how small? Dr. Ali Binazir illustrates the extremely unlikely chain of events that would have to occur in order for you to be born with this example in a blog post: Imagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean and there is exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere. The probability that you came about and exist today is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water — in the middle of that life preserver. On one try. Dr. Binazir has crunched the exact numbers shown in the infographic below. The path begins with the odds of your dad meeting your mom (1 in 20,000). This is multiplied by the chances of them staying together long enough to have kids (1 in 2,000), and so on... The probability of you existing at all comes out to 1 in 10 2,685,000 — yes, that's a 10 followed by 2,685,000 zeroes!

Ali Binazir went to a Tedx talk in San Francisco and heard some probabilities being bandied about that he considered dubious:  One of the talks was by Mel Robbins , a riotously funny self-help author and life coach with a syndicated radio show.  In it, she mentioned that scientists calculate the probability of your existing as you, today, at about one in 400 trillion (4×10 14 ).  “That’s a pretty big number,” I thought to myself.  If I had 400 trillion pennies to my name, I could probably retire.  Previously, I had heard the Buddhist version of the probability of ‘this precious incarnation’.  Imagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean and there is exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere.  The probability that you came about and exist today is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water — into the middle of that life preserver. On one try.  Like a good skeptic, Binazir first calculated the turtle-head-into-life-preserver probability, making due allowances for the area of the world’s oceans and the area of the hole in a life preserver. That turns out to be 1 in 6.82×10 14 , or about 1 in 700 trillion. Pretty close to the probability-that-you-exist-figure.  But when Binazir calculated the second figure, he found out that Robbins was off. Way off. But Binazir made that calculation, too, which of course involves some ancillary assumptions and calculations. The probability that you’d exist on Earth today includes the probability that your parents would meet 20 years ago, that they’d have a relationship that would result in pregnancy, and of course that the right egg would meet the right sperm.  But it also includes the probability that your parents would also have existed with the genes they have, which means calculating that every one of your ancestors would have reproduced successfully , and that for each pair of them the right egg would have met the right sperm as well.  He comes up with this probability that you’d exist (by “you”, of course, he means those individuals resulting from the concatenation of a sperm and egg genetically to those who formed your zygote:  Probability of your existing at all: 1 in 10 2,685,000  As a comparison, the number of atoms in the body of an average male (80kg, 175 lb) is 10 27 .  The number of atoms making up the earth is about 10 50 .  The number of atoms in the known universe is estimated at 10 80 .  So what’s the probability of your existing?  It’s the probability of 2 million people getting together – about the population of San Diego – each to play a game of dice with trillion-sided dice. They each roll the dice, and they all come up the exact same number – say, 550,343,279,001.  A miracle is an event so unlikely as to be almost impossible.  By that definition, I’ve just shown that you are a miracle.  Now go forth and feel and act like the miracle that you are.  Well, somebody’s going to point out to me that although the specific genetic “you” who exists is improbable, the probability that some you, that is, some offspring of your lineage that could be reading this piece, is much higher. Others will pick nits and question Binazir’s calculations. (Given that the number of chromosomes is limited, the probability of getting an individual nearly identical to you is higher.)

I wonder if they sell great big clubs with Bayes’ theorem printed on the business end.          Orlando   Posted November 11, 2011 at 8:38 am |  Permalink   It reminds me of the court cases on TV where the prosecution argues that the odds of another person having the same DNA is several billion to one and therefore not possible.  Well, by that argument, if the odds of winning a lottery are several billion to one and you win, then you must give up your winnings because the odds are so high it was impossible.  They confuse improbable with impossible and over long periods of time or with large enough numbers, the very improbable does happen.          Dr. I. Needtob Athe   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:26 am |  Permalink   It may seem like a nit-pick, but when the odds of something happening are several billion to one, that means it’s extremely likely, not unlikely. If the odds AGAINST something happening are high then that means it’s improbable.  To put it in mathematical terms, if you subtract one from the reciprocal of the probability that something will happen, you get the odds that it won’t happen.              chance   Posted November 11, 2011 at 7:58 am |  Permalink   *the REAL probability that you exist (typo in the final sentence there, you can delete this post once you fix it 😮          Julien Rousseau   Posted November 11, 2011 at 4:34 pm |  Permalink   But he must first read your post to correct the typo read for real.

Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 8:10 am |  Permalink   It’s basic set theory.  The omnimax gods are indistinguishable from “the set of all sets.” I mean, that’s the whole point of such gods. Yet it was long ago demonstrated that “the set of all sets” is as meaningless a concept as “the largest (prime) number.”  The best you can do is a pantheist-style equation of “God” with Sagan’s “Cosmos.” But that just leads to confusion, so why bother?  Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:10 am |  Permalink   I find this argument very strange.  What you are saying is this:  P1 Some things are in principle unknowable. P2 Omniscience, the notion of knowing everything, includes knowing things that are in principle unknowable. P3 This is incoherent. Ergo, there is no god.  The problem lies in P2.  Why does omniscience have to consist of knowing things that are in principle unknowable?  How has it come to be that you have defined omniscience to mean the set of all sets?  And what makes you think that this principle applies to a deity, which is by definition outside of the laws of the universe?  I am not a theist, nor a deist, and I think the arguments presented by religionists are wrong.  I am an atheist.  But your argument is of the same form as those sophistical paradoxes you see online sometimes: “could god create a rock so heavy even he couldn’t lift it?”  And those are not good arguments.  We could just define omniscience to mean “knowing all things that can in principle be known”.  That is not destroyed by your argument, especially if it means, for instance, knowing the absolute position and momentum of every particle in the universe from beginning to end, which a being unconstrained by the laws of the universe could ‘know’, whatever it means to know something under those conditions.  And that certainly sounds like an attribute a supposed deity would have, even if it can’t count to infinity.  It would also enable that deity to have the knowledge to make moral judgements – so your rejection of the notion of omniscience that you have come up with does no damage to the conventional notion of a deity.  You have attached a strong meaning to the word ‘omniscience’ that enables you to make the a priori judgement that it isn’t coherent.  But perhaps you need to read Quine, “Two Dogmas of Empiricism” (yes, I know – philosophy!), to understand why your argument is actually not a good one, and why your a priori rejection of any deity on the grounds of rejecting a strange supposition, wholly linguistic, of Christian theologians is not reasonable.  There are plenty of excellent arguments against all kinds of deities.  Yours is unfortunately not very good.          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:25 am |  Permalink   We could just define omniscience to mean “knowing all things that can in principle be known”.  In so doing, you destroy the meaning of the word, “omnipotence.”  I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers. But because it is impossible for me to know such things, and your definition of “omniscience” excludes that which it is impossible for the individual in question to know, my ignorance of tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers cannot be held against my claim of omniscience.  I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know the precise number of C14 atoms in some random rock on some random planet circling some random star in the Andromeda galaxy. This ignorance, too, does not disprove my claim of omniscience (using your definition).  Continue down the line, and you quickly discover that, everything that I do not know, it is in principle impossible for me to know. I might well be able to learn it at some point in the future, but my current self cannot, in principle, know such things today.  Therefore, by your definition, I, Ben Goren, am omniscient.  Once you start making excuses for a god’s inability to perform a miracle, those same excuses must be applied to all other entities as well. And, as soon as you start handing out those get-out-of-jail-free cards to all comers, it becomes apparent that, once again, the properties attributed to the gods are meaningless.  Besides. Of what point is a miracle if it’s not an instance of the impossible? Jesus didn’t walk on water because it’s something that a space alien with repulsor sandals could do. He did it because nobody can do it. But, if he really walked on water, then it really was possible…and therefore merely impressive, not miraculous.  Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:36 am |  Permalink   Your point about miracles is a non-sequitur.  And you need to revise your definition of “in principle”.  You are stating that you cannot in principle know a number of things that you can, in principle, know.  I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know tomorrow’s winning lottery numbers.  Yes, you can in principle know that. In principle .  You don’t know it (and if you do, then please let me know asap).  But you could, in principle know that.  Heisenberg has some good arguments about the nature of time that rest on a notion of “in principle” that you reject.  Perhaps you should read his Physics and Philosophy to discover what “in principle” can be taken to mean.  In so doing, you destroy the meaning of the word, “omnipotence.”  No – that is only true if you assume that a deity is both omnipotent and omniscient, and while this is certainly the standard formulation, it doesn’t rule out many kinds of deity.  It just means that a deity that is omniscient is not also omnipotent, and while that has obvious implications (ie, there is no Christian god) it doesn’t rule out a deity that i) created the universe, ii) knows everything knowable, iii) makes moral judgements about actions based on knowledge of knowable things, and iv) consigns people to hell for transgressing its moral judgements.  Apart from the notion that god has the power to rain thunderbolts on your head and give you boils, you’ve left some notion of a deity reasonably intact.  And I think we already knew that omniscience, omnipotence, etc, are incompatible – hence theodicy!  That is the primary problem theologians have (apart from, you know, the utter non-existence of their subject matter).  All you’ve done is to restate this problem and say that it is not resolvable.  You may be right, but that’s not a revelation, and it’s certainly not the best argument for atheism, I’m afraid.          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:50 am |  Permalink   You can try to bring all the quantum woo into it you like, but I’m sure Heisenberg, were he here, would assure you that nothing he demonstrated would make possible knowledge outside of one’s relativistic light cone. Tomorrow’s lottery numbers are most emphatically outside that cone.  But never mind that. Permit me to simplify things further.  The very principle of personal knowledge is that one can only know that which is recorded in one’s brain. The process by which such information is recorded is very well known and limited. Once one eliminates that which has not been recorded (or subsequently forgotten) along with that which has never presented the possibility for being recorded, one is left with the set of that which an individual knows being perfectly congruent with the set of that which an individual can, in principle, know. Therefore, by your definition, because there’s no way in principle that the individual could possibly know anything else, everybody is omniscient.  And your claim that it’s possible for an individual to be omniscient (using the traditional naïve definition, not your castrated version) but not omnipotent, but not vice-versa, also falls flat. An omnipotent individual could “use his omnipotence” to make himself omniscient. An omniscient individual would know how to make herself omniscient. Indeed, the two properties are indistinguishable.  Cheers,  b&          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:07 am |  Permalink   And your claim that it’s possible for an individual to be omniscient (using the traditional naïve definition, not your castrated version) but not omnipotent, but not vice-versa, also falls flat. An omnipotent individual could “use his omnipotence” to make himself omniscient. An omniscient individual would know how to make herself omniscient. Indeed, the two properties are indistinguishable.  First of all, I didn’t say ‘not vice versa’.  Nor did I say that an ‘individual’ could be omniscient.  Given the attenuated definition of omniscience that I discussed – one that is still undeniably the property of a ‘deity’ – it is not possible to know how to make yourself omnipotent, because that is in principle unknowable.  But even given your strong version of omniscience, it does not follow than an omniscient being would be able to make itself omnipotent.  It might actually know how, but knowledge of how to do something doesn’t equal capability to do that thing.  It could know how to make itself omnipotent without actually being able to do it.  Either way, it doesn’t hold.  If we define ‘omniscience’ as being ‘knowledge of the position and momentum of every particle in the universe from beginning to end’, which is in principle knowable (ie, it doesn’t turn into knowledge of incoherent things like the largest prime number or the set of all sets), then this is a coherent property, even if it is impossible in the universe (materially, due to recursion).  That means that you can’t reject it due to a priori speculation.  To provide an example of a deity that is not both omniscient and omnipotent, and one that was worshipped for thousands of years by the world’s most powerful empire, I give you Ahura Mazda (or, in Middle Persian, Ohrmazd), benevolent deity of the Zoroastrian religion, state religion of the Achaemenid, Arsacid, and Sasanid empires.  Hardly inconsequential!  Ahura Mazda is supposed to have created the universe; it is supposed to know everything; it is supposed to make moral judgements; but it is not supposed to be omnipotent, because it has no control over ‘evil’ things, which are the domain of Angra Manyu (MP Ahriman).  There was a religious movement in the Sasanian era to confound this – this was notably after the rise of Christianity.  An omnipotent deity was proposed, named Zurvan, who was supposed to have created both Angra Manyu and Ahura Madza.  There was a schism, of course.  There always is.  My point is, if that argument is all you have to go on (and I’m sure it’s not, but….), then you couldn’t be a Zurvanite, but you could be a Zoroastrian.          Chris V.   Posted November 11, 2011 at 2:45 pm |  Permalink   Wait what? Omniscient means “all-knowing”, right? You cannot circumscribe that. The largest prime is not “unknowable”, it simply does not exist. That’s the answer that your omniscient being would give you. The same with your set-of-all-sets; it is simply recursive. It may cause problems for your garden-variety omnipotent being, but not your omniscient ones.            Occam   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:46 pm |  Permalink   “I, Ben Goren, cannot in principle know the precise number of C14 atoms in some random rock on some random planet…”  Small matter of principle indeed, Ben: 14C-isotopes are only assimilated by carbon-based life forms, and therefore found only in fossilised remains thereof (or of their rejections, such as coprolites) or carbonate deposits, and only down to a detection limit of 10-15 half lives, i.e. 55-75 Ky, after which there is hardly any radiocarbon left. Hence, unless carbon-based life forms would have existed whithin that time frame on that random planet around that random star in the Andromeda galaxy, the detectable number of 14C-isotopes on a random “rock” there (organic fossil or piece of carbonate sediment, rather) would be ~zero. An omniscient being would have known that 🙂            Gabrielle Guichard   Posted November 11, 2011 at 1:37 pm |  Permalink   (Outside the topic) I wonder how many believers think that what defines a deity is to be “outside of the laws of the universe”.

David Gerard   Posted November 11, 2011 at 1:42 pm |  Permalink   I’m really not convinced they think that far. “Sophisticated theology” is actually a rarity, for all its practitioners hide behind it.

Sastra   Posted November 11, 2011 at 10:14 am |  Permalink   The Fine Tuning Argument for God has always seemed to me to be one of the weakest and silliest of the arguments. Yet I’ve seen wised and learned atheists spending plenty of time on it, doing calculations and invoking multiple universes — all to get that number down so that the life-allowing properties of the universe becomes less ‘extraordinary’ and therefore more probable.  Doesn’t the whole argument fail before you even get to the calculations and odds, though? I’m not a statistician, but it may not be a matter of statistics. Mel Robbin’s talk on ‘this precious incarnation’ or whatever helps to highlight why.  Here’s the basic set-up of the FTA:  1.) Pick out something that YOU think is special and important — for any reason you want. It could be the life-allowing properties of the universe; it could be life itself; it could be you; it could be the elephant’s trunk; it could be a leaf falling on a particular spot on the sidewalk at 12:05 pm; it could be a single speck of sand on a planet in another galaxy; it could be the speck of sand to the right of that one. Whatever. Select it with reverence.  2.)Now, going back to the beginning of time (or as far as possible), think of all the things that might have happened to prevent this special, important thing from happening. Consider all the different ways things could have been, for all you know. Invoke the multiverse, if you want, as well as all the quantum events and their clouds of probability.  3.) Come up with some calculation of the odds against the special, important thing. For the sake of brevity, we could say it’s going to be something perilously close to ‘infinity to the infinity power …minus one.’  4.) Good. Gape in awe at your discovery: this special, important thing was clearly selected with reverence … by someone . WHO could that someone BE? Who might have picked out something they thought was special and important in advance of what we find after the fact?  Ummmm… can we look at step 1 and hazard a guess?  The whole damn process just seems circular to me. It wouldn’t seem to matter what was selected and what the probabilities are or how they are calculated. The results will be the same. The whole weight and purpose and import of Fine Tuning or ‘precious incarnation’ or any other process that looks at the odds and calculates a miracle is in that first step . In an elaborate and unnecessary scenario, something you select is discovered to have been something selected. A=A.  Am I missing something more critical here?          Tim Martin   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:09 pm |  Permalink   No! I said the same thing here .  “Isn’t the fine tuning argument BS to being with? It’s my understanding that even if the universe is fine-tuned to support life, we are a biased sample because we would have to be alive to think about it. Further, improbable stuff happens all the time, and we don’t even know the prior probability of getting our universe, so our universe is either not improbable, or it is but that doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen.  In other words, the multiverse hypothesis is completely unnecessary in answering the fine-tuning argument, cause it’s a shit argument.”  It’s Statistics 101 that stuff with a very low prior probability happens all the time.

However then there is also a sensible answer, which turns out to be bad for believers: the likelihood for any form of livable conditions is actually rather high. And in any case the weak anthropic principle, as it applies in such cases of changing parameters, would circumvent any small a priori probabilities.            Dr. I.

I don’t doubt that is a causal connection between all of these states, and that the stuff that made up them all actually does exist, but unless they are all exactly the same thing, you cannot say that “you” exist, because your exact properties, including causal properties, are not always the same.  You reduce to a number of parts which are not you – and so you are at most a fleeting composite.

Yes, theological — it’s only by presuming the existence of an immaterial soul (or its philosophical analogue, the Platonic ideal) that one can even begin to get tripped up by the gnats you’re straining at here with “Do I exist?” That your woo is labeled “philosophy” rather than “religion” doesn’t decrease the bullshit content in the slightest.

You are saying, outright, that you exist.  That is the presupposition of someone who believes in an immaterial soul.  All I’m trying to do is make the idea of existence reasonable given what is known about the universe.  How you have managed to derive the notion that I believe in an immaterial soul from this is beyond my powers – it seems like madness.  It is the absolute direct opposite of what I have just said, which is that I probably don’t exist as an independent entity in the universe.  The lepton is also constantly changing — it is always in motion, it might be part of different atomic configurations, and so on.  Yes – but the lepton is the part , not the thing composed.  That is the difference.          Ben Goren   Posted November 11, 2011 at 11:51 am |  Permalink   I’m sorry, but you’re making even less sense now.  I’ve never made any claim that the self is irreducible to little parts, and I laughed at the idiocy of souls in the post you’re replying to. And now you’re declaring that leptons are somehow not “things.”  Regrettably, every conversation I’ve ever had with a philosophy evangelist quickly deteriorates into such incomprehensible blather. How quickly it degenerates from all-knowing immaterial minds that can’t know what it’s like to forget something and all-powerful ghosts that can’t feel powerless to subatomic particles that apparently now don’t exist, either.  You’ll excuse me when I categorize all this as yet another religion, closely related to the religion of Theology, and dismiss it as an utter waste of time. Or maybe you won’t excuse me. I really don’t care.  Cheers,  b&            Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:05 pm |  Permalink   The reason you think I’m making less sense is because you’ve decide to mutilate my points and misunderstand them, seemingly on purpose.  Only that could allow for the crazy things you’ve just said.  Leptons are things – they are elementary particles, and they are irreducible (at least at present).  Their properties are constant, especially their causal properties.  Leptons exist, unambiguously and without qualification.  The same cannot be said for human beings, which have constantly changing properties made up of and reducing to a series of smaller parts with their own properties.  That is the argument that is being made.  Do you see anything in there about souls?  I don’t, and I have no idea how you managed to come up with that.  There are no souls.  There are no essences.  There are elementary particles in various quantities, arranged in certain ways, with their own properties.  Those exist.  Everything else… well, it’s somewhat more debatable.  And I’m not a ‘philosophy evangelist’.  The fact remains that you see fit to pontificate on philosophical issues while having the capability at abstract thinking, it seems, of a sponge.  Philosophy is not a religion.  It isn’t even a thing.  It’s just the name for this kind of abstract thinking.  I note, also, that you haven’t bothered to defend your claim that you unambiguously exist.  I assume that is because it would require that you outline your belief in an essence or soul, something that defines who you are without reference to properties or causal states or anything real.          DV   Posted November 11, 2011 at 12:51 pm |  Permalink   “so you are at most a fleeting composite”  Do composites exist? If yes then you exist. What’s the problem?          Al West   Posted November 11, 2011 at 1:08 pm |  Permalink   First of all, it’s not as simple as that.  I stated it too simply.  You are not simply one composite: you are a great series of incredibly complex composites, each different from the last in properties, from birth to death.  So even if composites, or wholes, can be held to exist, then the issue is still not settled for human beings.  If we say that “I exist” because we can accept that some wholes might exist, then we’re jumping the gun.  You could be a whole, but in a moment your component parts will be different, and so will the arrangement of those parts.  So even if composites ‘exist’, we have a number of composites rather than just one.  And to talk about all of these composites, whose causal properties might reduce to their component parts, as being the same thing – hmm, no dice.  Secondly, if we use the same word, “exist”, for both the irreducible things that make up the whole and the whole itself, then we are being ambiguous.  Third, the discussion comes down to causal properties.  An electron always has the same properties.  One electron is interchangeable in every way with another, because the causal properties of electrons are always the same.  They are little bits of the universe that do not reduce to other bits, and the properties of things made up of electrons fundamentally reduce to the properties of the electrons (or other elementary particles, etc).  If there is something with causal properties that are more than the sum of its parts, then we can talk unambiguously about that thing existing.  Some people have argued that people have causal properties that are more than the sum of their parts while accepting mereological nihilism in every other aspect.  This is called partial mereological nihilism .  Its chief proponent is Trenton Merricks, IIRC.  His book Objects and Persons outlines the idea of mereological nihilism as well as the possibility that consciousness and intention are causal properties that do not reduce to component parts – and that therefore, people can be said to exist, in a sense, albeit not one that allows for personal identity in the way we expect.  I am on the fence about that.  But regardless, it is hardly an easy topic, nor one that can be dismissed out of hand.

It refers to the study of part/whole relations, and it’s a branch of mathematics as well as a philosophical branch.  I suggest consulting wiki – there is doubtless an article on mereology, and probably one on partial mereological nihilism.  Mereological nihilism is the view that only irreducible parts exist; anything consisting of irreducible parts with no new causal properties is not a thing, and cannot be spoken of as existing.  It is a popular view, because it seems to be the most reasonable, but it comes in a few flavours.  Partial mereological nihilism is that only a limited number of special things exist beyond their constituent parts.  This usually means: humans, or things with intentionality/consciousness/intention, etc.            Torbjorn Larsson, OM   Posted November 12, 2011 at 2:16 pm |  Permalink   and philosophy, as everyone knows (surely!), is just stupid.

The probability of an outcome isn’t influenced by the fact that it already happened. There’s still (1-p) versions of you that could have existed but don’t.  The probability of rolling a “6” on a six-sided die is one in six, even if its sitting there showing a 6.          Tim Martin   Posted November 11, 2011 at 2:36 pm |  Permalink   The probability of anything is based on what you already know of it.  If you ask what was the probability of a person with your genetic code coming into existence at the moment your dad ejaculated inside your mom, the answer would be 1/280 million or less, since the sperm that became you was one of 280 million in that ejaculate (and there was always the possibility that none of them would have fertilized the egg, or the embryo would not have implanted, thus 1/280 million or less ).  If you ask what was the probability of a person with your genetic code coming into existence at any time before that moment, we have to calculate the probability of that moment occurring (and the moment that led to that moment occurring, and so on), so the chances just get worse and worse the more unknowns you let into the equation.  There is no single answer to the question “what is the probability of X?” It depends on what you know about the problem. And if you know that X has already happened, then the probability of X are exactly 1, every time.          Tom Dobrzeniecki   Posted November 12, 2011 at 6:32 am |  Permalink   Chet: I would disagree. To the extent that it makes sense to speak of the probability of an event that has already happened, the probability of the die being a “6” after it is rolled and has come up as “6” is one.  The probability of a another “6” coming up on SUBSEQUENT rolls is 1/6.  Those are two different things.  As Mr. Gerard wrote in comment #1, probability really deals with the state of knowledge of the observer with regard to some future event.  I already know the first roll has come up “6”.  I DON’T know how future rolls will come up, so the probability is 1/6 for those.

RFW   Posted November 12, 2011 at 5:28 am |  Permalink   It seems to me that the question is deeply flawed. At the very least “you” and “exist” are not clearly and objectively defined. And I’m not even sure that “probability” is a valid concept in the present context.  Jerry, in one of his earlier paragraphs, posits a definition of “you” that includes parentage back to the beginning of time, but from where I sit, a more reasonable definition is that “you” is distinguished by a particular combination of genes. [Note that this leaves out of the question non-genetic aspects of development, but if the definition of “you” includes “did your mother eat a lot of peanut butter during pregnancy?” then the whole issue falls to the ground in a welter of meaninglessness.]  The question, as I see it, thus becomes (a) how many genes are there in the human genome and (b) how many alleles does each gene have? IOW, how many genetically distinct humans are possible? The probability — if the concept is meaningful in this context — then becomes 1/(number of possible genetically distinct individuals).  I have no idea how many genes there are in the H. sap. genome, nor how many alleles there are for each one. Even if we just have an average number of alleles per gene, an approximation is possible. Anyone have the numbers handy?  PS: In this formulation of the question, note that “you” is not necessarily unique. In particular, identical twins are the same “you”.          sailor1031   Posted November 12, 2011 at 6:57 am |  Permalink   Best not to overthink this.

But the principle is still the same: it shows the fallacy of the anthropic principle—or of Douglas Adams’s self-reflecting puddle.  Those are two different things, the a posteriori scientific anthropic principle and the a priori religious anthropic argument. The fallacy belongs to the latter, while the former is untouched by it.  I would like for scientists to acknowledge what physics have to say about this. The weak anthropic principle is the observation that if parameter varies, the likeliest spot to find observers is where the parameters are compatible with them. That is why, for example, we found life on Earth and not on the Moon.  The anthropic argument is a large number argument fallacy: large number, therefore gods. It is based on the scam that a priori probabilities has anything to say on a posteriori probabilities. Or in other word that we should find life on both Earth and the Moon.  In this context, I would think that applying WAP on an individual, let us call it the Coyne Anthropic Principle, would say that it is likeliest to find Coyne’s parents and not other couples as responsible for Coyne’s birth. Which seems like something with a likelihood on the order of ~ 1. =D  The WAP, in the form of generalized environmental principles (looking for star or dust production) is currently the most predictive theories post-standard cosmology.

In order for our Universe to exist, it must have a finite probability of creation, given a multiverse.      In order for you to exist, a great many unlikely events needed to unfold in exactly the way that they did. The exact sperm cell and egg cell needed to meet to create you with the DNA sequence that encoded you, and brought you into existence; a one-in-250 million chance for a sperm cell alone. That needed to happen each time in an unbroken string for millions of generations of your ancestors, going back to well before they were human beings or even hominids of any type. Other unlikely events needed to occur as well: life needed to take hold on Earth, Earth needed to form as a habitable planet with the right ingredients for life out of the ashes of previously dead stars, the laws of physics needed to be such that they permitted life, and the Universe itself must have unfolded in such a way as to make all of this possible.     NASA/CXC/M.Weiss      A standard cosmic timeline of our Universe's history. A series of extremely unlikely events all needed to occur in order so that you would exist.      Yet there's one thing we can be sure of in this entire series of unlikely events, occurring one after the other: nothing that occurred at any point had an infinitesimal likelihood. Instead, every single event, including:     the mutations and meiosis crossovers in the DNA of each of your ancestors,  the survival of every one of them to reproductive age,  the finding of the particular mate needed to give rise to the next generation of your particular ancestors,  the creation of this exact planet with the exact extinction history that it's had,  the formation of stars and galaxies in the Milky Way to create the environment in which Earth formed,  the creation of the original, initial density conditions of the Universe that make it possible for gravity to create us,  the realization of the laws of nature that they would be exactly sufficient to create us,  and that our Universe would have come to exist out of the great abyss of nothingness that came before,   must have had finite odds of occurring. Even the emergence of our Universe from the Multiverse couldn't have had an infinitely small probability.     Lee Davy / flickr      An example of parallel worlds, or alternative outcomes for a world created with our initial conditions. Bayes' theorem has implications for the way our world turned out.       How do we know this, you ask? It isn't physics that tells us this is so, but rather a more fundamental theorem about basic probability itself: Bayes' theorem . This mathematical idea is devastatingly simple, but its consequences are incredibly complex. On its own, Bayes' theorem is simply a rule to tell you the probability that something is true, given knowledge of conditions that are related to that thing you're trying to measure. For example, perhaps you're hungry right now and perhaps you're not, and one possibly related factor is the time of day. If you know the time of day and the time of day is related to your hunger, you can more accurately assess whether you're likely to be hungry or not, probabilistically, than if you didn't know the time of day. Bayes' theorem tells you that and a whole lot more.     mattbuck of Wikimedia Commons      One of the most fundamental and useful rules in probability is Bayes' theorem, mathematically expressed in blue neon at the offices of Autonomy in Cambridge.      What it does is take any two events, like being hungry ( A ) and the time of day ( B ), and relates them by saying:   The probability that A is true if B is given is equal to the probability that B is true if A is given, multiplied by the probability that A is true (independent of B ) and divided by the probability that B is true (independent of A ).   You can apply that to your hunger based on time, the creation of you based on your biological parents' genetic material, the existence of Earth based on the interstellar environment where our Solar System formed, or the existence of this Universe based on the conditions that came beforehand. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical rule that can be applied to any system at all, in principle.     Bock et al. (2006, astro-ph/0604101); modifications by E. Siegel      The history of our Universe is filled with a number of fantastic events, but they all must have occurred exactly as they did in order to give rise to the Universe as we observe it today.      But there's a fun, important, and underappreciated consequence of Bayes' theorem that can tell us something vital about any of these steps: the odds of any one of them happening, no matter how small, could not have been infinitesimal. If you want to create our Universe with our laws of physics, our local group, our Sun, our Earth, and every one of us, given all the conditions that existed before the Big Bang, that probability may be very, very small, but it can't be infinitely small. If it were, our model for the conditions that existed before the Big Bang could be ruled out immediately, with no need to gather data or make measurements.     Max Pixel / public domain      Rolling five 'sixes' in a single dice roll of five dice is an unlikely outcome, which will only happen one out of 7,776 rolls, on average, but given an infinite number of rolls., you'd get an infinite number of results like this.      The reason is that the probability of A  not happening, given B , must then be equal to 1, or 100%. If the probability of A happening (regardless of B ) goes to zero, then the probability of "not A " happening goes to 1. At a fundamental level, our Universe is based in probabilities, as quantum mechanics uncomfortably taught us in the 20th century. It's only the act of observing, interacting, measuring or otherwise "determining" the state of a system that forces any system into a particular state. With every measurement we make, we can be sure that the outcome of our experiment, however unlikely, still had a finite, non-zero probability of occurring.     Dr. Tonomura and Belsazar of Wikimedia Commons      The wave pattern for electrons passing through a double slit, one-at-a-time. Each electron's results have a finite probability of occurring. If you measure “which slit” the electron goes through, however, you destroy the quantum interference pattern shown here.      Scientists often argue over cosmic inflation, the model for the origin of our Universe , with some contending that a major problem of inflation is that it gives an infinite number of possible outcomes, all of which are equally likely. But if that were true, and the odds of a Universe turning out like ours were completely infinitesimal, then that model could be immediately ruled out. If there were an infinite number of other possible outcomes that occurred 100% of the time, then there would be no way to obtain our own Universe.     E. Siegel      Even though inflation may continue for an infinite amount of time and over an infinite volume of space, the odds of inflation ending and giving rise to a Universe like ours, any point in time, must be finite.      This is true for all types of probabilities! So the next time something unlikely happens, or you realize that something very unlikely must have already occurred, remember that no matter how unlikely it is, the odds of it happening weren't infinitely small.

Posted December 31, 2011 by Dan Falk in Philosophy of science , Probability science    Have you ever wondered how  likely – or unlikely – it is that you exist?  Although  it may sound pie-in-the-sky, it’s really a scientific problem, though  you don’t have to be a scientist to be captivated by it.  Take, for example, the wonderfully-named Cosmicomics of 20 th -century Italian writer Italo  Calvino – a collection of whimsical, science-fiction-flavoured short  stories.  One of the stories, called “How Much Shall We Bet,”  involves two characters, the narrator (with the unpronounceable name  “Qfwfq”) and someone named “Dean (k)yK.”  The two men seem  to have existed since the before the beginning of the universe – somehow separate from the universe, whatever that could mean – and they  seem to be immortal.  All they do is make an endless series of  bets regarding what sorts of things will happen in their cosmos.  As you might imagine, the series  of events that they bet on, and the series of events that actually unfold,  are rather familiar:  They seem to resemble the actual events that  have unfolded in the history of our own universe.  Their first  bet is on the formation of atoms; the narrator bets for it, while Dean  bets against it.  They go on betting on the formation of various  chemical elements, and, looking billions of years ahead, they bet as  to whether the Assyrians will invade Mesopotamia.  We’re told that  Dean always bets no, “not because he believed the Assyrians wouldn’t  do it, but because he refused to think there would ever be Assyrians  and Mesopotamia and the Earth and a human race.”  Let’s begin with the big  philosophical questions:  First there’s the issue of determinism – roughly, whether the “stuff that happens” in the universe is  largely, or perhaps completely, determined by what came before.   This is something that thinkers have wrestled with for 2,500 years,  and I won’t attempt to add to that discussion here; but it is worth  mentioning that most versions of determinism seem to place free will  in jeopardy, making them rather unappetizing (though not necessarily  wrong).  (But I would say that, wouldn’t, if I were destined  to say it?)  Secondly, assuming that the  future is not fully determined by the present, there’s the  string of probabilities associated with each development along the way  to “us.”  Thinking again of Calvino’s story:  Before you  can have Assyrians, you have to have human beings, and before you can  have human beings you have to have life, and before you can have life  you have to have a habitable planet orbiting a star at just the right  distance… it does sound like a leaning tower of improbabilities, doesn’t  it?  In my next blog post, I’ll  explore what I think is the weakest link in that chain – the  appearance of intelligent life.  But first, let’s have  some more fun with the ideas and the numbers.  Certainly, the more specific  the outcome, more improbable it seems.  If you consider some particular state of affairs, and then ask what the odds are, starting  from today and going back even a short time (let alone the 3.8 billion  years to when life first appeared on this planet), that particular state  will seem extraordinarily unlikely.  For example, imagine turning  the clock back five years.  From that perspective, what were the  odds that, on this particular day, you would be sitting in this particular  room, in this city, reading this particular sentence?  And what something even more  basic – say, your own existence?  A couple of months ago,  a “probability chart” produced by Harvard Law School blogger  Ali Binazir went somewhat viral, encouraging people to contemplate this  very question.  In the chart, Binazir calculates just how improbable  it was that the right sperm from your father hooked up with the right  egg produced by your mother – by his estimate, it’s about one chance  in 400 quadrillion (that number seems only slightly more tame in scientific  notation: 4 x 10^17).  And that’s hardly the whole battle:   To even get to that stage, all of your ancestors, going all the way  back to the beginning of life on Earth, had to survive to reproductive  age.  Multiplying the string of probabilities together, he concludes  that the odds of your existence are an astronomical one in 10^2,685.000.   (As you can imagine, not everyone in the blogosphere was kind to Binazir;  one asked if it was painful to pull those numbers out of you-know-where.)  To be sure, we can quibble  about the precise figures.  But I’m sure we can agree that the  chances of anything specific happening, viewed from a remote  enough point in the past, seem absurdly low.  And yet, for some  reason, we often weave stories in which historical events have a flavour  of inevitability to them.  Think how many science fiction stories  you’ve read on the theme of time travel, in which the time traveller  attempts to “change history,” only to find that what was going to  happen, happens anyway.  Push history, and it pushes back.  If you’re a Stephen King  fan, you’ll know that his latest book, 11-22-63 , involves a  time traveller who attempts to prevent the Kennedy assassination (which  of course took place on the date that gives the book its title).   As you might guess, even with several years lead-time, preventing the  fatal shot from being fired from the Dallas book depository is no simple  task.  As filmmaker Errol Morris puts it in his review of King’s  book :  “What if history is too forceful to redirect?   What if jiggering the engine produces no favourable outcome – merely  a postponement of the inevitable?  If he had lived, Kennedy might  not have escalated the war in Vietnam, and might have kept America out  of a bloody mire.  But we don’t know.  What if we were headed  there anyway?  Then our tampering might only make things worse.   It is not historical inevitability, but something close.”  These kinds of questions, about  the inevitability (or otherwise) of history, have made their way into  our popular culture, so I’m happy to give the last word to Lisa Simpson.   I’m thinking of a Halloween episode in which Lisa had lost  a tooth; as part of an experiment for a science fair project, she leaves  the tooth in a glass of cola overnight.  Sure enough, the next  morning she sees a peculiar mould growing on it; and looking through  her microscope, she sees that she’s crated little cave men.   Some hours later she looks again, and the little people are undergoing  what appears to be the Renaissance; soon, one of the little people is  seen nailing something to the cathedral door.  She gasps:  “I’ve  created Lutherans!”  More on likelihood of life  – and intelligent life in particular – next time.

Credit: David Aguilar, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics     When life originates on a planet, whether Earth or a distant world, the newborn life-forms may have to overcome incredible odds to come into existence — and a new equation lays out exactly how overwhelming those odds may be.  The creators of the equation hope it can connect diverse areas of research that aim to answer long-standing questions about the origins of life, much like how the famous Drake equation pulled together research concerning communications from intelligent life.  "The idea of the equation, at some level, is to try to connect the unknown, presumably microscopic events that … give rise to the first thing that we would call a living system — to connect those microscopic components to the macroscopic fact of whether a planet has life starting on it," Caleb Scharf, an astrophysicist at Columbia University and lead author of the new work, told Space.com. [ 8 Newfound Alien Worlds Could Potentially Support Life ]  The Drake equation, originally penned by astronomer Frank Drake in the 1960s, laid out a series of terms estimating how many intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations likely exist in the Milky Way. The equation takes into account factors such as the rate of star formation in the galaxy, the fraction of planets where life emerges, and the fraction of that life that gains intelligence and the capability to broadcast its presence into space. Over the years, the equation has acted as a road map for researchers searching for communications signals created by intelligent civilizations beyond Earth. Scharf and his co-author Lee Cronin, a chemist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, hope to provide a similar road map to researchers trying to work out how — and how often — life forms on a given planet.  "It came out of a moment in the field where we were trying to bring some cohesion to this study of origins of life," which is notorious for its disparate areas of focus, Scharf said. "To my mind, what this equation is trying to do, or at least trying to prompt people to think about, is how you make that connection — how do you go from some story about how life may have originated on Earth to a quantitative assessment of the probability that that happened, and what that means for life elsewhere in the universe," he said.  Series of steps  The new equation breaks down the process of abiogenesis — the formation of life from nonliving components — into a series of simpler factors. Those factors incorporate the planet's conditions, the ingredients needed to form life and the likelihood of those ingredients getting into the right configuration for life to emerge. As with the Drake equation, each of the terms is straightforward to describe, but each hides additional complexity and room for new research.  Here is the equation:       The average number of origin-of-life events for a given planet = (number of building blocks on planet) × 1/(average [mean] number of building blocks needed per "organism") × (availability of building blocks during time t) × (probability of assembly in a given time) × time.  Credit: Caleb Scharf and Lee Cronin    On the left, the equation considers the average (mean) expected number of origin-of-life events for a given planet. To get there, it takes into account the number of potential "building blocks" for life on the planet, the average number of building blocks needed to create a living system, the availability of those building blocks during a given time and the probability of that assembly happening during that time.  On Earth, building blocks for life take the form of amino acids, lipids and certain essential metals. Somewhere else, though, an entirely different set of ingredients could create enough complexity to form life — the equation doesn't assume any specific set is necessary.  "We're being kind of sneaky," Scharf said. "I think it's one of the beautiful things about it: If you write the equation this way, you don't necessarily have to worry about all the fine, fine details, but what you do do is, you start to break open the factors that you might be able to put some numbers to."  For instance, if you know the size of a planet and its composition, you can begin to estimate how many potential building blocks for life there are on the planet. To calculate whether those building blocks are actually available to form life, you'd have to know more about the conditions on the planet, such as its temperature, which could render some of the blocks unusable or inaccessible.  For example, these blocks could be unusable or inaccessible if they're always in gaseous form or if water is not readily available — although future research might show that life could emerge in more scenarios than scientists currently know about.  In that way, the equation "links where people in exoplanetary science may actually begin to get some data, on the size of planets, the composition, and so on, to the piece that we still don't really understand but we know must have some kind of probability of happening": how it is that life first begins, Scharf said.  A trillion test tubes  The value P a , which is the probability that life will assemble out of those particular building blocks over a given time, is murkier — and much more interesting. If the value of P a is very low, it's extremely unlikely that life will form even when the ingredients are there — potentially explaining why humans haven't yet happened to create life in the lab , even if scientists have used the right ingredients, Scharf said. But a planet-wide "lab" would increase the odds that life-creating events will occur.  "We might have to wait 100 million years for it to fall into place just in a test tube," Scharf said. "Whereas on a planet scale, you've got a trillion test tubes — probably even more than that. It's conceivable that, using this equation, playing these games, is hinting at a possible explanation for why we haven't seen life miraculously appearing in our laboratories, that … there's some subtle thing that has to happen that really doesn't happen often."  And if the scale is larger than planetary, Scharf said, that could further increase the likelihood of life forming. Early Earth and Mars, for example, were cultivating their own, separate chemistries, but the early solar system was chaotic ; impacts with other solar system bodies could have resulted in material exchanges between the two planets. That would have led to even more "test tubes" — the chemical mixing could have allowed even more interactions to occur, potentially hitting the right combination, Scharf said.  If multiple planets exchange materials, it could lead to a sort of "chemical amplification [that] could, in principle, be hugely important," he said. "It could be all the difference between getting life to occur or not, especially when we're dealing with such tiny, tiny probabilities on the microscopic scale of something going right," he added.  Factoring our ignorance  Scharf hopes that the new equation can bring together the different areas of research that relate to each of the equation's terms. For instance, the equation provides an opportunity to combine detailed examinations of far-off exoplanets, chemical research about how different molecules in different physical states can interact to generate complexity, and investigations of the smallest possible units that can exhibit living traits. Combining these areas of research, in turn, could help to link scientists' large-scale understanding of exoplanets to the microscopic chemical interactions, Scharf said.  "It's not an answer; it's a new tool for trying to think about the issues involved," Ed Turner, an astronomer at Princeton University, told Space.com. Turner was not involved in the work, but the paper's definition of the left-hand probability — the expected number of origin-of-life events — draws heavily from his work to allow for incorporating scientists' uncertainty about the origins of life based on observations of life on Earth (and how much weight to give those observations ).  "To really put numbers on those, to think very specifically about a lot of the factors in their equation, will require a lot more knowledge about exoplanets than we have now," Turner said. "We may be decades off from being able to talk about things like the total mass of building blocks on a planet's surface and things like that."  Turner pointed out that the same was true about the Drake equation: Scientists have been able to quantify only some of the terms recently, such as the number of potentially habitable planets. Therefore, the equation could become more useful as the science progresses, he said. In the meantime, it can act to "divide our ignorance into different factors" and focus research on those different components, Turner added. [ The Father of SETI: Q&A with Astronomer Frank Drake ]  But some of the factors — especially biological ones, such as the switch from nonliving to living organisms — may not be understood anytime soon, he said.  Paul Davies, an astrobiologist at Arizona State University who was not involved in the study, also said that the term that incorporates the probability of nonlife becoming life will be among the hardest to define.  "We don't know the mechanism whereby nonlife turns into life, so we have no way of estimating the odds … It may be one in a trillion trillion (it's easy to imagine that), in which case, Earth life may be unique in the observable universe," Davies told Space.com in an email. "But P a may be quite large. We simply can't say."  "Setting that aside, I think the remaining terms are discussed in a very useful way as a conceptual framework for research," he added.  To get a grip on that probability, humanity would have to encounter another instance of life's emergence beyond our own for comparison. Future observatories that can see exoplanets in more detail, like the James Webb Space Telescope , may be able to detect signatures from life in earlier forms than Drake might have thought we'd spot — life on the microscopic scale rather than life actively communicating with humanity. That kind of data could help illustrate what other forms life can take.  The work also mentions the possibility of life arising multiple times using different building blocks — for instance, that some form of life that previously existed on Earth, or one that exists currently but is unknown to science, came into being separately from our brand of life with a totally different chemical vocabulary. Davies said that a good step toward narrowing down the likelihood would be to investigate Earth's own organisms for evidence of this possibility.  "We just need one other sample of life (second genesis) and the field is transformed, because we would know P a can't be exceedingly small," Davies said. "And that sample might be right here on Earth. Frankly, almost nobody has looked."  The new work was detailed July 4 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Skip to content     William M. Briggs            Menu            The Probability Of Your Existence   September 4, 2017 by Briggs 23 Comments on The Probability Of Your Existence Statistics        On Labor Day, it’s well to ponder your existence. A version of this column originally ran 7 July 2014.  To the nearest order of magnitude, there have existed, including us, about 100 billion human beings.  This proves what was always, until our day, quite obvious: that people are good at breeding. Or were, before discovering contraception, abortion, and sexual dissipation of course.  That’s a lot of people in a relatively short period of time, geologically speaking, considering the human species has only existed some few hundred thousand years.  According to Harvard Law blogger Ali Binazir , author of Awaken Your Genius, you, dear reader, only have a “1 in 10 2,685,000 ” chance of existing.  Pretty small, no?  But since there’s been so many of us, each one of us being next to impossible according to these odds, something has gone wrong in the calculations or in our thinking about them.  Nothing better illustrates the truth that all probability is conditional than Binazir’s calculation. It’s sort of a Drake equation for individual human existence. The Drake equation is a probability-like calculation which gives the chances of other life forms like us, i.e. beings possessed on intellect and will, existing on other planets. It is notorious in its liquidity: it won’t stay solid. Binzair’s calculations suffer from the same flaws. He’s unable to keep straight which side of the equation he’s on.  Given you’re reading this post, the probability you exist is 1, i.e. it is certain. That’s because there must be a you to read. But Binazir tells us that the probability you exist is a number practically 0, the other end of the probability spectrum.  Both probabilities can be right, since all probabilities depend on the premises used. And it depends on the meaning of those premises, too. Does “to exist” mean “being made” or “alive and functioning now”?  Alive and functioning now is easy: you exist certainly. But how did you get made?  Well, mom met dad and they did what came naturally. Out came you. You, logic insists, could not be other than you.  This is necessary to emphasize.  The probability your parents had any kids is also 1, because you are one of them. But the probability that two mated humans reproduce is different. That probability doesn’t exist because no premises have been specified. One possible premise: both male and female are over 80 years old. Another: one is sterile, by natural or artificial means. Another: One belongs to the push-up club and eats his clams. And on and on.  Now each time the mates attempt to reproduce, either a baby is produced or it isn’t, a tautology. In either case, something caused the baby to be made or to stop it from being made. We (typically) won’t be in the position of knowing these exact causes, so we say the creation or lack of it is “random”, which is just another label of our ignorance of the causes. But if we assume these causes are “regular”, and are careful to specify the kind of mates to which they apply (say, 20-30 year-olds, of this and such background, etc.), then we can use probability to express our incomplete knowledge and make reasonable predictions over groups of mates.  In any case, we are not asking what is the probability your parents had kids, because they obviously did. We asking the probability of you yourself coming into being.  Assuming each of your mom’s and dad’s gametes were unique (are male gametes like snowflakes? has anybody checked? I ask in ignorance), then each mating could make a different baby. But each mating will have a list of causes which either make or stop the baby.  So again we’re not talking about what causes the individual gametes to meet.  What premises to use? On those for any individual attempt? If so, there are a number of male gametes and a fixed female gamete. In ignorance of the causes, and assuming conception, there are n male gametes and one female, thus the probability is 1/n that this male gamete meets this fixed female one. Is that newly created baby you or somebody else?  Assuming no conception, then no you and no anybody else either. What is the probability of no conception? Well, what premises do we assume?  You can see this is getting nowhere slow.  The problem is in the question. What is the probability you exist? This is not what is the probability somebody else exists, or the probability somebody in your place exists.  It isn’t even the probability some other human exists—which is one by the plain meaning of the question. Why? Because people exist.  You exist, too. Therefore it must be the probability you exist is 1. That you might not have existed is a counterfactual question, which is perfectly comprehensible as long as we supply the premises under which you would not have existed. Say, you imagine your dad got called away on a business trip during the time in which your parents conceived you.  Or that your dad never met your mom. Then, given those premises, the probability would not have existed is also 1, because there would have been no causal way of you coming into existence.  Face it. Probability is never as easy as you hope it is.  ————————————————————————————-  Thanks to The Carolina Cowbody for suggesting this topic.

I ask in ignorance)  Very probably (heh) yes.  The process of meiosis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis includes a step called “crossing over” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover where the chromosomes exchange genetic material and making each eventual gamete unique.  The process essentially mixes up the DNA from both parents of the individual producing the gametes which has the benefit of passing genetic diversity (a good thing) to the next generation.          Gary  says:     July 7, 2014 at 10:40 am      Shouldn’t the question be what is the probability of predicting correctly that a specific person will exist?  Which, too, depends on the details of the specification.  Merely male, ~ 0.5.  Male American, ~ 0.025.

I felt good when I saw the title of the post I thought the probability of me existing is 1.  Now, back to the weekly humbling that is me trying to understand the Sunday posts on Aquinas.  At least that’s what’s happening now.  I mean right now.          Hans Erren  says:     July 7, 2014 at 4:25 pm      and now the probability of the universe…          Jersey McJones  says:     July 7, 2014 at 6:08 pm      Given all the stuff there is in the universe, and given that we are made of all the same stuff as the rest of it (proof you don’t need God to make us, as we’re not made of anything that isn’t around us), I’d say we’re not all that surprising.  I’m sure there are lots of weird critters around the universe.  That we have certain features, that would narrow things, but again, I’m sure there are all sorts of weird features out there too.  JMJ          MattS  says:     July 7, 2014 at 8:02 pm      “Given all the stuff there is in the universe, and given that we are made of all the same stuff as the rest of it (proof you donâ€™t need God to make us, as weâ€™re not made of anything that isnâ€™t around us)”  One of the very first principles discovered by science is that life does not arise spontaneously from non-living matter.  So, unless you are arguing that we aren’t really alive, the mere fact that we are made of the same materials as the rest of the universe is not proof that we don’t need God to make us.          Jersey McJones  says:     July 7, 2014 at 9:04 pm      “One of the very first principles discovered by science is that life does not arise spontaneously from non-living matter.”  No.  There is no such principle.  Silliness.  JMJ          Sander van der Wal  says:     July 7, 2014 at 11:44 pm      Most of the universe is made of spacetime. We are not made of spacetime.  Almost all particles in the universe are Dark Matter particles. We are not made of Dark Matter particles.  There are a few fermions (quarks and electrons) around. We are made of fermions.  So we are made of the rarest stuff in the universe.

Paraphrase of Rene Descartes” That reminds me of a “Raymond Smullyan” joke: “I think, therefore I am– could be–  unless I’m really someone else who only THINKS they’re me”          Mike Ozanne  says:     July 8, 2014 at 9:16 pm      Just to be clear are you asking us to evaluate :  1) the probabilty that we (I) has spontaneously arisen  2) the probability that the two meiotic sets that make up my DNA  might ever come together  3) given that my existence is predicated on being born from parents, the probability that my DNA will be generated from the available meiotic combinations  crossed with the risk of mutation and copying error  .??          Joseph Hertzlinger  says:     July 10, 2014 at 11:30 pm      If there have been 100 billion human beings, that means only 93% of all humans have died. In other words, the theory that “all men are mortal” is no longer established to within a 95% confidence interval.          Joy  says:     September 4, 2017 at 9:36 am      Joseph Hertzinger makes a good point in humour.  That ‘all men are mortal’ is taken to be true (for purposes of explanation) because nobody has seen any  other type.  Oh yes, and we understand the essence of man, slugs and snails and puppy dog tails, DNA and all that.  If all that is required to be included in the set is ‘being a man’ then Jesus fulfils the which means that to be true ‘man’ needs to be more accurately qualified.  …but never mind, as long as the calculator knows what he’s talking about.  If the robot is told ‘all men are moral’ who is it to question? it won’t know to question the statement and will churn out an answer based on the arithmetic. Robots are very trusting, being not free to do anything else.  Probability is only as hard as you make it.  If you pretend, for argument’s sake, the universe is a casino and use algebra for added truthiness it will fool a lot of people, most of the time.          Gary  says:     September 4, 2017 at 10:04 am      Assuming each of your mom’s and dad’s gametes were unique (are male gametes like snowflakes? has anybody checked? I ask in ignorance), then each mating could make a different baby. The process of meiosis does indeed produce unique gametes at a point where a pair of homologous chromosomes exchange their DNA.  Because an individual’s chromosomes are not identical (one comes from each parent) this trading of material makes them different yet again.  Considering that the exchange location can occur at very many places and each one of the 23 human chromosome set can perform this trick, the genetic material of each gamete is for all practical purposes unique. Wikipedia provides a technical explanation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis          Rexx Shelton  says:     September 4, 2017 at 11:42 am      I am glad that you decided to go over this again, I wounder what brought you back to it, I had let it fall out of my mind completely.          Bob Kurland  says:     September 4, 2017 at 3:40 pm      Interesing!! now it isn’t only the DNA, but it’s the way the DNA expresses itself.  That’s epigenesis and is affected by the environment.   That’s why “identical twins” (same DNA from a split fertilized egg) aren’t actually identical.  So what’s the probability of twin A vs twin B???          Bob Kurland  says:     September 4, 2017 at 3:41 pm      I didn’t check the “get new comments” box          FilipG  says:     September 9, 2017 at 1:30 pm      Hey, you should read “De Impossibilitate Vitae” and “De Impossibilitate Prognoscendi” by Cezar Kouska. Or at least the review by Stanis?aw Lem.          Dean  says:     December 31, 2017 at 12:23 pm      It seems to me that the probability of me existing is/has always been 1.  All probabilities exist in the same way that nothing exists.  There isn’t a 1 without a 0.  The real question may be the definition of “exist” or the “here and now”.

Cody Fenwick , Alternet  The probability of human existence, calculated “The Copernicus Complex” explores new scientific discoveries informing and guiding our estimates John Horgan , The Scientific American 2014-11-23T15:00:00Z • 2014-11-23T15:00:00Z This article was originally published by Scientific American . I’m writing this post for two reasons. One is to recommend a new book by Columbia astrobiologist Caleb Scharf (who also writes a terrific Scientific American blog, “ Life, Unbounded “), and the other is to defend an old book of mine.  In his new book Caleb Scharf writes: "So are we unusual or not?... Neither side is yet a winner. But we are much, much closer to an answer than we have ever been in the history of the human species; we are on the cusp of knowing."  Scharf’s book is The Copernicus Complex: Our Cosmic Significance in a Universe of Planets and Probabilities . I loved Scharf’s book, and so I brought him to my school, Stevens Institute of Technology, to talk about it this week. Here’s how I introduced him: “The Copernicus Complex addresses some of the deepest questions humans have ever asked. How weird are we? Was our existence highly probable, or improbable? Even miraculous? You can break this question down into more specific questions: How probable was our universe? Our galaxy? Solar system? Planet? How probable was life? And how probable were creatures like us, who can ponder their probability? For thousands of years, anyone could speculate about our weirdness, from Plato to pot-smoking college kids, because no one had any answers. It was just philosophy, pure guesswork. But new scientific discoveries are informing and guiding estimates of our probability. This is the story that Caleb Scharf tells brilliantly in The Copernicus Complex .” “Pure guesswork” was a gratuitous jab at my Stevens philosophy buddies. Otherwise, I meant everything I said in my introduction, especially the last sentence. Scharf provides an exceptionally clear, entertaining, up-to-date report on observations and conjectures bearing on what I call our “weirdness.” Scharf delves into exoplanets (4,000 discovered so far), and also microbiomes, Bayesian inference, planetary dynamics, multiverses, the anthropic principle, the Fermi Paradox, the RNA world theory and lots of other fascinating topics. All this work is provoking reconsideration of the Copernicus Principle, which holds, as Scharf puts it, that “we are not the center of all existence; we are not ‘special.’” Now I come to the second reason for writing this post. In The Guardian , journalist Tim Radford praises Copernicus Complex as “an intoxicating collection of questions answered with other questions. A couple of decades ago, physicists spoke confidently of a theory of everything, and one or two even proposed an end to science. All has now changed. The mysteries have multiplied.” I don’t know any physicists who proposed “an end to science” two decades ago, but I did. In my 1996 book The End of Science , I argued that “pure” science, which I defined as the “quest to understand the universe and our place in it,” may be drawing to a close. “Further research may yield no more revelations or revolutions but only diminishing returns.” I addressed the same questions that Scharf does in Copernicus Complex . I examined physicists’ efforts to explain how our universe came to be, and why it took a form that allowed us to exist. I also looked at attempts by “chaoplexologists,” notably Stuart Kauffman (also mentioned by Scharf), to estimate the probability of life, including intelligent, multicellular creatures like us. (I coined the term “chaoplexity” to describe research into chaos and complexity, which are virtually indistinguishable.) I did not anticipate the thrilling recent surge in discoveries of exoplanets, which have revealed that planetary systems are quite common. Those observations, as I said when introducing Scharf, are “informing and guiding”—that is, enriching–discussions about our probability. But answers to the biggest questions remain as elusive as ever.  Scientists still don’t have a clue why our universe has the form we observe, or how life began on the Earth some 3.6 billion years ago, or whether life exists elsewhere. During his talk at Stevens, Scharf acknowledged that we may never observe exoplanets in sufficient detail to know, with certainty, that they harbor life. In the “Afterword” of the paperback version of The End of Science, I noted that scientists, lacking data that can fully resolve questions about our probability, choose answers for philosophical and even emotional reasons. I wrote: “Unfortunately, you cannot determine the probability of the universe or of life on Earth when you have only one universe and one history of life to contemplate. Statistics require more than one data point. The utter lack of empirical data does not stop scientists and philosophers from holding strong opinions on these matters. On one side are inevitabilists, who take comfort in theories portraying reality as the highly probable and even necessary outcome of immutable laws. Most scientists are inevitabilists. Perhaps the most prominent was Einstein, who rejected quantum mechanics because it implied that God ‘plays dice with the universe.’ On the other side are the anti-inevitabilists–notably Karl Popper, Stephen Jay Gould and Ilya Prigogine–who see scientific determinism as a threat to human freedom. We are either pawns of destiny or wildly improbable flukes. Take your pick.” I hope this situation changes, but I fear it won’t, in spite of continued research in cosmology, astrobiology, chaoplexity and other fields. Scharf writes toward the end of his book: “So are we unusual or not?… Neither side is yet a winner. But we are much, much closer to an answer than we have ever been in the history of the human species; we are on the cusp of knowing.” We may be on the cusp of knowing, and yet still infinitely far away.

But just how small? Dr. Ali Binazir illustrates the extremely unlikely chain of events that would have to occur in order for you to be born with this example in a blog post: Imagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean and there is exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere. The probability that you came about and exist today is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water — in the middle of that life preserver. On one try. Dr. Binazir has crunched the exact numbers shown in the infographic below. The path begins with the odds of your dad meeting your mom (1 in 20,000). This is multiplied by the chances of them staying together long enough to have kids (1 in 2,000), and so on... The probability of you existing at all comes out to 1 in 10 2,685,000 — yes, that's a 10 followed by 2,685,000 zeroes! Binazir concludes that the odds of you being alive are basically zero . visual.ly SEE ALSO: See How The Most Popular Baby Names Have Changed Over Time >    More:  Baby  Science  Parents and Kids      facebook     linkedin     twitter     email     copy link           Recommended For You   Powered By Sailthru              Powered By Sailthru                       Follow us on:                  Also check out:           * Copyright © 2018 Business Insider Inc.
