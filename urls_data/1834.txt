	        probabilities of other events.  This lesson covers some important rules 
	        that simplify those computations.  View Video Lesson  Definitions and Notation  Before discussing the rules of probability, we state the following definitions:   Two events are mutually 
			    exclusive or disjoint if they cannot occur at the same time.  The probability that Event A occurs, given that Event B has occurred, is called 
		    a conditional probability . The conditional probability 
		    of Event A, given Event B, is denoted by the symbol P(A|B).  The complement of an event is the event not occurring.
	    The probability that Event A will not occur is denoted by P(A').  The probability that Events A and B both occur is  
	        the probability of the intersection of A and B.
	        The probability of the intersection of Events A and B is denoted by 
	        P(A ∩ B). If Events A and B are 
	        mutually exclusive, P(A ∩ B) = 0.  The probability that Events A or B occur is  
	        the probability of the union of A and B.
	        The probability of the union of Events A and B is denoted by 
	        P(A ∪ B) .  If the occurrence of Event A changes the probability of 
            Event B, then Events A and B are dependent .
            On the other hand, if the occurrence of Event A does not change
            the probability of Event B, then Events A and B are independent .    Probability Calculator  Use the Probability Calculator to compute the probability of 
		    an event from the known probabilities of other events. The Probability 
		    Calculator is free and easy to use. The Probability Calculator can found in the Stat Trek
            main menu under the Stat Tools tab. Or you can tap the button below.  Probability Calculator   Rule of Subtraction  In a previous lesson , 
        we learned two important properties of probability:   The probability of an event ranges from 0 to 1. The sum of probabilities of all possible events equals 1.   The rule of subtraction follows directly from these properties.   Rule of Subtraction . The probability 
		    that event A will occur is equal to 1 minus the probability that event A will not occur.  P(A) = 1 - P(A')   Suppose, for example, the probability that Bill will graduate from college
        is 0.80.  What is the probability that Bill will not graduate from college?
        Based on the rule of subtraction, the probability that Bill will not graduate
        is 1.00 - 0.80 or 0.20.  Rule of Multiplication  The rule of multiplication applies to the situation when we want to know 
        the probability of the intersection of two events; that is, we want to know
        the probability that two events (Event A and Event B) both occur.   Rule of Multiplication The 
	        probability that Events A and B both occur is 
		    equal to the probability that Event A occurs times the probability that 
		    Event B occurs, given that A has occurred.  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B|A)   Example An urn contains 6 red marbles and 4 black marbles. Two marbles are drawn without 
		    replacement from the urn. What is the probability that both of the 
	    marbles are black?  Solution: Let A = the event that the first marble is black; and let B = 
	    the event that the second marble is black. We know the following:   In the beginning, there are 10 marbles in the urn, 4 of which are black. 
	    Therefore, P(A) = 4/10. After the first selection, there are 9 marbles in the urn, 3 of which are 
		    black. Therefore, P(B|A) = 3/9.   Therefore, based on the rule of multiplication:  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B|A) P(A ∩ B) = (4/10) * (3/9) = 12/90 = 2/15 = 0.133           Rule of Addition  The rule of addition applies to the following situation. We have two events, 
        and we want to know the probability that either event occurs.   Rule of Addition The probability that 
	        Event A or Event B occurs 
		    is equal to the probability that Event A occurs plus the probability that Event 
		    B occurs minus the probability that both Events A and B occur.  P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)  Note: Invoking the fact that P(A ∩  B) = P( A )P( B | A ), the Addition Rule can also be expressed as:   P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P( B | A )   Example A student goes to the library. The probability that she checks out (a) a work 
	    of fiction is 0.40, (b) a work of non-fiction is 0.30, and (c) both fiction 
	    and non-fiction is 0.20. What is the probability that the student checks out a 
	    work of fiction, non-fiction, or both?  Solution: Let F = the event that the student checks out fiction; and let 
	    N = the event that the student checks out non-fiction. Then, based on the rule 
	    of addition:  P(F ∪ N) = P(F) + P(N) - P(F ∩ N) P(F ∪ N) = 0.40 + 0.30 - 0.20 = 0.50        Test Your Understanding  Problem 1  An urn contains 6 red marbles and 4 black marbles. Two marbles are drawn with replacement from the urn. What is the probability that both of the 
	    marbles are black?   (A) 0.16 (B) 0.32 (C) 0.36 (D) 0.40 (E) 0.60  Solution  The correct answer is A.  Let A = the event that the first marble is black; 
        and let B = 
	    the event that the second marble is black. We know the following:   In the beginning, there are 10 marbles in the urn, 4 of which are black. 
	    Therefore, P(A) = 4/10. After the first selection, we replace the selected marble; so there are still 
		    10 marbles in the urn, 4 of which are black. Therefore, P(B|A) = 4/10.   Therefore, based on the rule of multiplication:  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B|A) P(A ∩ B) = (4/10)*(4/10) = 16/100 = 0.16    Problem 2  A card is drawn randomly from a deck of ordinary playing cards. You win $10 if 
	    the card is a spade or an ace. What is the probability that you will win the 
	    game?   (A) 1/13 (B) 13/52 (C) 4/13 (D) 17/52 (E) None of the above.  Solution  The correct answer is C.
        Let S = the event that the card is a spade; and let A = the 
	    event that the card is an ace. We know the following:   There are 52 cards in the deck. There are 13 spades, so P(S) = 13/52. There are 4 aces, so P(A) = 4/52. There is 1 ace that is also a spade, so P(S ∩ A) = 1/52.   Therefore, based on the rule of addition:  P(S ∪ A) = P(S) + P(A) - P(S ∩ A) P(S ∪ A) = 13/52 + 4/52 - 1/52 = 16/52 = 4/13               Bestsellers Advanced Placement Statistics Updated daily 1.

uncertainty of statements or events. It gives a numerical measure for the degree
of certainty (or degree of uncertainty) of the occurrence of an event.   Another way to define probability is the
ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of all possible
outcomes. The enumeration of all possible outcomes is called as the sample
space.   If there are totally n possible outcomes
in a sample space, S and m of those are favorable for an event, A. then
probability of event, A is given as   P(A) = (number of favorable outcomes) /
(total number of possible outcomes)   = n(A) / n(S)   = m/n   Example:- Find the probability of getting a 3 or 5 while
throwing a dice.   Answer:- Sample space, S = {1,2,3,4,5,6} and Event, A =
{3,5}.   n(A) = 2 and n(S) = 6.   So, P(A) = n(A) / n(S) = 2/6 = 0.3333       Axioms of Probability:      All probability values are positive numbers not greater than
1, i.e. 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. An event that is not likely to occur or impossible has
probability zero, while an highly likely event has a probability one.    Example:- P(A
pregnant human being a female) = 1   Example:- P(A
human male being pregnant) = 0.       If the probability that an event occurs is p, then the
probability that the event does not occur is q = (1-p). i.e. probability of the
complement of an event = 1 - probability of the event.    i.e. P(Ā) =
1 - P(A)   Example:- Find the
probability of not getting a 3 or 5 while throwing a dice.   Answer:- Sample
space, S = {1,2,3,4,5,6} and Event, B = {1,2,4,6}.   n(B) = 4 and n(S) = 6.   So, P(B) = n(B) / n(S) = 4/6 = 0.6667   Now A and B are complementary events, i.e. B = Ā.   So: 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.3333 = 0.6667 = P(B) = P(Ā).       If A and b are two different events then, P(A U B) = P(A) +
P(B) - P(A ∩ B). Consider the Venn diagram. P(A U B) is the probability of the
sum of all sample points in A U B. Now P(A) + P(B) is the sum of probabilities
of sample points in A and in B. Since we added up the sample points in (A ∩ B)
twice, we need to subtract once to obtain the sum of probabilities in (A U B),
which is P(A U B).     Example:- Probability that John passes a Math exam is 4/5 and
that he passes a Chemistry exam is 5/6. If the probability that he passes both
exams is 3/4, find the probability that he is pass at least one exam.   Answer:- Let M = John passes Math exam, and C = John passes
Chemistry exam.   P(John passes at least one exam) = P(M U C) = P(M) + P(C) - P(M ∩ C)   = 4/5 + 5/6 - 3/4   = 53/60      If two events, A and B are mutually exclusive then, P(A U B)
= P(A) + P(B). This follows immediately from (3). Since A and B are mutually
exclusive, n(A ∩ B)=0 and so P(A ∩ B)=0.    Example:- What is the probability of getting a total of 7 or
11, when two dice are rolled.   Answer:- Let A be the event that the total is 7 and B be the
event that it is 11.   Sample space, S = { (1,1), (1,2), .........., (2,1), (2,2), ........., (6,6) }   n(S) = 36.   A = { (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) } and n(A) = 6.   So P(A) = 6/36 = 1/6.   B = { (5,6), (6,5) } and n(A) = 2.   So P(B) = 2/36 = 1/18.   Since, we cannot have a total both 7 and 11, A and B are mutually exclusive.   i.e. (A ∩ B) = 0.   So we have P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/6 + 1/18 = 2/9.      Exercises:     A person draws 5 cards from a shuffled pack of cards. Find
the probability that the person has at least 3 aces. Find the probability that
the person has at least 4 cards of the same suit.    Two cards are drawn from a pack, without replacement. What is
the probability that both are greater than 2 and lesser than 8.    A permutation of the word "white" is chosen at random. Find
the probability that it beings with a vowel. Also find the probability that it
ends with a consonant.    A dice is tossed 5 times. Find the probability that we will
have 4 of a kind.    Find the probability that a leap year will have 53 Sundays.         Up   Next  >>>          Union and Intersection  The intersection and union of sets can be confusing especially when you have to understand the words and
    and or which are associated with these concepts.  Think of two roads that intersect in your
    hometown.  Now, think of a business at the intersection of these roads.  In Shelbyville there are two roads named
    Main and Madison.  If you were at the
    intersection then you would see KFC.  KFC is
    at the intersection of Main and Madison.  In other words, the intersection of
    sets is the set of elements or numbers common to both sets.  The union of sets is like a marriage of elements
    and numbers in the sets.  When a husband and
    wife marry (often referred to as a union ), they bring all of their
    belongings under one household.  Belongings
    which either he or she owned are now in their union (marriage.)  Every element that is in either
    set is in the union of sets.  The symbol for Union is   and the symbol for Intersection is  .  Observe the following example and note that the union  of sets is the set of elements that is in the first
    set or the second set while the intersection of sets is the set of elements that are in
    the first set and the second
    set.  (7)  Given
    that  A={2,4,6,8,10}  and  B={1,2,3,4,5}    A  B={1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10}  the Union   A B={2,4}  the Intersection  The last concept in this chapter is that of
    absolute value equations and inequalities.  You
    must remember that the value of the inside of the absolute value symbol may be
    positive or negative, but once the absolute value is evaluated the result is always
    positive.  In other words,   or  .  (8)  Solve
    the equation:  , then   or   .  Solving these equations we would find that   or  .  The absolute value equation has two points that
    satisfy the equation.  Checking this answer
    would provide the following information:   and  . The solution to the equation is the set {-1,4}.  Absolute value inequalities are solved in a
    similar fashion.  You must understand that the
    less than and less than or equal to inequalities are compound
    statements (the three part inequalities that were solved in the first section).  (9)  Solve
    the inequality:  .  This
    would mean that the value for   would lie
    between the values of  5  and  5.  Therefore, you would set up a compound inequality
    to solve the problem.  The problem would now
    look like this:    Solving this compound inequality would
    provide the result that  .  Which means
    that the value for x lies between  1  and  4.   (graph)  [  ]    -1  4  (interval notation)    notice that
    this is an Intersection of two sets of numbers  The greater than and
    greater than or equal to inequalities are disjoint statements.  This means that you must disjoin them
    or take them apart to solve.  The answer to
    the inequality will be greater than the positive value of the number or less than the negative value of the
    number.  The answer is the union of the two
    inequalities.  (10)  Solve the inequality:  .  This
    would mean that the value for   would be
    greater than  5  or the value for   would be less
    than  5.  When you disjoin the inequality to solve, the problem would look like
    this:    or    Solving these inequalities would provide
    the result   or   .    (graph)  )  (    -1  4  (interval notation)    notice that this is a

What percent of those who passed the first test also passed the second test?  Analysis: This problem describes a conditional probability since it asks us to find the probability that the second test was passed given that the first test was passed. In the last lesson, the notation for conditional probability was used in the statement of Multiplication Rule 2.  Multiplication Rule 2: When two events, A and B, are dependent, the probability of both occurring is:   The formula for the Conditional Probability of an event can be derived from Multiplication Rule 2 as follows:   Start with Multiplication Rule 2.   Divide both sides of equation by P(A).   Cancel P(A)s on right-hand side of equation.   Commute the equation.   We have derived the formula for conditional probability.  Now we can use this formula to solve the problem at the top of the page.  Problem: A math teacher gave her class two tests. 25% of the class passed both tests and 42% of the class passed the first test. What percent of those who passed the first test also passed the second test?  Solution:  P(Second|First)  =  P(First and Second)  =  0.25  =  0.60  =  60%  P(First)  0.42  Let's look at some other problems in which we are asked to find a conditional probability.  Example 1: A jar contains black and white marbles. Two marbles are chosen without replacement. The probability of selecting a black marble and then a white marble is 0.34, and the probability of selecting a black marble on the first draw is 0.47. What is the probability of selecting a white marble on the second draw, given that the first marble drawn was black?  Solution:  P(White|Black)  =  P(Black and White)  =  0.34  =  0.72  =  72%  P(Black)  0.47  Example 2: The probability that it is Friday and that a student is absent is 0.03. Since there are 5 school days in a week, the probability that it is Friday is 0.2. What is the probability that a student is absent given that today is Friday?  Solution:  P(Absent|Friday)  =  P(Friday and Absent)  =  0.03  =  0.15  =  15%  P(Friday)  0.2  Example 3: At Kennedy Middle School, the probability that a student takes Technology and Spanish is 0.087. The probability that a student takes Technology is 0.68. What is the probability that a student takes Spanish given that the student is taking Technology?  Solution:  P(Spanish|Technology)  =  P(Technology and Spanish)  =  0.087  =  0.13  =  13%  P(Technology)  0.68  Summary: The conditional probability of an event B in relationship to an event A is the probability that event B occurs given that event A has already occurred. The notation for conditional probability is P(B|A), read as the probability of B given A . The formula for conditional probability is:   The Venn Diagram below illustrates P(A), P(B), and P(A and B).

Conditional Probability The conditional probability B A P(B|A) probability of B given A A B independent A B B A B P(B)  If events A and B are not independent, then the probability
of the intersection of A and B (the probability that both events
occur) is defined by P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A). From this definition, the conditional probability P(B|A) is easily
obtained by dividing by P(A) :  Note: This expression is only valid when P(A) is greater than 0.   Examples In a card game, suppose a player needs to draw two cards of the same suit in order 
to win.  Of the 52 cards, there are 13 cards in each suit.  Suppose first the player 
draws a heart.  Now the player wishes to draw a second heart.  Since one
heart has already been chosen, there are now 12 hearts remaining in a deck of 51 cards.
So the conditional probability P(Draw second heart|First card a heart) = 12/51. Suppose an individual applying to a college determines that he has an 80% chance of
being accepted, and he knows that dormitory housing will only be provided for 60% of 
all of the accepted students.  The chance of the student being accepted and receiving dormitory housing is defined by  P(Accepted and Dormitory Housing) = P(Dormitory Housing|Accepted)P(Accepted) = 
(0.60)*(0.80) = 0.48.  To calculate the probability of the intersection of more than two events, the conditional
probabilities of all of the preceding events must be considered.  In the case of
three events, A , B , and C , the probability of the intersection P(A and B and C) = P(A)P(B|A)P(C|A and B) .  Consider the college applicant who has determined that he has 0.80 probability of 
acceptance and that only 60% of the accepted students will receive dormitory housing.  
Of the accepted students who receive dormitory housing, 80% will have at least one roommate.
The probability of being accepted and receiving dormitory housing and having
no roommates is calculated by:  P(Accepted and Dormitory Housing and No Roommates) = 
P(Accepted)P(Dormitory Housing|Accepted)P(No Roomates|Dormitory Housing and Accepted) = (0.80)*(0.60)*(0.20) = 0.096.  The student has about a 10% chance of receiving
a single room at the college. Another important method for calculating conditional probabilities is given by Bayes's formula P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A c )P(A c ) B B A A B P(B)P(A) + P(B)P(A c ) = P(B)(P(A) + 
P(A c )) = P(B)(1) = P(B), Example By Bayes's formula, P(Voter lives in state B|Voter supports liberal candidate) =
P(Voter supports liberal candidate|Voter lives in state B)P(Voter lives in state B)/
	(P(Voter supports lib. cand.|Voter lives in state A)P(Voter lives in state A) + 
	 P(Voter supports lib. cand.|Voter lives in state B)P(Voter lives in state B) +
	 P(Voter supports lib. cand.|Voter lives in state C)P(Voter lives in state C)) = (0.60)*(0.25)/((0.50)*(0.40) + (0.60)*(0.25) + (0.35)*(0.35)) 
= (0.15)/(0.20 + 0.15 + 0.1225) = 0.15/0.4725 = 0.3175.  The probability that the voter lives in state B is approximately 0.32.

	        probabilities of other events.  This lesson covers some important rules 
	        that simplify those computations.  View Video Lesson  Definitions and Notation  Before discussing the rules of probability, we state the following definitions:   Two events are mutually 
			    exclusive or disjoint if they cannot occur at the same time.  The probability that Event A occurs, given that Event B has occurred, is called 
		    a conditional probability . The conditional probability 
		    of Event A, given Event B, is denoted by the symbol P(A|B).  The complement of an event is the event not occurring.
	    The probability that Event A will not occur is denoted by P(A').  The probability that Events A and B both occur is  
	        the probability of the intersection of A and B.
	        The probability of the intersection of Events A and B is denoted by 
	        P(A ∩ B). If Events A and B are 
	        mutually exclusive, P(A ∩ B) = 0.  The probability that Events A or B occur is  
	        the probability of the union of A and B.
	        The probability of the union of Events A and B is denoted by 
	        P(A ∪ B) .  If the occurrence of Event A changes the probability of 
            Event B, then Events A and B are dependent .
            On the other hand, if the occurrence of Event A does not change
            the probability of Event B, then Events A and B are independent .    Probability Calculator  Use the Probability Calculator to compute the probability of 
		    an event from the known probabilities of other events. The Probability 
		    Calculator is free and easy to use. The Probability Calculator can found in the Stat Trek
            main menu under the Stat Tools tab. Or you can tap the button below.  Probability Calculator   Rule of Subtraction  In a previous lesson , 
        we learned two important properties of probability:   The probability of an event ranges from 0 to 1. The sum of probabilities of all possible events equals 1.   The rule of subtraction follows directly from these properties.   Rule of Subtraction . The probability 
		    that event A will occur is equal to 1 minus the probability that event A will not occur.  P(A) = 1 - P(A')   Suppose, for example, the probability that Bill will graduate from college
        is 0.80.  What is the probability that Bill will not graduate from college?
        Based on the rule of subtraction, the probability that Bill will not graduate
        is 1.00 - 0.80 or 0.20.  Rule of Multiplication  The rule of multiplication applies to the situation when we want to know 
        the probability of the intersection of two events; that is, we want to know
        the probability that two events (Event A and Event B) both occur.   Rule of Multiplication The 
	        probability that Events A and B both occur is 
		    equal to the probability that Event A occurs times the probability that 
		    Event B occurs, given that A has occurred.  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B|A)   Example An urn contains 6 red marbles and 4 black marbles. Two marbles are drawn without 
		    replacement from the urn. What is the probability that both of the 
	    marbles are black?  Solution: Let A = the event that the first marble is black; and let B = 
	    the event that the second marble is black. We know the following:   In the beginning, there are 10 marbles in the urn, 4 of which are black. 
	    Therefore, P(A) = 4/10. After the first selection, there are 9 marbles in the urn, 3 of which are 
		    black. Therefore, P(B|A) = 3/9.   Therefore, based on the rule of multiplication:  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B|A) P(A ∩ B) = (4/10) * (3/9) = 12/90 = 2/15 = 0.133           Rule of Addition  The rule of addition applies to the following situation. We have two events, 
        and we want to know the probability that either event occurs.   Rule of Addition The probability that 
	        Event A or Event B occurs 
		    is equal to the probability that Event A occurs plus the probability that Event 
		    B occurs minus the probability that both Events A and B occur.  P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)  Note: Invoking the fact that P(A ∩  B) = P( A )P( B | A ), the Addition Rule can also be expressed as:   P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P( B | A )   Example A student goes to the library. The probability that she checks out (a) a work 
	    of fiction is 0.40, (b) a work of non-fiction is 0.30, and (c) both fiction 
	    and non-fiction is 0.20. What is the probability that the student checks out a 
	    work of fiction, non-fiction, or both?  Solution: Let F = the event that the student checks out fiction; and let 
	    N = the event that the student checks out non-fiction. Then, based on the rule 
	    of addition:  P(F ∪ N) = P(F) + P(N) - P(F ∩ N) P(F ∪ N) = 0.40 + 0.30 - 0.20 = 0.50        Test Your Understanding  Problem 1  An urn contains 6 red marbles and 4 black marbles. Two marbles are drawn with replacement from the urn. What is the probability that both of the 
	    marbles are black?   (A) 0.16 (B) 0.32 (C) 0.36 (D) 0.40 (E) 0.60  Solution  The correct answer is A.  Let A = the event that the first marble is black; 
        and let B = 
	    the event that the second marble is black. We know the following:   In the beginning, there are 10 marbles in the urn, 4 of which are black. 
	    Therefore, P(A) = 4/10. After the first selection, we replace the selected marble; so there are still 
		    10 marbles in the urn, 4 of which are black. Therefore, P(B|A) = 4/10.   Therefore, based on the rule of multiplication:  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B|A) P(A ∩ B) = (4/10)*(4/10) = 16/100 = 0.16    Problem 2  A card is drawn randomly from a deck of ordinary playing cards. You win $10 if 
	    the card is a spade or an ace. What is the probability that you will win the 
	    game?   (A) 1/13 (B) 13/52 (C) 4/13 (D) 17/52 (E) None of the above.  Solution  The correct answer is C.
        Let S = the event that the card is a spade; and let A = the 
	    event that the card is an ace. We know the following:   There are 52 cards in the deck. There are 13 spades, so P(S) = 13/52. There are 4 aces, so P(A) = 4/52. There is 1 ace that is also a spade, so P(S ∩ A) = 1/52.   Therefore, based on the rule of addition:  P(S ∪ A) = P(S) + P(A) - P(S ∩ A) P(S ∪ A) = 13/52 + 4/52 - 1/52 = 16/52 = 4/13               Bestsellers Advanced Placement Statistics Updated daily 1.

For Example: if we are performing the experiment of throwing a dice then there can be numerous events associated with it, one of which can be the number on top be a multiple of 3. There are different operations performed on events. Union is one of them. As the name implies union means joining of two things irrespective of their individual behavior.  The union of two events gives us a compound event. Union of events simply mean the condition of occurrence of wither of the events. It is not necessary that all events must hold true. The condition of at least one holds. More than one or even all events under the union operation can be true simultaneously.    Formula    Suppose A and B are two events associated with a random experiment. Then the union of A and B is represented by A $\cup$ B. The probability of union of two events is given by: $P (A \cup B)$ = $P (A) + P (B)$ – $P (A \cap B)$ Here, P (A) is the probability of event A, P (B) is the probability of event B. Also, $P (A \cap B)$ is the probability of the intersection of events A and B. When $A\ and\  B$ are two independent or mutually exclusive events that is the occurrence of event $A$ does not affect the occurrence of event B at all, in such a case, $P (A \cap B)$ = 0 and hence we have, $P (A \cup B)$ = $P (A) + P (B)$ If we have more than two independent events say A, B & C, then in that case the union probability is given by: $P (A \cup B \cup C)$ = $P (A) + P (B) + P (C)$ If $A\,  B\  and\  C$ are not independent or mutually exclusive then the union probability is given by: $P (A \cup B \cup C)$ = $P (A) + P (B) + P (C)$ – $P (A \cap B) – P (B \cap C) – P (A \cap C)$ - $P (A \cap B \cap C)$   Examples    Some examples are illustrated on union of events: Example 1: Consider the experiment of rolling a dice. Find the probability of getting an even number of a number that is multiple of 3. Solution: Here S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, so n (S) = 6 Let A be the event of getting an even number. So A = {2, 4, 6}. $\rightarrow n (A)$ = 3 Hence we have $P (A)$ = $\frac{3}{6}$ Let B be the event of getting a number that is multiple of 3. So B = {3, 6} $\rightarrow n (B)$ = 2 Hence we have $P (B)$ = $\frac{2}{6}$ We can clearly see that the events are not mutually exclusive. That is $A \cap B$ = {6}, => $n (A \cap B)$ = 1 => $P (A \cap B)$ = $\frac{1}{6}$ Thus the compound probability is given by: $P (A \cap B)$ = $P (A) + P (B) – P (A \cap B)$ = $\frac{3}{6}$ + $\frac{2}{6}$ - $\frac{1}{6}$ = $\frac{4}{6}$ = $\frac{2}{3}$ Example 2:  Christ rolled a fair die and wished to find the probability of "the number that turns up is odd or divisible by 5". From the sample space, Let A be the event "an odd number turns up" and the B is the event "the number that turns up is divisible by 5 ". Solution: Sample space for a die is: S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. From the given statement: A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {5}. Let M = The number that turns up is odd or divisible by 5 So M = A $\cup$ B = {1, 3, 5} and P(M) = P(A $\cup$ B) = $\frac{n(A \cup B)}{n(S)}$ = $\frac{3}{6}$ = $\frac{1}{2}$ = 0.5         «  Experimental Probability     Intersection of Events   »          Topics in  Union of Events  Union of Events Examples             © 2018 www.probabilityformula.org, Inc.

Fundamentals of Probability  Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood that certain outcomes will occur. There are five basic rules, or axioms, that one must understand while studying the fundamentals of probability.   Learning Objectives  Explain the most basic and most important rules in determining the probability of an event    Key Takeaways  KEY POINTS   Probability is a number that can be assigned to outcomes and events. It always is greater than or equal to zero, and less than or equal to one.  The sum of the probabilities of all outcomes must equal [latex]1[/latex].  If two events have no outcomes in common, the probability that one or the other occurs is the sum of their individual probabilities.  The probability that an event does not occur is [latex]1[/latex] minus the probability that the event does occur.  Two events [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are independent if knowing that one occurs does not change the probability that the other occurs.   KEY TERMS   experiment : Something that is done that produces measurable results, called outcomes.  outcome : One of the individual results that can occur in an experiment.  event : A subset of the sample space.  sample space : The set of all outcomes of an experiment.    In discrete probability, we assume a well-defined experiment, such as flipping a coin or rolling a die. Each individual result which could occur is called an outcome. The set of all outcomes is called the sample space, and any subset of the sample space is called an event.  For example, consider the experiment of flipping a coin two times. There are four individual outcomes, namely [latex]\text{HH},\text{HT},\text{TH},\text{TT}[/latex]. The sample space is thus [latex]\{\text{HH},\text{HT},\text{TH},\text{TT}\}[/latex]. The event “at least one heads occurs” would be the set [latex]\{\text{HH},\text{HT},\text{TH}\}[/latex]. If the coin were a normal coin, we would assign the probability of 1/4 to each outcome.  In probability theory, the probability [latex]\text{P}[/latex] of some event [latex]\text{E}[/latex], denoted [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{E}\right)[/latex], is usually defined in such a way that [latex]\text{P}[/latex] satisfies a number of axioms, or rules. The most basic and most important rules are listed below.  Probability Rules  Probability is a number. It is always greater than or equal to zero, and less than or equal to one. This can be written as [latex]0\leq{\text{P}}\left(\text{A}\right)\geq{1}[/latex]. An impossible event, or an event that never occurs, has a probability of [latex]0[/latex]. An event that always occurs has a probability of [latex]1[/latex]. An event with a probability of [latex]0.5[/latex] will occur half of the time.  The sum of the probabilities of all possibilities must equal [latex]1[/latex]. Some outcome must occur on every trial, and the sum of all probabilities is 100%, or in this case, [latex]1[/latex]. This can be written as [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{S}\right)=1[/latex], where [latex]\text{S}[/latex] represents the entire sample space.  If two events have no outcomes in common, the probability that one or the other occurs is the sum of their individual probabilities. If one event occurs in 30% of the trials, a different event occurs in 20% of the trials, and the two cannot occur together (if they are disjoint), then the probability that one or the other occurs is 30%+20%=50%. This is sometimes referred to as the addition rule, and can be simplified with the following: [latex]\text{P}\left({\text{A}} \text{ or} {\text{ B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex]. The word “or” means the same thing in mathematics as the union, which uses the following symbol: [latex]\cup[/latex]. Thus when [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are disjoint, we have [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex]. The probability that an event does not occur is [latex]1[/latex] minus the probability that the event does occur. If an event occurs in 60% of all trials, it fails to occur in the other 40%, because 100%−60%=40%. The probability that an event occurs and the probability that it does not occur always add up to 100%, or [latex]1[/latex]. These events are called complementary events, and this rule is sometimes called the complement rule. It can be simplified with [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}^\text{c}\right)=1−\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)[/latex], where [latex]\text{A}^\text{c}[/latex] is the complement of [latex]\text{A}[/latex].  Two events [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are independent if knowing that one occurs does not change the probability that the other occurs. This is often called the multiplication rule. If [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are independent, then [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A} \text{ and} \text{ B}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex]. The word “and” in mathematics means the same thing in mathematics as the intersection, which uses the following symbol: [latex]\cap[/latex]. Therefore when [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are independent, we have [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex].  Extension of the Example  Elaborating on our example above of flipping two coins, assign the probability [latex]1/4[/latex] to each of the [latex]4[/latex] outcomes. We consider each of the five rules above in the context of this example.  1. Note that each probability is [latex]1/4[/latex], which is between [latex]0[/latex] and [latex]1[/latex].  2. Note that the sum of all the probabilities is [latex]1[/latex], since [latex]\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}=1[/latex].  3. Suppose [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is the event exactly one head occurs, and B is the event exactly two tails occur. Then [latex]\text{A}=\{\text{HT},\text{TH}\}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}=\{\text{TT}\}[/latex] are disjoint. Also, [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\right)=\frac{3}{4}=\frac{2}{4}+\frac{1}{4}=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex].  4. The probability that no heads occurs is [latex]1/4[/latex], which is equal to [latex]1−3/4[/latex]. So if [latex]\text{A}=\{\text{HT},\text{TH},\text{HH}\}[/latex] is the event that a head occurs, we have [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}^\text{c}\right)=\frac{1}{4}=1−\frac{3}{4}=1−\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)[/latex].  5. If [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is the event that the first flip is a heads and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] is the event that the second flip is a heads, then [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and[latex]\text{B}[/latex] are independent. We have [latex]\text{A}=\{\text{HT},\text{HH}\}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}={\text{TH},\text{HH}}[/latex] and [latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}={\text{HH}}[/latex]. Note that [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)=\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{2}\cdot{\frac{1}{2}}=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex].  Conditional Probability  The conditional probability of an event is the probability that an event will occur given that another event has occurred.   Learning Objectives  Explain the significance of Bayes’ theorem in manipulating conditional probabilities    Key Takeaways  KEY POINTS   The conditional probability [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)[/latex] of an event [latex]\text{B}[/latex], given an event [latex]\text{A}[/latex], is defined by: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)=\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)}[/latex], when [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)>0[/latex].  If the knowledge that event [latex]\text{A}[/latex] occurs does not change the probability that event [latex]\text{B}[/latex] occurs, then [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and[latex]\text{B}[/latex] are independent events, and thus, [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex].  Mathematically, Bayes’ theorem gives the relationship between the probabilities of [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}, \text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)[/latex] and [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex], and the conditional probabilities of [latex]\text{A}[/latex] given [latex]\text{B}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] given [latex]\text{A}, \text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)[/latex] and [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\cap{\text{A}}\right)[/latex]. In its most common form, it is: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)=\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)}[/latex].   KEY TERMS   conditional probability : The probability that an event will take place given the restrictive assumption that another event has taken place, or that a combination of other events has taken place  independent : Not dependent; not contingent or depending on something else; free.    Probability of B Given That A Has Occurred  Our estimation of the likelihood of an event can change if we know that some other event has occurred. For example, the probability that a rolled die shows a [latex]2[/latex] is [latex]1/6[/latex] without any other information, but if someone looks at the die and tells you that is is an even number, the probability is now [latex]1/3[/latex] that it is a [latex]2[/latex]. The notation [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)[/latex] indicates a conditional probability, meaning it indicates the probability of one event under the condition that we know another event has happened. The bar “[latex]\mid[/latex]” can be read as “given”, so that [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)[/latex] is read as “the probability of [latex]\text{B}[/latex] given that [latex]\text{A}[/latex] has occurred”.  The conditional probability [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)[/latex] of an event [latex]\text{B}[/latex], given an event [latex]\text{A}[/latex], is defined by:  [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)=\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)}[/latex]  When [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)>0[/latex]. Be sure to remember the distinct roles of [latex]\text{B}[/latex] and [latex]\text{A}[/latex] in this formula. The set after the bar is the one we are assuming has occurred, and its probability occurs in the denominator of the formula.   Example  Suppose that a coin is flipped 3 times giving the sample space:  [latex]\text{S}=\{\text{HHH},\text{HHT},\text{HTH},\text{THH},\text{TTH},\text{THT},\text{HTT},\text{TTT}\}[/latex]  Each individual outcome has probability [latex]1/8[/latex]. Suppose that [latex]\text{B}[/latex] is the event that at least one heads occurs and [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is the event that all 3 coins are the same. Then the probability of [latex]\text{B}[/latex] given [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is [latex]1/2[/latex], since [latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}=\{\text{HHH}\}[/latex] which has probability [latex]1/8[/latex] and [latex]\text{A}=\{\text{HHH},\text{TTT}\}[/latex] which has probability [latex]2/8[/latex], and [latex]\frac{1/8}{2/8}=\frac{1}{2}[/latex].   Independence  The conditional probability [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)[/latex] is not always equal to the unconditional probability [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex]. The reason behind this is that the occurrence of event [latex]\text{A}[/latex] may provide extra information that can change the probability that event [latex]\text{B}[/latex] occurs. If the knowledge that event [latex]\text{A}[/latex] occurs does not change the probability that event [latex]\text{B}[/latex] occurs, then [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are independent events, and thus, [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex].  Bayes’ Theorem  In probability theory and statistics, Bayes’ theorem (alternatively Bayes’ law or Bayes’ rule) is a result that is of importance in the mathematical manipulation of conditional probabilities. It can be derived from the basic axioms of probability.  Mathematically, Bayes’ theorem gives the relationship between the probabilities of [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex], [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)[/latex] and [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex], and the conditional probabilities of [latex]\text{A}[/latex] given [latex]\text{B}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] given [latex]\text{A}[/latex]. In its most common form, it is:  [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\mid{\text{B}}\right)=\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)}[/latex]  This may be easier to remember in this alternate symmetric form:  [latex]\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{A}\mid{\text{B}}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)}=\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)}[/latex]   Example  Suppose someone told you they had a nice conversation with someone on the train. Not knowing anything else about this conversation, the probability that they were speaking to a woman is 50%. Now suppose they also told you that this person had long hair. It is now more likely they were speaking to a woman, since women in in this city are more likely to have long hair than men. Bayes’s theorem can be used to calculate the probability that the person is a woman.  To see how this is done, let [latex]\text{W}[/latex] represent the event that the conversation was held with a woman, and [latex]\text{L}[/latex] denote the event that the conversation was held with a long-haired person. It can be assumed that women constitute half the population for this example. So, not knowing anything else, the probability that [latex]\text{W}[/latex] occurs is [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{W}\right)=0.5[/latex].  Suppose it is also known that 75% of women in this city have long hair, which we denote as [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{L}\mid{\text{W}}\right)=0.75[/latex]. Likewise, suppose it is known that 25% of men in this city have long hair, or [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{L}\mid{\text{M}}\right)=0.25[/latex], where [latex]\text{M}[/latex] is the complementary event of [latex]\text{W}[/latex], i.e., the event that the conversation was held with a man (assuming that every human is either a man or a woman).  Our goal is to calculate the probability that the conversation was held with a woman, given the fact that the person had long hair, or, in our notation, [latex]\text{P}(\text{W}\mid{\text{L}})[/latex]. Using the formula for Bayes’s theorem, we have:  [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{W}\mid{\text{L}}\right)=\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{L}\mid{\text{W}}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{W}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{L}\right)}=\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{L}\mid{\text{W}}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{W}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{L}\mid{\text{W}}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{W}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{L}\mid{\text{M}}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{M}\right)}=\frac{0.75\cdot{0.5}}{0.75\cdot{0.5}+0.25\cdot{0.5}}=0.75[/latex]   Unions and Intersections  Union and intersection are two key concepts in set theory and probability.   Learning Objectives  Give examples of the intersection and the union of two or more sets    Key Takeaways  KEY POINTS   The union of two or more sets is the set that contains all the elements of the two or more sets. Union is denoted by the symbol [latex]\cup[/latex].  The general probability addition rule for the union of two events states that [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)−\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)[/latex], where [latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}[/latex] is the intersection of the two sets.  The addition rule can be shortened if the sets are disjoint: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex]. This can even be extended to more sets if they are all disjoint: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\cup{\text{C}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{C}\right)[/latex].  The intersection of two or more sets is the set of elements that are common to every set. The symbol [latex]\cap[/latex] is used to denote the intersection.  When events are independent, we can use the multiplication rule for independent events, which states that [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex].   KEY TERMS   independent : Not contingent or dependent on something else.  disjoint : Having no members in common; having an intersection equal to the empty set.    Probability uses the mathematical ideas of sets, as we have seen in the definition of both the sample space of an experiment and in the definition of an event. In order to perform basic probability calculations, we need to review the ideas from set theory related to the set operations of union, intersection, and complement.  Union  The union of two or more sets is the set that contains all the elements of each of the sets; an element is in the union if it belongs to at least one of the sets. The symbol for union is [latex]\cup[/latex], and is associated with the word “or”, because [latex]\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}[/latex] is the set of all elements that are in [latex]\text{A}[/latex] or [latex]\text{B}[/latex] (or both.) To find the union of two sets, list the elements that are in either (or both) sets. In terms of a Venn Diagram, the union of sets [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] can be shown as two completely shaded interlocking circles.  Union of Two Sets : The shaded Venn Diagram shows the union of set [latex]\text{A}[/latex] (the circle on left) with set [latex]\text{B}[/latex] (the circle on the right). It can be written shorthand as [latex]\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}[/latex] In symbols, since the union of [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] contains all the points that are in [latex]\text{A}[/latex] or [latex]\text{B}[/latex] or both, the definition of the union is: [latex]\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}=\{\text{x}:\text{x}\in{\text{A}} \text{ or } \text{x}\in{\text{B}}\}[/latex] For example, if [latex]\text{A}=\{1,3,5,7\}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}=\{1,2,4,6\}[/latex] , then [latex]\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}[/latex]. Notice that the element 1 is not listed twice in the union, even though it appears in both sets [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex]. This leads us to the general addition rule for the union of two events: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)−\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)[/latex] Where [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)[/latex] is the intersection of the two sets. We must subtract this out to avoid double counting of the inclusion of an element. If sets [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are disjoint, however, the event [latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}[/latex] has no outcomes in it, and is an empty set denoted as ∅, which has a probability of zero. So, the above rule can be shortened for disjoint sets only: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex] This can even be extended to more sets if they are all disjoint: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\cup{\text{C}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{C}\right)[/latex] Intersection The intersection of two or more sets is the set of elements that are common to each of the sets. An element is in the intersection if it belongs to all of the sets. The symbol for intersection is [latex]\cap[/latex], and is associated with the word “and”, because [latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}[/latex] is the set of elements that are in [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] simultaneously. To find the intersection of two (or more) sets, include only those elements that are listed in both (or all) of the sets. In terms of a Venn Diagram, the intersection of two sets [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] can be shown at the shaded region in the middle of two interlocking circles . Intersection of Two Sets :  Set A is the circle on the left, set B is the circle on the right, and the intersection of A and B, or [latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}[/latex], is the shaded portion in the middle. In mathematical notation, the intersection of [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] is written as[latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}=\{\text{x}:\text{x}\in{\text{A}}[/latex] and [latex]\text{x}\in{\text{B}}\}[/latex]. For example, if [latex]\text{A}=\{1,3,5,7\}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}=\{1,2,4,6\}[/latex], then [latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}=\{1\}[/latex] because [latex]1[/latex] is the only element that appears in both sets [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex]. When events are independent, meaning that the outcome of one event doesn’t affect the outcome of another event, we can use the multiplication rule for independent events, which states: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex] For example, let’s say we were tossing a coin twice, and we want to know the probability of tossing two heads. Since the first toss doesn’t affect the second toss, the events are independent. Say is the event that the first toss is a heads and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] is the event that the second toss is a heads, then [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{4}[/latex]. Complementary Events The complement of [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is the event in which [latex]\text{A}[/latex] does not occur.  Learning Objectives  Explain an example of a complementary event   Key Takeaways  KEY POINTS   The complement of an event [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is usually denoted as [latex]\text{A}′[/latex], [latex]\text{A}^\text{c}[/latex] or [latex]\bar{\text{A}}[/latex].  An event and its complement are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one of the two events occurs, the other event cannot occur.  An event and its complement are exhaustive, meaning that both events cover all possibilities.   KEY TERMS   exhaustive : including every possible element  mutually exclusive : describing multiple events or states of being such that the occurrence of any one implies the non-occurrence of all the others   What are Complementary Events? In probability theory, the complement of any event [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is the event [latex][\text{not A}][/latex], i.e. the event in which [latex]\text{A}[/latex] does not occur. The event [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and its complement [latex][\text{not A}][/latex] are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that if one occurs, the other does not, and that both groups cover all possibilities. Generally, there is only one event [latex]\text{B}[/latex] such that [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are both mutually exclusive and exhaustive; that event is the complement of [latex]\text{A}[/latex]. The complement of an event [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is usually denoted as [latex]\text{A}′[/latex], [latex]\text{A}^c[/latex] or [latex]\bar{\text{A}}[/latex].  Examples  Simple Examples  A common example used to demonstrate complementary events is the flip of a coin. Let’s say a coin is flipped and one assumes it cannot land on its edge. It can either land on heads or on tails. There are no other possibilities (exhaustive), and both events cannot occur at the same time (mutually exclusive). Because these two events are complementary, we know that [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{heads}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{tails}\right)=1[/latex].  Coin Flip : Often in sports games, such as tennis, a coin flip is used to determine who will serve first because heads and tails are complementary events. Another simple example of complementary events is picking a ball out of a bag. Let’s say there are three plastic balls in a bag. One is blue and two are red. Assuming that each ball has an equal chance of being pulled out of the bag, we know that [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{blue}\right)=\frac{1}{3}[/latex] and [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{red}\right)=\frac{2}{3}[/latex]. Since we can only either chose blue or red (exhaustive) and we cannot choose both at the same time (mutually exclusive), choosing blue and choosing red are complementary events, and [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{blue}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{red}\right)=1[/latex]. Finally, let’s examine a non-example of complementary events. If you were asked to choose any number, you might think that that number could either be prime or composite. Clearly, a number cannot be both prime and composite, so that takes care of the mutually exclusive property. However, being prime or being composite are not exhaustive because the number 1 in mathematics is designated as “unique. ”   Licenses and Attributions   CC licensed content, Shared previously Curation and Revision.

One is red , 
one is blue , one is yellow ,
one is green , and one is purple .  
If one marble is to be picked at random from the bowl, the
sample space possible outcomes S = { red , blue , yellow , green , purple }.  If 3 of the 
marbles are red and 2 are blue , 
then the sample space S = { red , blue }, 
since only two  possible color outcomes be possible.  If, instead, two marbles are picked 
from a bowl with 3 red marbles and 2 blue marbles, then the sample space S = 
{(2 red ), (2 blue ), (1 red and 1 blue )}, 
the set of all possible outcomes. An event A Suppose there are 3 red marbles and 2 blue marbles in a bowl.  If an individual picks three 
marbles, one at a time, from the bowl, the event "pick 2 red marbles" can be achieved in 3 ways, 
so the set of outcomes A = {( red , red , blue ),( red , blue , red ), ( blue , red , red )}.  
The sample space for picking three marbles, one at a time, is all of the possible ordered 
combinations of three marbles, S = {( red , red , red ), ( red , red , blue ), ( red , blue , red ), ( blue , red , red ), ( blue , blue , red ), ( blue , red , blue ), ( red , blue , blue )}.  
Since there are only 2 blue marbles, it is impossible to achieve the event { blue , blue , blue }. A probability A P(A)  Rule 1: Any probability P(A) is a number between 0 and 1 
(0 < P(A) < 1).  Rule 2: The probability of the sample space S is equal to 1 (P(S) = 1). Suppose five marbles, each of a different color, are placed in a bowl.  The sample space for 
choosing one marble, from above, is S = { red , blue , yellow , green , purple }.  Since one of these must
be selected, the probability of choosing any marble is equal to the probability of 
the sample space S = 1.   Suppose the event of interest is choosing the purple marble, A = { purple }.  
If it is equally likely that any one marble will be selected, then the probability of choosing 
the purple marble, P(A) = 1/5.  In general, the following 
formula describes the calculation of probabilities for equally likely outcomes:  If there are k possible outcomes for a phenomenon and each is equally likely, 
then each individual outcome has probability 1/ k . The probability of any event A is   If two events have no outcomes in common, then they are called disjoint  Rule 3: If two events A and B are disjoint, then
the probability of either event is the sum of the probabilities of the two events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B).  The chance of any (one or more) of two or more events occurring is called 
the union For example, the probability of drawing either a purple , red , or green marble from a bowl of five
differently colored marbles is the sum of the probabilities of drawing any of these marbles:
1/5 + 1/5 + 1/5 = 3/5.  If there are three red marbles and two blue marbles, then the probability of drawing any red marble is the number of outcomes in the event " red ," which is equal
to three, divided by the total number of outcomes, 5, or 3/5 = 0.6.  The sample space is this case
is { red , blue }, which must have total 
probability equal to 1, so the probability of drawing a blue marble is equal to 2/5 = 0.4.
The event of drawing a blue marble does not occur if a red marble is chosen, so the event A = " blue " is called the complement A c of the event " red ."
Since an event and its complement together form the entire sample space S , the 
probability of an event A is equal to the probability of the 
sample space S , minus the probability of A c , as follows:  Rule 4: The probability that any event A does not occur is
P(A c ) = 1 - P(A).  Venn Diagrams A useful graphical tool for studying the complements, intersections, and unions of events within
a sample space S is known as a Venn diagram In the Venn diagram to the right, events A and B are disjoint.  Suppose, for example, event A is drawing a red marble from a bowl of five differently colored marbles, and 
event B is drawing a blue marble.  These events cannot 
both occur, so there is no overlapping area.   In the Venn diagram on the left, 
events A and B are not disjoint.  This means that it is possible for 
both events to occur, and the overlapping area represents this possibility.  Suppose, 
for instance, there are 3 red marbles and two blue marbles in a bowl.  Two marbles are to be drawn from the 
bowl, one after the other.  After the first draw, the marble drawn is returned to the bowl.  
Define event A to be drawing a red marble from the 
bowl on the first draw, and define event B to be drawing a blue marble on the second draw.  The occurence of event A is represented by the red area, the occurence of event B is represented by the blue area, the occurence of both events 
is represented by the overlapping area (also known as the intersection of the two events), 
and the occurence of either event is represented by the entire colored area (also 
known as the union of the two events).  Independence Consider two events which might occur in succession, such as two flips of a coin.  
If the outcome of the first event has no effect on the probability of the second 
event, then the two events are called independent multiplication rule  Rule 5: If two events A and B are independent, then the
probability of both events is the product of the probabilities for each event: P(A and B) = P(A)P(B).  The chance of all of two or more events occurring is called 
the intersection of events.  For independent events, the probability of the 
intersection of two or more events is the product of the probabilities. In the case of two coin flips, for example, the probability of observing
two heads is 1/2*1/2 = 1/4.  Similarly, the probability of observing four heads on 
four coin flips is 1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2 = 1/16.  If two events A and B are not disjoint, then the probability of their 
union (the event that A or B occurs) is equal to the sum of their probabilities minus the sum of their intersection.  In the example corresponding to the second Venn diagram above, we know that the probability 
of drawing a red marble on the first draw (event A ) is 
equal to 3/5, and the probability of drawing a blue marble on 
the second draw (event B ) is equal to 2/5.  Since events A and B are 
independent, the probability of the intersection of A and B, P(A and B) , equals the 
product P(A)*P(B) = 3/5*2/5 = 6/25.  The probability of the union of A and B , P(A or B) , is equal to P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 3/5 + 2/5 - 6/25 = 1 - 6/25 = 19/25 = 0.76. For another example, consider tossing two coins.  The probability of a head on any toss is
equal to 1/2.  Since the tosses are independent, the probability of a head on both tosses
(the intersection) is equal to 1/2*1/2 = 1/4.  The probability of a head on either 
toss (the union) is equal to the sum of the probabilities of a head on each toss minus
the probability of the intersection, 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/4 = 3/4.  Note: Disjoint events are not independent.  In the marble example,
consider drawing one marble from the bowl of five, where each marble is a different
color.  Suppose the event of interest, event A , is drawing a blue marble.  The probability of drawing this marble is 1/5.  
Suppose event B is drawing a green marble.  These events are 
disjoint, since event B cannot occur if event A occurs.  Obviously, they are not 
independent, since the outcome of event A directly affects the outcome of event B .  
If, instead, two marbles were to be drawn from the bowl, with the first marble replaced before the second
marble was drawn, then the event of drawing a blue marble on the first
draw would not affect the outcome of the second draw.  The event of drawing a green marble on the second draw would be independent of the event
of drawing a blue marble on the first draw, so the probability of both events occurring would be the product of the probabilities of each event,
1/5*1/5 = 1/25. The probability of the intersection of two or events which are not independent is determined 
using conditional probabilities . For some more definitions and examples, see the probability index in Valerie J. Easton and John H. McColl's Statistics Glossary v1.1 .

This is the probability of sample points belonging to exactly 1 event, exactly 2 events, ...,exactly $n$ events. WLOG this can be written as $$P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i \right) = P(A_1) + P(A_1 \cap A_2) + \cdots + P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_n)$$  But the $A_i$'s are arbitrary and we have to account for that. So there are $n$ possibilities for the first probability, $\binom{n}{2}$ possibilities for the second probability, ..., and $1$ possibility for the final probability. So we add and subtract these to prevent overcounting?    probability     share | cite | improve this question     asked Dec 29 '11 at 2:29       barry   34 1 2 3              1      Do you mean $P(A_1) + P(-A_1 \cap A_2) + \cdots + P(-A_1 \cap -A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_n)$, or are you talking about the Principe of Inclusion and Exclusion (see Wikipedia or some such)? – Lopsy  Dec 29 '11 at 2:35         1      Your assertion about $P(\cup A_i)$ is incorrect.

$$
P\Bigl(\,\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n A_i\,\Bigr ) =\sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i).
$$  But (1) does not hold for arbitrary unions. One strategy to find a formula for the probability of a union of arbitrary events is to write the given union as a (different)  union of mutually disjoint events.   From this, it follows that your initial statement, "This is the probability of sample points belonging to exactly 1 event, exactly 2 events, ...,exactly $n$ events." , is correct.  $P\Bigl(\,\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n A_i\,\Bigr )$ is the sum of the probabilities of the events $B_i$ where $B_i$ is the event that exactly $i$ of the events $A_j$ occurs.
You have, noting that the $B_i$ are mutually disjoint:
$$
P\Bigl(\,\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n A_i\,\Bigr ) =\sum_{i=1}^n P(B_i).
$$  But,  the subsequent formula you have is incorrect. In fact, the event  $B_1$ is somewhat complicated. If exactly one event $A_i$ occurs, then either $A_1$ only occurs, or $A_2$ only occurs, ... .
So 
$$
B_1=  \bigcup_{j=1}^n \Bigl(\,A_j\cap ({\textstyle\bigcup\limits_{i\ne j }}\, A_i^C\,)\,\Bigr).
$$  Trying to write down descriptions of the other $B_i$ might lead you to suspect this particular method is more trouble than its worth (of course, it may prove useful in certain problems).   The formula in Dilip's comment is a nice way to "disjointify" the union $\cup A_i$. If you draw a Venn diagram for the case $n=2$, it is easy to convince yourself that
$A_1\cup A_2$ can be written as a union of pairwise disjoint events:
$$
A_1\cup A_2 = A_1 \cup (A_1^c\cap A_2).
$$
So you can write
$$
P(A_1\cup A_2) =P( A_1)+ P (A_1^c\cap A_2).
$$  For the case $n=3$, $A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3$ can be written as a union of pairwise disjoint events:
$$
A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3 = A_1 \cup(A_1^c\cap A_2)\cup (A_1^c\cap A_2^c\cap A_3).
$$
So you can write
$$
P(A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3) =P( A_1)+P(A_1^c\cap A_2)+P (A_1^c\cap A_2^c\cap A_3).
$$  And, of course the general formula in Dilip's comment holds because the union of the $A_i$  is written as a union of pairwise disjoint sets.   The "add and subtract business" you mention seems like what is done in deriving the so-called Inclusion-Exclusion principle, as mentioned in gnometorule's answer. This gives a different method for evaluating the probability of a union (it is not exactly the "disjointification" method above).  As a warm up to the general formula, let's consider the formulas for $P(A\cup B)$ and $P(A\cup B\cup C)$.   Probability of the union of two events:  Let us find the probability of the union of two arbitrary events $A$ and $B$. One might think $P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)$; however, each of
$P(A)$ and $P(B)$ counts the probability of $A\cap B$.  We thus have to subtract this probability from $P(A)+P(B)$ to obtain the correct formula: $$
P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B).
$$
Another way to derive the formula is to note that $A\cup B$ is the disjoint union of $A/B$, $B/A$, and $A\cap B$.
Now, since $A$ is the disjoint union of $A\cap B$ and $A/B$, it follows that $P(A)=P(A\cap B)+P(A/B)$; whence $P(A/B)= P(A)-P(A\cap B)$.  In a similar manner, one shows that   $P(B/A)= P(B)-P(B\cap A)$.  It follows that 
$$\eqalign{
  P(A\cup B)&=P(A/B)+P(B/A)+P(A\cap B)\cr
	&=\bigl( P(A)-P(A\cap B)\bigr)+\bigl(P(B)-P(B\cap A)\bigr)+P(A\cap B) \cr
	&= P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B).
	}
	$$   Probability of the union of three events: For three arbitrary events $A $, $B$, and $C$, to find $P(A \cup B\cup C)$, we first start with the guess
$$
P(A\cup B\cup C)=P(A )+P(B)+P(C).\tag{1}
$$
Now (1) counts each of $P(A \cap B)$, $P(A\cap C)$, and $P(B\cap C)$ twice. To make up for this,
we have to subtract
$$P(A \cap B)+P(A \cap C)+P(B\cap B).\tag{2}$$ 
But $P(A )+P(B)+P(C)$ counts $P(A \cap B \cap C)$ thrice, and in (2) we subtracted it thrice. So, we must add
$P(A )+P(B)+P(C)$ back in again. We have:
$$
P(A\cup B\cup C)=P(A)+P(B)+P(C)-P(A\cap B)-P(A\cap C)-P(B\cap C)+P(A\cap B\cap C).
$$
Looking at the Venn diagram may be helpful here:   More generally, for the events $A_1$, $A_2$, $\ldots\,$, $A_n$, we have the inclusion-exclusion principle:
$$\eqalign{
P\Bigl(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\Bigr) = \sum_{i\le n} P(A_i) - &\sum_{i_1<i_2} P(A_{i_1}\cap A_{i_2})
   +\sum_{i_1<i_2<i_3} P(A_{i_1}\cap A_{i_2}\cap A_{i_3}) - \cr
	&\cdots+ (-1)^{n}\sum_{i_1<i_2<\cdots<i_{n-1} } 
	P(A_{i_1}\cap\cdots\cap A_{i_{n-1}} )\cr&\qquad\qquad + (-1)^{n+1}P(A_1\cap A_2\cap\cdots\cap A_n)}.
$$  As pointed out in the comments, this can be proved by induction.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 29 '11 at 15:55             answered Dec 29 '11 at 13:38       David Mitra   61.1k 5 89 155                  +1 for a very well-written and thorough answer.  I think the OP's translation of thoughts into notation follows a pattern very often seen in beginners: confusing between an outcome $\omega$ belonging to an event $A$ and an outcome belonging only to an event $A$ and not to other events. $$A\cup B=(A\cap B^c)\cup(A^c\cap B)\cup(A\cap B)$$ is saying "outcome belongs only to $A$ or only to $B$ or to both". The three parts are disjoint, and so probabilities can be added. But we add $P(A\cap B^c)$ and $P(A^c\cap B)$, not $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ as the OP seems trying to do. – Dilip Sarwate  Dec 29 '11 at 15:21             @Dilip Sarwate Thanks for the compliment Dilip. – David Mitra  Dec 29 '11 at 15:30             I agree with Dilip's first remark about this answer.

A classical way of calculating this is based in the following sieve formula:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion–exclusion_principle ,  but of course there are other ways to break this down (eg, see above).

The problem is I wanted to say that A will transfer elecricity only if 1 of his legs will be connected so its like saying $0.8 + 0.8 + 0.8$ which is obviously wrong(over $1$) so I used the weird formula that says to do like this: $0.8 + 0.8 + 0.8 - (0.8)^2 -(0.8)^2 - (0.8)^2 + (0.8)^3 = {124\over125}$ too.

\mathbb{P}\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_i\right) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{P}\left(A_i\right)\text{.}
\end{align}$$  It so happens that this is also true if you have a finite number of disjoint events. If you're interested in more detail, consult a measure-theoretic probability  textbook.   Theorem . For two events $A$ and $B$, $\mathbb{P}\left(A \cup B\right) = \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B) - \mathbb{P}(A \cap B)$.  Proof . Write $A \cup B = \left(A \cap B\right) \cup \left(A \cap B^{c}\right) \cup \left(A^{c} \cap B\right)$. Notice also that $A = \left(A \cap B^{c}\right) \cup\left(A \cap B\right)$ and $B = \left(B \cap A^{c}\right) \cup \left(A \cap B\right)$. This implies that 
  $$\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}\left(A\right) &= \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B^{c}\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B\right) \\
\mathbb{P}\left(B\right) &= \mathbb{P}\left(B \cap A^{c}\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B\right) \\
\end{align}$$
  Then since $\left(A \cap B\right) \cup \left(A \cap B^{c}\right) \cup \left(A^{c} \cap B\right)$ is a disjoint union of sets,
  $$\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}\left(A \cup B\right) &= \mathbb{P}\left[ \left(A \cap B\right) \cup \left(A \cap B^{c}\right) \cup \left(A^{c} \cap B\right) \right] \\
&= \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B^{c}\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(A^{c} \cap B\right) \\
&= \mathbb{P}\left(A\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(A^{c} \cap B\right) \\
&= \mathbb{P}\left(A\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(B\right) - \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B\right)\text{. } \square
\end{align}$$  Theorem . $\mathbb{P}\left(A \cup B \cup C\right) = \mathbb{P}\left(A\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(B\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(C\right) - \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B\right) - \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap C\right) - \mathbb{P}\left(B \cap C\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B \cap C\right)$  Proof . Since $A \cup B \cup C = \left(A \cup B\right) \cup C$, by the previous theorem, 
  $$\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}\left(A \cup B \cup C\right) &= \mathbb{P}\left(A \cup B\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(C\right) - \mathbb{P}\left[\left(A \cup B\right) \cap C\right] \\
&= \mathbb{P}\left(A\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(B\right) - \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(C\right) - \mathbb{P}\left[\left(A \cap C\right) \cup \left(B \cap C\right)\right] \\
&= \mathbb{P}\left(A\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(B\right) - \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(C\right) - \Big[\mathbb{P}\left(A \cap C\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(B \cap C\right) \\
&- \mathbb{P}\left[\left(A \cap C\right) \cap \left(B \cap C\right) \right]\Big]\text{,}
\end{align}$$
  and since $\left(A \cap C\right) \cap \left(B \cap C\right) = A \cap B \cap C$, the result is proven. $\square$      share | cite | improve this answer      edited Feb 14 '17 at 23:10             answered Feb 9 '14 at 6:58       Clarinetist   8,948 2 22 58                  While I didn't ask for an analytic clarification explicitly, I've been trying to do this during the past 2 days, so I thank you for this.

The sections which feature more than once must be subtracted from the total to find the final answer.   The blank sections are added once. No subtraction required .  The dashed (||) sections represent $P(A \cap B \cap C^c)$, $P(A \cap B^c \cap C)$, and $P(A^c \cap B \cap C)$. Each appears twice so each must be subtracted once .  The dotted (::) section represents $P(A \cap B \cap C)$. Appears thrice so it must subtracted twice .   This yields:  $$P(A \cup B \cup C ) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \cap B \cap C^c) - P(A \cap B^c \cap C) - P(A^c \cap B \cap C) - 2P(A \cap B \cap C).$$  Observing from the figure that 
$$P(A \cap B \cap C^c) = P(A \cap B) - P(A \cap B \cap C),$$
$$P(A \cap B^c \cap C) = P(A \cap C) - P(A \cap B \cap C),$$
$$P(A^c \cap B \cap C) = P(B \cap C) -P(A \cap B \cap C),$$  The final answer is given by
$$P(A \cup B \cup C ) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \cap B) -  P(A \cap C) - P(B \cap C) + P(A \cap B \cap C).$$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Apr 1 '17 at 23:36       user3009798   41 4              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

However, the rules of finding the probability of A and B happening are a bit more elusive. In the former you add, which makes sense; in the later, you multiply, which does not make as much sense. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that both events occurring simultaneously has a lower probability. Is this one valid interpretation? I would very greatly appreciate someone being able to explain the mechanics of what is going on--that is, how can I interpret abstract math symbols in this particular case.    probability  elementary-number-theory  soft-question     share | cite | improve this question     asked Feb 4 '13 at 21:45       Mack   1,896 14 59 112                  You can think as a branch of possibilities.

For example, suppose that you roll a fair die. Event $A$ is getting an even number, and event $B$ is getting a number that is not a perfect square. These events have probabilities $\frac12$ and $\frac23$, respectively, so the sum of their probabilities is $\frac76$, which is greater than $1$ and cannot be a probability of anything. The actual probability of $A\text{ or }B$ is the probability of getting something other than a $1$, so it’s $\frac56$.  The probability of getting $A\text{ and }B$ is the probability of getting $2$ or $6$, which is $\frac13$. Adding $P(A)=\frac12$ and $P(B)=\frac23$ counts this event twice, once as part of $A$ and once as part of $B$, so to get the correct value of $P(A\text{ or }B)$ you have to subtract once what was counted twice, namely, $P(A\text{ and }B)$:  $$P(A\text{ or }B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\text{ and }B)\;.$$  As for $P(A\text{ and }B)$ being $P(A)P(B)$, you’re on the right track with the idea that getting both $A$ and $B$ to occur is harder than getting either one of them to occur individually. Suppose that you perform the experiment many times; on average you expect $A$ to occur in $P(A)$ fraction of the trials, and $B$ to occur in $P(B)$ fraction of the trials. If $A$ and $B$ are independent, $B$ will occur on average in $P(B)$ fraction of the trials in which $A$ occurs, and also in $P(B)$ fraction of the trials in which $A$ does not occur. You’re interested in the former: the trials in which $A$ and $B$ both occur. Overall on average that’s $P(B)$ fraction of the $P(A)$ fraction of the trials in which $A$ occurs, or $P(A)P(B)$ fraction of all the trials. In other words, if $A$ and $B$ are independent, then $P(A\text{ and }B)=P(A)P(B)$. In the example above, $$P(A\text{ and }B)=\frac13=\frac12\cdot\frac23\;:$$ half the time on average we get an even number, and on average two-thirds of those even numbers are $2$ or $6$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 30 '16 at 17:03             answered Feb 4 '13 at 22:02       Brian M.

Suppose you have events $A$ and $B$.  You have the following disjoint union.
$$A \cup B = (A - B) \cup (A \cap B) \cup (B - A),$$
so $$P(A\cup B) = P(A - B) + P(A\cap B) + P(B - A).$$
Since $A = (A - B) \cup (A\cap B)$, we have $P(A) = P(A - B) + P(A\cap B)$, giving
$$P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B - A).$$
Now by symmetry of the reasoning, we have
$$P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B - A) + P(A\cap B) - P(A\cap B) 
= P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B).$$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 4 '13 at 21:54       ncmathsadist   40.5k 2 54 95              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Use the inclusion/exclusion principle for finding probabilities of unions and intersections in general.  When the events are mutually exclusive, then you may multiply probabilities to get the probability of an intersection (i.e. "AND").  You are correct in that the probability of intersections will be less than the individual probabilities of each component event.  This is because probabilities are numbers between $0$ and $1$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Feb 4 '13 at 21:55             answered Feb 4 '13 at 21:49       Ron Gordon   120k 14 147 254                  I believe the inclusion/exclusion principle would really help if I had an issue with find the probability of the events A or B, where A and B are not disjoint--that is, they can occur simultaneously. – Mack  Feb 4 '13 at 21:51            That's right.

We are asked to find $P(A \cap B)$ from probability theory. I know that $P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)$. But surely the last one is equal zero so it means that  result should be $P(A)+P(B)$ but it is more than $1$ (To be exact it is $1.1$). Please help me where i am wrong?    probability  independence     share | cite | improve this question      edited Apr 2 '17 at 15:40       Icycarus   364 2 12        asked Jul 8 '11 at 7:35       dato datuashvili   5,300 12 46 99              add a comment |           4 Answers 4     active  oldest  votes            up vote  6  down vote  accepted      If the events $A$ and $B$ are independent, then $P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B)$ and not necessarily $0$.  You are confusing independent with mutually exclusive.  For instance, you toss two coins. What is the probability that both show heads? It is $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}$ isn't it? Note that the coin tosses are independent of each other.  Now you toss only one coin, what is the probability that it shows both heads and tails?     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jul 8 '11 at 7:47             answered Jul 8 '11 at 7:39       Aryabhata   68.3k 6 151 242              1      it is zero because if show me heads for example  it is impossible show  tails at the same time everything is clear thanks – dato datuashvili  Jul 8 '11 at 7:44             @user: Yes, zero is correct. Both events are mutually exclusive. – Aryabhata  Jul 8 '11 at 7:48            ok i have understood thanks very much it is a very great site with very great users – dato datuashvili  Jul 8 '11 at 7:58             But tossing 2 coins looks like a union: we're asking for probability of 2 independent events at the same time. I'd even suppose that intersection here is equal to union, but their formulas would give different results. I am so confused. – Hi-Angel  Apr 17 '17 at 23:10        1      @Hi-Angel: Suppose you toss two coins (call them A and B) at the same time. What is probability that at least one of them shows heads? This is asking about the union. What is the probability that both show heads? This is asking about the intersection. – Aryabhata  Apr 17 '17 at 23:18        add a comment |             up vote  3  down vote      If $A$ and $B$ are 2 independent events then :  \begin{align*}
P(A \cup B) &= P(A) + P(B) - P(A)\cdot P(B) \quad \Bigl[\because \tiny P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \ \text{for independent events} \Bigr] \\ &=  \frac{4}{10} + \frac{7}{10} - \frac{28}{100} \\ &= \frac{110-28}{100} = \frac{82}{100} =0.82

This is what throws everybody off in my math class. Mutually exclusive is when two events cannot happen at the same time and independent is when two events do not influence each other. In this case, there is an intersection because there are independent events, so you would subtract 1/28. On the other hand, let's look at it this way. If A was the chance of picking a king (4 kings) from a deck of cards and B was the chance of picking a queen as a deck of cards (4 queens), what is the probability that you would pick a king or a queen. Well, obviously a card cannot have both a king and a queen, therefore, there would not be an intersection. Hope that makes sense!     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 3 '17 at 2:17       Raul Agrasen   11 1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

We know that for rolling a die, the rolling a number greater than four or a number less than three are mutually exclusive events, with nothing in common. So to find the probability of this event, we simply add the probability that we roll a number greater than four to the probability that we roll a number less than three.         In symbols, we have the following, where the capital P denotes “probability of”:​​ P (greater than four or less than three) = P (greater than four) + P (less than three) = 2/6 + 2/6 = 4/6. If the events are not mutually exclusive, then we do not simply add the probabilities of the events together, but we need to subtract the probability of the intersection of the events. Given the events A and B : P ( A U B ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) - P ( A ∩ B ). Here we account for the possibility of double counting those elements that are in both A and B , and that is why we subtract the probability of the intersection. The question that arises from this is “Why stop with two sets? What is the probability of the union of more than two sets?” Formula for Union of Three Sets We will extend the above ideas to the situation where we have three sets, which we will denote A , B and C . We will not assume anything more than this, so there is the possibility that the sets have non-empty intersection.   The goal will be to calculate the probability of the union of these three sets, or P ( A U B U C ). The above discussion for two sets still holds. We can add together the probabilities of the individual sets A , B and C , but in doing this we have double counted some elements. The elements in the intersection of A and B have been double counted as before, but now there are other elements that have potentially been counted twice.         The elements in the intersection of A and C and in the intersection of B and C have now also been counted twice. So the probabilities of these intersections must also be subtracted. But have we subtracted too much? There is something new to consider that we did not have to be concerned about when there were only two sets. Just as any two sets can have an intersection, all three sets can also have an intersection. In trying to make sure that we did not double count anything, we have not counted at all those elements that show up in all three sets. So the probability of the intersection of all three sets must be added back in. Here is the formula that is derived from the above discussion: P ( A U B U C ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) + P ( C ) - P ( A ∩ B ) - P ( A ∩ C ) - P ( B ∩ C ) + P ( A ∩ B ∩ C ) Example To see the formula for the probability of the union of three sets, suppose we are playing a board game that involves rolling two dice . Due to the rules of the game, we need to get at least one of the dice to be a two, three or four in order to win. What is the probability of this? We note that we are trying to calculate the probability of the union of three events: rolling at least one two, rolling at least one three, rolling at least one four.  So we can use the above formula with the following probabilities: The probability of rolling a two is 11/36. The numerator here comes from the fact that there are six outcomes in which the first die is a two, six in which the second die is a two, and one outcome where both dice are twos. This gives us 6 + 6 - 1 = 11. The probability of rolling a three is 11/36, for the same reason as above. The probability of rolling a four is 11/36, for the same reason as above. The probability of rolling a two and a three is 2/36. Here we can simply list the possibilities, the two could come first or it could come second. The probability of rolling a two and a four is 2/36, for the same reason that probability of a two and a three is 2/36. The probability of rolling a two, three and a four is 0, because we are only rolling two dice and there is no way to get three numbers with two dice.  We now use the formula and see that the probability of getting at least a two, a three or a four is 11/36 + 11/36 + 11/36 – 2/36 – 2/36 – 2/36 + 0 = 27/36. Formula for Probability of Union of Four Sets The reason for why the formula for the probability of the union of four sets has its form is similar to the reasoning for the formula for three sets. As the number of sets increase, the number of pairs, triples and so on increase as well. With four sets there are six pairwise intersections that must be subtracted, four triple intersections to add back in, and now a quadruple intersection that needs to be subtracted. Given four sets A , B , C and D , the formula for the union of these sets is as follows: P ( A U B U C U D ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) + P ( C ) + P ( D ) - P ( A ∩ B ) - P ( A ∩ C ) - P ( A ∩ D )- P ( B ∩ C ) - P ( B ∩ D ) - P ( C ∩ D ) + P ( A ∩ B ∩ C ) + P ( A ∩ B ∩ D ) + P ( A ∩ C ∩ D ) + P ( B ∩ C ∩ D ) - P ( A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D ). Overall Pattern We could write formulas (that would look even scarier than the one above) for the probability of the union of more than four sets, but from studying the above formulas we should notice some patterns. These patterns hold to calculate unions of more than four sets. The probability of the union of any number of sets can be found as follows: Add the probabilities of the individual events. Subtract the probabilities of the intersections of every pair of events. Add the probabilities of the intersection of every set of three events. Subtract the probabilities of the intersection of every set of four events.  Continue this process until the last probability is the probability of the intersection of the total number of sets that we started with.                                           cite cite this article          Format  mla  apa  chicago  Your Citation   Taylor, Courtney.

The probability of the union of incompatible events is:
$$$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)$$$  The probability of the union of compatible events is:
$$$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$$$  Note that when the events are incompatible $$P(A\cap B)=0$$, then the second formula is always true.  Probability of the intersection of events  To calculate the probability of the intersection of events, we first have to verify whether they are dependent or independent.  The probability of the intersection of independent events is:
$$$P(A\cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)$$$  The probability of the intersection of dependent events is:
$$$P(A\cap B)=P(A/B)\cdot P(B)$$$  Let's note that when the events are independent, $$P (A/B) = P (A)$$, then the second formula in fact is always true.

	        probabilities of other events.  This lesson covers some important rules 
	        that simplify those computations.  View Video Lesson  Definitions and Notation  Before discussing the rules of probability, we state the following definitions:   Two events are mutually 
			    exclusive or disjoint if they cannot occur at the same time.  The probability that Event A occurs, given that Event B has occurred, is called 
		    a conditional probability . The conditional probability 
		    of Event A, given Event B, is denoted by the symbol P(A|B).  The complement of an event is the event not occurring.
	    The probability that Event A will not occur is denoted by P(A').  The probability that Events A and B both occur is  
	        the probability of the intersection of A and B.
	        The probability of the intersection of Events A and B is denoted by 
	        P(A ∩ B). If Events A and B are 
	        mutually exclusive, P(A ∩ B) = 0.  The probability that Events A or B occur is  
	        the probability of the union of A and B.
	        The probability of the union of Events A and B is denoted by 
	        P(A ∪ B) .  If the occurrence of Event A changes the probability of 
            Event B, then Events A and B are dependent .
            On the other hand, if the occurrence of Event A does not change
            the probability of Event B, then Events A and B are independent .    Probability Calculator  Use the Probability Calculator to compute the probability of 
		    an event from the known probabilities of other events. The Probability 
		    Calculator is free and easy to use. The Probability Calculator can found in the Stat Trek
            main menu under the Stat Tools tab. Or you can tap the button below.  Probability Calculator   Rule of Subtraction  In a previous lesson , 
        we learned two important properties of probability:   The probability of an event ranges from 0 to 1. The sum of probabilities of all possible events equals 1.   The rule of subtraction follows directly from these properties.   Rule of Subtraction . The probability 
		    that event A will occur is equal to 1 minus the probability that event A will not occur.  P(A) = 1 - P(A')   Suppose, for example, the probability that Bill will graduate from college
        is 0.80.  What is the probability that Bill will not graduate from college?
        Based on the rule of subtraction, the probability that Bill will not graduate
        is 1.00 - 0.80 or 0.20.  Rule of Multiplication  The rule of multiplication applies to the situation when we want to know 
        the probability of the intersection of two events; that is, we want to know
        the probability that two events (Event A and Event B) both occur.   Rule of Multiplication The 
	        probability that Events A and B both occur is 
		    equal to the probability that Event A occurs times the probability that 
		    Event B occurs, given that A has occurred.  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B|A)   Example An urn contains 6 red marbles and 4 black marbles. Two marbles are drawn without 
		    replacement from the urn. What is the probability that both of the 
	    marbles are black?  Solution: Let A = the event that the first marble is black; and let B = 
	    the event that the second marble is black. We know the following:   In the beginning, there are 10 marbles in the urn, 4 of which are black. 
	    Therefore, P(A) = 4/10. After the first selection, there are 9 marbles in the urn, 3 of which are 
		    black. Therefore, P(B|A) = 3/9.   Therefore, based on the rule of multiplication:  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B|A) P(A ∩ B) = (4/10) * (3/9) = 12/90 = 2/15 = 0.133           Rule of Addition  The rule of addition applies to the following situation. We have two events, 
        and we want to know the probability that either event occurs.   Rule of Addition The probability that 
	        Event A or Event B occurs 
		    is equal to the probability that Event A occurs plus the probability that Event 
		    B occurs minus the probability that both Events A and B occur.  P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)  Note: Invoking the fact that P(A ∩  B) = P( A )P( B | A ), the Addition Rule can also be expressed as:   P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P( B | A )   Example A student goes to the library. The probability that she checks out (a) a work 
	    of fiction is 0.40, (b) a work of non-fiction is 0.30, and (c) both fiction 
	    and non-fiction is 0.20. What is the probability that the student checks out a 
	    work of fiction, non-fiction, or both?  Solution: Let F = the event that the student checks out fiction; and let 
	    N = the event that the student checks out non-fiction. Then, based on the rule 
	    of addition:  P(F ∪ N) = P(F) + P(N) - P(F ∩ N) P(F ∪ N) = 0.40 + 0.30 - 0.20 = 0.50        Test Your Understanding  Problem 1  An urn contains 6 red marbles and 4 black marbles. Two marbles are drawn with replacement from the urn. What is the probability that both of the 
	    marbles are black?   (A) 0.16 (B) 0.32 (C) 0.36 (D) 0.40 (E) 0.60  Solution  The correct answer is A.  Let A = the event that the first marble is black; 
        and let B = 
	    the event that the second marble is black. We know the following:   In the beginning, there are 10 marbles in the urn, 4 of which are black. 
	    Therefore, P(A) = 4/10. After the first selection, we replace the selected marble; so there are still 
		    10 marbles in the urn, 4 of which are black. Therefore, P(B|A) = 4/10.   Therefore, based on the rule of multiplication:  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B|A) P(A ∩ B) = (4/10)*(4/10) = 16/100 = 0.16    Problem 2  A card is drawn randomly from a deck of ordinary playing cards. You win $10 if 
	    the card is a spade or an ace. What is the probability that you will win the 
	    game?   (A) 1/13 (B) 13/52 (C) 4/13 (D) 17/52 (E) None of the above.  Solution  The correct answer is C.
        Let S = the event that the card is a spade; and let A = the 
	    event that the card is an ace. We know the following:   There are 52 cards in the deck. There are 13 spades, so P(S) = 13/52. There are 4 aces, so P(A) = 4/52. There is 1 ace that is also a spade, so P(S ∩ A) = 1/52.   Therefore, based on the rule of addition:  P(S ∪ A) = P(S) + P(A) - P(S ∩ A) P(S ∪ A) = 13/52 + 4/52 - 1/52 = 16/52 = 4/13               Bestsellers Advanced Placement Statistics Updated daily 1.

uncertainty of statements or events. It gives a numerical measure for the degree
of certainty (or degree of uncertainty) of the occurrence of an event.   Another way to define probability is the
ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of all possible
outcomes. The enumeration of all possible outcomes is called as the sample
space.   If there are totally n possible outcomes
in a sample space, S and m of those are favorable for an event, A. then
probability of event, A is given as   P(A) = (number of favorable outcomes) /
(total number of possible outcomes)   = n(A) / n(S)   = m/n   Example:- Find the probability of getting a 3 or 5 while
throwing a dice.   Answer:- Sample space, S = {1,2,3,4,5,6} and Event, A =
{3,5}.   n(A) = 2 and n(S) = 6.   So, P(A) = n(A) / n(S) = 2/6 = 0.3333       Axioms of Probability:      All probability values are positive numbers not greater than
1, i.e. 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. An event that is not likely to occur or impossible has
probability zero, while an highly likely event has a probability one.    Example:- P(A
pregnant human being a female) = 1   Example:- P(A
human male being pregnant) = 0.       If the probability that an event occurs is p, then the
probability that the event does not occur is q = (1-p). i.e. probability of the
complement of an event = 1 - probability of the event.    i.e. P(Ā) =
1 - P(A)   Example:- Find the
probability of not getting a 3 or 5 while throwing a dice.   Answer:- Sample
space, S = {1,2,3,4,5,6} and Event, B = {1,2,4,6}.   n(B) = 4 and n(S) = 6.   So, P(B) = n(B) / n(S) = 4/6 = 0.6667   Now A and B are complementary events, i.e. B = Ā.   So: 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.3333 = 0.6667 = P(B) = P(Ā).       If A and b are two different events then, P(A U B) = P(A) +
P(B) - P(A ∩ B). Consider the Venn diagram. P(A U B) is the probability of the
sum of all sample points in A U B. Now P(A) + P(B) is the sum of probabilities
of sample points in A and in B. Since we added up the sample points in (A ∩ B)
twice, we need to subtract once to obtain the sum of probabilities in (A U B),
which is P(A U B).     Example:- Probability that John passes a Math exam is 4/5 and
that he passes a Chemistry exam is 5/6. If the probability that he passes both
exams is 3/4, find the probability that he is pass at least one exam.   Answer:- Let M = John passes Math exam, and C = John passes
Chemistry exam.   P(John passes at least one exam) = P(M U C) = P(M) + P(C) - P(M ∩ C)   = 4/5 + 5/6 - 3/4   = 53/60      If two events, A and B are mutually exclusive then, P(A U B)
= P(A) + P(B). This follows immediately from (3). Since A and B are mutually
exclusive, n(A ∩ B)=0 and so P(A ∩ B)=0.    Example:- What is the probability of getting a total of 7 or
11, when two dice are rolled.   Answer:- Let A be the event that the total is 7 and B be the
event that it is 11.   Sample space, S = { (1,1), (1,2), .........., (2,1), (2,2), ........., (6,6) }   n(S) = 36.   A = { (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) } and n(A) = 6.   So P(A) = 6/36 = 1/6.   B = { (5,6), (6,5) } and n(A) = 2.   So P(B) = 2/36 = 1/18.   Since, we cannot have a total both 7 and 11, A and B are mutually exclusive.   i.e. (A ∩ B) = 0.   So we have P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/6 + 1/18 = 2/9.      Exercises:     A person draws 5 cards from a shuffled pack of cards. Find
the probability that the person has at least 3 aces. Find the probability that
the person has at least 4 cards of the same suit.    Two cards are drawn from a pack, without replacement. What is
the probability that both are greater than 2 and lesser than 8.    A permutation of the word "white" is chosen at random. Find

    and or which are associated with these concepts.  Think of two roads that intersect in your
    hometown.  Now, think of a business at the intersection of these roads.  In Shelbyville there are two roads named
    Main and Madison.  If you were at the
    intersection then you would see KFC.  KFC is
    at the intersection of Main and Madison.  In other words, the intersection of
    sets is the set of elements or numbers common to both sets.  The union of sets is like a marriage of elements
    and numbers in the sets.  When a husband and
    wife marry (often referred to as a union ), they bring all of their
    belongings under one household.  Belongings
    which either he or she owned are now in their union (marriage.)  Every element that is in either
    set is in the union of sets.  The symbol for Union is   and the symbol for Intersection is  .  Observe the following example and note that the union  of sets is the set of elements that is in the first
    set or the second set while the intersection of sets is the set of elements that are in
    the first set and the second
    set.  (7)  Given
    that  A={2,4,6,8,10}  and  B={1,2,3,4,5}    A  B={1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10}  the Union   A B={2,4}  the Intersection  The last concept in this chapter is that of
    absolute value equations and inequalities.  You
    must remember that the value of the inside of the absolute value symbol may be
    positive or negative, but once the absolute value is evaluated the result is always
    positive.  In other words,   or  .  (8)  Solve
    the equation:  , then   or   .  Solving these equations we would find that   or  .  The absolute value equation has two points that
    satisfy the equation.  Checking this answer
    would provide the following information:   and  . The solution to the equation is the set {-1,4}.  Absolute value inequalities are solved in a
    similar fashion.  You must understand that the
    less than and less than or equal to inequalities are compound
    statements (the three part inequalities that were solved in the first section).  (9)  Solve
    the inequality:  .  This
    would mean that the value for   would lie
    between the values of  5  and  5.  Therefore, you would set up a compound inequality
    to solve the problem.  The problem would now
    look like this:    Solving this compound inequality would
    provide the result that  .  Which means
    that the value for x lies between  1  and  4.   (graph)  [  ]    -1  4  (interval notation)    notice that
    this is an Intersection of two sets of numbers  The greater than and
    greater than or equal to inequalities are disjoint statements.  This means that you must disjoin them
    or take them apart to solve.  The answer to
    the inequality will be greater than the positive value of the number or less than the negative value of the
    number.  The answer is the union of the two
    inequalities.  (10)  Solve the inequality:  .  This
    would mean that the value for   would be
    greater than  5  or the value for   would be less
    than  5.  When you disjoin the inequality to solve, the problem would look like
    this:    or    Solving these inequalities would provide

What percent of those who passed the first test also passed the second test?  Analysis: This problem describes a conditional probability since it asks us to find the probability that the second test was passed given that the first test was passed. In the last lesson, the notation for conditional probability was used in the statement of Multiplication Rule 2.  Multiplication Rule 2: When two events, A and B, are dependent, the probability of both occurring is:   The formula for the Conditional Probability of an event can be derived from Multiplication Rule 2 as follows:   Start with Multiplication Rule 2.   Divide both sides of equation by P(A).   Cancel P(A)s on right-hand side of equation.   Commute the equation.   We have derived the formula for conditional probability.  Now we can use this formula to solve the problem at the top of the page.  Problem: A math teacher gave her class two tests. 25% of the class passed both tests and 42% of the class passed the first test. What percent of those who passed the first test also passed the second test?  Solution:  P(Second|First)  =  P(First and Second)  =  0.25  =  0.60  =  60%  P(First)  0.42  Let's look at some other problems in which we are asked to find a conditional probability.  Example 1: A jar contains black and white marbles. Two marbles are chosen without replacement. The probability of selecting a black marble and then a white marble is 0.34, and the probability of selecting a black marble on the first draw is 0.47. What is the probability of selecting a white marble on the second draw, given that the first marble drawn was black?  Solution:  P(White|Black)  =  P(Black and White)  =  0.34  =  0.72  =  72%  P(Black)  0.47  Example 2: The probability that it is Friday and that a student is absent is 0.03. Since there are 5 school days in a week, the probability that it is Friday is 0.2. What is the probability that a student is absent given that today is Friday?  Solution:  P(Absent|Friday)  =  P(Friday and Absent)  =  0.03  =  0.15  =  15%  P(Friday)  0.2  Example 3: At Kennedy Middle School, the probability that a student takes Technology and Spanish is 0.087. The probability that a student takes Technology is 0.68. What is the probability that a student takes Spanish given that the student is taking Technology?  Solution:  P(Spanish|Technology)  =  P(Technology and Spanish)  =  0.087  =  0.13  =  13%  P(Technology)  0.68  Summary: The conditional probability of an event B in relationship to an event A is the probability that event B occurs given that event A has already occurred. The notation for conditional probability is P(B|A), read as the probability of B given A . The formula for conditional probability is:   The Venn Diagram below illustrates P(A), P(B), and P(A and B).

Conditional Probability The conditional probability B A P(B|A) probability of B given A A B independent A B B A B P(B)  If events A and B are not independent, then the probability
of the intersection of A and B (the probability that both events
occur) is defined by P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A). From this definition, the conditional probability P(B|A) is easily
obtained by dividing by P(A) :  Note: This expression is only valid when P(A) is greater than 0.   Examples In a card game, suppose a player needs to draw two cards of the same suit in order 
to win.  Of the 52 cards, there are 13 cards in each suit.  Suppose first the player 
draws a heart.  Now the player wishes to draw a second heart.  Since one
heart has already been chosen, there are now 12 hearts remaining in a deck of 51 cards.
So the conditional probability P(Draw second heart|First card a heart) = 12/51. Suppose an individual applying to a college determines that he has an 80% chance of
being accepted, and he knows that dormitory housing will only be provided for 60% of 
all of the accepted students.  The chance of the student being accepted and receiving dormitory housing is defined by  P(Accepted and Dormitory Housing) = P(Dormitory Housing|Accepted)P(Accepted) = 
(0.60)*(0.80) = 0.48.  To calculate the probability of the intersection of more than two events, the conditional
probabilities of all of the preceding events must be considered.  In the case of
three events, A , B , and C , the probability of the intersection P(A and B and C) = P(A)P(B|A)P(C|A and B) .  Consider the college applicant who has determined that he has 0.80 probability of 
acceptance and that only 60% of the accepted students will receive dormitory housing.  
Of the accepted students who receive dormitory housing, 80% will have at least one roommate.
The probability of being accepted and receiving dormitory housing and having
no roommates is calculated by:  P(Accepted and Dormitory Housing and No Roommates) = 
P(Accepted)P(Dormitory Housing|Accepted)P(No Roomates|Dormitory Housing and Accepted) = (0.80)*(0.60)*(0.20) = 0.096.  The student has about a 10% chance of receiving
a single room at the college. Another important method for calculating conditional probabilities is given by Bayes's formula P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A c )P(A c ) B B A A B P(B)P(A) + P(B)P(A c ) = P(B)(P(A) + 
P(A c )) = P(B)(1) = P(B), Example By Bayes's formula, P(Voter lives in state B|Voter supports liberal candidate) =
P(Voter supports liberal candidate|Voter lives in state B)P(Voter lives in state B)/
	(P(Voter supports lib. cand.|Voter lives in state A)P(Voter lives in state A) + 
	 P(Voter supports lib. cand.|Voter lives in state B)P(Voter lives in state B) +
	 P(Voter supports lib. cand.|Voter lives in state C)P(Voter lives in state C)) = (0.60)*(0.25)/((0.50)*(0.40) + (0.60)*(0.25) + (0.35)*(0.35)) 
= (0.15)/(0.20 + 0.15 + 0.1225) = 0.15/0.4725 = 0.3175.  The probability that the voter lives in state B is approximately 0.32.

	        probabilities of other events.  This lesson covers some important rules 
	        that simplify those computations.  View Video Lesson  Definitions and Notation  Before discussing the rules of probability, we state the following definitions:   Two events are mutually 
			    exclusive or disjoint if they cannot occur at the same time.  The probability that Event A occurs, given that Event B has occurred, is called 
		    a conditional probability . The conditional probability 
		    of Event A, given Event B, is denoted by the symbol P(A|B).  The complement of an event is the event not occurring.
	    The probability that Event A will not occur is denoted by P(A').  The probability that Events A and B both occur is  
	        the probability of the intersection of A and B.
	        The probability of the intersection of Events A and B is denoted by 
	        P(A ∩ B). If Events A and B are 
	        mutually exclusive, P(A ∩ B) = 0.  The probability that Events A or B occur is  
	        the probability of the union of A and B.
	        The probability of the union of Events A and B is denoted by 
	        P(A ∪ B) .  If the occurrence of Event A changes the probability of 
            Event B, then Events A and B are dependent .
            On the other hand, if the occurrence of Event A does not change
            the probability of Event B, then Events A and B are independent .    Probability Calculator  Use the Probability Calculator to compute the probability of 
		    an event from the known probabilities of other events. The Probability 
		    Calculator is free and easy to use. The Probability Calculator can found in the Stat Trek
            main menu under the Stat Tools tab. Or you can tap the button below.  Probability Calculator   Rule of Subtraction  In a previous lesson , 
        we learned two important properties of probability:   The probability of an event ranges from 0 to 1. The sum of probabilities of all possible events equals 1.   The rule of subtraction follows directly from these properties.   Rule of Subtraction . The probability 
		    that event A will occur is equal to 1 minus the probability that event A will not occur.  P(A) = 1 - P(A')   Suppose, for example, the probability that Bill will graduate from college
        is 0.80.  What is the probability that Bill will not graduate from college?
        Based on the rule of subtraction, the probability that Bill will not graduate
        is 1.00 - 0.80 or 0.20.  Rule of Multiplication  The rule of multiplication applies to the situation when we want to know 
        the probability of the intersection of two events; that is, we want to know
        the probability that two events (Event A and Event B) both occur.   Rule of Multiplication The 
	        probability that Events A and B both occur is 
		    equal to the probability that Event A occurs times the probability that 
		    Event B occurs, given that A has occurred.  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B|A)   Example An urn contains 6 red marbles and 4 black marbles. Two marbles are drawn without 
		    replacement from the urn. What is the probability that both of the 
	    marbles are black?  Solution: Let A = the event that the first marble is black; and let B = 
	    the event that the second marble is black. We know the following:   In the beginning, there are 10 marbles in the urn, 4 of which are black. 
	    Therefore, P(A) = 4/10. After the first selection, there are 9 marbles in the urn, 3 of which are 
		    black. Therefore, P(B|A) = 3/9.   Therefore, based on the rule of multiplication:  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B|A) P(A ∩ B) = (4/10) * (3/9) = 12/90 = 2/15 = 0.133           Rule of Addition  The rule of addition applies to the following situation. We have two events, 
        and we want to know the probability that either event occurs.   Rule of Addition The probability that 
	        Event A or Event B occurs 
		    is equal to the probability that Event A occurs plus the probability that Event 
		    B occurs minus the probability that both Events A and B occur.  P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)  Note: Invoking the fact that P(A ∩  B) = P( A )P( B | A ), the Addition Rule can also be expressed as:   P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P( B | A )   Example A student goes to the library. The probability that she checks out (a) a work 
	    of fiction is 0.40, (b) a work of non-fiction is 0.30, and (c) both fiction 
	    and non-fiction is 0.20. What is the probability that the student checks out a 
	    work of fiction, non-fiction, or both?  Solution: Let F = the event that the student checks out fiction; and let 
	    N = the event that the student checks out non-fiction. Then, based on the rule 
	    of addition:  P(F ∪ N) = P(F) + P(N) - P(F ∩ N) P(F ∪ N) = 0.40 + 0.30 - 0.20 = 0.50        Test Your Understanding  Problem 1  An urn contains 6 red marbles and 4 black marbles. Two marbles are drawn with replacement from the urn. What is the probability that both of the 
	    marbles are black?   (A) 0.16 (B) 0.32 (C) 0.36 (D) 0.40 (E) 0.60  Solution  The correct answer is A.  Let A = the event that the first marble is black; 
        and let B = 
	    the event that the second marble is black. We know the following:   In the beginning, there are 10 marbles in the urn, 4 of which are black. 
	    Therefore, P(A) = 4/10. After the first selection, we replace the selected marble; so there are still 
		    10 marbles in the urn, 4 of which are black. Therefore, P(B|A) = 4/10.   Therefore, based on the rule of multiplication:  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) P(B|A) P(A ∩ B) = (4/10)*(4/10) = 16/100 = 0.16    Problem 2  A card is drawn randomly from a deck of ordinary playing cards. You win $10 if 
	    the card is a spade or an ace. What is the probability that you will win the 
	    game?   (A) 1/13 (B) 13/52 (C) 4/13 (D) 17/52 (E) None of the above.  Solution  The correct answer is C.
        Let S = the event that the card is a spade; and let A = the 
	    event that the card is an ace. We know the following:   There are 52 cards in the deck. There are 13 spades, so P(S) = 13/52. There are 4 aces, so P(A) = 4/52. There is 1 ace that is also a spade, so P(S ∩ A) = 1/52.   Therefore, based on the rule of addition:  P(S ∪ A) = P(S) + P(A) - P(S ∩ A) P(S ∪ A) = 13/52 + 4/52 - 1/52 = 16/52 = 4/13               Bestsellers Advanced Placement Statistics Updated daily 1.

For Example: if we are performing the experiment of throwing a dice then there can be numerous events associated with it, one of which can be the number on top be a multiple of 3. There are different operations performed on events. Union is one of them. As the name implies union means joining of two things irrespective of their individual behavior.  The union of two events gives us a compound event. Union of events simply mean the condition of occurrence of wither of the events. It is not necessary that all events must hold true. The condition of at least one holds. More than one or even all events under the union operation can be true simultaneously.    Formula    Suppose A and B are two events associated with a random experiment. Then the union of A and B is represented by A $\cup$ B. The probability of union of two events is given by: $P (A \cup B)$ = $P (A) + P (B)$ – $P (A \cap B)$ Here, P (A) is the probability of event A, P (B) is the probability of event B. Also, $P (A \cap B)$ is the probability of the intersection of events A and B. When $A\ and\  B$ are two independent or mutually exclusive events that is the occurrence of event $A$ does not affect the occurrence of event B at all, in such a case, $P (A \cap B)$ = 0 and hence we have, $P (A \cup B)$ = $P (A) + P (B)$ If we have more than two independent events say A, B & C, then in that case the union probability is given by: $P (A \cup B \cup C)$ = $P (A) + P (B) + P (C)$ If $A\,  B\  and\  C$ are not independent or mutually exclusive then the union probability is given by: $P (A \cup B \cup C)$ = $P (A) + P (B) + P (C)$ – $P (A \cap B) – P (B \cap C) – P (A \cap C)$ - $P (A \cap B \cap C)$   Examples    Some examples are illustrated on union of events: Example 1: Consider the experiment of rolling a dice. Find the probability of getting an even number of a number that is multiple of 3. Solution: Here S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, so n (S) = 6 Let A be the event of getting an even number. So A = {2, 4, 6}. $\rightarrow n (A)$ = 3 Hence we have $P (A)$ = $\frac{3}{6}$ Let B be the event of getting a number that is multiple of 3. So B = {3, 6} $\rightarrow n (B)$ = 2 Hence we have $P (B)$ = $\frac{2}{6}$ We can clearly see that the events are not mutually exclusive. That is $A \cap B$ = {6}, => $n (A \cap B)$ = 1 => $P (A \cap B)$ = $\frac{1}{6}$ Thus the compound probability is given by: $P (A \cap B)$ = $P (A) + P (B) – P (A \cap B)$ = $\frac{3}{6}$ + $\frac{2}{6}$ - $\frac{1}{6}$ = $\frac{4}{6}$ = $\frac{2}{3}$ Example 2:  Christ rolled a fair die and wished to find the probability of "the number that turns up is odd or divisible by 5". From the sample space, Let A be the event "an odd number turns up" and the B is the event "the number that turns up is divisible by 5 ". Solution: Sample space for a die is: S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. From the given statement: A = {1, 3, 5} and B = {5}. Let M = The number that turns up is odd or divisible by 5 So M = A $\cup$ B = {1, 3, 5} and P(M) = P(A $\cup$ B) = $\frac{n(A \cup B)}{n(S)}$ = $\frac{3}{6}$ = $\frac{1}{2}$ = 0.5         «  Experimental Probability     Intersection of Events   »          Topics in  Union of Events  Union of Events Examples             © 2018 www.probabilityformula.org, Inc.

Fundamentals of Probability  Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood that certain outcomes will occur. There are five basic rules, or axioms, that one must understand while studying the fundamentals of probability.   Learning Objectives  Explain the most basic and most important rules in determining the probability of an event    Key Takeaways  KEY POINTS   Probability is a number that can be assigned to outcomes and events. It always is greater than or equal to zero, and less than or equal to one.  The sum of the probabilities of all outcomes must equal [latex]1[/latex].  If two events have no outcomes in common, the probability that one or the other occurs is the sum of their individual probabilities.  The probability that an event does not occur is [latex]1[/latex] minus the probability that the event does occur.  Two events [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are independent if knowing that one occurs does not change the probability that the other occurs.   KEY TERMS   experiment : Something that is done that produces measurable results, called outcomes.  outcome : One of the individual results that can occur in an experiment.  event : A subset of the sample space.  sample space : The set of all outcomes of an experiment.    In discrete probability, we assume a well-defined experiment, such as flipping a coin or rolling a die. Each individual result which could occur is called an outcome. The set of all outcomes is called the sample space, and any subset of the sample space is called an event.  For example, consider the experiment of flipping a coin two times. There are four individual outcomes, namely [latex]\text{HH},\text{HT},\text{TH},\text{TT}[/latex]. The sample space is thus [latex]\{\text{HH},\text{HT},\text{TH},\text{TT}\}[/latex]. The event “at least one heads occurs” would be the set [latex]\{\text{HH},\text{HT},\text{TH}\}[/latex]. If the coin were a normal coin, we would assign the probability of 1/4 to each outcome.  In probability theory, the probability [latex]\text{P}[/latex] of some event [latex]\text{E}[/latex], denoted [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{E}\right)[/latex], is usually defined in such a way that [latex]\text{P}[/latex] satisfies a number of axioms, or rules. The most basic and most important rules are listed below.  Probability Rules  Probability is a number. It is always greater than or equal to zero, and less than or equal to one. This can be written as [latex]0\leq{\text{P}}\left(\text{A}\right)\geq{1}[/latex]. An impossible event, or an event that never occurs, has a probability of [latex]0[/latex]. An event that always occurs has a probability of [latex]1[/latex]. An event with a probability of [latex]0.5[/latex] will occur half of the time.  The sum of the probabilities of all possibilities must equal [latex]1[/latex]. Some outcome must occur on every trial, and the sum of all probabilities is 100%, or in this case, [latex]1[/latex]. This can be written as [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{S}\right)=1[/latex], where [latex]\text{S}[/latex] represents the entire sample space.  If two events have no outcomes in common, the probability that one or the other occurs is the sum of their individual probabilities. If one event occurs in 30% of the trials, a different event occurs in 20% of the trials, and the two cannot occur together (if they are disjoint), then the probability that one or the other occurs is 30%+20%=50%. This is sometimes referred to as the addition rule, and can be simplified with the following: [latex]\text{P}\left({\text{A}} \text{ or} {\text{ B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex]. The word “or” means the same thing in mathematics as the union, which uses the following symbol: [latex]\cup[/latex]. Thus when [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are disjoint, we have [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex]. The probability that an event does not occur is [latex]1[/latex] minus the probability that the event does occur. If an event occurs in 60% of all trials, it fails to occur in the other 40%, because 100%−60%=40%. The probability that an event occurs and the probability that it does not occur always add up to 100%, or [latex]1[/latex]. These events are called complementary events, and this rule is sometimes called the complement rule. It can be simplified with [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}^\text{c}\right)=1−\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)[/latex], where [latex]\text{A}^\text{c}[/latex] is the complement of [latex]\text{A}[/latex].  Two events [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are independent if knowing that one occurs does not change the probability that the other occurs. This is often called the multiplication rule. If [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are independent, then [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A} \text{ and} \text{ B}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex]. The word “and” in mathematics means the same thing in mathematics as the intersection, which uses the following symbol: [latex]\cap[/latex]. Therefore when [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are independent, we have [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex].  Extension of the Example  Elaborating on our example above of flipping two coins, assign the probability [latex]1/4[/latex] to each of the [latex]4[/latex] outcomes. We consider each of the five rules above in the context of this example.  1. Note that each probability is [latex]1/4[/latex], which is between [latex]0[/latex] and [latex]1[/latex].  2. Note that the sum of all the probabilities is [latex]1[/latex], since [latex]\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}=1[/latex].  3. Suppose [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is the event exactly one head occurs, and B is the event exactly two tails occur. Then [latex]\text{A}=\{\text{HT},\text{TH}\}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}=\{\text{TT}\}[/latex] are disjoint. Also, [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\right)=\frac{3}{4}=\frac{2}{4}+\frac{1}{4}=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex].  4. The probability that no heads occurs is [latex]1/4[/latex], which is equal to [latex]1−3/4[/latex]. So if [latex]\text{A}=\{\text{HT},\text{TH},\text{HH}\}[/latex] is the event that a head occurs, we have [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}^\text{c}\right)=\frac{1}{4}=1−\frac{3}{4}=1−\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)[/latex].  5. If [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is the event that the first flip is a heads and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] is the event that the second flip is a heads, then [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and[latex]\text{B}[/latex] are independent. We have [latex]\text{A}=\{\text{HT},\text{HH}\}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}={\text{TH},\text{HH}}[/latex] and [latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}={\text{HH}}[/latex]. Note that [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)=\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{2}\cdot{\frac{1}{2}}=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex].  Conditional Probability  The conditional probability of an event is the probability that an event will occur given that another event has occurred.   Learning Objectives  Explain the significance of Bayes’ theorem in manipulating conditional probabilities    Key Takeaways  KEY POINTS   The conditional probability [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)[/latex] of an event [latex]\text{B}[/latex], given an event [latex]\text{A}[/latex], is defined by: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)=\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)}[/latex], when [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)>0[/latex].  If the knowledge that event [latex]\text{A}[/latex] occurs does not change the probability that event [latex]\text{B}[/latex] occurs, then [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and[latex]\text{B}[/latex] are independent events, and thus, [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex].  Mathematically, Bayes’ theorem gives the relationship between the probabilities of [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}, \text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)[/latex] and [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex], and the conditional probabilities of [latex]\text{A}[/latex] given [latex]\text{B}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] given [latex]\text{A}, \text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)[/latex] and [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\cap{\text{A}}\right)[/latex]. In its most common form, it is: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)=\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)}[/latex].   KEY TERMS   conditional probability : The probability that an event will take place given the restrictive assumption that another event has taken place, or that a combination of other events has taken place  independent : Not dependent; not contingent or depending on something else; free.    Probability of B Given That A Has Occurred  Our estimation of the likelihood of an event can change if we know that some other event has occurred. For example, the probability that a rolled die shows a [latex]2[/latex] is [latex]1/6[/latex] without any other information, but if someone looks at the die and tells you that is is an even number, the probability is now [latex]1/3[/latex] that it is a [latex]2[/latex]. The notation [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)[/latex] indicates a conditional probability, meaning it indicates the probability of one event under the condition that we know another event has happened. The bar “[latex]\mid[/latex]” can be read as “given”, so that [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)[/latex] is read as “the probability of [latex]\text{B}[/latex] given that [latex]\text{A}[/latex] has occurred”.  The conditional probability [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)[/latex] of an event [latex]\text{B}[/latex], given an event [latex]\text{A}[/latex], is defined by:  [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)=\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)}[/latex]  When [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)>0[/latex]. Be sure to remember the distinct roles of [latex]\text{B}[/latex] and [latex]\text{A}[/latex] in this formula. The set after the bar is the one we are assuming has occurred, and its probability occurs in the denominator of the formula.   Example  Suppose that a coin is flipped 3 times giving the sample space:  [latex]\text{S}=\{\text{HHH},\text{HHT},\text{HTH},\text{THH},\text{TTH},\text{THT},\text{HTT},\text{TTT}\}[/latex]  Each individual outcome has probability [latex]1/8[/latex]. Suppose that [latex]\text{B}[/latex] is the event that at least one heads occurs and [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is the event that all 3 coins are the same. Then the probability of [latex]\text{B}[/latex] given [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is [latex]1/2[/latex], since [latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}=\{\text{HHH}\}[/latex] which has probability [latex]1/8[/latex] and [latex]\text{A}=\{\text{HHH},\text{TTT}\}[/latex] which has probability [latex]2/8[/latex], and [latex]\frac{1/8}{2/8}=\frac{1}{2}[/latex].   Independence  The conditional probability [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)[/latex] is not always equal to the unconditional probability [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex]. The reason behind this is that the occurrence of event [latex]\text{A}[/latex] may provide extra information that can change the probability that event [latex]\text{B}[/latex] occurs. If the knowledge that event [latex]\text{A}[/latex] occurs does not change the probability that event [latex]\text{B}[/latex] occurs, then [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are independent events, and thus, [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex].  Bayes’ Theorem  In probability theory and statistics, Bayes’ theorem (alternatively Bayes’ law or Bayes’ rule) is a result that is of importance in the mathematical manipulation of conditional probabilities. It can be derived from the basic axioms of probability.  Mathematically, Bayes’ theorem gives the relationship between the probabilities of [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex], [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)[/latex] and [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex], and the conditional probabilities of [latex]\text{A}[/latex] given [latex]\text{B}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] given [latex]\text{A}[/latex]. In its most common form, it is:  [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\mid{\text{B}}\right)=\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)}[/latex]  This may be easier to remember in this alternate symmetric form:  [latex]\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{A}\mid{\text{B}}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{B}\mid{\text{A}}\right)}=\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)}[/latex]   Example  Suppose someone told you they had a nice conversation with someone on the train. Not knowing anything else about this conversation, the probability that they were speaking to a woman is 50%. Now suppose they also told you that this person had long hair. It is now more likely they were speaking to a woman, since women in in this city are more likely to have long hair than men. Bayes’s theorem can be used to calculate the probability that the person is a woman.  To see how this is done, let [latex]\text{W}[/latex] represent the event that the conversation was held with a woman, and [latex]\text{L}[/latex] denote the event that the conversation was held with a long-haired person. It can be assumed that women constitute half the population for this example. So, not knowing anything else, the probability that [latex]\text{W}[/latex] occurs is [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{W}\right)=0.5[/latex].  Suppose it is also known that 75% of women in this city have long hair, which we denote as [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{L}\mid{\text{W}}\right)=0.75[/latex]. Likewise, suppose it is known that 25% of men in this city have long hair, or [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{L}\mid{\text{M}}\right)=0.25[/latex], where [latex]\text{M}[/latex] is the complementary event of [latex]\text{W}[/latex], i.e., the event that the conversation was held with a man (assuming that every human is either a man or a woman).  Our goal is to calculate the probability that the conversation was held with a woman, given the fact that the person had long hair, or, in our notation, [latex]\text{P}(\text{W}\mid{\text{L}})[/latex]. Using the formula for Bayes’s theorem, we have:  [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{W}\mid{\text{L}}\right)=\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{L}\mid{\text{W}}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{W}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{L}\right)}=\frac{\text{P}\left(\text{L}\mid{\text{W}}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{W}\right)}{\text{P}\left(\text{L}\mid{\text{W}}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{W}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{L}\mid{\text{M}}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{M}\right)}=\frac{0.75\cdot{0.5}}{0.75\cdot{0.5}+0.25\cdot{0.5}}=0.75[/latex]   Unions and Intersections  Union and intersection are two key concepts in set theory and probability.   Learning Objectives  Give examples of the intersection and the union of two or more sets    Key Takeaways  KEY POINTS   The union of two or more sets is the set that contains all the elements of the two or more sets. Union is denoted by the symbol [latex]\cup[/latex].  The general probability addition rule for the union of two events states that [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)−\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)[/latex], where [latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}[/latex] is the intersection of the two sets.  The addition rule can be shortened if the sets are disjoint: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex]. This can even be extended to more sets if they are all disjoint: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\cup{\text{C}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{C}\right)[/latex].  The intersection of two or more sets is the set of elements that are common to every set. The symbol [latex]\cap[/latex] is used to denote the intersection.  When events are independent, we can use the multiplication rule for independent events, which states that [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex].   KEY TERMS   independent : Not contingent or dependent on something else.  disjoint : Having no members in common; having an intersection equal to the empty set.    Probability uses the mathematical ideas of sets, as we have seen in the definition of both the sample space of an experiment and in the definition of an event. In order to perform basic probability calculations, we need to review the ideas from set theory related to the set operations of union, intersection, and complement.  Union  The union of two or more sets is the set that contains all the elements of each of the sets; an element is in the union if it belongs to at least one of the sets. The symbol for union is [latex]\cup[/latex], and is associated with the word “or”, because [latex]\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}[/latex] is the set of all elements that are in [latex]\text{A}[/latex] or [latex]\text{B}[/latex] (or both.) To find the union of two sets, list the elements that are in either (or both) sets. In terms of a Venn Diagram, the union of sets [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] can be shown as two completely shaded interlocking circles.  Union of Two Sets : The shaded Venn Diagram shows the union of set [latex]\text{A}[/latex] (the circle on left) with set [latex]\text{B}[/latex] (the circle on the right). It can be written shorthand as [latex]\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}[/latex] In symbols, since the union of [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] contains all the points that are in [latex]\text{A}[/latex] or [latex]\text{B}[/latex] or both, the definition of the union is: [latex]\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}=\{\text{x}:\text{x}\in{\text{A}} \text{ or } \text{x}\in{\text{B}}\}[/latex] For example, if [latex]\text{A}=\{1,3,5,7\}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}=\{1,2,4,6\}[/latex] , then [latex]\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}[/latex]. Notice that the element 1 is not listed twice in the union, even though it appears in both sets [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex]. This leads us to the general addition rule for the union of two events: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)−\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)[/latex] Where [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)[/latex] is the intersection of the two sets. We must subtract this out to avoid double counting of the inclusion of an element. If sets [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are disjoint, however, the event [latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}[/latex] has no outcomes in it, and is an empty set denoted as ∅, which has a probability of zero. So, the above rule can be shortened for disjoint sets only: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex] This can even be extended to more sets if they are all disjoint: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cup{\text{B}}\cup{\text{C}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{C}\right)[/latex] Intersection The intersection of two or more sets is the set of elements that are common to each of the sets. An element is in the intersection if it belongs to all of the sets. The symbol for intersection is [latex]\cap[/latex], and is associated with the word “and”, because [latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}[/latex] is the set of elements that are in [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] simultaneously. To find the intersection of two (or more) sets, include only those elements that are listed in both (or all) of the sets. In terms of a Venn Diagram, the intersection of two sets [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] can be shown at the shaded region in the middle of two interlocking circles . Intersection of Two Sets :  Set A is the circle on the left, set B is the circle on the right, and the intersection of A and B, or [latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}[/latex], is the shaded portion in the middle. In mathematical notation, the intersection of [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] is written as[latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}=\{\text{x}:\text{x}\in{\text{A}}[/latex] and [latex]\text{x}\in{\text{B}}\}[/latex]. For example, if [latex]\text{A}=\{1,3,5,7\}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}=\{1,2,4,6\}[/latex], then [latex]\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}=\{1\}[/latex] because [latex]1[/latex] is the only element that appears in both sets [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex]. When events are independent, meaning that the outcome of one event doesn’t affect the outcome of another event, we can use the multiplication rule for independent events, which states: [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)=\text{P}\left(\text{A}\right)\text{P}\left(\text{B}\right)[/latex] For example, let’s say we were tossing a coin twice, and we want to know the probability of tossing two heads. Since the first toss doesn’t affect the second toss, the events are independent. Say is the event that the first toss is a heads and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] is the event that the second toss is a heads, then [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{A}\cap{\text{B}}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{4}[/latex]. Complementary Events The complement of [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is the event in which [latex]\text{A}[/latex] does not occur.  Learning Objectives  Explain an example of a complementary event   Key Takeaways  KEY POINTS   The complement of an event [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is usually denoted as [latex]\text{A}′[/latex], [latex]\text{A}^\text{c}[/latex] or [latex]\bar{\text{A}}[/latex].  An event and its complement are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one of the two events occurs, the other event cannot occur.  An event and its complement are exhaustive, meaning that both events cover all possibilities.   KEY TERMS   exhaustive : including every possible element  mutually exclusive : describing multiple events or states of being such that the occurrence of any one implies the non-occurrence of all the others   What are Complementary Events? In probability theory, the complement of any event [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is the event [latex][\text{not A}][/latex], i.e. the event in which [latex]\text{A}[/latex] does not occur. The event [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and its complement [latex][\text{not A}][/latex] are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that if one occurs, the other does not, and that both groups cover all possibilities. Generally, there is only one event [latex]\text{B}[/latex] such that [latex]\text{A}[/latex] and [latex]\text{B}[/latex] are both mutually exclusive and exhaustive; that event is the complement of [latex]\text{A}[/latex]. The complement of an event [latex]\text{A}[/latex] is usually denoted as [latex]\text{A}′[/latex], [latex]\text{A}^c[/latex] or [latex]\bar{\text{A}}[/latex].  Examples  Simple Examples  A common example used to demonstrate complementary events is the flip of a coin. Let’s say a coin is flipped and one assumes it cannot land on its edge. It can either land on heads or on tails. There are no other possibilities (exhaustive), and both events cannot occur at the same time (mutually exclusive). Because these two events are complementary, we know that [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{heads}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{tails}\right)=1[/latex].  Coin Flip : Often in sports games, such as tennis, a coin flip is used to determine who will serve first because heads and tails are complementary events. Another simple example of complementary events is picking a ball out of a bag. Let’s say there are three plastic balls in a bag. One is blue and two are red. Assuming that each ball has an equal chance of being pulled out of the bag, we know that [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{blue}\right)=\frac{1}{3}[/latex] and [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{red}\right)=\frac{2}{3}[/latex]. Since we can only either chose blue or red (exhaustive) and we cannot choose both at the same time (mutually exclusive), choosing blue and choosing red are complementary events, and [latex]\text{P}\left(\text{blue}\right)+\text{P}\left(\text{red}\right)=1[/latex]. Finally, let’s examine a non-example of complementary events. If you were asked to choose any number, you might think that that number could either be prime or composite. Clearly, a number cannot be both prime and composite, so that takes care of the mutually exclusive property. However, being prime or being composite are not exhaustive because the number 1 in mathematics is designated as “unique. ”   Licenses and Attributions   CC licensed content, Shared previously Curation and Revision.

One is red , 
one is blue , one is yellow ,
one is green , and one is purple .  
If one marble is to be picked at random from the bowl, the
sample space possible outcomes S = { red , blue , yellow , green , purple }.  If 3 of the 
marbles are red and 2 are blue , 
then the sample space S = { red , blue }, 
since only two  possible color outcomes be possible.  If, instead, two marbles are picked 
from a bowl with 3 red marbles and 2 blue marbles, then the sample space S = 
{(2 red ), (2 blue ), (1 red and 1 blue )}, 
the set of all possible outcomes. An event A Suppose there are 3 red marbles and 2 blue marbles in a bowl.  If an individual picks three 
marbles, one at a time, from the bowl, the event "pick 2 red marbles" can be achieved in 3 ways, 
so the set of outcomes A = {( red , red , blue ),( red , blue , red ), ( blue , red , red )}.  
The sample space for picking three marbles, one at a time, is all of the possible ordered 
combinations of three marbles, S = {( red , red , red ), ( red , red , blue ), ( red , blue , red ), ( blue , red , red ), ( blue , blue , red ), ( blue , red , blue ), ( red , blue , blue )}.  
Since there are only 2 blue marbles, it is impossible to achieve the event { blue , blue , blue }. A probability A P(A)  Rule 1: Any probability P(A) is a number between 0 and 1 
(0 < P(A) < 1).  Rule 2: The probability of the sample space S is equal to 1 (P(S) = 1). Suppose five marbles, each of a different color, are placed in a bowl.  The sample space for 
choosing one marble, from above, is S = { red , blue , yellow , green , purple }.  Since one of these must
be selected, the probability of choosing any marble is equal to the probability of 
the sample space S = 1.   Suppose the event of interest is choosing the purple marble, A = { purple }.  
If it is equally likely that any one marble will be selected, then the probability of choosing 
the purple marble, P(A) = 1/5.  In general, the following 
formula describes the calculation of probabilities for equally likely outcomes:  If there are k possible outcomes for a phenomenon and each is equally likely, 
then each individual outcome has probability 1/ k . The probability of any event A is   If two events have no outcomes in common, then they are called disjoint  Rule 3: If two events A and B are disjoint, then
the probability of either event is the sum of the probabilities of the two events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B).  The chance of any (one or more) of two or more events occurring is called 
the union For example, the probability of drawing either a purple , red , or green marble from a bowl of five
differently colored marbles is the sum of the probabilities of drawing any of these marbles:
1/5 + 1/5 + 1/5 = 3/5.  If there are three red marbles and two blue marbles, then the probability of drawing any red marble is the number of outcomes in the event " red ," which is equal
to three, divided by the total number of outcomes, 5, or 3/5 = 0.6.  The sample space is this case
is { red , blue }, which must have total 
probability equal to 1, so the probability of drawing a blue marble is equal to 2/5 = 0.4.
The event of drawing a blue marble does not occur if a red marble is chosen, so the event A = " blue " is called the complement A c of the event " red ."
Since an event and its complement together form the entire sample space S , the 
probability of an event A is equal to the probability of the 
sample space S , minus the probability of A c , as follows:  Rule 4: The probability that any event A does not occur is
P(A c ) = 1 - P(A).  Venn Diagrams A useful graphical tool for studying the complements, intersections, and unions of events within
a sample space S is known as a Venn diagram In the Venn diagram to the right, events A and B are disjoint.  Suppose, for example, event A is drawing a red marble from a bowl of five differently colored marbles, and 
event B is drawing a blue marble.  These events cannot 
both occur, so there is no overlapping area.   In the Venn diagram on the left, 
events A and B are not disjoint.  This means that it is possible for 
both events to occur, and the overlapping area represents this possibility.  Suppose, 
for instance, there are 3 red marbles and two blue marbles in a bowl.  Two marbles are to be drawn from the 
bowl, one after the other.  After the first draw, the marble drawn is returned to the bowl.  
Define event A to be drawing a red marble from the 
bowl on the first draw, and define event B to be drawing a blue marble on the second draw.  The occurence of event A is represented by the red area, the occurence of event B is represented by the blue area, the occurence of both events 
is represented by the overlapping area (also known as the intersection of the two events), 
and the occurence of either event is represented by the entire colored area (also 
known as the union of the two events).  Independence Consider two events which might occur in succession, such as two flips of a coin.  
If the outcome of the first event has no effect on the probability of the second 
event, then the two events are called independent multiplication rule  Rule 5: If two events A and B are independent, then the
probability of both events is the product of the probabilities for each event: P(A and B) = P(A)P(B).  The chance of all of two or more events occurring is called 
the intersection of events.  For independent events, the probability of the 
intersection of two or more events is the product of the probabilities. In the case of two coin flips, for example, the probability of observing
two heads is 1/2*1/2 = 1/4.  Similarly, the probability of observing four heads on 
four coin flips is 1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2 = 1/16.  If two events A and B are not disjoint, then the probability of their 
union (the event that A or B occurs) is equal to the sum of their probabilities minus the sum of their intersection.  In the example corresponding to the second Venn diagram above, we know that the probability 
of drawing a red marble on the first draw (event A ) is 
equal to 3/5, and the probability of drawing a blue marble on 
the second draw (event B ) is equal to 2/5.  Since events A and B are 
independent, the probability of the intersection of A and B, P(A and B) , equals the 
product P(A)*P(B) = 3/5*2/5 = 6/25.  The probability of the union of A and B , P(A or B) , is equal to P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 3/5 + 2/5 - 6/25 = 1 - 6/25 = 19/25 = 0.76. For another example, consider tossing two coins.  The probability of a head on any toss is
equal to 1/2.  Since the tosses are independent, the probability of a head on both tosses
(the intersection) is equal to 1/2*1/2 = 1/4.  The probability of a head on either 
toss (the union) is equal to the sum of the probabilities of a head on each toss minus
the probability of the intersection, 1/2 + 1/2 - 1/4 = 3/4.  Note: Disjoint events are not independent.  In the marble example,
consider drawing one marble from the bowl of five, where each marble is a different
color.  Suppose the event of interest, event A , is drawing a blue marble.  The probability of drawing this marble is 1/5.  
Suppose event B is drawing a green marble.  These events are 
disjoint, since event B cannot occur if event A occurs.  Obviously, they are not 
independent, since the outcome of event A directly affects the outcome of event B .  
If, instead, two marbles were to be drawn from the bowl, with the first marble replaced before the second
marble was drawn, then the event of drawing a blue marble on the first
draw would not affect the outcome of the second draw.  The event of drawing a green marble on the second draw would be independent of the event
of drawing a blue marble on the first draw, so the probability of both events occurring would be the product of the probabilities of each event,
1/5*1/5 = 1/25. The probability of the intersection of two or events which are not independent is determined 
using conditional probabilities . For some more definitions and examples, see the probability index in Valerie J. Easton and John H. McColl's Statistics Glossary v1.1 .

This is the probability of sample points belonging to exactly 1 event, exactly 2 events, ...,exactly $n$ events. WLOG this can be written as $$P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i \right) = P(A_1) + P(A_1 \cap A_2) + \cdots + P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_n)$$  But the $A_i$'s are arbitrary and we have to account for that. So there are $n$ possibilities for the first probability, $\binom{n}{2}$ possibilities for the second probability, ..., and $1$ possibility for the final probability.

$$
P\Bigl(\,\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n A_i\,\Bigr ) =\sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i).
$$  But (1) does not hold for arbitrary unions. One strategy to find a formula for the probability of a union of arbitrary events is to write the given union as a (different)  union of mutually disjoint events.   From this, it follows that your initial statement, "This is the probability of sample points belonging to exactly 1 event, exactly 2 events, ...,exactly $n$ events." , is correct.  $P\Bigl(\,\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n A_i\,\Bigr )$ is the sum of the probabilities of the events $B_i$ where $B_i$ is the event that exactly $i$ of the events $A_j$ occurs.
You have, noting that the $B_i$ are mutually disjoint:
$$
P\Bigl(\,\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n A_i\,\Bigr ) =\sum_{i=1}^n P(B_i).
$$  But,  the subsequent formula you have is incorrect. In fact, the event  $B_1$ is somewhat complicated. If exactly one event $A_i$ occurs, then either $A_1$ only occurs, or $A_2$ only occurs, ... .
So 
$$
B_1=  \bigcup_{j=1}^n \Bigl(\,A_j\cap ({\textstyle\bigcup\limits_{i\ne j }}\, A_i^C\,)\,\Bigr).
$$  Trying to write down descriptions of the other $B_i$ might lead you to suspect this particular method is more trouble than its worth (of course, it may prove useful in certain problems).   The formula in Dilip's comment is a nice way to "disjointify" the union $\cup A_i$. If you draw a Venn diagram for the case $n=2$, it is easy to convince yourself that
$A_1\cup A_2$ can be written as a union of pairwise disjoint events:
$$
A_1\cup A_2 = A_1 \cup (A_1^c\cap A_2).
$$
So you can write
$$
P(A_1\cup A_2) =P( A_1)+ P (A_1^c\cap A_2).
$$  For the case $n=3$, $A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3$ can be written as a union of pairwise disjoint events:
$$
A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3 = A_1 \cup(A_1^c\cap A_2)\cup (A_1^c\cap A_2^c\cap A_3).
$$
So you can write
$$
P(A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3) =P( A_1)+P(A_1^c\cap A_2)+P (A_1^c\cap A_2^c\cap A_3).
$$  And, of course the general formula in Dilip's comment holds because the union of the $A_i$  is written as a union of pairwise disjoint sets.   The "add and subtract business" you mention seems like what is done in deriving the so-called Inclusion-Exclusion principle, as mentioned in gnometorule's answer. This gives a different method for evaluating the probability of a union (it is not exactly the "disjointification" method above).  As a warm up to the general formula, let's consider the formulas for $P(A\cup B)$ and $P(A\cup B\cup C)$.   Probability of the union of two events:  Let us find the probability of the union of two arbitrary events $A$ and $B$. One might think $P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)$; however, each of
$P(A)$ and $P(B)$ counts the probability of $A\cap B$.  We thus have to subtract this probability from $P(A)+P(B)$ to obtain the correct formula: $$
P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B).
$$
Another way to derive the formula is to note that $A\cup B$ is the disjoint union of $A/B$, $B/A$, and $A\cap B$.
Now, since $A$ is the disjoint union of $A\cap B$ and $A/B$, it follows that $P(A)=P(A\cap B)+P(A/B)$; whence $P(A/B)= P(A)-P(A\cap B)$.  In a similar manner, one shows that   $P(B/A)= P(B)-P(B\cap A)$.  It follows that 
$$\eqalign{
  P(A\cup B)&=P(A/B)+P(B/A)+P(A\cap B)\cr
	&=\bigl( P(A)-P(A\cap B)\bigr)+\bigl(P(B)-P(B\cap A)\bigr)+P(A\cap B) \cr
	&= P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B).
	}
	$$   Probability of the union of three events: For three arbitrary events $A $, $B$, and $C$, to find $P(A \cup B\cup C)$, we first start with the guess
$$
P(A\cup B\cup C)=P(A )+P(B)+P(C).\tag{1}
$$
Now (1) counts each of $P(A \cap B)$, $P(A\cap C)$, and $P(B\cap C)$ twice. To make up for this,
we have to subtract
$$P(A \cap B)+P(A \cap C)+P(B\cap B).\tag{2}$$ 
But $P(A )+P(B)+P(C)$ counts $P(A \cap B \cap C)$ thrice, and in (2) we subtracted it thrice. So, we must add
$P(A )+P(B)+P(C)$ back in again. We have:
$$
P(A\cup B\cup C)=P(A)+P(B)+P(C)-P(A\cap B)-P(A\cap C)-P(B\cap C)+P(A\cap B\cap C).
$$
Looking at the Venn diagram may be helpful here:   More generally, for the events $A_1$, $A_2$, $\ldots\,$, $A_n$, we have the inclusion-exclusion principle:
$$\eqalign{
P\Bigl(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\Bigr) = \sum_{i\le n} P(A_i) - &\sum_{i_1<i_2} P(A_{i_1}\cap A_{i_2})
   +\sum_{i_1<i_2<i_3} P(A_{i_1}\cap A_{i_2}\cap A_{i_3}) - \cr
	&\cdots+ (-1)^{n}\sum_{i_1<i_2<\cdots<i_{n-1} } 
	P(A_{i_1}\cap\cdots\cap A_{i_{n-1}} )\cr&\qquad\qquad + (-1)^{n+1}P(A_1\cap A_2\cap\cdots\cap A_n)}.
$$  As pointed out in the comments, this can be proved by induction.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 29 '11 at 15:55             answered Dec 29 '11 at 13:38       David Mitra   61.1k 5 89 155                  +1 for a very well-written and thorough answer.  I think the OP's translation of thoughts into notation follows a pattern very often seen in beginners: confusing between an outcome $\omega$ belonging to an event $A$ and an outcome belonging only to an event $A$ and not to other events. $$A\cup B=(A\cap B^c)\cup(A^c\cap B)\cup(A\cap B)$$ is saying "outcome belongs only to $A$ or only to $B$ or to both". The three parts are disjoint, and so probabilities can be added.

The sieve formula is an easy inductive proof.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 29 '11 at 3:54       Ilmari Karonen   18.7k 2 49 79        answered Dec 29 '11 at 3:00       gnometorule   4,002 18 38              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

The problem is I wanted to say that A will transfer elecricity only if 1 of his legs will be connected so its like saying $0.8 + 0.8 + 0.8$ which is obviously wrong(over $1$) so I used the weird formula that says to do like this: $0.8 + 0.8 + 0.8 - (0.8)^2 -(0.8)^2 - (0.8)^2 + (0.8)^3 = {124\over125}$ too.  My only problem is that I didnt understand why I had to use that formula and why I could multiple probabilities for the intersection but couldn't just sum them for the union.

Only then is the probability of the intersection equal to the product of the probabilities of the events.  $\mathsf P(A\cap B) ~=~ \mathsf P(A)~\mathsf P(B)~$ only when events $A$ and $B$ are independent.  (When dealing with more than two events we require mutual independence .)  Otherwise conditional probability must be used: $\mathsf P(A\cap B)~=~\mathsf P(A)~\mathsf P(B\mid A)\\\qquad\qquad~=~\mathsf P(A\mid B)~\mathsf P(B)$   The Addition Rule applies only when the events are mutually exclusive (also known as disjoint ).   Only then is the probability of the union equal to the sum of probabilities of the event.  $\mathsf P(A\cup B)~=~\mathsf P(A)+\mathsf P(B)$  Otherwise if the events are not disjoint (ie they have common outcomes) then we would be over measuring and must exclude the measure of the intersection.  $\mathsf P(A\cup B)~=~\mathsf P(A)+\mathsf P(B) - \mathsf P(A\cap B)$  When dealing with more than two events, the principle of inclusion and exclusion is required  $\begin{align}\mathsf P(A\cup B\cup C)~=~&\mathsf P(A)+\mathsf P(B)+\mathsf P(C) - \mathsf P(A\cap B)-\mathsf P(A\cap C)-\mathsf P(B\cap C)+\mathsf P(A\cap B\cap C)\end{align}$  ... and so on.  $\Box$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Apr 15 '16 at 11:56       Graham Kemp   73.6k 4 30 66              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Hint One of the three legs running isnt dependent on the running of other two legs.

\mathbb{P}\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_i\right) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{P}\left(A_i\right)\text{.}
\end{align}$$  It so happens that this is also true if you have a finite number of disjoint events. If you're interested in more detail, consult a measure-theoretic probability  textbook.   Theorem . For two events $A$ and $B$, $\mathbb{P}\left(A \cup B\right) = \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B) - \mathbb{P}(A \cap B)$.  Proof . Write $A \cup B = \left(A \cap B\right) \cup \left(A \cap B^{c}\right) \cup \left(A^{c} \cap B\right)$. Notice also that $A = \left(A \cap B^{c}\right) \cup\left(A \cap B\right)$ and $B = \left(B \cap A^{c}\right) \cup \left(A \cap B\right)$. This implies that 
  $$\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}\left(A\right) &= \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B^{c}\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B\right) \\
\mathbb{P}\left(B\right) &= \mathbb{P}\left(B \cap A^{c}\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B\right) \\
\end{align}$$
  Then since $\left(A \cap B\right) \cup \left(A \cap B^{c}\right) \cup \left(A^{c} \cap B\right)$ is a disjoint union of sets,
  $$\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}\left(A \cup B\right) &= \mathbb{P}\left[ \left(A \cap B\right) \cup \left(A \cap B^{c}\right) \cup \left(A^{c} \cap B\right) \right] \\
&= \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B^{c}\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(A^{c} \cap B\right) \\
&= \mathbb{P}\left(A\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(A^{c} \cap B\right) \\
&= \mathbb{P}\left(A\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(B\right) - \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B\right)\text{. } \square
\end{align}$$  Theorem . $\mathbb{P}\left(A \cup B \cup C\right) = \mathbb{P}\left(A\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(B\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(C\right) - \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B\right) - \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap C\right) - \mathbb{P}\left(B \cap C\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B \cap C\right)$  Proof . Since $A \cup B \cup C = \left(A \cup B\right) \cup C$, by the previous theorem, 
  $$\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}\left(A \cup B \cup C\right) &= \mathbb{P}\left(A \cup B\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(C\right) - \mathbb{P}\left[\left(A \cup B\right) \cap C\right] \\
&= \mathbb{P}\left(A\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(B\right) - \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(C\right) - \mathbb{P}\left[\left(A \cap C\right) \cup \left(B \cap C\right)\right] \\
&= \mathbb{P}\left(A\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(B\right) - \mathbb{P}\left(A \cap B\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(C\right) - \Big[\mathbb{P}\left(A \cap C\right) + \mathbb{P}\left(B \cap C\right) \\
&- \mathbb{P}\left[\left(A \cap C\right) \cap \left(B \cap C\right) \right]\Big]\text{,}
\end{align}$$
  and since $\left(A \cap C\right) \cap \left(B \cap C\right) = A \cap B \cap C$, the result is proven. $\square$      share | cite | improve this answer      edited Feb 14 '17 at 23:10             answered Feb 9 '14 at 6:58       Clarinetist   8,948 2 22 58                  While I didn't ask for an analytic clarification explicitly, I've been trying to do this during the past 2 days, so I thank you for this.

The sections which feature more than once must be subtracted from the total to find the final answer.   The blank sections are added once. No subtraction required .  The dashed (||) sections represent $P(A \cap B \cap C^c)$, $P(A \cap B^c \cap C)$, and $P(A^c \cap B \cap C)$. Each appears twice so each must be subtracted once .  The dotted (::) section represents $P(A \cap B \cap C)$. Appears thrice so it must subtracted twice .   This yields:  $$P(A \cup B \cup C ) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \cap B \cap C^c) - P(A \cap B^c \cap C) - P(A^c \cap B \cap C) - 2P(A \cap B \cap C).$$  Observing from the figure that 
$$P(A \cap B \cap C^c) = P(A \cap B) - P(A \cap B \cap C),$$
$$P(A \cap B^c \cap C) = P(A \cap C) - P(A \cap B \cap C),$$
$$P(A^c \cap B \cap C) = P(B \cap C) -P(A \cap B \cap C),$$  The final answer is given by
$$P(A \cup B \cup C ) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A \cap B) -  P(A \cap C) - P(B \cap C) + P(A \cap B \cap C).$$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Apr 1 '17 at 23:36       user3009798   41 4              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

However, the rules of finding the probability of A and B happening are a bit more elusive. In the former you add, which makes sense; in the later, you multiply, which does not make as much sense. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that both events occurring simultaneously has a lower probability. Is this one valid interpretation? I would very greatly appreciate someone being able to explain the mechanics of what is going on--that is, how can I interpret abstract math symbols in this particular case.    probability  elementary-number-theory  soft-question     share | cite | improve this question     asked Feb 4 '13 at 21:45       Mack   1,896 14 59 112                  You can think as a branch of possibilities.

For example, suppose that you roll a fair die. Event $A$ is getting an even number, and event $B$ is getting a number that is not a perfect square. These events have probabilities $\frac12$ and $\frac23$, respectively, so the sum of their probabilities is $\frac76$, which is greater than $1$ and cannot be a probability of anything. The actual probability of $A\text{ or }B$ is the probability of getting something other than a $1$, so it’s $\frac56$.  The probability of getting $A\text{ and }B$ is the probability of getting $2$ or $6$, which is $\frac13$. Adding $P(A)=\frac12$ and $P(B)=\frac23$ counts this event twice, once as part of $A$ and once as part of $B$, so to get the correct value of $P(A\text{ or }B)$ you have to subtract once what was counted twice, namely, $P(A\text{ and }B)$:  $$P(A\text{ or }B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\text{ and }B)\;.$$  As for $P(A\text{ and }B)$ being $P(A)P(B)$, you’re on the right track with the idea that getting both $A$ and $B$ to occur is harder than getting either one of them to occur individually. Suppose that you perform the experiment many times; on average you expect $A$ to occur in $P(A)$ fraction of the trials, and $B$ to occur in $P(B)$ fraction of the trials. If $A$ and $B$ are independent, $B$ will occur on average in $P(B)$ fraction of the trials in which $A$ occurs, and also in $P(B)$ fraction of the trials in which $A$ does not occur. You’re interested in the former: the trials in which $A$ and $B$ both occur. Overall on average that’s $P(B)$ fraction of the $P(A)$ fraction of the trials in which $A$ occurs, or $P(A)P(B)$ fraction of all the trials. In other words, if $A$ and $B$ are independent, then $P(A\text{ and }B)=P(A)P(B)$. In the example above, $$P(A\text{ and }B)=\frac13=\frac12\cdot\frac23\;:$$ half the time on average we get an even number, and on average two-thirds of those even numbers are $2$ or $6$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 30 '16 at 17:03             answered Feb 4 '13 at 22:02       Brian M.

Suppose you have events $A$ and $B$.  You have the following disjoint union.
$$A \cup B = (A - B) \cup (A \cap B) \cup (B - A),$$
so $$P(A\cup B) = P(A - B) + P(A\cap B) + P(B - A).$$
Since $A = (A - B) \cup (A\cap B)$, we have $P(A) = P(A - B) + P(A\cap B)$, giving
$$P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B - A).$$
Now by symmetry of the reasoning, we have
$$P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B - A) + P(A\cap B) - P(A\cap B) 
= P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B).$$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Feb 4 '13 at 21:54       ncmathsadist   40.5k 2 54 95              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Use the inclusion/exclusion principle for finding probabilities of unions and intersections in general.  When the events are mutually exclusive, then you may multiply probabilities to get the probability of an intersection (i.e. "AND").  You are correct in that the probability of intersections will be less than the individual probabilities of each component event.  This is because probabilities are numbers between $0$ and $1$.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Feb 4 '13 at 21:55             answered Feb 4 '13 at 21:49       Ron Gordon   120k 14 147 254                  I believe the inclusion/exclusion principle would really help if I had an issue with find the probability of the events A or B, where A and B are not disjoint--that is, they can occur simultaneously. – Mack  Feb 4 '13 at 21:51            That's right.

This is what throws everybody off in my math class. Mutually exclusive is when two events cannot happen at the same time and independent is when two events do not influence each other. In this case, there is an intersection because there are independent events, so you would subtract 1/28. On the other hand, let's look at it this way. If A was the chance of picking a king (4 kings) from a deck of cards and B was the chance of picking a queen as a deck of cards (4 queens), what is the probability that you would pick a king or a queen. Well, obviously a card cannot have both a king and a queen, therefore, there would not be an intersection. Hope that makes sense!     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 3 '17 at 2:17       Raul Agrasen   11 1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

We know that for rolling a die, the rolling a number greater than four or a number less than three are mutually exclusive events, with nothing in common. So to find the probability of this event, we simply add the probability that we roll a number greater than four to the probability that we roll a number less than three.         In symbols, we have the following, where the capital P denotes “probability of”:​​ P (greater than four or less than three) = P (greater than four) + P (less than three) = 2/6 + 2/6 = 4/6. If the events are not mutually exclusive, then we do not simply add the probabilities of the events together, but we need to subtract the probability of the intersection of the events. Given the events A and B : P ( A U B ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) - P ( A ∩ B ). Here we account for the possibility of double counting those elements that are in both A and B , and that is why we subtract the probability of the intersection. The question that arises from this is “Why stop with two sets? What is the probability of the union of more than two sets?” Formula for Union of Three Sets We will extend the above ideas to the situation where we have three sets, which we will denote A , B and C . We will not assume anything more than this, so there is the possibility that the sets have non-empty intersection.   The goal will be to calculate the probability of the union of these three sets, or P ( A U B U C ). The above discussion for two sets still holds. We can add together the probabilities of the individual sets A , B and C , but in doing this we have double counted some elements. The elements in the intersection of A and B have been double counted as before, but now there are other elements that have potentially been counted twice.         The elements in the intersection of A and C and in the intersection of B and C have now also been counted twice. So the probabilities of these intersections must also be subtracted. But have we subtracted too much? There is something new to consider that we did not have to be concerned about when there were only two sets. Just as any two sets can have an intersection, all three sets can also have an intersection. In trying to make sure that we did not double count anything, we have not counted at all those elements that show up in all three sets. So the probability of the intersection of all three sets must be added back in. Here is the formula that is derived from the above discussion: P ( A U B U C ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) + P ( C ) - P ( A ∩ B ) - P ( A ∩ C ) - P ( B ∩ C ) + P ( A ∩ B ∩ C ) Example To see the formula for the probability of the union of three sets, suppose we are playing a board game that involves rolling two dice . Due to the rules of the game, we need to get at least one of the dice to be a two, three or four in order to win. What is the probability of this? We note that we are trying to calculate the probability of the union of three events: rolling at least one two, rolling at least one three, rolling at least one four.  So we can use the above formula with the following probabilities: The probability of rolling a two is 11/36. The numerator here comes from the fact that there are six outcomes in which the first die is a two, six in which the second die is a two, and one outcome where both dice are twos. This gives us 6 + 6 - 1 = 11. The probability of rolling a three is 11/36, for the same reason as above. The probability of rolling a four is 11/36, for the same reason as above. The probability of rolling a two and a three is 2/36. Here we can simply list the possibilities, the two could come first or it could come second. The probability of rolling a two and a four is 2/36, for the same reason that probability of a two and a three is 2/36. The probability of rolling a two, three and a four is 0, because we are only rolling two dice and there is no way to get three numbers with two dice.  We now use the formula and see that the probability of getting at least a two, a three or a four is 11/36 + 11/36 + 11/36 – 2/36 – 2/36 – 2/36 + 0 = 27/36. Formula for Probability of Union of Four Sets The reason for why the formula for the probability of the union of four sets has its form is similar to the reasoning for the formula for three sets. As the number of sets increase, the number of pairs, triples and so on increase as well. With four sets there are six pairwise intersections that must be subtracted, four triple intersections to add back in, and now a quadruple intersection that needs to be subtracted. Given four sets A , B , C and D , the formula for the union of these sets is as follows: P ( A U B U C U D ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) + P ( C ) + P ( D ) - P ( A ∩ B ) - P ( A ∩ C ) - P ( A ∩ D )- P ( B ∩ C ) - P ( B ∩ D ) - P ( C ∩ D ) + P ( A ∩ B ∩ C ) + P ( A ∩ B ∩ D ) + P ( A ∩ C ∩ D ) + P ( B ∩ C ∩ D ) - P ( A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D ). Overall Pattern We could write formulas (that would look even scarier than the one above) for the probability of the union of more than four sets, but from studying the above formulas we should notice some patterns. These patterns hold to calculate unions of more than four sets. The probability of the union of any number of sets can be found as follows: Add the probabilities of the individual events. Subtract the probabilities of the intersections of every pair of events. Add the probabilities of the intersection of every set of three events. Subtract the probabilities of the intersection of every set of four events.  Continue this process until the last probability is the probability of the intersection of the total number of sets that we started with.                                           cite cite this article          Format  mla  apa  chicago  Your Citation   Taylor, Courtney.

The probability of the union of incompatible events is:
$$$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)$$$  The probability of the union of compatible events is:
$$$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$$$  Note that when the events are incompatible $$P(A\cap B)=0$$, then the second formula is always true.  Probability of the intersection of events  To calculate the probability of the intersection of events, we first have to verify whether they are dependent or independent.  The probability of the intersection of independent events is:
$$$P(A\cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)$$$  The probability of the intersection of dependent events is:
$$$P(A\cap B)=P(A/B)\cdot P(B)$$$  Let's note that when the events are independent, $$P (A/B) = P (A)$$, then the second formula in fact is always true.
