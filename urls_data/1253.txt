Baer , Journal Sentinel Staff   Aug. 25, 2013    0                 Mike Kisner thought the doctor had to be kidding. Triplets, the doctor said. Kisner and his fiancée were having triplets.  The couple had little time to absorb the idea when, two days later, the doctor found a fourth baby.  Kisner, 26, and his fiancée, Charity McCulloch, 39, of Wilmot in Kenosha County, had conceived quadruplets without the assistance of fertility drugs.  "I thought it was a joke at first," McCulloch said.  The couple found themselves in a rather exclusive club. The chance of conceiving quadruplets naturally is 1 in 700,000, said Joseph Davis, a gynecologist and fertility specialist at Froedtert & The Medical College of Wisconsin. Experts say 90% of quadruplets are born with the aid of medical technology.  "It is a surprise to have natural quadruplets, but it's not unheard of," Davis said. "It's just exceedingly rare."  The couple had planned to have one child once they were married — they plan to marry Aug. 31.  But when the four boys were born at Wheaton Franciscan All Saints Hospital in Racine on June 5, they became an instant family.  "The Lord has a plan for us. I don't know what it is, but He has a plan for us," Kisner said.  Kisner remembers being in the operating room that day with more than 20 doctors and nurses.  "It was very chaotic," he said. "Each person had their own little job to do and in a matter of three minutes all of them were out."  The quadruplets were born at 28 weeks and four days — birth normally occurs around 40 weeks. Typically, multiple pregnancies reduce the gestation period about three weeks per baby, or "multiple," said Davis.  Because of the early delivery, the quadruplets stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit several weeks after they were born. The smallest baby weighed 1 pound, 12 ounces.  Two boys, Kerrigan and Christian, went home July 29, while Brice and Oliver, the smaller of the four, stayed at the hospital a bit longer. They came home on Aug. 8. None of them faced severe complications.  While family history of twins can increase the  chances of multiple births, the science behind conceiving quadruplets, or even triplets, is a bit of a mystery. Davis said one theory is that the closer women are to menopause, the higher their chances are of multiple births. These women typically have elevated follicle-stimulating hormones levels, which can increase their chance of having more than one egg released.  "From a reproductive standpoint she's closer to advanced reproductive age," Davis said of McCulloch. "It may be a factor."  Davis said the age of the male is usually less of a factor because males have the same fertility chances up until age 50 or 60.  Kisner and McCulloch met at work about five years ago and got engaged last summer. The two are paramedics for Bell Ambulance in Milwaukee.  Though the stress of caring for four babies at once has challenged the new parents, Kisner and McCulloch have prepared themselves.  "We're just trying to keep the boys healthy and keep our sanity," Kisner said.  "Four's enough," McCulloch said.       0    Share    Tweet    Email    Print                             News Watch               Milwaukee man accused of executing man over $90 debt  11:31 a.m.    Convict in fatal park shooting will have chance at parole  11:08 a.m.    UW-led study finds infection with Zika prevents reinfection  11:03 a.m.    Dodge County man charged with homicide in woman’s overdose  10:55 a.m.    Wisconsin’s appeal on abortion turned away by Supreme Court  Updated:

But for parents of quadruplets, their initial responses can be far from what can be called exuberance, at least in the early stages.  The practicalities of raising four babies to adulthood can seem utterly overwhelming, which is why experienced parents of higher order multiples ( HOM ) say it can help to just take things slowly at first and to allow the news to settle in, one steady day at a time.  The most common form of multiples are twins. Statistically 90% of all multiple births are made up of twins and the remaining 10% being shared between triplets, quadruplets and more. The most common variety of quadruplets is formed when four separate eggs are fertilised by four separate sperm.  There are however, a range of possibilities when it comes to the different combinations of quadruplets and how they are conceived. Quadruplets may be identical, non identical or a combination of both.  As well as the four separate eggs and sperm variety, there is also the possibility that:   One fertilised egg splits into four identical embryos.  One fertilised egg splits into three identical embryos and another separate egg is fertilised by a separate sperm. This means there are identical triplets plus one.  One set of Identical (monozygotic) twins occurs plus another two entirely separate embryos or another set of identical twins.  Another possibility is that a set of non identical/fraternal twins are conceived plus a monozygotic pair form making a total of four embryos.   Quadruplet pregnancy is usually diagnosed on ultrasound.  This is the most common time for parents to be told that four babies have been conceived and implanted. Seeing four little embryos on the screen can help the idea become a reality, but it’s very normal for expectant parents to leave the ultrasound rooms in a state of shock.  If they have had fertility assistance then there is an increased risk of multiple birth so the possibility may already have been raised and discussed. Although rare, it is not unknown for quadruplets to be naturally conceived.  Tell us again how lucky we are  Different cultures view multiple births in diverse ways.  For the Mayans, identical twins were seen as a blessing from God and a sign that they shared one soul which had been split between the two. In Roman culture twin boys were also viewed as a blessing, but unfortunately this belief did not extend to twin girls. They were seen as too much of a burden and the expense of raising two dowries instead of one overshadowed the “specialness” of two babies.  Within Greek and other European mythology, twins and other higher order multiples all feature, with their existence being attributable to the blessing or alternately, a curse from an almighty God.  In some ancient cultures, multiple births were seen as an outward sign that a woman had been unfaithful to her husband and the existence of more than one baby was indisputable proof of this.  Without any means of disproving this theory the poor women and their babies were often left to fend for themselves.  It goes without saying that we have much to be thankful for in terms of our current understanding of science and reproductive biology. But no matter how smart we have become and irrefutable evidence now supports our knowledge, there is still a little mystery and specialness surrounding multiple births.  Are quads as common as they used to be?  In the 1980s-1990s, multiple pregnancies were generally more common than at the present time. This decrease is thought to be due to overall advances in technology surrounding fertility assistance as well as the increased likelihood of these pregnancies being successful.  In the early days of assisted reproductive technology the general approach was to implant as many fertilised eggs as possible and therefore increase the chances of at least one of them implanting. But since there has been a greater understanding of the processes involved, as well as changes in the legislation surrounding the numbers of embryos which can be implanted, this has meant a reduction in the number of quadruplets being born.  There is an increased likelihood of quadruplets when:   A mother has a family history of multiple births. If she is a multiple herself or her mother and/or sisters naturally conceived multiple babies, then she is more likely to as well. This is because there is a genetic link of hyper ovulation amongst the women in some families.  Couples have had fertility assistance. Medication which increases the number of eggs supported towards maturity will increase the chances of multiple conception.  Women whose diet is high in dairy foods and yams/sweet potato.  Women are of African, especially Nigerian, descent.  Women are already breastfeeding an older baby or toddler; they are more likely to conceive with multiples. But lactation and frequent breastfeeding can also have a contraceptive effect by stopping ovulation so this is a very individual process.  Couples have regular sex during the woman’s fertile phases. This increases the overall chances of conception occurring.  A woman conceives in her first cycle after ceasing the contraceptive pill. This is a time when her body is going through a readjustment phase of ovulation and menstruation and it can take a few months for her body to align back to a and normal reproductive cycle.  Women are taller and have a higher Body Mass Index ( BMI ).  Though this can also have a reverse effect, as women who are overweight can also have problems with regular ovulation.  Women are older when they conceive rather than in a younger age group. Research has shown that women who are over 35 years are more likely to conceive with multiples. This tendency is thought to be due to what is known as a “fertility spike”, which occurs in women just before they enter peri-menopause.  From a biological perspective, this is probably due to the naturally occurring phenomenon of nature maximising the number of babies which can be born whilst women are still fertile.  A woman has had many previous pregnancies. The more babies she has had and the more times she has ovulated the more likely she is to naturally conceive with multiples. This includes   quadruplets.   Risks of quadruplet pregnancy  To the mother:   Miscarrying one or all of the quadruplets. Genetic abnormalities account for a large percentage of early stage miscarriage. Even in a singleton pregnancy, the chances of miscarriage are 10-25% and these odds are increased for multiples.  Increased risks of pregnancy complications overall including gestational diabetes, hypertension, placenta praevia, ante and post partum haemorrhage and anaemia.  Uterine rupture and placental abruption.  Need for caesarian section delivery.  A normal vaginal delivery is not advisable for the birth of quadruplets as it is too stressful and risky for both the mother and her babies.  Access to tertiary level neonatal services is essential. Women who are pregnant with quadruplets and who live in rural or regional areas are usually advised to relocate in their second or third trimester (at the latest) so they are close to the major city maternity hospital where their quads will be born.  Restrictions around lifestyle, work, household and care of older children if there are any.  The usual recommendations around working during pregnancy and taking maternity leave are usually different in the case of multiple pregnancy.  Greater likelihood of having post natal depression and psychological adjustment disorders after the babies are born. Additional stress on the parent’s relationship is inevitable and the need for practical, financial and emotional support is great.   To the babies:   Premature birth is always a risk factor in multiple births.  Intra-uterine growth retardation and low birth weight. The average weight for a preterm individual quadruplet is around 1.3kgs but many weigh less than this and do not exceed 1kg when they are born.  Cerebral palsy and jaundice. May need blood transfusions if there has been incompatibility issues or in cases of anaemia and extreme jaundice.  Breathing difficulties, problems maintaining their temperature and blood sugar levels.  A generalised higher risk of physiological problems including hernia.  Greater risk of developmental problems and global delays, including gross and fine motor skills, speech and language development, social and emotional development and visual acuity.

Multiple birth   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search      Identical triplet brothers at graduation. Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Abid Katib / Getty Images       More in Ages and Stages        Multiples       Through the Years     Babies     Toddlers     Preschoolers     School-Age Kids     Tweens     Teens        Quintuplets are a set of five offspring born at one birth. An individual that is part of such a set is called a quintuplet and sometimes referred to as a quint . Types of Quintuplets Quintuplets can be fraternal ( multi zygotic ), identical ( monozygotic ) or a combination of both. Multi zygotic quintuplets occur from five unique egg/sperm combinations. Monozygotic multiples are the result of a fertilized egg that splits into two or more embryos.         It is possible for a split to occur more than once, producing ​ monozygotic triplets or even a rare set of monozygotic quintuplets. Fully monozygotic quintuplets are rare, so rare that it is difficult to assess the odds. Quintuplets can be all male, all female, or a combination of both. (Monozygotic quintuplets will always be of the same gender.) Most quintuplets are a combination of boys and girls; all male or all female quintuples are rare. The first set of all-female quintuplets were born in the United States in 2015. In 2008, a Polish woman gave birth to a set of "probably identical" girls without the aid of fertility drugs. Odds of Quintuplets In 2005, the National Vital Statistics report for the United States reported the birth of 68 quintuplets and higher order multiples. Because this number includes the possible birth of sextuplets, septuplets or more, it is not determined exactly how many of those births were quintuplets.   The spontaneous conception of quintuplets is rare, the average estimate is 1 in about 60 million births. Most recent quintuplet births are the result of assisted reproductive techniques such as fertility enhancing drugs or in-vitro fertilization. Quintuplets do not always share the same birthdate. A delayed interval delivery (also known as iatrogenic asynchronous birth) may mean that individual babies are born days or even weeks apart.         Pregnancy With Quintuplets The average gestation for a quintuplet pregnancy is 29 weeks, as opposed to 40 weeks for a full-term baby. The longest gestation I've discovered was 35 weeks, a record held by the mother of the Stanford quintuplets in Rhode Island. Many mothers will gain more than fifty pounds during their pregnancy and will require cervical cerclage, a surgical procedure in which the cervix is sewn shut to prevent preterm labor. Nearly all quintuplet pregnancies result in a cesarean delivery. The average birth weight of a quintuplet is about 2 pounds, 12 ounces and most quintuplets receive medical care in a hospital NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) until they reach their original birth date. Dionne Quintuplets Perhaps the most famous quintuplets are the Dionne Quintuplets born in Canada in 1934. They were the first surviving set of all identical quintuplets. The girls - Annette, Émilie, Yvonne, Cécile, and Marie - attracted worldwide attention. They were removed from their parent's care and placed in the custody of a doctor, who displayed them as a tourist attraction. Interesting Facts About Quintuplets The Wilkinson quintuplets weighed more than 21 pounds combined when they were born at about 34 weeks in 2007. The heaviest quintuplet births on record, according to the Guinness Book of World Records was 25 pounds combined, attributed to two mothers, Liu Saulian (China, 1953) and Mrs. Kamalammal (India, 1956).         Parents of quintuplets will change more than 35,000 diapers before their kids are potty trained. The first set of quintuplets born in the United States were reported to be the Kanouse quints in Watertown, Wisconsin in 1875. They were all boys and did not survive. The Fischer quintuplets were the first surviving quintuplets in the United States, born in 1963 in South Dakota, according to Wikipedia. Baseball player Melvin Mora is a dad of quintuplets born in 2001 (3 girls and 2 boys). The mascots of the 2008 Beijing Olympics are quintuplets. A 2004 television show, "Quintuplets" starred Andy Richter and Rebecca Creskoff as parents of teenage quints.  The 1994 novel, Feather Crowns , is about a young Kentucky farm couple who gives birth to quintuplets. Support Groups for Families Are you having quintuplets? It's important for families to seek support and advice from other families in the same situation. Here are some organizations that can offer resources and assistance: MOST (Mothers of Supertwins) (United States) Multiple Births Canada's Higher Order Multiples Support Network Australian Multiple Birth Association (AMBA) New Zealand Multiple Birth Association (NZMBA) Twins and Multiple Birth Association (Tamba) (United Kingdom) Strollers for Quintuplets Five-seat quintuplet strollers are available and are a convenient -- though pricey -- option for transporting quints. The most prevalent brand is Runabout , a company that crafts multi-seat tandem strollers with hand-welded steel frames. They are quite expensive, costing nearly $1000 new from the manufacturer, but are widely available on the secondary market. Many families find it convenient to use a combination of double and triple strollers to accommodate all five babies.

Identical Quadruplets Born: 1 in 13 Million   By ABC News  Aug. 22, 2007   0 Shares               Email      Star    0 Shares               Email      The chances of having quadruplets is about one in 800,000. The chances of having a set of identical quadruplets is one in 11 million to 15 million. On Aug. 12, four babies beat the odds and broke a record at the same time. The identical Jepp quadruplets were born in four quick minutes in Great Falls, Mont. The four identical baby girls — Autumn, Brooke, Calissa and Dahlia — were delivered in the Benefis Healthcare System to proud parents Karen and J.P. "As any parent will tell you, bringing a new life into the world is an amazing wonderful thing, and we've got four amazing wonderful things," new dad J.P. said. The Jepps live in Calgary, Canada, but were sent to the states after learning that every single neonatal unit in Canada was too crowded to handle four premature births. One long hour after Karen Jepp went into labor and dozens of frantic phone calls later, the Jepps found Benefis Healthcare System in Montana — 300 miles away. They were on a plane shortly thereafter. "The nurses have been wonderful and really helped us out because we have no idea what we're doing," Karen said. The girls were delivered by Caesarean section after 31 weeks. All are in good health and breathing without ventilators. The girls were conceived without the help of fertility drugs; one egg split three times to produce four babies. With the babies traveling two to an incubator, the new family returned to Calgary in two separate trips; two with dad Thursday, and two with mom Friday. The birth of the Jepp girls marks one of fewer 50 sets of identical quadruplets in documented, medical history. "This is an incredibly rare event. You're talking about a one in 11 [million] to a one in 15 million event," said Jamie Grifo, division director of reproductive endocrinology at NYU Medical Center. Aside from J.P.'s mother, who is a twin, there is no history of multiple births in either parent's family. "My mom is a fraternal twin," J.P. said. "But we're told that doesn't apply in this case. Fraternal abilities may be genetic, but an egg splitting is just a genetic happening." The quads are expected to spend another four to eight weeks in the hospital before heading home with mom and dad to meet their big brother, 2-year-old Simon.        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

But for parents of quadruplets, their initial responses can be far from what can be called exuberance, at least in the early stages.  The practicalities of raising four babies to adulthood can seem utterly overwhelming, which is why experienced parents of higher order multiples ( HOM ) say it can help to just take things slowly at first and to allow the news to settle in, one steady day at a time.  The most common form of multiples are twins. Statistically 90% of all multiple births are made up of twins and the remaining 10% being shared between triplets, quadruplets and more. The most common variety of quadruplets is formed when four separate eggs are fertilised by four separate sperm.  There are however, a range of possibilities when it comes to the different combinations of quadruplets and how they are conceived. Quadruplets may be identical, non identical or a combination of both.  As well as the four separate eggs and sperm variety, there is also the possibility that:   One fertilised egg splits into four identical embryos.  One fertilised egg splits into three identical embryos and another separate egg is fertilised by a separate sperm. This means there are identical triplets plus one.  One set of Identical (monozygotic) twins occurs plus another two entirely separate embryos or another set of identical twins.  Another possibility is that a set of non identical/fraternal twins are conceived plus a monozygotic pair form making a total of four embryos.   Quadruplet pregnancy is usually diagnosed on ultrasound.  This is the most common time for parents to be told that four babies have been conceived and implanted. Seeing four little embryos on the screen can help the idea become a reality, but it’s very normal for expectant parents to leave the ultrasound rooms in a state of shock.  If they have had fertility assistance then there is an increased risk of multiple birth so the possibility may already have been raised and discussed. Although rare, it is not unknown for quadruplets to be naturally conceived.  Tell us again how lucky we are  Different cultures view multiple births in diverse ways.  For the Mayans, identical twins were seen as a blessing from God and a sign that they shared one soul which had been split between the two. In Roman culture twin boys were also viewed as a blessing, but unfortunately this belief did not extend to twin girls. They were seen as too much of a burden and the expense of raising two dowries instead of one overshadowed the “specialness” of two babies.  Within Greek and other European mythology, twins and other higher order multiples all feature, with their existence being attributable to the blessing or alternately, a curse from an almighty God.  In some ancient cultures, multiple births were seen as an outward sign that a woman had been unfaithful to her husband and the existence of more than one baby was indisputable proof of this.  Without any means of disproving this theory the poor women and their babies were often left to fend for themselves.  It goes without saying that we have much to be thankful for in terms of our current understanding of science and reproductive biology. But no matter how smart we have become and irrefutable evidence now supports our knowledge, there is still a little mystery and specialness surrounding multiple births.  Are quads as common as they used to be?  In the 1980s-1990s, multiple pregnancies were generally more common than at the present time. This decrease is thought to be due to overall advances in technology surrounding fertility assistance as well as the increased likelihood of these pregnancies being successful.  In the early days of assisted reproductive technology the general approach was to implant as many fertilised eggs as possible and therefore increase the chances of at least one of them implanting. But since there has been a greater understanding of the processes involved, as well as changes in the legislation surrounding the numbers of embryos which can be implanted, this has meant a reduction in the number of quadruplets being born.  There is an increased likelihood of quadruplets when:   A mother has a family history of multiple births. If she is a multiple herself or her mother and/or sisters naturally conceived multiple babies, then she is more likely to as well. This is because there is a genetic link of hyper ovulation amongst the women in some families.  Couples have had fertility assistance. Medication which increases the number of eggs supported towards maturity will increase the chances of multiple conception.  Women whose diet is high in dairy foods and yams/sweet potato.  Women are of African, especially Nigerian, descent.  Women are already breastfeeding an older baby or toddler; they are more likely to conceive with multiples. But lactation and frequent breastfeeding can also have a contraceptive effect by stopping ovulation so this is a very individual process.  Couples have regular sex during the woman’s fertile phases. This increases the overall chances of conception occurring.  A woman conceives in her first cycle after ceasing the contraceptive pill. This is a time when her body is going through a readjustment phase of ovulation and menstruation and it can take a few months for her body to align back to a and normal reproductive cycle.  Women are taller and have a higher Body Mass Index ( BMI ).  Though this can also have a reverse effect, as women who are overweight can also have problems with regular ovulation.  Women are older when they conceive rather than in a younger age group. Research has shown that women who are over 35 years are more likely to conceive with multiples. This tendency is thought to be due to what is known as a “fertility spike”, which occurs in women just before they enter peri-menopause.  From a biological perspective, this is probably due to the naturally occurring phenomenon of nature maximising the number of babies which can be born whilst women are still fertile.  A woman has had many previous pregnancies. The more babies she has had and the more times she has ovulated the more likely she is to naturally conceive with multiples. This includes   quadruplets.   Risks of quadruplet pregnancy  To the mother:   Miscarrying one or all of the quadruplets. Genetic abnormalities account for a large percentage of early stage miscarriage. Even in a singleton pregnancy, the chances of miscarriage are 10-25% and these odds are increased for multiples.  Increased risks of pregnancy complications overall including gestational diabetes, hypertension, placenta praevia, ante and post partum haemorrhage and anaemia.  Uterine rupture and placental abruption.  Need for caesarian section delivery.  A normal vaginal delivery is not advisable for the birth of quadruplets as it is too stressful and risky for both the mother and her babies.  Access to tertiary level neonatal services is essential. Women who are pregnant with quadruplets and who live in rural or regional areas are usually advised to relocate in their second or third trimester (at the latest) so they are close to the major city maternity hospital where their quads will be born.  Restrictions around lifestyle, work, household and care of older children if there are any.  The usual recommendations around working during pregnancy and taking maternity leave are usually different in the case of multiple pregnancy.  Greater likelihood of having post natal depression and psychological adjustment disorders after the babies are born. Additional stress on the parent’s relationship is inevitable and the need for practical, financial and emotional support is great.   To the babies:   Premature birth is always a risk factor in multiple births.  Intra-uterine growth retardation and low birth weight. The average weight for a preterm individual quadruplet is around 1.3kgs but many weigh less than this and do not exceed 1kg when they are born.  Cerebral palsy and jaundice. May need blood transfusions if there has been incompatibility issues or in cases of anaemia and extreme jaundice.  Breathing difficulties, problems maintaining their temperature and blood sugar levels.  A generalised higher risk of physiological problems including hernia.  Greater risk of developmental problems and global delays, including gross and fine motor skills, speech and language development, social and emotional development and visual acuity.

Home  Shop  Basket  Twins Tips          Resources Centre / Twins Tips Introduction / Twins Tips / What are the chances of having Twins.Triplets or Quads ?        You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Multiples in pregnancy Twins triplets quads identical and fraternal            Home : Ovulation Planner : Duedate : Baby Names : Week by Week : Site Map :             Types of Multiples in pregnancy   A pregnancy of two or more fetuses is called a multiple pregnancy. Multiple fetuses can be the same (identical) or different (fraternal). Identical twins or triplets come from a single egg that has been fertilized by one sperm. For unknown reasons, the fertilized egg splits into two or more embryos during the first stage of development. Fraternal multiples come from multiple fertilized eggs. Some identical multiples share the same placenta. However, they usually grow within separate amniotic sacs in the uterus. In rare cases, identical multiples share one amniotic sac. Fraternal fetuses have separate placentas and amniotic sacs. Identical multiples: Are always the same sex and blood type. Do not always look exactly alike. One may be right-handed while the other is left-handed. They are not related to your age, race, or family history of twins. Fraternal multiples:  Can be of different sexes and have different blood types. May look very different from one another, with different colored hair and eyes. They may also look alike, as siblings often do. Fraternal multiples tend to run in families.       Types of Twins Fraternal Twins With fraternal twins, the most common type, the mother contributes two eggs that are independently fertilized in the womb by two different sperm cells from the father. They are genetically as similar as any ordinary siblings. Fraternal twins are simply brothers and/or sisters who happen to be the same age. Fraternals are more common for older mothers, with rates doubling over the age of 35. Identical Twins With identical twins, one egg from the mother is fertilized by one sperm from the father, and then very early in development the embryo splits and two fetuses grow. These twins are very similar genetically and they are the same gender. Identical twins appears to be a random event, not a hereditary trait, and is uniformly distributed in all populations around the world. More information on Twins in pregnancy. Semi Identical Twins The 'semi-identical' twins are the result of two sperm cells fusing with a single egg, before becoming two embryos. This would result in a set of twins with identical genes from the mother's side, but different ones from the father's side. An embryo created this way doesn't usually survive, but a few cases are known.  ↑ Top ↑           How Common are Multiples?  There has been an increase in multiple births in recent years. Since 1980, infertility treatment has more than doubled the American twin birth rate. The rate of triplet or more births is now nearly 5 times higher than before infertility treatment was used. In the year 2000, in the United States, there were: 118,920 Twin Births 6,740 Triplet Births 507 Quadruplet Births 78 Quintuplets & other higher order Births That is more than a 70 percent increase in the number of twin births from 1980. With just over 4 million births in the United States in 2000, about 3% of babies born in the United States are twins or higher order multiple births (such as triplets), which although not common, does mean that multiples are more common than many people believe. What are your chance of having more than one baby at a time? Basically, it is about 3% or 1 in 33. The chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins is only about 1.7% or 1 in 60. The chance of having identical twins has remained steady, and is about 0.4% or 1 in 250. The chances of having twins with the use of fertility treatments can be as high as 20 to 25%. chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins: 1 in 60 chance of having 'natural' identical twins: 1 in 250 chance of having 'fertility treatment' multiple: 1 in 4 chance of having 'natural' triplets: 1 in 8,100 (only about 30% of triplets are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quads: 1 in 729,000 (only about 6% of quads are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quints: 1 in 55,000,000 Common factors that increase the chances of conceiving twins. Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, it can increase your chances of having twins by more than 20%. Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39. Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably. Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins. Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.   ↑ Top ↑      Higher Risks with Multiples What risks? If you are expecting twins, you will be classed as a high risk pregnancy. Extra demands are placed on the mother and the placental system on which the babies rely. This may slow the growth of one or both the babies, and cause high blood pressure in the mother. There is a strong chance of premature birth. These risks are made greater with triplets or higher multiple pregnancies. Your doctor may suggest an early scan if you look large for your due date or have a history of multiples in yor family, but you will most likely find out at your first routine scan , 12 to 14 weeks. On rare occasions, the second baby is missed in an earlier scan as it is hidden behind the first. Nearly all multiple pregnancies are now diagnosed in the first trimester by ultrasound. However, some twins die and are absorbed in the first half of pregnancy ('the disappearing twin' syndrome) and early scanning increases awareness of this phenomenon. Being told you are expecting twins or more can be a shock, particulary if you have no family history of twins. You will get more antenatal care, and you will need to take more care of yourself than if you were having one baby, but there is no reson to consider youself invalid. Making sure that you have enough rest and eat a healthy diet are important to your body as it has to work harder. Most likely you will not go the whole term, so you may have to leave work earlier than planned, if you have other children, try to arrange for help so you don't get overtired.               Complications Although a naturally occurring phenomena, multiple pregnancies are considered high-risk because: Smaller babies - fetuses tend to be individually smaller than those in a
singleton pregnancy because of greater demand for nutrients and slower in utero growth i.e. light-for-dates. Monozygotic twins tend to be smaller than dizygotic twins.  Increased risk of prematurity - the mean gestation for twins is 37 weeks and for triplets 31 weeks.  Higher risk of congenital abnormality associated with multiple pregnancies (x2 rate in singleton pregnancies).  Higher rates of cerebral palsy found in twins (1 - 1.5%) and triplets (7 - 8%).  Perinatal mortality (at 22 completed weeks gestation and over) rate for twins is significantly higher than singletons (x5) and even higher for triplets (x6). Rates are higher for monochorionic twins than dichorionic twins (49 versus 11.5 in 1000). Higher rate of maternal pregnancy-related complications such as hyperemesis gravidarum (from Greek hyper and emesis and Latin gravida; meaning " excessive vomiting of pregnant women"), polyhydramnios (an abnormally large volume of amniotic fluid), pre-eclampsia, anaemia, antepartum haemorrhage.  Higher rate of complications in labour - malpresentation, vasa praevia, cord prolapse, premature separation of placenta, cord entanglement, postpartum haemorrhage.  Complications of multiple pregnancy do not end with birth. Language and speech delay, more general cognitive delay or motor problems, behavioural problems and difficulty in parent-child interactions all appear to be more common in multiple birth children. Also the non-medical financial, social and emotional consequences of caring for twins or higher order multiples need to be kept in mind.  ↑ Top ↑           Main Pages   Home Fetus Growth Baby Names Medical Index Boy or Girl ?

By Sarah Schreiber     Dec 22, 2016                            When you hear heartwarming stories about couples overcoming major odds to conceive, infertility is usually the culprit. For Kortney and Justin Miller, a couple in their early 20s, it seems as if over -fertility was at play when they naturally conceived quadruplets. Are you ready for the odds? I don't think you're ready. The odds of conceiving quadruplets sans IVF or fertility therapy are 1 in 700,000. As if that isn't rare enough, the Miller quads are even more extraordinary. Each child came from its very own egg, which led to four individual sacs and placentas. In layman's terms, that means that, prior to the quads' conceptions, Kortney Miller released four eggs at once. Busy mama.

They weren't quite prepared for the news, but Kortney had a hunch. Multiples, after all, run in her family. "I was sure I was having more than one," Kortney told Today . "I felt a little different." Yep, we'd expect you'd feel a tad different when you're, you know, carrying four tiny humans inside of you. "I never thought there would be four," she continued. At the ultrasound, with her mother by her side, she discovered that she would be "carrying on the tradition" with Miller multiples.  The Georgia couple turned to their OB-GYN, Dr. Heather Turner, at Piedmont Newnan Hospital, where a team of doctors and nurses (dubbed the "quad squad") assembled to prepare for the babies' arrival. It was the first time the hospital would be delivering quadruplets. "There was a lot of preparation to do," Dr. Turner told Today . "Any time we anticipate a pre-term delivery, there is a lot of coordination across the labor and delivery unit as well as the hospital to lay the groundwork so everything can be as smooth as possible."  Weekly interdisciplinary meetings for doctors and conferences with the Millers were hosted to maximize chances of a successful delivery. So when Kortney came in for a check-up on December 16, a quiet Friday morning, to discover that she was three centimeters dilated, it was all systems go. Her husband arrived just in time to witness the cesarean birth.  Kortney and Justin are now the proud parents of three boys — Brandon, Brayden and Bryant — and one precious little girl, Kenlee. Brandon was the largest of the four, weighing in at 3 pounds, 1 ounce. The babies are currently in the NICU and are thriving. Dr. Turner says the birth went "amazingly well" and that the babies are expected to grow stronger over time.

Looks like the overprotective big brother gene has been activated. "We are so excited and blessed to have four healthy babies," Kortney told the Newnan Times Herald . "We can't wait to go with them on their journey as they grow and progress."

Baer , Journal Sentinel Staff   Aug. 25, 2013    0                 Mike Kisner thought the doctor had to be kidding. Triplets, the doctor said. Kisner and his fiancée were having triplets.  The couple had little time to absorb the idea when, two days later, the doctor found a fourth baby.  Kisner, 26, and his fiancée, Charity McCulloch, 39, of Wilmot in Kenosha County, had conceived quadruplets without the assistance of fertility drugs.  "I thought it was a joke at first," McCulloch said.  The couple found themselves in a rather exclusive club. The chance of conceiving quadruplets naturally is 1 in 700,000, said Joseph Davis, a gynecologist and fertility specialist at Froedtert & The Medical College of Wisconsin. Experts say 90% of quadruplets are born with the aid of medical technology.  "It is a surprise to have natural quadruplets, but it's not unheard of," Davis said. "It's just exceedingly rare."  The couple had planned to have one child once they were married — they plan to marry Aug. 31.  But when the four boys were born at Wheaton Franciscan All Saints Hospital in Racine on June 5, they became an instant family.  "The Lord has a plan for us. I don't know what it is, but He has a plan for us," Kisner said.  Kisner remembers being in the operating room that day with more than 20 doctors and nurses.  "It was very chaotic," he said. "Each person had their own little job to do and in a matter of three minutes all of them were out."  The quadruplets were born at 28 weeks and four days — birth normally occurs around 40 weeks. Typically, multiple pregnancies reduce the gestation period about three weeks per baby, or "multiple," said Davis.  Because of the early delivery, the quadruplets stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit several weeks after they were born. The smallest baby weighed 1 pound, 12 ounces.  Two boys, Kerrigan and Christian, went home July 29, while Brice and Oliver, the smaller of the four, stayed at the hospital a bit longer. They came home on Aug. 8. None of them faced severe complications.  While family history of twins can increase the  chances of multiple births, the science behind conceiving quadruplets, or even triplets, is a bit of a mystery. Davis said one theory is that the closer women are to menopause, the higher their chances are of multiple births. These women typically have elevated follicle-stimulating hormones levels, which can increase their chance of having more than one egg released.  "From a reproductive standpoint she's closer to advanced reproductive age," Davis said of McCulloch. "It may be a factor."  Davis said the age of the male is usually less of a factor because males have the same fertility chances up until age 50 or 60.  Kisner and McCulloch met at work about five years ago and got engaged last summer. The two are paramedics for Bell Ambulance in Milwaukee.  Though the stress of caring for four babies at once has challenged the new parents, Kisner and McCulloch have prepared themselves.  "We're just trying to keep the boys healthy and keep our sanity," Kisner said.  "Four's enough," McCulloch said.       0    Share    Tweet    Email    Print                             News Watch               Milwaukee man accused of executing man over $90 debt  11:31 a.m.    Convict in fatal park shooting will have chance at parole  11:08 a.m.    UW-led study finds infection with Zika prevents reinfection  11:03 a.m.    Dodge County man charged with homicide in woman’s overdose  10:55 a.m.    Wisconsin’s appeal on abortion turned away by Supreme Court  Updated:

By Jason DeRusha March 15, 2011 at 10:53 pm       Filed Under: Durst , Four Of A Kind , Good Question , Jason DeRusha , Multiple Births , Odds , Quadruplets    By Jason DeRusha, WCCO-TV  MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — Four identical twins from Buffalo, Minnesota are now starring in a documentary-style reality show about their life.  “Four of a Kind” is now airing on Lifetime Television, following Callie, Kendra, Megan and Sarah Durst through their senior year in high school.  They are one of 63 sets of identical quadruplets in the world. Clearly rare. But what are the odds of having a multiple birth?  “Naturally quadruplet births occur only in 1 per 500,000 births, only a few a year in the country,” said Dr. Bill Block, a perinatal specialist at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis.  “Not very high. They’re about Powerball odds.”  At Abbott in 2010, they delivered one set of quadruplets.  The odds of having triplets or more in the United States are just barely one tenth of one percent, 0.0015 percent according to the National Center for Health Statistics.  Still, the odds are about 400 percent higher than in 1980, according to Block, that’s almost entirely because of the explosion of fertility drugs and in-vitro fertilization.  And that’s something that the reproductive experts are working to reduce.  “A lot of the reproductive endocrinologists in town and around the country will only put back one egg or, at times, two eggs now. It’s not a matter of putting back four, five, six eggs hoping one would take,” said Block.  So let’s talk twins. In 2008, 3.3 percent of all births were twins. That’s the highest rate ever, perhaps because doctors are cutting down on the rate of triplets or higher.  African-Americans are more likely to have multiple births.  And if it runs in your family, that also elevates the chances.  “There is a genetic component to it. We don’t have it worked out as to what it is exactly, but if you come from a family with many multiple births, you’re more likely to have a multiple birth too,” said Block.  So let’s put this in perspective.  According to the Minnesota Department of Health, in 2009, there were 70,611 babies born.  Of that group, 68,012 were single babies and 2,599 were multiples.  If you removed the influence of fertility drugs and treatments, Block said that the birth rate of multiples are “very steady over time.”   Jason DeRusha Facebook Follow on Twitter Jason DeRusha filed his first report for WCCO-TV on April Fool's Day in 2003.

This report is totally about numbers, yet at roughly 54 seconds into it, you say: here they are as 5 year-olds in their home town of Buffalo in 1993. Today they’re 18 …  But, 1993 was 18 years ago (hint: you subtract 1993 from 2011); so how could they be 18 now if they were 5, 18 years ago?  Why should I believe any other numbers in the answer?

Reply  Report comment        Maynard  says:   March 16, 2011 at 5:24 am   Or maybe someone else wrote it for you and the script really had 1998 instead of 1993 and you need your eyes checked (in certain fonts the 3 is almost closed, and can be hard to distinguish from an 8).  But you’re off camera while reading it — I really don’t understand why it wasn’t corrected before airing.  Reply  Report comment        Maynard  says:   March 16, 2011 at 9:53 am   Retired.  B.

Does that mean the fertilized egg split 4 times, or are there 2 sets of identical twins born at the same time? I’m confused  Reply  Report comment        Helen  says:   March 16, 2011 at 10:21 am   The way they word the first line about it being two sets of identical twins leads me to believe they think it was two sets of twins born at the same time…  For my identical triplets one egg split and then one of those split, giving me three.  Reply  Report comment        Kristen  says:   March 16, 2011 at 12:35 pm   They’re only identical if the egg splits, so identical quads means the one egg split once and then each of those two also split. Otherwise, two sets of identical twins would mean they are fraternal to one another and all four would not be identical.  Reply  Report comment          David J.

Reply  Report comment          Kristen  says:   March 16, 2011 at 12:40 pm   She stated that she did not use fertility drugs but the fact that they’re identical absolutely does mean it was not from drugs – the drugs do not cause eggs to split, they cause mutliple eggs to release simultaneously and when more than one is fertilized, you get fraternal twins, triplets, quads, etc.  Courteney, consider that some people need help to have a child of their own and it’s totally unfair for you to say “get rid of fertility drugs” — if it was you wanting to have a baby and you could not, you would feel differently. The overpopulation is not because of fertility drugs – it’s people having too many that are not having problems having them (for the most part). Trust me, if you were in this position, you’d have a different viewpoint. It’s the hardest thing in the world to have to learn that you cannot have a baby when everyone else is doing it without problems. Have some sensitivity.

If four are born in the same gestation, and their identical, then they’re identical quadruplets.  But then again, that’s to be expected in an article whose related story indicates that they were 5 in 1993, and are 18 now…  Reply  Report comment        K.  says:   March 16, 2011 at 12:09 pm   They really mixed apples and oranges with this report.  Identical quads and fraternal quads are two entirely separate entities.  Usually, fertility drugs cause multple fraternal twins………not identical.  Identical is a phenomenon where the fertilized egg splits.  And to have identical quads means that after the one fertized egg split, each of those then split giving you four……….quite rare…..especially when compared to fraternal quads which happens from several ovulations thus making each baby different.  This report wasn’t very clear in giving us the numbers distinguishing these differences.  Reply  Report comment        K.  says:   March 16, 2011 at 12:12 pm   As I said above, fertility drugs would be more likely to cause multple fraternals because they act on the ovaries to release more eggs.  I am not sure that fertility drugs could affect the fertilized egg before it implants itself……..how could it do that?  I mean, it’s not connected to the mother’s blood supply as it is just floating around in the fallopian tubes before it implants.  This report was missing a lot of details.  Reply  Report comment        Kristen  says:   March 16, 2011 at 12:46 pm   Fertility drugs absolutely do not affect the egg itself or even implantation. The drugs act to cause your body to release hormones that cause your ovaries to develop eggs. Then you get another drug that causes your ovary to release the egg (ovulate) and that’s ALL they do. You still have to wait for fertilization to happen (in IVF, they ensure that part outside your body and then reinsert the fertilized egg in the uterus) and so you could still end up with only one that works (or none most of the time). The multiples thing is pretty rare, even in IUI and IVF.

We are the grandparents of a 4 year old boy and girl set of twins from one son.  Their cousins are, fraternal boys who are 23 months and their identical twin sisters who are 9 months old.  Do the math.  Their family had 4 children in 14 months.  We also have a brand new singleton just 3 weeks old.  None of the twins were conceived with fertility drugs.  There are no twins in anyof the families.  Reply  Report comment        Maynard  says:   March 21, 2011 at 11:48 am   Third attempt.  Not sure why my prior replies were blocked.  Maybe because they had URLs.  I’m not an expert in this, so hopefully the rates that google internet searches found are reliable.  Tummy Wear (googled “How to Increase Chances of Having Twins”; include the quote marks on all) lists several ways other than fertility drugs to improve the chances of having twins.  Excluding fertility drugs, Keep Kids Healthy (googled “What is your chance of having twins”) says, in the US, the likelihood of a pregnancy producing fraternal twins is 1 in 60.  It also says it is more common in African Americans and least common in Asians and Hispanics.  Baby Center (googled “Your likelihood of having twins or more”) says the likelihood is 1 in 89.  Since the world-wide Asian plus Hispanic populations dwarf the US population and those are the least likely, it makes sense that it is rarer world-wide than in the US.  iVillage (googled “What are your chances of having a second set”) says giving birth to fraternal twins is about 5 times more likely for a mother who has already given birth to fraternal twins.  But it also says the likelihood of giving birth to identical twins for that same mother is the same 1 in 250 as the general population.  The 1 in 250 likelihood is what the other websites also list for identical twins.  Twins List (googled “Causes of Identical Twinning”) reports an increased likelihood for some fathers to produce identical twins.  For example, it mentions a father of identical twins, later divorcing, and producing identical twins with his next wife as well.  But it doesn’t say identical twins are more likely after fraternal twins.  So assuming none of the 4 parents are in any population that change the chances of having twins, the general population chances of the 3 sets of twins you describe are, depending on which fraternal twin rate you choose, 1 in 900,000 (60x60x250) or 1 in 1,980,250 (89x89x250).  The chances of identical twins in one family and 2 sets of fraternal twins in the other are 5 times higher than those.  But I can’t calculate the “1 set of grandparents” part of your question. As far as I know, no state has a place to list the grandparents on a birth certificate, so grandparent statistics aren’t kept, and even if they were, I have no idea what number of grandparents (2, 4, 6, ?) comprise the “set” you mention.  Perhaps I’m taking things too literally. 🙂  Reply  Report comment          kathy  says:   March 16, 2011 at 9:59 pm   what are the chances of 3 siblings each having a set of grandchildren that are twins  my brother has a set of identical boys my sister has a set of identical girls and I have a set of a girl and a boy  we have them all covered also there was no fertility drugs these are all natural I sure am glad it missed my generation  Reply  Report comment        Maynard  says:   March 17, 2011 at 1:19 am   Again depending on the fraternal twin birth rate (1 in 89 or 1 in 60), the chances are 1 in 5,562,500 (250x250x89) or 1 in 3,750,000 (250x250x60).  Reply  Report comment        Maynard  says:   March 18, 2011 at 8:19 am   Forgot to mention the chances of having identical twins is 1 in 250.  What I calculated is the likelihood that any 3 pregnancies result in exactly 2 sets of identical twins and 1 set of fraternal twins.  To be what you ask, they would have to be multiplied by the likelihood that 3 siblings all have grandchildren (which would have to include the likelihood that your family had 3 siblings).  I don’t believe statistics at the grandchildren level are kept. You or your siblings could have adopted, not saying that happened, but it’s possible, and that would throw a wrench in the statistics gathering.

If it was just supposed to be 0.0015, it’s also wrong – that would be 15-hundredths of one percent, which is one and a half times one-tenth of one percent.  Shoddy math all around.

Identical Quadruplets Born: 1 in 13 Million   By ABC News  Aug. 22, 2007   0 Shares               Email      Star    0 Shares               Email      The chances of having quadruplets is about one in 800,000. The chances of having a set of identical quadruplets is one in 11 million to 15 million. On Aug. 12, four babies beat the odds and broke a record at the same time. The identical Jepp quadruplets were born in four quick minutes in Great Falls, Mont. The four identical baby girls — Autumn, Brooke, Calissa and Dahlia — were delivered in the Benefis Healthcare System to proud parents Karen and J.P. "As any parent will tell you, bringing a new life into the world is an amazing wonderful thing, and we've got four amazing wonderful things," new dad J.P. said. The Jepps live in Calgary, Canada, but were sent to the states after learning that every single neonatal unit in Canada was too crowded to handle four premature births. One long hour after Karen Jepp went into labor and dozens of frantic phone calls later, the Jepps found Benefis Healthcare System in Montana — 300 miles away. They were on a plane shortly thereafter. "The nurses have been wonderful and really helped us out because we have no idea what we're doing," Karen said. The girls were delivered by Caesarean section after 31 weeks. All are in good health and breathing without ventilators. The girls were conceived without the help of fertility drugs; one egg split three times to produce four babies. With the babies traveling two to an incubator, the new family returned to Calgary in two separate trips; two with dad Thursday, and two with mom Friday. The birth of the Jepp girls marks one of fewer 50 sets of identical quadruplets in documented, medical history. "This is an incredibly rare event. You're talking about a one in 11 [million] to a one in 15 million event," said Jamie Grifo, division director of reproductive endocrinology at NYU Medical Center. Aside from J.P.'s mother, who is a twin, there is no history of multiple births in either parent's family. "My mom is a fraternal twin," J.P. said. "But we're told that doesn't apply in this case. Fraternal abilities may be genetic, but an egg splitting is just a genetic happening." The quads are expected to spend another four to eight weeks in the hospital before heading home with mom and dad to meet their big brother, 2-year-old Simon.        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

		Staff  The Canadian Press           WATCH ABOVE: An Alberta woman, pregnant with identical quadruplets, has recently given birth in Edmonton. On Monday, a couple from Hythe introduced their four new daughters to the world. Carole Anne Devaney reports.                             X               -   A  A   +       Listen            EDMONTON – An Alberta couple will have added reasons to celebrate when they mark their first wedding anniversary next month. Bethani and Tim Webb of Hythe — 500 kilometres northwest of Edmonton — became the parents of four identical baby girls on Friday. The naturally conceived quadruplets were delivered by caesarean section by obstetric and neonatal specialists at an Edmonton hospital.  Story continues below        “Of course, I’m worried about her,” Tim said. “The day of, everything went fine. “It was kind of like a magic show, because they’re pulling out one, two, three, four… It was kind of surreal.” The Webbs were told by a nurse during the pregnancy that the odds of having natural quads are one in 67 million.

It’s overwhelmingly awesome.” The girls have been named Emily, Grace, McKayla and Abigail and weigh between three pounds and four pounds, one ounce. How did the couple pick those names? “We just decided,” Bethani said simply. “Found some we liked and picked them out. It was nice that we didn’t have to pick our favourites. We could just pick four we liked. We didn’t have to choose just one.” “I’m looking forward to the memories,” Tim said, “and how close they’ll all be.” “I can’t wait until they’re home,” Bethani added. “It’s going to be crazy the first few years… It’ll be very exciting.” With files from Global News     Report an error        AHS  Alberta Health Services  Alberta quads  Edmonton Health Matters  Four babies  Hythe  Identical Quadruplets  Identical quads  Naturally conceived identical quads  naturally conceived quadruplets       Editor's Picks          Canada    How Ottawa might try to save the Trans Mountain pipeline          Tech    Two-thirds of Canadians don't trust Facebook with their data, Ipsos poll shows         Politics    UK probing AggregateIQ as part of inquiry into privacy law breach         Canada    Ambassador told to take down tweet about 'pleasing' Myanmar beach due to Canadian cold snap, not ethnic cleansing         Canada    Millennials are confident about buying homes, but many get a boost from mom and dad          Money    Donald Trump keeps attacking Amazon — here's why, and what he's hoping to accomplish          Politics    Bureaucrats working under Harper and Trudeau rejected IBM's advice to delay Phoenix         Canada    Matthew Schrier was kidnapped by al-Qaida in Syria.

Little did the couple know, though, that before they got married they would become a family of six. A pain in the 32-year-old's abdomen sent her to the emergency room over a month later to do an ultrasound. The scan showed that Danielle and her partner Joseph Odom were pregnant with not one baby, but two, which didn't surprise her because her older brothers were twins. But then a new ultrasound a week later showed another baby hiding with the twins. The couple was having triplets. At 13 weeks pregnant, the third ultrasound revealed the final count and doctors informed them they were actually having quadruplets. The fourth baby was hiding by her belly button. Danielle gave birth to naturally conceived quadruplets on August 17, a feat that is only done in one and 700,000 women who are pregnant with four children.          Danielle Thrasher, 32, gave birth to quadruplets on August 17 after first being told she was pregnant with twins. From top left clockwise is Zoey, Lyla, Arya and Maya Odom        Danielle (left) and her partner Joseph Odom (right) were planning on getting married but those plans are on hold to focus on the girls. They have been together for three years Danielle Thrasher and Joseph Odom, both 32, from Noblesville, Indiana, took on the shock of having not one or two or even three children, but four after two false readings on an ultrasound. The couple first found out they were pregnant with a child when Danielle took a home pregnancy test. Severe abdominal pain sent her to the emergency room at six weeks pregnant where doctors revealed that she was actually having twins. The twins were no surprise to her because her brothers were twins and she knew genetically that it was possible for her, too.

Share this article  Share      How rare are quadruplets and what are the risks for this type of pregnancy The most common form of multiple births is twins. Twins occur 90 percent of the time with the other 10 percent divided between triplets, quadruplets, etc. These multiple births are more likely with the help of IVF and other fertility drugs to help people get pregnant. The most common way someone can conceive quadruplets is if there are four separate eggs that are fertilized by four different sperm. But, it is also possible for embryos to split to form multiple babies. There is a one in 700,000 chance that someone can conceive quadruplets naturally without any help from IVF or other fertility treatments. How are the chances of producing quadruplets increased? If the mother comes from a family with multiple births because there is a genetic link to hyper ovulation. If the couple is using a fertility treatment to help get pregnant. If the couple has regular sex during the woman's fertile phase of her cycle. If the woman is 35 years or older because the body is more likely to release multiple eggs at one time. What are the risks to a quadruplet pregnancy on the mother? The mother is at a higher risk for miscarrying one of the children if she is carrying all four. Other increased risks include uterine rupture, placental rupture, gestational diabetes and hypertension. The additional babies can also cause psychological, financial and social effects on both of the parents. What are the risks for the babies? Premature birth is always a risk factor when the mother is carrying multiple babies in her womb. The babies are also more likely to have a low birth weight. Quadruplets can have breathing difficulties, problems maintaining their temperature and blood sugar levels. They can also experience hearing loss, vision loss and heart complications. Source: Huggies But then on an ultrasound one week later showed a third baby hiding in her womb. Joseph was the one who experienced the largest shock of the news. 'It took him a good solid month to process all that,' Danielle said to Daily Mail Online. Little did they know at the time, but a fourth baby was hiding under Danielle's belly button. Doctors revealed Danielle was having a quadruplets when she was 13 weeks pregnant during her third ultrasound. 'I turned to Joseph and said "What are we going to do" in the middle of the ultrasound,' Danielle said. Joseph was the calm one after the big reveal that they were having four. 'He was like "it's fine, it's just one more",' Danielle said. But they couldn't understand how the fourth baby was missed when the ultrasound technicians first found the three and their individual heartbeat. Her doctor explained that they didn't have any reason to check and see if she was having more than three babies. 'Because of the placement of the babies, they didn't go searching around for four,' Danielle said. The quadruplets were naturally conceived from four individual eggs that were fertilized by four separate sperm. There is only a one in 700,000 chance of someone pregnant with quadruplets to naturally conceive them. On that same day of seeing their fourth baby, doctors brought up a potential plan to reduce the pregnancy down to twins. 'It was very tough to hear all the statistics,' Danielle said. The chances of her having a miscarriage had significantly increased with having all four babies. Also, there was a higher risk of her going into preterm labor where the babies could be born with developmental problems. The couple decided together that giving up one or two of their children wasn't an option. 'We really felt in our hearts that if God wanted to give us four, we would have four,' Danielle said. 'We couldn't live with ourselves knowing we had to pick two.' This decision brought them down a harder road with the knowledge that the births would cause extra stress on both Danielle and her babies as well as a larger financial burden. The average mother carrying quadruplets goes into preterm labor at 24 to 26 weeks. Danielle was able to make it to 27 weeks and five days before having each child by a cesarean section birth. She wanted to make it longer, but her waist at the time measured at the size of a 53-week pregnancy and her blood pressure was high.          Daniele and Joseph found out they were having quadruplets during an ultrasound when she was 13 weeks pregnant. The fourth baby was hiding under her belly button          Danielle and Joseph are holding their daughter Lyla after she was born. Lyla is easy for them to recognize because she has golden hair while her sisters all have darker hair Baby D, who is now called Arya, was also getting a lower blood chord flow than the other babies. This provides oxygen and nutrients from the mother to the baby, so it was imperative to deliver to make sure all the children remained healthy.  We really felt in our hearts that if God wanted us to have four, we would have four.  Danielle Thrasher, mother Baby A, named Zoey Cheyenne after Danielle's deceased sister, was born at 2lbs and 2oz as the smallest of her siblings. The hiding baby was Baby B and the couple named her Lyla Mae, which they came up with in the car on the way home from finding out they were having quadruplets. She weighed 2lbs and 6.5oz. Baby C was named Maya Jo after her father and was born weighing 2bs and 4oz. The final baby was Baby D, named Arya Grace because Danielle is a big Game of Thrones fan. She weighed in at 2lbs and 2.9oz. The couple stuck with a trend of having each girl have four letters in their name because they are quadruplets and they wanted them to have short names. 'We both have long names,' Danielle said. 'So we thought "let's keep it short and simple".' The doctors were all pleased that the babies all weighed so much considering they were born premature. Their actual due date was supposed to be November 11. But with this birth has come complications for the quadruplets. Lyla, Arya and Zoey have done extremely well with gaining weight since they were first born, but Maya has been having more trouble.          Arya Grace was born at 2lbs and 2.9oz. She is named after the character Arya in Game of Thrones because Danielle is a big fan of the show          Lyla Mae was the fourth baby that was hidden during the ultrasound the first and second ultrasound. She was born weighing 2lbs and 6.5oz She is gaining weight but has developed a heart murmur and can't always breathe on her own. A heart murmur is when an extra sound is made in the heart as the blood is traveling through it. Depending on the murmur, it can cause no problems at all for the baby. But other murmurs could lead to severe problems with the valves or walls of the heart. Doctors are monitoring Maya closely to make sure it doesn't develop into something more serious. All four babies are expected to stay in the hospital at least until the end of October because doctors need them to reach a certain stage of development before they feel comfortable releasing them. Danielle explained that the doctors are looking for each baby to weigh 4.5lbs, breathe on their own, suck and swallow on their own and pass the car seat test. This test involves the infant having to sit in a car seat for 90 to 120 minutes while a nurse monitors their breathing, heart rate and oxygen levels. Weight also plays a large factor in the car seat test because their isn't one small enough to handle a child that weighs less than 4lbs. Until then, Danielle is traveling 30 minutes to the Community Hospital North in Indianapolis, Indiana, every day to be with her daughters while Joseph goes to work. She has been feeding them with her breast milk because doctors think that is the best way to give the children nutrients to help with growth. But the hard part is far from over for the new parents. The couple has been together for three years and was originally going to get married, but those plans have been put on hold. 'The needs of the girls comes first,' Danielle said. Financial problems have occurred because they currently live in a one bedroom apartment and do not have a car large enough to fit all four car seats.          Maya Jo was born weighing 2lbs and 4oz. She is named after her father Joseph. Maya is the quadruplet that has had the most difficulty because she developed a heart murmur and occasionally has trouble breathing on her own          Zoey Cheyenne was the smallest weighing at 2lbs and 2oz when she was born. She is named after Danielle's sister who died when she was only 11 But Joseph is the only one that can go to work because daycare is too expensive for  them to both to be at work. 'We don't have cable and we cut down on internet usage,' Danielle said. 'We are limiting things we would indulge in and really watching what we are spending.' One of Danielle's friends reached out to the apartment complex they live in to see if the building could help them pay for a two-bedroom instead of a one, but they have had no luck so far for that to happen. If the couple paid for a two-bedroom on their own it would add $300-350 a month to their rent. 'That's diapers for the girls,' Danielle said. A GoFundMe page was created to help raise money for the price of hospital bills and other necessities for the quadruplets. The couple is focused right now, though, on keeping their girls healthy and getting them out of the hospital. 'Knowing they have a roof over their head, food in their mouths and basic necessities is enough for now,' Danielle said.  Advertisement   Read more:   www.gofundme.com...

Baer , Journal Sentinel Staff   Aug. 25, 2013    0                 Mike Kisner thought the doctor had to be kidding. Triplets, the doctor said. Kisner and his fiancée were having triplets.  The couple had little time to absorb the idea when, two days later, the doctor found a fourth baby.  Kisner, 26, and his fiancée, Charity McCulloch, 39, of Wilmot in Kenosha County, had conceived quadruplets without the assistance of fertility drugs.  "I thought it was a joke at first," McCulloch said.  The couple found themselves in a rather exclusive club. The chance of conceiving quadruplets naturally is 1 in 700,000, said Joseph Davis, a gynecologist and fertility specialist at Froedtert & The Medical College of Wisconsin. Experts say 90% of quadruplets are born with the aid of medical technology.  "It is a surprise to have natural quadruplets, but it's not unheard of," Davis said. "It's just exceedingly rare."  The couple had planned to have one child once they were married — they plan to marry Aug. 31.  But when the four boys were born at Wheaton Franciscan All Saints Hospital in Racine on June 5, they became an instant family.  "The Lord has a plan for us. I don't know what it is, but He has a plan for us," Kisner said.  Kisner remembers being in the operating room that day with more than 20 doctors and nurses.  "It was very chaotic," he said. "Each person had their own little job to do and in a matter of three minutes all of them were out."  The quadruplets were born at 28 weeks and four days — birth normally occurs around 40 weeks. Typically, multiple pregnancies reduce the gestation period about three weeks per baby, or "multiple," said Davis.  Because of the early delivery, the quadruplets stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit several weeks after they were born. The smallest baby weighed 1 pound, 12 ounces.  Two boys, Kerrigan and Christian, went home July 29, while Brice and Oliver, the smaller of the four, stayed at the hospital a bit longer. They came home on Aug. 8. None of them faced severe complications.  While family history of twins can increase the  chances of multiple births, the science behind conceiving quadruplets, or even triplets, is a bit of a mystery. Davis said one theory is that the closer women are to menopause, the higher their chances are of multiple births. These women typically have elevated follicle-stimulating hormones levels, which can increase their chance of having more than one egg released.  "From a reproductive standpoint she's closer to advanced reproductive age," Davis said of McCulloch. "It may be a factor."  Davis said the age of the male is usually less of a factor because males have the same fertility chances up until age 50 or 60.  Kisner and McCulloch met at work about five years ago and got engaged last summer. The two are paramedics for Bell Ambulance in Milwaukee.  Though the stress of caring for four babies at once has challenged the new parents, Kisner and McCulloch have prepared themselves.  "We're just trying to keep the boys healthy and keep our sanity," Kisner said.  "Four's enough," McCulloch said.       0    Share    Tweet    Email    Print                             News Watch               Milwaukee man accused of executing man over $90 debt  11:31 a.m.    Convict in fatal park shooting will have chance at parole  11:08 a.m.    UW-led study finds infection with Zika prevents reinfection  11:03 a.m.    Dodge County man charged with homicide in woman’s overdose  10:55 a.m.    Wisconsin’s appeal on abortion turned away by Supreme Court  Updated:

But for parents of quadruplets, their initial responses can be far from what can be called exuberance, at least in the early stages.  The practicalities of raising four babies to adulthood can seem utterly overwhelming, which is why experienced parents of higher order multiples ( HOM ) say it can help to just take things slowly at first and to allow the news to settle in, one steady day at a time.  The most common form of multiples are twins. Statistically 90% of all multiple births are made up of twins and the remaining 10% being shared between triplets, quadruplets and more. The most common variety of quadruplets is formed when four separate eggs are fertilised by four separate sperm.  There are however, a range of possibilities when it comes to the different combinations of quadruplets and how they are conceived. Quadruplets may be identical, non identical or a combination of both.  As well as the four separate eggs and sperm variety, there is also the possibility that:   One fertilised egg splits into four identical embryos.  One fertilised egg splits into three identical embryos and another separate egg is fertilised by a separate sperm. This means there are identical triplets plus one.  One set of Identical (monozygotic) twins occurs plus another two entirely separate embryos or another set of identical twins.  Another possibility is that a set of non identical/fraternal twins are conceived plus a monozygotic pair form making a total of four embryos.   Quadruplet pregnancy is usually diagnosed on ultrasound.  This is the most common time for parents to be told that four babies have been conceived and implanted. Seeing four little embryos on the screen can help the idea become a reality, but it’s very normal for expectant parents to leave the ultrasound rooms in a state of shock.  If they have had fertility assistance then there is an increased risk of multiple birth so the possibility may already have been raised and discussed. Although rare, it is not unknown for quadruplets to be naturally conceived.  Tell us again how lucky we are  Different cultures view multiple births in diverse ways.  For the Mayans, identical twins were seen as a blessing from God and a sign that they shared one soul which had been split between the two. In Roman culture twin boys were also viewed as a blessing, but unfortunately this belief did not extend to twin girls. They were seen as too much of a burden and the expense of raising two dowries instead of one overshadowed the “specialness” of two babies.  Within Greek and other European mythology, twins and other higher order multiples all feature, with their existence being attributable to the blessing or alternately, a curse from an almighty God.  In some ancient cultures, multiple births were seen as an outward sign that a woman had been unfaithful to her husband and the existence of more than one baby was indisputable proof of this.  Without any means of disproving this theory the poor women and their babies were often left to fend for themselves.  It goes without saying that we have much to be thankful for in terms of our current understanding of science and reproductive biology. But no matter how smart we have become and irrefutable evidence now supports our knowledge, there is still a little mystery and specialness surrounding multiple births.  Are quads as common as they used to be?  In the 1980s-1990s, multiple pregnancies were generally more common than at the present time. This decrease is thought to be due to overall advances in technology surrounding fertility assistance as well as the increased likelihood of these pregnancies being successful.  In the early days of assisted reproductive technology the general approach was to implant as many fertilised eggs as possible and therefore increase the chances of at least one of them implanting. But since there has been a greater understanding of the processes involved, as well as changes in the legislation surrounding the numbers of embryos which can be implanted, this has meant a reduction in the number of quadruplets being born.  There is an increased likelihood of quadruplets when:   A mother has a family history of multiple births. If she is a multiple herself or her mother and/or sisters naturally conceived multiple babies, then she is more likely to as well. This is because there is a genetic link of hyper ovulation amongst the women in some families.  Couples have had fertility assistance. Medication which increases the number of eggs supported towards maturity will increase the chances of multiple conception.  Women whose diet is high in dairy foods and yams/sweet potato.  Women are of African, especially Nigerian, descent.  Women are already breastfeeding an older baby or toddler; they are more likely to conceive with multiples. But lactation and frequent breastfeeding can also have a contraceptive effect by stopping ovulation so this is a very individual process.  Couples have regular sex during the woman’s fertile phases. This increases the overall chances of conception occurring.  A woman conceives in her first cycle after ceasing the contraceptive pill. This is a time when her body is going through a readjustment phase of ovulation and menstruation and it can take a few months for her body to align back to a and normal reproductive cycle.  Women are taller and have a higher Body Mass Index ( BMI ).  Though this can also have a reverse effect, as women who are overweight can also have problems with regular ovulation.  Women are older when they conceive rather than in a younger age group. Research has shown that women who are over 35 years are more likely to conceive with multiples. This tendency is thought to be due to what is known as a “fertility spike”, which occurs in women just before they enter peri-menopause.  From a biological perspective, this is probably due to the naturally occurring phenomenon of nature maximising the number of babies which can be born whilst women are still fertile.  A woman has had many previous pregnancies. The more babies she has had and the more times she has ovulated the more likely she is to naturally conceive with multiples. This includes   quadruplets.   Risks of quadruplet pregnancy  To the mother:   Miscarrying one or all of the quadruplets. Genetic abnormalities account for a large percentage of early stage miscarriage. Even in a singleton pregnancy, the chances of miscarriage are 10-25% and these odds are increased for multiples.  Increased risks of pregnancy complications overall including gestational diabetes, hypertension, placenta praevia, ante and post partum haemorrhage and anaemia.  Uterine rupture and placental abruption.  Need for caesarian section delivery.  A normal vaginal delivery is not advisable for the birth of quadruplets as it is too stressful and risky for both the mother and her babies.  Access to tertiary level neonatal services is essential. Women who are pregnant with quadruplets and who live in rural or regional areas are usually advised to relocate in their second or third trimester (at the latest) so they are close to the major city maternity hospital where their quads will be born.  Restrictions around lifestyle, work, household and care of older children if there are any.  The usual recommendations around working during pregnancy and taking maternity leave are usually different in the case of multiple pregnancy.  Greater likelihood of having post natal depression and psychological adjustment disorders after the babies are born. Additional stress on the parent’s relationship is inevitable and the need for practical, financial and emotional support is great.   To the babies:   Premature birth is always a risk factor in multiple births.  Intra-uterine growth retardation and low birth weight. The average weight for a preterm individual quadruplet is around 1.3kgs but many weigh less than this and do not exceed 1kg when they are born.  Cerebral palsy and jaundice. May need blood transfusions if there has been incompatibility issues or in cases of anaemia and extreme jaundice.  Breathing difficulties, problems maintaining their temperature and blood sugar levels.  A generalised higher risk of physiological problems including hernia.  Greater risk of developmental problems and global delays, including gross and fine motor skills, speech and language development, social and emotional development and visual acuity.

Multiple birth   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search      Identical triplet brothers at graduation. Identical triplets are extremely rare.    A multiple birth is the culmination of one multiple pregnancy , wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to placental species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in twins and triplets . In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a litter , and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception, and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.  Each single fertilized egg ( zygote ) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called fraternal and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material, and are hence called identical and are always of the same sex (except in cases of Turner syndrome ).  A multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these two. A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called monozygotic , from two zygotes is called dizygotic , or from two or more zygotes is called polyzygotic .  Similarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical, or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.

The technical term for "fraternal" is "polyzygotic".       Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap. Nonidentical twins, the most common kind of multiple birth among humans, occur in about 1 out of every 80 pregnancies.    Terms used for multiple births or the genetic relationships of their offspring:   Monozygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by the splitting of a single zygote  Dizygotic – multiple (typically two) fetuses produced by two zygotes  Trizygotic – three or more fetuses produced by three zygotes  Polyzygotic – multiple fetuses produced by two or more zygotes   Terms used for the number of offspring in a multiple birth:   Two offspring - twins  Three offspring - triplets  Four offspring - quadruplets  Five offspring - quintuplets  Six offspring - sextuplets  Seven offspring - septuplets  Eight offspring - octuplets  Nine offspring - nonuplets  Ten offspring - decuplets   See List of Multiple Births  Human multiple births [ edit ]  In humans, the average length of pregnancy (two weeks fewer than gestation ) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.  Recent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology . [1]  Twins [ edit ]  Main article: Twin  Twins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report more than 132,000 sets of twins out of 3.9 million births of all kinds each year, about 3.4%, or 1 in 30. [2]  Triplets [ edit ]     Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.      Play media   Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound [3]    Identical triplets come from a monozygotic pregnancy, three fetuses from one egg. The most common set, strictly fraternal triplets, comes from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Between these types, triplets that include an identical (monozygotic) pair of siblings plus a fraternal sibling are the result of a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two fetuses and the other doesn't.  Triplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000. [2] According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand. [2] Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million. [2] According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, "No one really knows the incidence". [2]  Identical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets). The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies. [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  Quadruplets [ edit ]  Quadruplets are much rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were approximately 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births are becoming increasingly common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical quadruplets worldwide. Many sets of quadruplets contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical quadruplets was the Genain quadruplets , all of whom developed schizophrenia . Quadruplets are sometimes referred to as "quads" in Britain. [9]  Quintuplets [ edit ]     The Canadian  Dionne sisters , seen in this 1947 photograph, were the first quintuplets known to survive infancy.    Quintuplets occur naturally in 1 in 55,000,000 births. [10] The first quintuplets known to survive infancy were the all-female Canadian Dionne Quintuplets , born in 1934. Quintuplets are sometimes referred to as "quins" in the UK and "quints" in North America. [11]  Sextuplets [ edit ]  Born in Liverpool, England on 18 November 1983, the Walton sextuplets were the world's first all-female surviving sextuplets, and the world's fourth known set of surviving sextuplets. Another well-known set of sextuplets is the Gosselin sextuplets, born May 10, 2004 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. [12] Reality television shows called Jon & Kate Plus 8 and later Kate Plus 8 have chronicled the lives of these sextuplets.  Very high-order multiple births [ edit ]  In 1997, the McCaughey septuplets were born in Carlisle, Iowa. Multiple births of as many as eight babies have been born alive, the first set on record to the Chukwu family in Texas in 1998; one died and seven survived. In 2009, a second set, the Suleman octuplets , were born in Bellflower, California . [13] [14] The most recent report that all were still alive was shortly before their fifth birthday. [15]  There have been a few sets of nonuplets (nine) in which a few babies were born alive, though none lived longer than a few days. There have been cases of human pregnancies that started out with ten, eleven, twelve or fifteen fetuses, but no instances of live births. The pregnancies of the 10, 11 and 15 fetuses have all resulted from fertility medications and assisted reproductive technology (ART) . However, there has been one documented case when 12 fetuses were conceived naturally. [16] [ not in citation given ]  Causes and frequency [ edit ]        The examples and perspective in this article deal primarily with North America and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject . You may improve this article , discuss the issue on the talk page , or create a new article , as appropriate.  (December 2010)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The frequency of N multiple births from natural pregnancies has been given as approximately 1:89 N -1 ( Hellin's law ) and as about 1:80 N -1 . [17] This gives:   1:89 (= 1.1%) or 1:80 (= 1.25%) for twins  1:89 2 (= 1:7921, about 0.013%) or 1:80 2 (= 1:6400) for triplets  1:89 3 (= approx. 0.000142%, less than 1:700,000) or 1:80 3 for quadruplets   North American dizygotic twinning occurs about once in 83 conceptions, and triplets about once in 8000 conceptions. US figures for 2010 were: [18] [19]   Twins, 132,562, 3.31%  Triplets, 5,503, 0.14%  Quadruplets, 313, 0.0078%  Quintuplets and more, 37, 0.00092%   Human multiple births can occur either naturally (the woman ovulates multiple eggs or the fertilized egg splits into two) or as the result of infertility treatments such as IVF (several embryos are often transferred to compensate for lower quality) or fertility drugs (which can cause multiple eggs to mature in one ovulatory cycle).  For reasons that are not yet known, the older a woman is, the more likely she is to have a multiple birth naturally. It is theorized that this is due to the higher level of follicle-stimulating hormone that older women sometimes have as their ovaries respond more slowly to FSH stimulation. [20]  The number of multiple births has increased over the last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. [ citation needed ] Much of the increase can probably be attributed to the impact of fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization . Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH , followed by intrauterine insemination , are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.     The Gosselin sextuplets with their parents and sisters, cover of KoreAm , May 2008    Certain factors appear to increase the likelihood that a woman will naturally conceive multiples. These include:   mother's age: women over 35 are more likely to have multiples than younger women [21]  mother's use of fertility drugs : approximately 35% of pregnancies arising through the use of fertility treatments such as IVF involve more than one child   The increasing use of fertility drugs and consequent increased rate of multiple births has made the phenomenon of multiples more frequent and hence more visible. In 2004 the birth of sextuplets, six children, to Pennsylvania couple Kate and Jon Gosselin helped them to launch their television series, originally Jon & Kate Plus 8 and (following their divorce) Kate Plus 8 , which became the highest-rated show on the TLC network.  Risks [ edit ]  Premature birth and low birth weight [ edit ]  Babies born from multiple-birth pregnancies are much more likely to result in premature birth than those from single pregnancies. 51% of twins and 91% of triplets are born preterm, compared to 9.4% in singletons. [22] 14% of twins and 41% of triplets are even born very preterm , compared to 1.7% in singletons. [22]  At present, there is no way to stop twins being born early. [23] In women with single pregnancies drugs called betamimetics can relax the muscles of the uterus and delay birth. [24] Giving betamimetics can give more time to give steroids, for the baby’s lung development, or to transfer the mother to a hospital with a special care unit. [24]  However, there is not enough evidence to say whether or not women with twin pregnancies should be given oral betamimetics to reduce the risk of preterm birth. [23] In some studies betamimetics have reduced the rate of preterm labour in twin pregnancies however the studies are too small to draw any solid conclusions. [23] Likewise, putting a stitch in the neck of the womb (a cervical suture ) to prevent premature birth has not been shown to work in women carrying more than one baby due to the small sample sizes in the studies. [25]  The preterm births also result in multiples tending to have a lower birth weight compared to singletons.  Some evidence [ who? ] indicates that only 1.10% of singletons are born with a very low birth weight and 10.12% twins and 31.88% triplets were found to be born with very low birth weight. This study [ who? ] was conducted by looking at the statistics from the U.S. Natality Files (5).  Among the exceptions are the Kupresak triplets of Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ; their combined weight at birth in 2008, of 17 lbs, 2.7 ounces, set a world record. [26]  Cerebral palsy [ edit ]  Cerebral palsy is more common among multiple births than single births, being 2.3 per 1,000 survivors in singletons, 13 in twins, and 45 in triplets in North West England . [27] This is likely a side effect of premature birth and low birth weight.  Incomplete separation [ edit ]  Further information: Twin § Degree of separation  Multiples may be monochorionic , sharing the same chorion , with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . Monochorionic multiples may even be monoamniotic , sharing the same amniotic sac , resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and nuchal cord . In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins , possibly impairing function of internal organs.  Mortality rate (stillbirth) [ edit ]  Multiples are also known to have a higher mortality rate. It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses. [28] Though multiples are at a greater risk of being stillborn, there is inconclusive evidence whether the actual mortality rate is higher in multiples than in singletons.  Prevention in IVF [ edit ]  Today many multiple pregnancies are the result of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. [29] The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and .08% quadruplets). [29] Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made to reduce the risk of multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.  The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: [30]    Age  Attempt no.  Embryos transferred    <37 years  1st  1    2nd  1 if top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    37–39 years  1st & 2nd  1 if top-quality    2 if not top-quality    3rd  No more than 2    40–42 years   2    Also, it is recommended to use single embryo transfer in all situations if a top-quality blastocyst is available. [30]  Management [ edit ]  Bed rest has not been found to change outcomes and therefore is not generally recommended outside of a research study. [31]  Selective reduction [ edit ]  Main article: Selective reduction  Selective reduction is the termination of one or more, but not all, of the fetuses in a multiple pregnancy. This is often done in pregnancies with multiple gestations to increase the likelihood that one child may live a healthy life. Armour [32] reported a loss rate of 5.4% in a review of 1,000 cases of selective reduction. Fifteen percent of the losses occurred within 4 weeks of the procedures and more than 50% occurred after 8 weeks. This suggests that the reduction was successful at reducing the embryos from multiple gestations to single.  Though selective reduction seems to be effective, mothers of multiples who undergo this procedure are at a higher risk of miscarrying compared to that of an unreduced multiple pregnancy. A study done by looking at 158 pregnant women who underwent selective reduction from higher order multiples to twins showed that the mother had a 10.6% chance of miscarriage. Mothers of twin pregnancies without reduction only had a 9.5% chance of miscarriage. A study by Antsaklis [33] showed a small increase in mortality for reduced twin pregnancies versus unreduced twin pregnancies.  However, there is a lack of good quality research on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. [34] Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty getting pregnant in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce. [34]  Competition among fertility clinics does not appear to increase rates of multiple births from fertility treatment by promoting more aggressive embryo transfer decisions. [35]  Care in pregnancy [ edit ]  Women with a multiple pregnancy are usually seen more regularly by midwives or doctors than those with singleton pregnancies because of the higher risks of complications. [36] However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that specialised antenatal services produce better outcomes for mother or babies than ‘normal’ antenatal care. [37]  Nutrition [ edit ]  As preterm birth is such a risk for women with multiple pregnancies, it has been suggested that these women should be encouraged to follow a high-calorie diet to increase the birth weights of the babies. Evidence around this subject is not yet good enough to advise women to do this because the long term effects of the high-calorie diets on the mother are not known. [38]  Cesarean section or vaginal delivery [ edit ]  A study in 2013 involving 106 participating centers in 25 countries came to the conclusion that, in a twin pregnancy of a gestational age between 32 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days, and the first twin is in cephalic presentation , planned Cesarean section does not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal disability , as compared with planned vaginal delivery. [39] In this study, 44% of the women planned for vaginal delivery still ended up having Cesarean section for unplanned reasons such as pregnancy complications . In comparison, it has been estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by Cesarean section in 2008. [40] Also in comparison, the rate of Cesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 40% and 14%. [41]  Fetal position (the way the babies are lying in the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down there is no good evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies. [42]  Monoamniotic twins (twins that form after the splitting of a fertilised egg and share the same amniotic fluid sac) are at more risk of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babies’ wellbeing. [43] The birth of this type of twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services. [44]  Cesarean delivery is needed when first twin is in non cephalic presentation or when it is a monoamniotic twin pregnancy.  Neonatal intensive care [ edit ]  Multiple-birth infants are usually admitted to neonatal intensive care immediately after being born. The records for all the triplet pregnancies managed and delivered from 1992-1996 were looked over to see what the neonatal statistics were. Kaufman [45] found from reviewing these files that during a five-year period, 55 triplet pregnancies, which is 165 babies, were delivered. Of the 165 babies 149 were admitted to neonatal intensive care after the delivery.  Society and culture [ edit ]     A women bearing 9 or 11 children, Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon , 1557, by Conrad Lycosthenes    Insurance coverage [ edit ]  A study by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that, in 2011, pregnant women covered by private insurance in the United States were older and more likely to have multiple gestation than women covered by Medicaid. [46]  Cultural aspects [ edit ]  Certain cultures consider multiple births a portent of either good or evil. [47]  Mayan culture saw twins as a blessing, and was fascinated by the idea of two bodies looking alike. The Mayans used to believe that twins were one soul that had fragmented. [ citation needed ]  In Ancient Rome, the legend of the twin brothers who founded the city ( Romulus and Remus ) made the birth of twin boys a blessing, while twin girls were seen as an unlucky burden, since both would have to be provided with an expensive dowry at about the same time.     Beatrix with her seven swan-children, in the Knight of the Swan romance ( Talbot Shrewsbury Book )    In Greek mythology, fraternal twins Castor and Polydeuces , and Heracles and Iphicles , are sons of two different fathers. One of the twins ( Polydeuces , Heracles ) is the illegitimate son of the god Zeus ; his brother is the son of their mother's mortal husband. A similar pair of twin sisters are Helen (of Troy ) and Clytemnestra (who are also sisters of Castor and Polydeuces ). The theme occurs in other mythologies as well, and is called superfecundation .  In certain medieval European chivalric romances , such as Marie de France 's Le Fresne , a woman cites a multiple birth (often to a lower-class woman) as proof of adultery on her part; while this may reflect a widespread belief, it is invariably treated as malicious slander, to be justly punished by the accuser having a multiple birth of her own, and the events of the romance are triggered by her attempt to hide one or more of the children. [48] A similar effect occurs in the Knight of the Swan romance, in the Beatrix variants of the Swan-Children; her taunt is punished by giving birth to seven children at once, and her wicked mother-in-law returns her taunt before exposing the children.

Abid Katib / Getty Images       More in Ages and Stages        Multiples       Through the Years     Babies     Toddlers     Preschoolers     School-Age Kids     Tweens     Teens        Quintuplets are a set of five offspring born at one birth. An individual that is part of such a set is called a quintuplet and sometimes referred to as a quint . Types of Quintuplets Quintuplets can be fraternal ( multi zygotic ), identical ( monozygotic ) or a combination of both. Multi zygotic quintuplets occur from five unique egg/sperm combinations. Monozygotic multiples are the result of a fertilized egg that splits into two or more embryos.         It is possible for a split to occur more than once, producing ​ monozygotic triplets or even a rare set of monozygotic quintuplets. Fully monozygotic quintuplets are rare, so rare that it is difficult to assess the odds. Quintuplets can be all male, all female, or a combination of both. (Monozygotic quintuplets will always be of the same gender.) Most quintuplets are a combination of boys and girls; all male or all female quintuples are rare. The first set of all-female quintuplets were born in the United States in 2015. In 2008, a Polish woman gave birth to a set of "probably identical" girls without the aid of fertility drugs. Odds of Quintuplets In 2005, the National Vital Statistics report for the United States reported the birth of 68 quintuplets and higher order multiples. Because this number includes the possible birth of sextuplets, septuplets or more, it is not determined exactly how many of those births were quintuplets.   The spontaneous conception of quintuplets is rare, the average estimate is 1 in about 60 million births. Most recent quintuplet births are the result of assisted reproductive techniques such as fertility enhancing drugs or in-vitro fertilization. Quintuplets do not always share the same birthdate. A delayed interval delivery (also known as iatrogenic asynchronous birth) may mean that individual babies are born days or even weeks apart.         Pregnancy With Quintuplets The average gestation for a quintuplet pregnancy is 29 weeks, as opposed to 40 weeks for a full-term baby. The longest gestation I've discovered was 35 weeks, a record held by the mother of the Stanford quintuplets in Rhode Island. Many mothers will gain more than fifty pounds during their pregnancy and will require cervical cerclage, a surgical procedure in which the cervix is sewn shut to prevent preterm labor. Nearly all quintuplet pregnancies result in a cesarean delivery. The average birth weight of a quintuplet is about 2 pounds, 12 ounces and most quintuplets receive medical care in a hospital NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) until they reach their original birth date. Dionne Quintuplets Perhaps the most famous quintuplets are the Dionne Quintuplets born in Canada in 1934. They were the first surviving set of all identical quintuplets. The girls - Annette, Émilie, Yvonne, Cécile, and Marie - attracted worldwide attention. They were removed from their parent's care and placed in the custody of a doctor, who displayed them as a tourist attraction. Interesting Facts About Quintuplets The Wilkinson quintuplets weighed more than 21 pounds combined when they were born at about 34 weeks in 2007. The heaviest quintuplet births on record, according to the Guinness Book of World Records was 25 pounds combined, attributed to two mothers, Liu Saulian (China, 1953) and Mrs. Kamalammal (India, 1956).         Parents of quintuplets will change more than 35,000 diapers before their kids are potty trained. The first set of quintuplets born in the United States were reported to be the Kanouse quints in Watertown, Wisconsin in 1875. They were all boys and did not survive. The Fischer quintuplets were the first surviving quintuplets in the United States, born in 1963 in South Dakota, according to Wikipedia. Baseball player Melvin Mora is a dad of quintuplets born in 2001 (3 girls and 2 boys). The mascots of the 2008 Beijing Olympics are quintuplets. A 2004 television show, "Quintuplets" starred Andy Richter and Rebecca Creskoff as parents of teenage quints.  The 1994 novel, Feather Crowns , is about a young Kentucky farm couple who gives birth to quintuplets. Support Groups for Families Are you having quintuplets? It's important for families to seek support and advice from other families in the same situation. Here are some organizations that can offer resources and assistance: MOST (Mothers of Supertwins) (United States) Multiple Births Canada's Higher Order Multiples Support Network Australian Multiple Birth Association (AMBA) New Zealand Multiple Birth Association (NZMBA) Twins and Multiple Birth Association (Tamba) (United Kingdom) Strollers for Quintuplets Five-seat quintuplet strollers are available and are a convenient -- though pricey -- option for transporting quints. The most prevalent brand is Runabout , a company that crafts multi-seat tandem strollers with hand-welded steel frames. They are quite expensive, costing nearly $1000 new from the manufacturer, but are widely available on the secondary market. Many families find it convenient to use a combination of double and triple strollers to accommodate all five babies.

Identical Quadruplets Born: 1 in 13 Million   By ABC News  Aug. 22, 2007   0 Shares               Email      Star    0 Shares               Email      The chances of having quadruplets is about one in 800,000. The chances of having a set of identical quadruplets is one in 11 million to 15 million. On Aug. 12, four babies beat the odds and broke a record at the same time. The identical Jepp quadruplets were born in four quick minutes in Great Falls, Mont. The four identical baby girls — Autumn, Brooke, Calissa and Dahlia — were delivered in the Benefis Healthcare System to proud parents Karen and J.P. "As any parent will tell you, bringing a new life into the world is an amazing wonderful thing, and we've got four amazing wonderful things," new dad J.P. said. The Jepps live in Calgary, Canada, but were sent to the states after learning that every single neonatal unit in Canada was too crowded to handle four premature births. One long hour after Karen Jepp went into labor and dozens of frantic phone calls later, the Jepps found Benefis Healthcare System in Montana — 300 miles away. They were on a plane shortly thereafter. "The nurses have been wonderful and really helped us out because we have no idea what we're doing," Karen said. The girls were delivered by Caesarean section after 31 weeks. All are in good health and breathing without ventilators. The girls were conceived without the help of fertility drugs; one egg split three times to produce four babies. With the babies traveling two to an incubator, the new family returned to Calgary in two separate trips; two with dad Thursday, and two with mom Friday. The birth of the Jepp girls marks one of fewer 50 sets of identical quadruplets in documented, medical history. "This is an incredibly rare event. You're talking about a one in 11 [million] to a one in 15 million event," said Jamie Grifo, division director of reproductive endocrinology at NYU Medical Center. Aside from J.P.'s mother, who is a twin, there is no history of multiple births in either parent's family. "My mom is a fraternal twin," J.P. said. "But we're told that doesn't apply in this case. Fraternal abilities may be genetic, but an egg splitting is just a genetic happening." The quads are expected to spend another four to eight weeks in the hospital before heading home with mom and dad to meet their big brother, 2-year-old Simon.        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

But for parents of quadruplets, their initial responses can be far from what can be called exuberance, at least in the early stages.  The practicalities of raising four babies to adulthood can seem utterly overwhelming, which is why experienced parents of higher order multiples ( HOM ) say it can help to just take things slowly at first and to allow the news to settle in, one steady day at a time.  The most common form of multiples are twins. Statistically 90% of all multiple births are made up of twins and the remaining 10% being shared between triplets, quadruplets and more. The most common variety of quadruplets is formed when four separate eggs are fertilised by four separate sperm.  There are however, a range of possibilities when it comes to the different combinations of quadruplets and how they are conceived. Quadruplets may be identical, non identical or a combination of both.  As well as the four separate eggs and sperm variety, there is also the possibility that:   One fertilised egg splits into four identical embryos.  One fertilised egg splits into three identical embryos and another separate egg is fertilised by a separate sperm. This means there are identical triplets plus one.  One set of Identical (monozygotic) twins occurs plus another two entirely separate embryos or another set of identical twins.  Another possibility is that a set of non identical/fraternal twins are conceived plus a monozygotic pair form making a total of four embryos.   Quadruplet pregnancy is usually diagnosed on ultrasound.  This is the most common time for parents to be told that four babies have been conceived and implanted. Seeing four little embryos on the screen can help the idea become a reality, but it’s very normal for expectant parents to leave the ultrasound rooms in a state of shock.  If they have had fertility assistance then there is an increased risk of multiple birth so the possibility may already have been raised and discussed. Although rare, it is not unknown for quadruplets to be naturally conceived.  Tell us again how lucky we are  Different cultures view multiple births in diverse ways.  For the Mayans, identical twins were seen as a blessing from God and a sign that they shared one soul which had been split between the two. In Roman culture twin boys were also viewed as a blessing, but unfortunately this belief did not extend to twin girls. They were seen as too much of a burden and the expense of raising two dowries instead of one overshadowed the “specialness” of two babies.  Within Greek and other European mythology, twins and other higher order multiples all feature, with their existence being attributable to the blessing or alternately, a curse from an almighty God.  In some ancient cultures, multiple births were seen as an outward sign that a woman had been unfaithful to her husband and the existence of more than one baby was indisputable proof of this.  Without any means of disproving this theory the poor women and their babies were often left to fend for themselves.  It goes without saying that we have much to be thankful for in terms of our current understanding of science and reproductive biology. But no matter how smart we have become and irrefutable evidence now supports our knowledge, there is still a little mystery and specialness surrounding multiple births.  Are quads as common as they used to be?  In the 1980s-1990s, multiple pregnancies were generally more common than at the present time. This decrease is thought to be due to overall advances in technology surrounding fertility assistance as well as the increased likelihood of these pregnancies being successful.  In the early days of assisted reproductive technology the general approach was to implant as many fertilised eggs as possible and therefore increase the chances of at least one of them implanting. But since there has been a greater understanding of the processes involved, as well as changes in the legislation surrounding the numbers of embryos which can be implanted, this has meant a reduction in the number of quadruplets being born.  There is an increased likelihood of quadruplets when:   A mother has a family history of multiple births. If she is a multiple herself or her mother and/or sisters naturally conceived multiple babies, then she is more likely to as well. This is because there is a genetic link of hyper ovulation amongst the women in some families.  Couples have had fertility assistance. Medication which increases the number of eggs supported towards maturity will increase the chances of multiple conception.  Women whose diet is high in dairy foods and yams/sweet potato.  Women are of African, especially Nigerian, descent.  Women are already breastfeeding an older baby or toddler; they are more likely to conceive with multiples. But lactation and frequent breastfeeding can also have a contraceptive effect by stopping ovulation so this is a very individual process.  Couples have regular sex during the woman’s fertile phases. This increases the overall chances of conception occurring.  A woman conceives in her first cycle after ceasing the contraceptive pill. This is a time when her body is going through a readjustment phase of ovulation and menstruation and it can take a few months for her body to align back to a and normal reproductive cycle.  Women are taller and have a higher Body Mass Index ( BMI ).  Though this can also have a reverse effect, as women who are overweight can also have problems with regular ovulation.  Women are older when they conceive rather than in a younger age group. Research has shown that women who are over 35 years are more likely to conceive with multiples. This tendency is thought to be due to what is known as a “fertility spike”, which occurs in women just before they enter peri-menopause.  From a biological perspective, this is probably due to the naturally occurring phenomenon of nature maximising the number of babies which can be born whilst women are still fertile.  A woman has had many previous pregnancies. The more babies she has had and the more times she has ovulated the more likely she is to naturally conceive with multiples. This includes   quadruplets.   Risks of quadruplet pregnancy  To the mother:   Miscarrying one or all of the quadruplets. Genetic abnormalities account for a large percentage of early stage miscarriage. Even in a singleton pregnancy, the chances of miscarriage are 10-25% and these odds are increased for multiples.  Increased risks of pregnancy complications overall including gestational diabetes, hypertension, placenta praevia, ante and post partum haemorrhage and anaemia.  Uterine rupture and placental abruption.  Need for caesarian section delivery.  A normal vaginal delivery is not advisable for the birth of quadruplets as it is too stressful and risky for both the mother and her babies.  Access to tertiary level neonatal services is essential. Women who are pregnant with quadruplets and who live in rural or regional areas are usually advised to relocate in their second or third trimester (at the latest) so they are close to the major city maternity hospital where their quads will be born.  Restrictions around lifestyle, work, household and care of older children if there are any.  The usual recommendations around working during pregnancy and taking maternity leave are usually different in the case of multiple pregnancy.  Greater likelihood of having post natal depression and psychological adjustment disorders after the babies are born. Additional stress on the parent’s relationship is inevitable and the need for practical, financial and emotional support is great.   To the babies:   Premature birth is always a risk factor in multiple births.  Intra-uterine growth retardation and low birth weight. The average weight for a preterm individual quadruplet is around 1.3kgs but many weigh less than this and do not exceed 1kg when they are born.  Cerebral palsy and jaundice. May need blood transfusions if there has been incompatibility issues or in cases of anaemia and extreme jaundice.  Breathing difficulties, problems maintaining their temperature and blood sugar levels.  A generalised higher risk of physiological problems including hernia.  Greater risk of developmental problems and global delays, including gross and fine motor skills, speech and language development, social and emotional development and visual acuity.

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Multiples in pregnancy Twins triplets quads identical and fraternal            Home : Ovulation Planner : Duedate : Baby Names : Week by Week : Site Map :             Types of Multiples in pregnancy   A pregnancy of two or more fetuses is called a multiple pregnancy. Multiple fetuses can be the same (identical) or different (fraternal). Identical twins or triplets come from a single egg that has been fertilized by one sperm. For unknown reasons, the fertilized egg splits into two or more embryos during the first stage of development. Fraternal multiples come from multiple fertilized eggs. Some identical multiples share the same placenta. However, they usually grow within separate amniotic sacs in the uterus. In rare cases, identical multiples share one amniotic sac. Fraternal fetuses have separate placentas and amniotic sacs. Identical multiples: Are always the same sex and blood type. Do not always look exactly alike. One may be right-handed while the other is left-handed. They are not related to your age, race, or family history of twins. Fraternal multiples:  Can be of different sexes and have different blood types. May look very different from one another, with different colored hair and eyes. They may also look alike, as siblings often do. Fraternal multiples tend to run in families.       Types of Twins Fraternal Twins With fraternal twins, the most common type, the mother contributes two eggs that are independently fertilized in the womb by two different sperm cells from the father. They are genetically as similar as any ordinary siblings. Fraternal twins are simply brothers and/or sisters who happen to be the same age. Fraternals are more common for older mothers, with rates doubling over the age of 35. Identical Twins With identical twins, one egg from the mother is fertilized by one sperm from the father, and then very early in development the embryo splits and two fetuses grow. These twins are very similar genetically and they are the same gender. Identical twins appears to be a random event, not a hereditary trait, and is uniformly distributed in all populations around the world. More information on Twins in pregnancy. Semi Identical Twins The 'semi-identical' twins are the result of two sperm cells fusing with a single egg, before becoming two embryos. This would result in a set of twins with identical genes from the mother's side, but different ones from the father's side. An embryo created this way doesn't usually survive, but a few cases are known.  ↑ Top ↑           How Common are Multiples?  There has been an increase in multiple births in recent years. Since 1980, infertility treatment has more than doubled the American twin birth rate. The rate of triplet or more births is now nearly 5 times higher than before infertility treatment was used. In the year 2000, in the United States, there were: 118,920 Twin Births 6,740 Triplet Births 507 Quadruplet Births 78 Quintuplets & other higher order Births That is more than a 70 percent increase in the number of twin births from 1980. With just over 4 million births in the United States in 2000, about 3% of babies born in the United States are twins or higher order multiple births (such as triplets), which although not common, does mean that multiples are more common than many people believe. What are your chance of having more than one baby at a time? Basically, it is about 3% or 1 in 33. The chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins is only about 1.7% or 1 in 60. The chance of having identical twins has remained steady, and is about 0.4% or 1 in 250. The chances of having twins with the use of fertility treatments can be as high as 20 to 25%. chance of having 'natural' fraternal twins: 1 in 60 chance of having 'natural' identical twins: 1 in 250 chance of having 'fertility treatment' multiple: 1 in 4 chance of having 'natural' triplets: 1 in 8,100 (only about 30% of triplets are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quads: 1 in 729,000 (only about 6% of quads are 'natural') chance of having 'natural' quints: 1 in 55,000,000 Common factors that increase the chances of conceiving twins. Fertility Drugs: Taking fertility drugs or undergoing fertility treatments can significantly increase your chances of having twins or another type of multiple birth. In some cases, it can increase your chances of having twins by more than 20%. Age: Your chances of having twins increases as you grow older. The chance of having twins rises to 4% between the ages of 30 and 34, and to 5% between the ages of 35 and 39. Family History: Having a maternal history of twins or other multiple births increases your chance of becoming pregnant with twins considerably. Cultural Background: People of African American descent are more likely to have twins or multiple births. People of Asian or Hispanic descent are less likely to have twins. Previous Pregnancies: Women who have had four or more previous pregnancies are the most likely to have twins.   ↑ Top ↑      Higher Risks with Multiples What risks? If you are expecting twins, you will be classed as a high risk pregnancy. Extra demands are placed on the mother and the placental system on which the babies rely. This may slow the growth of one or both the babies, and cause high blood pressure in the mother. There is a strong chance of premature birth. These risks are made greater with triplets or higher multiple pregnancies. Your doctor may suggest an early scan if you look large for your due date or have a history of multiples in yor family, but you will most likely find out at your first routine scan , 12 to 14 weeks. On rare occasions, the second baby is missed in an earlier scan as it is hidden behind the first. Nearly all multiple pregnancies are now diagnosed in the first trimester by ultrasound. However, some twins die and are absorbed in the first half of pregnancy ('the disappearing twin' syndrome) and early scanning increases awareness of this phenomenon. Being told you are expecting twins or more can be a shock, particulary if you have no family history of twins. You will get more antenatal care, and you will need to take more care of yourself than if you were having one baby, but there is no reson to consider youself invalid. Making sure that you have enough rest and eat a healthy diet are important to your body as it has to work harder. Most likely you will not go the whole term, so you may have to leave work earlier than planned, if you have other children, try to arrange for help so you don't get overtired.               Complications Although a naturally occurring phenomena, multiple pregnancies are considered high-risk because: Smaller babies - fetuses tend to be individually smaller than those in a
singleton pregnancy because of greater demand for nutrients and slower in utero growth i.e. light-for-dates. Monozygotic twins tend to be smaller than dizygotic twins.  Increased risk of prematurity - the mean gestation for twins is 37 weeks and for triplets 31 weeks.  Higher risk of congenital abnormality associated with multiple pregnancies (x2 rate in singleton pregnancies).  Higher rates of cerebral palsy found in twins (1 - 1.5%) and triplets (7 - 8%).  Perinatal mortality (at 22 completed weeks gestation and over) rate for twins is significantly higher than singletons (x5) and even higher for triplets (x6). Rates are higher for monochorionic twins than dichorionic twins (49 versus 11.5 in 1000). Higher rate of maternal pregnancy-related complications such as hyperemesis gravidarum (from Greek hyper and emesis and Latin gravida; meaning " excessive vomiting of pregnant women"), polyhydramnios (an abnormally large volume of amniotic fluid), pre-eclampsia, anaemia, antepartum haemorrhage.  Higher rate of complications in labour - malpresentation, vasa praevia, cord prolapse, premature separation of placenta, cord entanglement, postpartum haemorrhage.  Complications of multiple pregnancy do not end with birth. Language and speech delay, more general cognitive delay or motor problems, behavioural problems and difficulty in parent-child interactions all appear to be more common in multiple birth children. Also the non-medical financial, social and emotional consequences of caring for twins or higher order multiples need to be kept in mind.  ↑ Top ↑           Main Pages   Home Fetus Growth Baby Names Medical Index Boy or Girl ?

By Sarah Schreiber     Dec 22, 2016                            When you hear heartwarming stories about couples overcoming major odds to conceive, infertility is usually the culprit. For Kortney and Justin Miller, a couple in their early 20s, it seems as if over -fertility was at play when they naturally conceived quadruplets. Are you ready for the odds? I don't think you're ready. The odds of conceiving quadruplets sans IVF or fertility therapy are 1 in 700,000. As if that isn't rare enough, the Miller quads are even more extraordinary. Each child came from its very own egg, which led to four individual sacs and placentas. In layman's terms, that means that, prior to the quads' conceptions, Kortney Miller released four eggs at once. Busy mama.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below     Kortney and Justin already had their hands full with their 4-year-old son, Bentlee, when they were told that their family of three would soon become a family of seven. They weren't quite prepared for the news, but Kortney had a hunch. Multiples, after all, run in her family. "I was sure I was having more than one," Kortney told Today . "I felt a little different." Yep, we'd expect you'd feel a tad different when you're, you know, carrying four tiny humans inside of you. "I never thought there would be four," she continued. At the ultrasound, with her mother by her side, she discovered that she would be "carrying on the tradition" with Miller multiples.  The Georgia couple turned to their OB-GYN, Dr. Heather Turner, at Piedmont Newnan Hospital, where a team of doctors and nurses (dubbed the "quad squad") assembled to prepare for the babies' arrival. It was the first time the hospital would be delivering quadruplets. "There was a lot of preparation to do," Dr. Turner told Today . "Any time we anticipate a pre-term delivery, there is a lot of coordination across the labor and delivery unit as well as the hospital to lay the groundwork so everything can be as smooth as possible."  Weekly interdisciplinary meetings for doctors and conferences with the Millers were hosted to maximize chances of a successful delivery. So when Kortney came in for a check-up on December 16, a quiet Friday morning, to discover that she was three centimeters dilated, it was all systems go. Her husband arrived just in time to witness the cesarean birth.  Kortney and Justin are now the proud parents of three boys — Brandon, Brayden and Bryant — and one precious little girl, Kenlee. Brandon was the largest of the four, weighing in at 3 pounds, 1 ounce. The babies are currently in the NICU and are thriving. Dr. Turner says the birth went "amazingly well" and that the babies are expected to grow stronger over time.

Looks like the overprotective big brother gene has been activated. "We are so excited and blessed to have four healthy babies," Kortney told the Newnan Times Herald . "We can't wait to go with them on their journey as they grow and progress."

Baer , Journal Sentinel Staff   Aug. 25, 2013    0                 Mike Kisner thought the doctor had to be kidding. Triplets, the doctor said. Kisner and his fiancée were having triplets.  The couple had little time to absorb the idea when, two days later, the doctor found a fourth baby.  Kisner, 26, and his fiancée, Charity McCulloch, 39, of Wilmot in Kenosha County, had conceived quadruplets without the assistance of fertility drugs.  "I thought it was a joke at first," McCulloch said.  The couple found themselves in a rather exclusive club. The chance of conceiving quadruplets naturally is 1 in 700,000, said Joseph Davis, a gynecologist and fertility specialist at Froedtert & The Medical College of Wisconsin. Experts say 90% of quadruplets are born with the aid of medical technology.  "It is a surprise to have natural quadruplets, but it's not unheard of," Davis said. "It's just exceedingly rare."  The couple had planned to have one child once they were married — they plan to marry Aug. 31.  But when the four boys were born at Wheaton Franciscan All Saints Hospital in Racine on June 5, they became an instant family.  "The Lord has a plan for us. I don't know what it is, but He has a plan for us," Kisner said.  Kisner remembers being in the operating room that day with more than 20 doctors and nurses.  "It was very chaotic," he said. "Each person had their own little job to do and in a matter of three minutes all of them were out."  The quadruplets were born at 28 weeks and four days — birth normally occurs around 40 weeks. Typically, multiple pregnancies reduce the gestation period about three weeks per baby, or "multiple," said Davis.  Because of the early delivery, the quadruplets stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit several weeks after they were born. The smallest baby weighed 1 pound, 12 ounces.  Two boys, Kerrigan and Christian, went home July 29, while Brice and Oliver, the smaller of the four, stayed at the hospital a bit longer. They came home on Aug. 8. None of them faced severe complications.  While family history of twins can increase the  chances of multiple births, the science behind conceiving quadruplets, or even triplets, is a bit of a mystery. Davis said one theory is that the closer women are to menopause, the higher their chances are of multiple births. These women typically have elevated follicle-stimulating hormones levels, which can increase their chance of having more than one egg released.  "From a reproductive standpoint she's closer to advanced reproductive age," Davis said of McCulloch. "It may be a factor."  Davis said the age of the male is usually less of a factor because males have the same fertility chances up until age 50 or 60.  Kisner and McCulloch met at work about five years ago and got engaged last summer. The two are paramedics for Bell Ambulance in Milwaukee.  Though the stress of caring for four babies at once has challenged the new parents, Kisner and McCulloch have prepared themselves.  "We're just trying to keep the boys healthy and keep our sanity," Kisner said.  "Four's enough," McCulloch said.       0    Share    Tweet    Email    Print                             News Watch               Milwaukee man accused of executing man over $90 debt  11:31 a.m.    Convict in fatal park shooting will have chance at parole  11:08 a.m.    UW-led study finds infection with Zika prevents reinfection  11:03 a.m.    Dodge County man charged with homicide in woman’s overdose  10:55 a.m.    Wisconsin’s appeal on abortion turned away by Supreme Court  Updated:

By Jason DeRusha March 15, 2011 at 10:53 pm       Filed Under: Durst , Four Of A Kind , Good Question , Jason DeRusha , Multiple Births , Odds , Quadruplets    By Jason DeRusha, WCCO-TV  MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — Four identical twins from Buffalo, Minnesota are now starring in a documentary-style reality show about their life.  “Four of a Kind” is now airing on Lifetime Television, following Callie, Kendra, Megan and Sarah Durst through their senior year in high school.  They are one of 63 sets of identical quadruplets in the world. Clearly rare. But what are the odds of having a multiple birth?  “Naturally quadruplet births occur only in 1 per 500,000 births, only a few a year in the country,” said Dr. Bill Block, a perinatal specialist at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis.  “Not very high. They’re about Powerball odds.”  At Abbott in 2010, they delivered one set of quadruplets.  The odds of having triplets or more in the United States are just barely one tenth of one percent, 0.0015 percent according to the National Center for Health Statistics.  Still, the odds are about 400 percent higher than in 1980, according to Block, that’s almost entirely because of the explosion of fertility drugs and in-vitro fertilization.  And that’s something that the reproductive experts are working to reduce.  “A lot of the reproductive endocrinologists in town and around the country will only put back one egg or, at times, two eggs now. It’s not a matter of putting back four, five, six eggs hoping one would take,” said Block.  So let’s talk twins. In 2008, 3.3 percent of all births were twins. That’s the highest rate ever, perhaps because doctors are cutting down on the rate of triplets or higher.  African-Americans are more likely to have multiple births.  And if it runs in your family, that also elevates the chances.  “There is a genetic component to it. We don’t have it worked out as to what it is exactly, but if you come from a family with many multiple births, you’re more likely to have a multiple birth too,” said Block.  So let’s put this in perspective.  According to the Minnesota Department of Health, in 2009, there were 70,611 babies born.  Of that group, 68,012 were single babies and 2,599 were multiples.  If you removed the influence of fertility drugs and treatments, Block said that the birth rate of multiples are “very steady over time.”   Jason DeRusha Facebook Follow on Twitter Jason DeRusha filed his first report for WCCO-TV on April Fool's Day in 2003.

This report is totally about numbers, yet at roughly 54 seconds into it, you say: here they are as 5 year-olds in their home town of Buffalo in 1993. Today they’re 18 …  But, 1993 was 18 years ago (hint: you subtract 1993 from 2011); so how could they be 18 now if they were 5, 18 years ago?  Why should I believe any other numbers in the answer?

Reply  Report comment        Kristen  says:   March 16, 2011 at 12:35 pm   They’re only identical if the egg splits, so identical quads means the one egg split once and then each of those two also split. Otherwise, two sets of identical twins would mean they are fraternal to one another and all four would not be identical.  Reply  Report comment          David J.

Reply  Report comment          Kristen  says:   March 16, 2011 at 12:40 pm   She stated that she did not use fertility drugs but the fact that they’re identical absolutely does mean it was not from drugs – the drugs do not cause eggs to split, they cause mutliple eggs to release simultaneously and when more than one is fertilized, you get fraternal twins, triplets, quads, etc.  Courteney, consider that some people need help to have a child of their own and it’s totally unfair for you to say “get rid of fertility drugs” — if it was you wanting to have a baby and you could not, you would feel differently. The overpopulation is not because of fertility drugs – it’s people having too many that are not having problems having them (for the most part). Trust me, if you were in this position, you’d have a different viewpoint. It’s the hardest thing in the world to have to learn that you cannot have a baby when everyone else is doing it without problems. Have some sensitivity.  Reply  Report comment          Bill  says:   March 16, 2011 at 12:03 pm   “Four identical twins from Buffalo…” The term “twins” refers to two being born in the same gestation. If four are born in the same gestation, and their identical, then they’re identical quadruplets.  But then again, that’s to be expected in an article whose related story indicates that they were 5 in 1993, and are 18 now…  Reply  Report comment        K.  says:   March 16, 2011 at 12:09 pm   They really mixed apples and oranges with this report.  Identical quads and fraternal quads are two entirely separate entities.  Usually, fertility drugs cause multple fraternal twins………not identical.  Identical is a phenomenon where the fertilized egg splits.  And to have identical quads means that after the one fertized egg split, each of those then split giving you four……….quite rare…..especially when compared to fraternal quads which happens from several ovulations thus making each baby different.  This report wasn’t very clear in giving us the numbers distinguishing these differences.  Reply  Report comment        K.  says:   March 16, 2011 at 12:12 pm   As I said above, fertility drugs would be more likely to cause multple fraternals because they act on the ovaries to release more eggs.  I am not sure that fertility drugs could affect the fertilized egg before it implants itself……..how could it do that?  I mean, it’s not connected to the mother’s blood supply as it is just floating around in the fallopian tubes before it implants.  This report was missing a lot of details.  Reply  Report comment        Kristen  says:   March 16, 2011 at 12:46 pm   Fertility drugs absolutely do not affect the egg itself or even implantation. The drugs act to cause your body to release hormones that cause your ovaries to develop eggs. Then you get another drug that causes your ovary to release the egg (ovulate) and that’s ALL they do. You still have to wait for fertilization to happen (in IVF, they ensure that part outside your body and then reinsert the fertilized egg in the uterus) and so you could still end up with only one that works (or none most of the time). The multiples thing is pretty rare, even in IUI and IVF.

Do the math.  Their family had 4 children in 14 months.  We also have a brand new singleton just 3 weeks old.  None of the twins were conceived with fertility drugs.  There are no twins in anyof the families.  Reply  Report comment        Maynard  says:   March 21, 2011 at 11:48 am   Third attempt.  Not sure why my prior replies were blocked.  Maybe because they had URLs.  I’m not an expert in this, so hopefully the rates that google internet searches found are reliable.  Tummy Wear (googled “How to Increase Chances of Having Twins”; include the quote marks on all) lists several ways other than fertility drugs to improve the chances of having twins.  Excluding fertility drugs, Keep Kids Healthy (googled “What is your chance of having twins”) says, in the US, the likelihood of a pregnancy producing fraternal twins is 1 in 60.  It also says it is more common in African Americans and least common in Asians and Hispanics.  Baby Center (googled “Your likelihood of having twins or more”) says the likelihood is 1 in 89.  Since the world-wide Asian plus Hispanic populations dwarf the US population and those are the least likely, it makes sense that it is rarer world-wide than in the US.  iVillage (googled “What are your chances of having a second set”) says giving birth to fraternal twins is about 5 times more likely for a mother who has already given birth to fraternal twins.  But it also says the likelihood of giving birth to identical twins for that same mother is the same 1 in 250 as the general population.  The 1 in 250 likelihood is what the other websites also list for identical twins.  Twins List (googled “Causes of Identical Twinning”) reports an increased likelihood for some fathers to produce identical twins.  For example, it mentions a father of identical twins, later divorcing, and producing identical twins with his next wife as well.  But it doesn’t say identical twins are more likely after fraternal twins.  So assuming none of the 4 parents are in any population that change the chances of having twins, the general population chances of the 3 sets of twins you describe are, depending on which fraternal twin rate you choose, 1 in 900,000 (60x60x250) or 1 in 1,980,250 (89x89x250).  The chances of identical twins in one family and 2 sets of fraternal twins in the other are 5 times higher than those.  But I can’t calculate the “1 set of grandparents” part of your question. As far as I know, no state has a place to list the grandparents on a birth certificate, so grandparent statistics aren’t kept, and even if they were, I have no idea what number of grandparents (2, 4, 6, ?) comprise the “set” you mention.  Perhaps I’m taking things too literally. 🙂  Reply  Report comment          kathy  says:   March 16, 2011 at 9:59 pm   what are the chances of 3 siblings each having a set of grandchildren that are twins  my brother has a set of identical boys my sister has a set of identical girls and I have a set of a girl and a boy  we have them all covered also there was no fertility drugs these are all natural I sure am glad it missed my generation  Reply  Report comment        Maynard  says:   March 17, 2011 at 1:19 am   Again depending on the fraternal twin birth rate (1 in 89 or 1 in 60), the chances are 1 in 5,562,500 (250x250x89) or 1 in 3,750,000 (250x250x60).  Reply  Report comment        Maynard  says:   March 18, 2011 at 8:19 am   Forgot to mention the chances of having identical twins is 1 in 250.  What I calculated is the likelihood that any 3 pregnancies result in exactly 2 sets of identical twins and 1 set of fraternal twins.  To be what you ask, they would have to be multiplied by the likelihood that 3 siblings all have grandchildren (which would have to include the likelihood that your family had 3 siblings).  I don’t believe statistics at the grandchildren level are kept. You or your siblings could have adopted, not saying that happened, but it’s possible, and that would throw a wrench in the statistics gathering.

Reply  Report comment        Maria  says:   April 15, 2011 at 1:14 pm   They also got their percentages wrong.  0.0015% is not “barely one tenth of one percent.”  0.0015% would be 15-ten-thousandths of 1%.  If it was just supposed to be 0.0015, it’s also wrong – that would be 15-hundredths of one percent, which is one and a half times one-tenth of one percent.  Shoddy math all around.

It is said that it skips a genearation then the next generation will have twins again, not one of us cousins had twins.  I prayed for twins, then I would only have to go through the pregancy thing once.LOL  Reply  Report comment      Leave a Reply Cancel reply      Enter your comment here...

Identical Quadruplets Born: 1 in 13 Million   By ABC News  Aug. 22, 2007   0 Shares               Email      Star    0 Shares               Email      The chances of having quadruplets is about one in 800,000. The chances of having a set of identical quadruplets is one in 11 million to 15 million. On Aug. 12, four babies beat the odds and broke a record at the same time. The identical Jepp quadruplets were born in four quick minutes in Great Falls, Mont. The four identical baby girls — Autumn, Brooke, Calissa and Dahlia — were delivered in the Benefis Healthcare System to proud parents Karen and J.P. "As any parent will tell you, bringing a new life into the world is an amazing wonderful thing, and we've got four amazing wonderful things," new dad J.P. said. The Jepps live in Calgary, Canada, but were sent to the states after learning that every single neonatal unit in Canada was too crowded to handle four premature births. One long hour after Karen Jepp went into labor and dozens of frantic phone calls later, the Jepps found Benefis Healthcare System in Montana — 300 miles away. They were on a plane shortly thereafter. "The nurses have been wonderful and really helped us out because we have no idea what we're doing," Karen said. The girls were delivered by Caesarean section after 31 weeks. All are in good health and breathing without ventilators. The girls were conceived without the help of fertility drugs; one egg split three times to produce four babies. With the babies traveling two to an incubator, the new family returned to Calgary in two separate trips; two with dad Thursday, and two with mom Friday. The birth of the Jepp girls marks one of fewer 50 sets of identical quadruplets in documented, medical history. "This is an incredibly rare event. You're talking about a one in 11 [million] to a one in 15 million event," said Jamie Grifo, division director of reproductive endocrinology at NYU Medical Center. Aside from J.P.'s mother, who is a twin, there is no history of multiple births in either parent's family. "My mom is a fraternal twin," J.P. said. "But we're told that doesn't apply in this case. Fraternal abilities may be genetic, but an egg splitting is just a genetic happening." The quads are expected to spend another four to eight weeks in the hospital before heading home with mom and dad to meet their big brother, 2-year-old Simon.        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

		Staff  The Canadian Press           WATCH ABOVE: An Alberta woman, pregnant with identical quadruplets, has recently given birth in Edmonton. On Monday, a couple from Hythe introduced their four new daughters to the world. Carole Anne Devaney reports.                             X               -   A  A   +       Listen            EDMONTON – An Alberta couple will have added reasons to celebrate when they mark their first wedding anniversary next month. Bethani and Tim Webb of Hythe — 500 kilometres northwest of Edmonton — became the parents of four identical baby girls on Friday. The naturally conceived quadruplets were delivered by caesarean section by obstetric and neonatal specialists at an Edmonton hospital.  Story continues below        “Of course, I’m worried about her,” Tim said. “The day of, everything went fine. “It was kind of like a magic show, because they’re pulling out one, two, three, four… It was kind of surreal.” The Webbs were told by a nurse during the pregnancy that the odds of having natural quads are one in 67 million.

It’s overwhelmingly awesome.” The girls have been named Emily, Grace, McKayla and Abigail and weigh between three pounds and four pounds, one ounce. How did the couple pick those names? “We just decided,” Bethani said simply. “Found some we liked and picked them out. It was nice that we didn’t have to pick our favourites. We could just pick four we liked. We didn’t have to choose just one.” “I’m looking forward to the memories,” Tim said, “and how close they’ll all be.” “I can’t wait until they’re home,” Bethani added. “It’s going to be crazy the first few years… It’ll be very exciting.” With files from Global News     Report an error        AHS  Alberta Health Services  Alberta quads  Edmonton Health Matters  Four babies  Hythe  Identical Quadruplets  Identical quads  Naturally conceived identical quads  naturally conceived quadruplets       Editor's Picks          Canada    How Ottawa might try to save the Trans Mountain pipeline          Tech    Two-thirds of Canadians don't trust Facebook with their data, Ipsos poll shows         Politics    UK probing AggregateIQ as part of inquiry into privacy law breach         Canada    Ambassador told to take down tweet about 'pleasing' Myanmar beach due to Canadian cold snap, not ethnic cleansing         Canada    Millennials are confident about buying homes, but many get a boost from mom and dad          Money    Donald Trump keeps attacking Amazon — here's why, and what he's hoping to accomplish          Politics    Bureaucrats working under Harper and Trudeau rejected IBM's advice to delay Phoenix         Canada    Matthew Schrier was kidnapped by al-Qaida in Syria.

Little did the couple know, though, that before they got married they would become a family of six. A pain in the 32-year-old's abdomen sent her to the emergency room over a month later to do an ultrasound. The scan showed that Danielle and her partner Joseph Odom were pregnant with not one baby, but two, which didn't surprise her because her older brothers were twins. But then a new ultrasound a week later showed another baby hiding with the twins. The couple was having triplets. At 13 weeks pregnant, the third ultrasound revealed the final count and doctors informed them they were actually having quadruplets. The fourth baby was hiding by her belly button. Danielle gave birth to naturally conceived quadruplets on August 17, a feat that is only done in one and 700,000 women who are pregnant with four children.          Danielle Thrasher, 32, gave birth to quadruplets on August 17 after first being told she was pregnant with twins. From top left clockwise is Zoey, Lyla, Arya and Maya Odom        Danielle (left) and her partner Joseph Odom (right) were planning on getting married but those plans are on hold to focus on the girls. They have been together for three years Danielle Thrasher and Joseph Odom, both 32, from Noblesville, Indiana, took on the shock of having not one or two or even three children, but four after two false readings on an ultrasound. The couple first found out they were pregnant with a child when Danielle took a home pregnancy test. Severe abdominal pain sent her to the emergency room at six weeks pregnant where doctors revealed that she was actually having twins. The twins were no surprise to her because her brothers were twins and she knew genetically that it was possible for her, too.

Share this article  Share      How rare are quadruplets and what are the risks for this type of pregnancy The most common form of multiple births is twins. Twins occur 90 percent of the time with the other 10 percent divided between triplets, quadruplets, etc. These multiple births are more likely with the help of IVF and other fertility drugs to help people get pregnant. The most common way someone can conceive quadruplets is if there are four separate eggs that are fertilized by four different sperm. But, it is also possible for embryos to split to form multiple babies. There is a one in 700,000 chance that someone can conceive quadruplets naturally without any help from IVF or other fertility treatments. How are the chances of producing quadruplets increased? If the mother comes from a family with multiple births because there is a genetic link to hyper ovulation. If the couple is using a fertility treatment to help get pregnant. If the couple has regular sex during the woman's fertile phase of her cycle. If the woman is 35 years or older because the body is more likely to release multiple eggs at one time. What are the risks to a quadruplet pregnancy on the mother? The mother is at a higher risk for miscarrying one of the children if she is carrying all four. Other increased risks include uterine rupture, placental rupture, gestational diabetes and hypertension. The additional babies can also cause psychological, financial and social effects on both of the parents. What are the risks for the babies? Premature birth is always a risk factor when the mother is carrying multiple babies in her womb. The babies are also more likely to have a low birth weight. Quadruplets can have breathing difficulties, problems maintaining their temperature and blood sugar levels. They can also experience hearing loss, vision loss and heart complications. Source: Huggies But then on an ultrasound one week later showed a third baby hiding in her womb. Joseph was the one who experienced the largest shock of the news. 'It took him a good solid month to process all that,' Danielle said to Daily Mail Online. Little did they know at the time, but a fourth baby was hiding under Danielle's belly button. Doctors revealed Danielle was having a quadruplets when she was 13 weeks pregnant during her third ultrasound. 'I turned to Joseph and said "What are we going to do" in the middle of the ultrasound,' Danielle said. Joseph was the calm one after the big reveal that they were having four. 'He was like "it's fine, it's just one more",' Danielle said. But they couldn't understand how the fourth baby was missed when the ultrasound technicians first found the three and their individual heartbeat. Her doctor explained that they didn't have any reason to check and see if she was having more than three babies. 'Because of the placement of the babies, they didn't go searching around for four,' Danielle said. The quadruplets were naturally conceived from four individual eggs that were fertilized by four separate sperm. There is only a one in 700,000 chance of someone pregnant with quadruplets to naturally conceive them. On that same day of seeing their fourth baby, doctors brought up a potential plan to reduce the pregnancy down to twins. 'It was very tough to hear all the statistics,' Danielle said. The chances of her having a miscarriage had significantly increased with having all four babies. Also, there was a higher risk of her going into preterm labor where the babies could be born with developmental problems. The couple decided together that giving up one or two of their children wasn't an option. 'We really felt in our hearts that if God wanted to give us four, we would have four,' Danielle said. 'We couldn't live with ourselves knowing we had to pick two.' This decision brought them down a harder road with the knowledge that the births would cause extra stress on both Danielle and her babies as well as a larger financial burden. The average mother carrying quadruplets goes into preterm labor at 24 to 26 weeks. Danielle was able to make it to 27 weeks and five days before having each child by a cesarean section birth. She wanted to make it longer, but her waist at the time measured at the size of a 53-week pregnancy and her blood pressure was high.          Daniele and Joseph found out they were having quadruplets during an ultrasound when she was 13 weeks pregnant. The fourth baby was hiding under her belly button          Danielle and Joseph are holding their daughter Lyla after she was born. Lyla is easy for them to recognize because she has golden hair while her sisters all have darker hair Baby D, who is now called Arya, was also getting a lower blood chord flow than the other babies. This provides oxygen and nutrients from the mother to the baby, so it was imperative to deliver to make sure all the children remained healthy.  We really felt in our hearts that if God wanted us to have four, we would have four.  Danielle Thrasher, mother Baby A, named Zoey Cheyenne after Danielle's deceased sister, was born at 2lbs and 2oz as the smallest of her siblings. The hiding baby was Baby B and the couple named her Lyla Mae, which they came up with in the car on the way home from finding out they were having quadruplets. She weighed 2lbs and 6.5oz. Baby C was named Maya Jo after her father and was born weighing 2bs and 4oz. The final baby was Baby D, named Arya Grace because Danielle is a big Game of Thrones fan. She weighed in at 2lbs and 2.9oz. The couple stuck with a trend of having each girl have four letters in their name because they are quadruplets and they wanted them to have short names. 'We both have long names,' Danielle said. 'So we thought "let's keep it short and simple".' The doctors were all pleased that the babies all weighed so much considering they were born premature. Their actual due date was supposed to be November 11. But with this birth has come complications for the quadruplets. Lyla, Arya and Zoey have done extremely well with gaining weight since they were first born, but Maya has been having more trouble.          Arya Grace was born at 2lbs and 2.9oz. She is named after the character Arya in Game of Thrones because Danielle is a big fan of the show          Lyla Mae was the fourth baby that was hidden during the ultrasound the first and second ultrasound. She was born weighing 2lbs and 6.5oz She is gaining weight but has developed a heart murmur and can't always breathe on her own. A heart murmur is when an extra sound is made in the heart as the blood is traveling through it. Depending on the murmur, it can cause no problems at all for the baby. But other murmurs could lead to severe problems with the valves or walls of the heart. Doctors are monitoring Maya closely to make sure it doesn't develop into something more serious. All four babies are expected to stay in the hospital at least until the end of October because doctors need them to reach a certain stage of development before they feel comfortable releasing them. Danielle explained that the doctors are looking for each baby to weigh 4.5lbs, breathe on their own, suck and swallow on their own and pass the car seat test. This test involves the infant having to sit in a car seat for 90 to 120 minutes while a nurse monitors their breathing, heart rate and oxygen levels. Weight also plays a large factor in the car seat test because their isn't one small enough to handle a child that weighs less than 4lbs. Until then, Danielle is traveling 30 minutes to the Community Hospital North in Indianapolis, Indiana, every day to be with her daughters while Joseph goes to work. She has been feeding them with her breast milk because doctors think that is the best way to give the children nutrients to help with growth. But the hard part is far from over for the new parents. The couple has been together for three years and was originally going to get married, but those plans have been put on hold. 'The needs of the girls comes first,' Danielle said. Financial problems have occurred because they currently live in a one bedroom apartment and do not have a car large enough to fit all four car seats.          Maya Jo was born weighing 2lbs and 4oz. She is named after her father Joseph. Maya is the quadruplet that has had the most difficulty because she developed a heart murmur and occasionally has trouble breathing on her own          Zoey Cheyenne was the smallest weighing at 2lbs and 2oz when she was born. She is named after Danielle's sister who died when she was only 11 But Joseph is the only one that can go to work because daycare is too expensive for  them to both to be at work. 'We don't have cable and we cut down on internet usage,' Danielle said. 'We are limiting things we would indulge in and really watching what we are spending.' One of Danielle's friends reached out to the apartment complex they live in to see if the building could help them pay for a two-bedroom instead of a one, but they have had no luck so far for that to happen. If the couple paid for a two-bedroom on their own it would add $300-350 a month to their rent. 'That's diapers for the girls,' Danielle said. A GoFundMe page was created to help raise money for the price of hospital bills and other necessities for the quadruplets. The couple is focused right now, though, on keeping their girls healthy and getting them out of the hospital. 'Knowing they have a roof over their head, food in their mouths and basic necessities is enough for now,' Danielle said.  Advertisement   Read more:   www.gofundme.com...
