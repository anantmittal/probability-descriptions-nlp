A low sperm count is also called oligospermia (ol-ih-go-SPUR-me-uh). A complete absence of sperm is called azoospermia. Your sperm count is considered lower than normal if you have fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen.  Having a low sperm count decreases the odds that one of your sperm will fertilize your partner's egg, resulting in pregnancy. Nonetheless, many men who have a low sperm count are still able to father a child.      Symptoms The main sign of low sperm count is the inability to conceive a child. There might be no other obvious signs or symptoms. In some cases, an underlying problem such as an inherited chromosomal abnormality, a hormonal imbalance, dilated testicular veins or a condition that blocks the passage of sperm may cause signs and symptoms. Low sperm count symptoms might include:   Problems with sexual function — for example, low sex drive or difficulty maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction)  Pain, swelling or a lump in the testicle area  Decreased facial or body hair or other signs of a chromosome or hormone abnormality   When to see a doctor  See a doctor if you have been unable to conceive a child after a year of regular, unprotected intercourse or sooner if you have any of the following:   Erection or ejaculation problems, low sex drive, or other problems with sexual function  Pain, discomfort, a lump or swelling in the testicle area  A history of testicle, prostate or sexual problems  Groin, testicle, penis or scrotum surgery   Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes The production of sperm is a complex process and requires normal functioning of the testicles (testes) as well as the hypothalamus and pituitary glands — organs in your brain that produce hormones that trigger sperm production. Once sperm are produced in the testicles, delicate tubes transport them until they mix with semen and are ejaculated out of the penis. Problems with any of these systems can affect sperm production.  Also, there can be problems of abnormal sperm shape (morphology), movement (motility) or function.  However, often the cause of low sperm count isn't identified.  Medical causes  Low sperm count can be caused by a number of health issues and medical treatments. Some of these include:   Varicocele. A varicocele (VAR-ih-koe-seel) is a swelling of the veins that drain the testicle. It's the most common reversible cause of male infertility. Although the exact reason that varicoceles cause infertility is unknown, it might be related to abnormal testicular temperature regulation. Varicoceles result in reduced quality of the sperm.  Infection. Some infections can interfere with sperm production or sperm health or can cause scarring that blocks the passage of sperm. These include inflammation of the epididymis (epididymitis) or testicles (orchitis) and some sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhea or HIV. Although some infections can result in permanent testicular damage, most often sperm can still be retrieved.   Ejaculation problems. Retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen enters the bladder during orgasm instead of emerging out of the tip of the penis. Various health conditions can cause retrograde or lack of ejaculation, including diabetes, spinal injuries, and surgery of the bladder, prostate or urethra.  Certain medications also might result in ejaculatory problems, such as blood pressure medications known as alpha blockers. Some ejaculatory problems can be reversed, while others are permanent. In most cases of permanent ejaculation problems, sperm can still be retrieved directly from the testicles.   Antibodies that attack sperm. Anti-sperm antibodies are immune system cells that mistakenly identify sperm as harmful invaders and attempt to destroy them.  Tumors. Cancers and nonmalignant tumors can affect the male reproductive organs directly, through the glands that release hormones related to reproduction, such as the pituitary gland, or through unknown causes. Surgery, radiation or chemotherapy to treat tumors can also affect male fertility.  Undescended testicles. During fetal development one or both testicles sometimes fail to descend from the abdomen into the sac that normally contains the testicles (scrotum). Decreased fertility is more likely in men with this condition.  Hormone imbalances. The hypothalamus, pituitary and testicles produce hormones that are necessary to create sperm. Alterations in these hormones, as well as from other systems such as the thyroid and adrenal gland, may impair sperm production.   Defects of tubules that transport sperm. Many different tubes carry sperm. They can be blocked due to various causes, including inadvertent injury from surgery, prior infections, trauma or abnormal development, such as with cystic fibrosis or similar inherited conditions.  Blockage can occur at any level, including within the testicle, in the tubes that drain the testicle, in the epididymis, in the vas deferens, near the ejaculatory ducts or in the urethra.   Chromosome defects. Inherited disorders such as Klinefelter's syndrome — in which a male is born with two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome instead of one X and one Y — cause abnormal development of the male reproductive organs. Other genetic syndromes associated with infertility include cystic fibrosis, Kallmann's syndrome and Kartagener's syndrome.  Celiac disease. A digestive disorder caused by sensitivity to gluten, celiac disease can cause male infertility. Fertility may improve after adopting a gluten-free diet.  Certain medications. Testosterone replacement therapy, long-term anabolic steroid use, cancer medications (chemotherapy), certain antifungal and antibiotic medications, some ulcer medications and other medications can impair sperm production and decrease male fertility.  Prior surgeries. Certain surgeries might prevent you from having sperm in your ejaculate, including vasectomy, inguinal hernia repairs, scrotal or testicular surgeries, prostate surgeries, and large abdominal surgeries performed for testicular and rectal cancers, among others. In most cases, surgery can be performed to either reverse these blockages or to retrieve sperm directly from the epididymis and testicles.   Environmental causes  Sperm production or function can be affected by overexposure to certain environmental elements, including:   Industrial chemicals. Extended exposure to benzenes, toluene, xylene, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, painting materials and lead might contribute to low sperm counts.  Heavy metal exposure. Exposure to lead or other heavy metals also can cause infertility.  Radiation or X-rays. Exposure to radiation can reduce sperm production. It can take several years for sperm production to return to normal. With high doses of radiation, sperm production can be permanently reduced.   Overheating the testicles. Elevated temperatures impair sperm production and function. Although studies are limited and are inconclusive, frequent use of saunas or hot tubs might temporarily impair sperm count.  Sitting for long periods, wearing tight clothing or working on a laptop computer for long stretches of time also might increase the temperature in your scrotum and slightly reduce sperm production.    Health, lifestyle and other causes  Other causes of low sperm count include:   Drug use. Anabolic steroids taken to stimulate muscle strength and growth can cause the testicles to shrink and sperm production to decrease. Use of cocaine or marijuana might reduce the number and quality of your sperm as well.  Alcohol use. Drinking alcohol can lower testosterone levels and cause decreased sperm production.  Occupation. Certain occupations might be linked with a risk of infertility, including welding or those associated with prolonged sitting, such as truck driving. However, the data to support these associations is inconsistent.  Tobacco smoking. Men who smoke might have a lower sperm count than do those who don't smoke.  Emotional stress. Severe or prolonged emotional stress, including stress about fertility, might interfere with hormones needed to produce sperm.  Weight. Obesity can impair fertility in several ways, including directly impacting sperm and by causing hormone changes that reduce male fertility.  Sperm testing issues. Lower than normal sperm counts can result from testing a sperm sample that was taken too soon after your last ejaculation; was taken too soon after an illness or stressful event; or didn't contain all of the semen you ejaculated because some was spilled during collection. For this reason, results are generally based on several samples taken over a period of time.   Risk factors A number of risk factors are linked to low sperm count and other problems that can cause low sperm count. They include:   Smoking tobacco  Drinking alcohol  Using certain illicit drugs  Being overweight  Having certain past or present infections  Being exposed to toxins  Overheating the testicles  Having experienced trauma to the testicles  Being born with a fertility disorder or having a blood relative with a fertility disorder  Having certain medical conditions, including tumors and chronic illnesses  Undergoing cancer treatments, such as radiation  Taking certain medications  Having a prior vasectomy or major abdominal or pelvic surgery  Having a history of undescended testicles   Complications Infertility caused by low sperm count can be stressful for both you and your partner. Complications can include:   Surgery or other treatments for an underlying cause of low sperm count  Expensive and involved assisted reproductive techniques, such as in vitro fertilization  Stress related to the inability to have a child   Prevention To protect your fertility, avoid known factors that can affect sperm count and quality. For example:   Don't smoke.  Limit or abstain from alcohol.  Steer clear of illicit drugs.  Talk to your doctor about medications that can affect sperm count.  Maintain a healthy weight.  Avoid heat.  Manage stress.  Avoid exposure to pesticides, heavy metals and other toxins.

Even if your doctor thinks low sperm count is the problem, it is recommended that your partner be evaluated to rule out potential contributing factors and determine if assisted reproductive techniques may be required.  Testing and diagnosis may involve the following:  General physical examination and medical history  This includes examination of your genitals and asking questions about any inherited conditions, chronic health problems, illnesses, injuries or surgeries that could affect fertility. Your doctor might also ask about your sexual habits and your sexual development.  Semen analysis  A low sperm count is diagnosed as part of a semen analysis test. Sperm count is generally determined by examining semen under a microscope to see how many sperm appear within squares on a grid pattern. In some cases, a computer might be used to measure sperm count.  To collect a semen sample, your doctor will have you masturbate and ejaculate into a special container. It's also possible to collect sperm for examination during intercourse, using a special condom. Because sperm counts often fluctuate, typically several semen analysis tests are done over a period of time to ensure accurate results.  New sperm are produced continually in the testicles and take about 42 to 76 days to mature. So, a current semen analysis reflects your environment over the past three months. Any positive changes you've made won't show up for several months.  One of the most common causes of low sperm count is incomplete or improper collection of a sperm sample. Most doctors will check two or more semen samples over time to ensure consistency between samples. To ensure accuracy in a collection, your doctor will:   Ask you to make sure all of your semen makes it into the collection cup or collection condom when you ejaculate  Have you abstain from ejaculating for 2 to 7 days before collecting a sample  Collect a second sample at least one to two weeks after the first  Have you avoid the use of lubricants because these products can affect sperm motility   Semen analysis results  Normal sperm densities range from 15 million to greater than 200 million sperm per milliliter of semen. You are considered to have a low sperm count if you have fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter or less than 39 million sperm total per ejaculate.  Your chance of getting your partner pregnant decreases with decreasing sperm counts. Some men have no sperm in their semen at all. This is known as azoospermia (ay-zoh-uh-SPUR-me-uh).  There are many factors involved in reproduction, and the number of sperm in your semen is only one. Some men with low sperm counts successfully father children. Likewise, some men with normal sperm counts are unable to father children. Even if you have enough sperm, other factors are important to achieve a pregnancy, including normal sperm movement (motility).  Other tests  Depending on initial findings, your doctor might recommend additional tests to look for the cause of your low sperm count and other possible causes of male infertility. These can include:   Scrotal ultrasound. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to look at the testicles and supporting structures.  Hormone testing. Your doctor might recommend a blood test to determine the level of hormones produced by the pituitary gland and testicles, which play a key role in sexual development and sperm production.  Post-ejaculation urinalysis. Sperm in your urine can indicate your sperm are traveling backward into the bladder instead of out your penis during ejaculation (retrograde ejaculation).  Genetic tests. When sperm concentration is extremely low, genetic causes could be involved. A blood test can reveal whether there are subtle changes in the Y chromosome — signs of a genetic abnormality. Genetic testing might also be ordered to diagnose various congenital or inherited syndromes.  Testicular biopsy. This test involves removing samples from the testicle with a needle. The results of the testicular biopsy can tell if sperm production is normal. If it is, your problem is likely caused by a blockage or another problem with sperm transport. However, this test is typically only used in certain situations and is not commonly used to diagnose the cause of infertility.  Anti-sperm antibody tests. These tests, which are used to check for immune cells (antibodies) that attack sperm and affect their ability to function, are not common.  Specialized sperm function tests. A number of tests can be used to check how well your sperm survive after ejaculation, how well they can penetrate an egg and whether there's any problem attaching to the egg. Generally, these tests are rarely performed and often do not significantly change treatment recommendations.  Transrectal ultrasound. A small lubricated wand is inserted into your rectum to check your prostate, and for blockages of the tubes that carry semen (ejaculatory ducts and seminal vesicles).   Treatment Treatments for low sperm count include:   Surgery. For example, a varicocele can often be surgically corrected or an obstructed vas deferens repaired. Prior vasectomies can be reversed. In cases where no sperm are present in the ejaculate, sperm can often be retrieved directly from the testicles or epididymis using sperm retrieval techniques.  Treating infections. Antibiotics can cure an infection of the reproductive tract, but this doesn't always restore fertility.  Treatments for sexual intercourse problems. Medication or counseling can help improve fertility in conditions such as erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation.  Hormone treatments and medications. Your doctor might recommend hormone replacement or medications in cases where infertility is caused by high or low levels of certain hormones or problems with the way the body uses hormones.  Assisted reproductive technology (ART). ART treatments involve obtaining sperm through normal ejaculation, surgical extraction or from donor individuals, depending on your specific case and wishes. The sperm are then inserted into the female genital tract, or used for in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection.   When treatment doesn't work  In rare cases, male fertility problems can't be treated, and it's impossible for a man to father a child. If this is the case, you and your partner can consider either using sperm from a donor or adopting a child.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Lifestyle and home remedies There are steps you can take at home to increase your chances of getting your partner pregnant, including:   Increasing the frequency of sex. Having sexual intercourse every day or every other day beginning at least four days before ovulation increases your chances of getting your partner pregnant.  Having sex when fertilization is possible. A woman is likely to become pregnant during ovulation — which occurs in the middle of the menstrual cycle, between periods. This will ensure that sperm, which can live several days, are present when conception is possible.  Avoiding lubricants. Some products such as Astroglide or K-Y jelly, lotions, and saliva might impair sperm movement and function. Ask your doctor about sperm-safe lubricants.   Alternative medicine Evidence is still limited on whether — or how much — herbs or supplements might help increase male fertility. None of these supplements treats a specific underlying cause of infertility, such as a sperm duct defect or chromosomal disorder. Some supplements might help only if you have a deficiency.  Supplements with studies showing potential benefits on improving sperm count or quality include:   Alpha-lipoic acid  Anthocyanins  L-arginine  Astaxanthin  Beta-carotene  Biotin  L-acetyl carnitine  L-carnitine  Cobalamin  Co-enzyme Q10  Ethylcysteine  Folic acid  Glutathione  Inositol  Lycopene  Magnesium  N-acetyl cysteine  Pentoxifylline  Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors  Polyunsaturated fatty acids  Selenium  Vitamins A, C, D and E  Zinc   Talk with your doctor before taking dietary supplements to review the risks and benefits of this therapy. Taking some supplements in high doses (megadoses) or for extended periods of time might be harmful.  Preparing for your appointment You should start with your family doctor or a general practitioner. However, he or she might refer you to an infertility specialist.  Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment, and what to expect from your doctor.  What you can do   Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. At the time you make the appointment ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as refraining from ejaculating for a certain period of time or stopping certain medications.  Write down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that might seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.  Write down key personal information, including any major stresses or recent life changes.  Find out whether you have a family history of fertility problems. Having a male blood relative, such as your brother or father, with fertility problems or other reproductive issues might give clues to the cause of low sperm count.  Find out from your parents if you had undescended testes or other issues at birth or in early childhood.  Make a list of all medications, vitamins and supplements that you're taking.  Take your partner along. Even if you have a low sperm count, your partner also might need tests to see whether she has any problems that could be preventing pregnancy. It's also good to have your partner along to help keep track of any instructions your doctor gives you or to ask questions you may not think of.  Write down questions to ask your doctor.   Some basic questions to ask your doctor include:   What do you suspect might be causing my low sperm count?  Other than the most likely cause, what are other possible reasons my partner and I haven't been able to conceive a child?  What kinds of tests do I need?  Will my partner also need tests?  What treatments are available to increase my sperm count? Which do you recommend?  Are there any restrictions that I need to follow?  At what point should we consider other alternatives, such as a sperm donor or adoption?  Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend visiting?   Don't hesitate to ask additional questions during your appointment.  What to expect from your doctor  Some questions your doctor may ask you include:   At what age did you start puberty?  Have you had a vasectomy or a vasectomy reversal?  Do you use illicit drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine or anabolic steroids?  Have you been exposed to toxins such as chemicals, pesticides, radiation or lead, especially on a regular basis?  Are you currently taking any medications, including dietary supplements?  Do you have a history of undescended testicles?

The good news is that low sperm count does not necessarily prevent pregnancy from occurring and there is a lot you can do to improve your chances of getting pregnant.  Click here to read couples’ success stories of conceiving with low sperm count.  In this article:   Low sperm count – what is it?  What is a ‘normal’ sperm count?  Low sperm count – how low is too low?  Low sperm count – boosting your chances of pregnancy Low sperm count – what is it? Low sperm count means that the number of sperm in a man’s semen is below the threshold of what is considered normal. Sperm motility (their ability to move) and sperm morphology (their form or shape) may also be affected. Sperm count is determined through a test called a semen analysis.  It is usually the first test your doctor will request (after taking your clinical history and possibly carrying out a physical exam). Semen refers to the fluid that is released from the penis when a man ejaculates. It is made up of fluids from several glands (mainly the prostate and seminal vesicles) and sperm. Surprisingly, sperm make up only 5% of the total semen volume! A semen analysis evaluates the quality and quantity of both the sperm and the semen.  A basic semen analysis can be ordered by your family doctor and this is usually carried out through your local pathology laboratory. If further investigation is required, a more in depth analysis can be carried out at a fertility clinic. What is a ‘normal’ sperm count? The semen parameters that are usually tested during a semen analysis are listed below, along with the values that are considered ‘normal’. Macroscopic:    Semen Parameter  Normal* Values    Ejaculate Volume (ml)  > 1.5    pH  ≥ 7.2    Viscosity  Normal    Liquefaction  <60 minutes    Microscopic:    Semen Parameter  Normal* Values    Sperm Count (million)  > 39    Sperm Concentration (million/ml)  > 15    Total Sperm Motility (%)  > 40    Progressive Sperm Motility (%)  > 32    Morphology (%)  > 4    Vitality (%)  > 58    Agglutination  Absent    White blood cells (million/ml)  < 1    * These ‘normal values’ reflect the lower reference limit adopted by the 5th edition of the WHO Laboratory manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen (ie. 5th percentile lower reference limit obtained from a population of approximately 2000 fertile men whose partners had a time-to-pregnancy of 12 months or less). It’s important to remember, that there can be wide fluctuations in these values from day to day, so it is important to get 2-3 samples tested before a low sperm count is diagnosed. Low sperm count – how low is too low? Sperm counts vary considerably between individuals and unfortunately its impossible to say for certain whether or not a particular sperm count will assure fertility or infertility. If however, there is a complete absence of sperm in the semen (a condition known as azoospermia), natural conception will be impossible and this will require investigation through a fertility clinic. The quality of  sperm is often more important than the quantity . For example, small numbers of excellent quality sperm may provide a better chance of conception than large numbers of poor quality sperm. In the Fertility Focus clinic, we have seen couples conceive naturally with a sperm count as low as 2 – 5 million per ml and research has shown that even in cases where sperm count is less than 2 million/ml, there is still a chance of natural conception. Low sperm count – boosting your chances of pregnancy There are many things you can do to improve sperm quality and boost fertility: Learn fertility awareness Learning the fertility awareness method to determine your most fertile day or days as a couple each cycle, is key to enhancing your chances of conception. Cervical fluid produced by the female partner is absolutely critical for sperm transport and survival. Timing intercourse for the day(s) that the best quality cervical fluid is produced, will give sperm their greatest chance of survival and being able to swim towards the egg (1) (2) .  Timing intercourse for these peak fertile days has also been shown to minimise the effect of lowered fertility due to male age (3) . The Fast Track to Pregnancy Program™ teaches you step by step,  how to use the empowering skills of fertility awareness and fertility charting to optimise your chances of conception with low sperm count. Don’t ‘save up’ sperm Contrary to popular belief, in the case of low sperm count, it is NOT advisable to abstain from intercourse for extended periods, to build up sperm numbers. While it’s true that abstaining will increase semen volume and the number of sperm, research has revealed that in men with low sperm count and quality, FREQUENT ejaculation has a significant benefit, improving sperm motility and sperm morphology, while reducing levels of DNA fragmentation. (4) (5) In Step 3 of the Fast Track to Pregnancy Program™ , you’ll learn the ‘Ultimate Sex Timing Strategy’  which discusses in detail how to time intercourse to optimise your chances of  getting pregnant with low sperm count. Make lifestyle changes A significant cause of male infertility is something called ‘free radical damage’. Free radicals are toxic metabolites produced by normal processes in our bodies.  However, they are also produced through exposure to certain environmental factors.  These highly reactive molecules damage cells, and an excess of free radicals in semen is also responsible for damaging sperm, which can lead to infertility and miscarriage. Excess free radicals can be caused by poor diet, tobacco and alcohol consumption, illness and stress. They can also be caused by exposure to pollutants and chemicals in the environment. Below are some tips on what you can do to fight free radical damage and improve the health of your sperm: 7 Tips to Improve Your Sperm 1. Eat a diet high in antioxidants . Antioxidants help to ‘mop up’ free radicals, reducing the amount of damage to sperm. Foods high in antioxidants include berries, fruit and vegetables (particularly those that are brightly coloured), nuts and seeds, cereals and dark chocolate. 2. Take a targeted multivitamin . If you have reduced sperm count or sperm quality, a specially formulated fertility multivitamin may help. The key vitamins and minerals that are important for healthy sperm production are: Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Zinc, Selenium, Folic Acid, L-Carnitine, CoQ10 and Glutathione. 3. Ditch the cigarettes! Smoking causes free radical damage to sperm DNA and lowers sperm quality. Men who smoke are four times as likely to have children who develop childhood cancer. Smoking marijuana is also thought to affect sperm health. Remember, it takes about 72 days for sperm to fully form, so even after you cease smoking, it may take several months for the effects to be reversed. 4. Reduce alcohol intake .  Alcohol is a testicular toxin and affects sperm production and sexual function in men. Research suggests that alcohol should be limited to 5 standard drinks or less a week (one standard drink equates to a 330ml can or bottle of beer, a 100ml glass of wine or 30ml of straight spirits).  Check out this blog article for more information. 5. Avoid hot baths and spas . Heat is bad for sperm production (that is why the testicles hang outside the body!). You may like to try wearing boxers instead of tight underpants. 6. Maintain a healthy BMI . Being overweight can reduce sperm count, particularly if excess fat leads to an increased temperature around the testicles. Keeping BMI within a normal range is advisable. 7. Avoid environmental toxins and pollutants . Organic solvents, pesticides, lead, toxic fumes, phthalates and other chemicals are suspected in lowering male fertility, so it is advisable to reduce exposure to these toxins where possible and wear protective clothing when necessary.

Did you know that 30 percent of infertility is related to problems with the male partner?  Male factor infertility is diagnosed by finding a low sperm count on a semen analysis.  Millions of sperm have to be produced by the man’s testicles and delivered to the woman’s body in order for just one lucky sperm to fertilize an egg. So, what does it mean if your partner has a low sperm count? Can you still get pregnant?  Why He Needs So Many When a man ejaculates, typically some 250 million sperm are released.  To cause conception, a sperm cell has to swim all the way up from the vagina, through the cervix and uterus and into your fallopian tube to reach an egg which has been ovulated.  Of those millions of sperm, only hundreds will make it up to the fallopian tubes. All of those sperm release an enzyme which helps clear the way to the egg.  If all goes well, one sperm will swim up that pathway and fertilize the egg. The fertilized egg will move down the fallopian tube and travel to the uterus, where it can implant and grow.  Semen analysis is the first test a man will take when getting evaluated for fertility problems. It involves testing a sample of a man’s semen to estimate how many sperm there are (total count), what percentage of the sperm are moving (motility) and if they have a normal shape (morphology), according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). Concentration of sperm per milliliter of semen is one of the measures.  Total sperm count multiplies the concentration by the volume of semen in the sample.  A man’s sperm count varies from day to day.  While his testicles are semen-producing machines, anything from having a fever to taking a new medicine can reduce his sperm count temporarily.  It’s best if he is feeling well, hasn’t had any recent changes in diet or medication, and hasn’t been exposed to heat when he goes to the lab to give a sperm sample, so the results will be more typical.  Your reproductive endocrinologist will tell him how long to abstain from sex before giving the sample.  That lets the testicles accumulate a good amount of sperm for the sample.  Typically, men are told to abstain for no less than two days and no more than seven.  If the test results show a low sperm count, a man may be asked to repeat the test, just to make sure it wasn’t an off day for his testicles.  Trying to Conceive with a Low Sperm Count Low sperm count doesn’t mean you can’t get pregnant. If his sperm are healthy and moving well, it may just take more attempts to conceive, which means more time. Common causes of low sperm count include abnormal hormonal secretion, the presence of a swollen vein around the testicle called a varicocele, or problems with the testicle’s ability to make sperm. There are lifestyle factors which contribute to low sperm count, such as smoking and obesity. If you are younger than 35 and neither of you have other fertility issues, making lifestyle changes may help raise his sperm count.  If the sperm counts are very low or there are other factors, such as abnormalities in the shape of his sperm or low motility, or if you have fertility issues as well, IVF with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may be a fertility treatment to consider. IVF with ICSI allows an egg to be fertilized by a single sperm in the lab.  The embryologist can select the healthiest sperm to inject  into the egg in order to fertilize it.  If you’re under 35 and have been trying to conceive for a year or more, or you’re 35 or older and have been trying for six months without success, it’s time to consult a fertility specialist. Reproductive endocrinologists are the experts in treating infertility and will develop a plan to maximize your chances of having a baby.  Need Help?

Hello all, I would really like to seek help and advise to seek ways on getting pregnant. My doctor told me that I, (the wife) have normal uterus and ovulation, but my husband has very low sperm count. If 80 million was average, my husband has less than 2 million. We have been trying for 3 years now and we have been praying long for a blessing. Please help us out. Is Invitro the only option?

My husband was told he had low sperm count (2 million) and basically low in everything else too. We decided to get prayed for at church and started to pray together as a couple which was sometimes a little awkward cause we had never done this before with one another. My husband was very calm about the whole thing and just kept reminding me that God would make it happen. In conjunctions with praying, we did get the fertile aid pills and within a month of taking them I got pregnant. I think the pills helped but honestly I think you should pray with your husband and proclaim out loud that your husband is healed. This may sound funny but I did this everyday and it worked. I truly believe my husband is healed and we will never have to go through this again. I&#39;ll pray for you tonight! God bless!           a BabyCenter member   Answered 7/17/16               9 found this helpful     Hi everyone hope we are all well. I am 23 and my husband is 28. We&#39;ve been trying to get pregnant for nearly 2 years but no success. We went to get some tests done and everything with me is fine but we found out my husbands sperm count is very low and the quality isn&#39;t that great either. We are on the waiting list for IVF with ICSI. I know I am young but the fact that I know now it&#39;s my husbands sperm that is not great I feel I want to have one now rather than later where more problems may occurs. I asked the doctor if there is anything we can do apart from going straight to IVF but she didn&#39;t really answer the question clearly. Does anyone know of anything my husband can do or take to help his sperm? He works in HSBC so he is always wearing suit trousers which are tight near the middle and also he sits down a lot but there&#39;s nothing we can really do about that. But please let me know if there is anything else we can try.

My husband and I have been married for almost 2 years. We started TTC almost immedietly after we got married. After unsuccessful attempts we sought medical advise. We both went through testings. For myself they checked the age of my ovaries(im 29 years old), i had and hsg test done (to check for blockage in the fallopian tubes) and a lot of blood work to check hormones and etc. All of my tests can back normal. My husband on the other hand has less than 20,000 sperm present. our chances of getting pregnant are less than 1% naturally. Our only hope is to do IVF with ICSI to have a biological child. We live in florida were that type of treatment is not covered under insurance. I am all for trying the IVF, i would do anything i could to have a baby with my husband, i am just scared of it not working which will completely devastate me :( .....

After all, it only takes one to fertilize an egg.  Tags: Fertility Health , Trying to Conceive      By Ann Douglas   Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter    Comments   shutterstock FACT: Men need more than one sperm—lots, lots more than one—to fertilize an egg after intercourse. In a typical ejaculate (about a teaspoon), 250 million sperm are released. But of those 250 million, only hundreds make it as far as the fallopian tubes. Functioning as a kind of synchronized sports team, most of the sperm release an enzyme that helps clear the pathway to the egg so that one sperm can penetrate it. While there’s no magic number when it comes to sperm counts, 20 million or more sperm per milliliter of ejaculate is the benchmark that most physicians consider “normal.” But a sperm count below that number doesn’t have to be devastating. “It may just mean that the time to conception will be longer,” explains Steven M. Schrader, Ph.D., lead of the reproductive health assessment team of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Sperm count isn’t the only measure of reproductive success . Male fertility also depends in part on sperm morphology (shape) and sperm motility (movement). While couples always want to know which of these three sperm measures matters most—count, morphology or motility—giving a single factor star billing doesn’t make any sense at all. Says Schrader, “It’s like asking what part of your car is most important. Maybe you think it would be the engine, but just try to get somewhere without the tires. And what about the steering wheel?” The good news is that assisted reproductive technologies—and especially intracytoplasmic sperm injection, in which a single sperm is injected into an egg—can give sperm a boost when a sperm analysis has identified a problem in one of the three key areas. Today, fertilization may be possible with even the worst semen analysis results.      comments        Parenting Books Bath Toys Video Games Potty Training Supplies Toddler Beds Bedroom Sets Security Cameras Board Games Teen Bedding Kids Clothes Desks Rugs TVs Kids Bikes Childrens Vitamins Birthday Party Decorations Kids Backpacks Activity Trackers Playroom Furniture Laptops Bookcases Shower Curtains Teen Clothing Toddler Clothes  Connect with us  Your Account Log In Join Now Customer Service Data Policy Help Update Your Account Member Benefits Newsletter Parenting.com Maternity Clothes Strollers Car Seats Feeding & Nursing Toys & Activities Shop Sitemap Shop Sitemap Parents Network Parents Parenting Family Circle Ser Padres Fit Pregnancy © Copyright 2018, Meredith Corporation .

What constitutes a low sperm count? Detecting a low sperm count can be relatively easy to do.  You simply need to provide a fresh specimen of semen (obtained through masturbation).  The semen is looked at under the microscope to see whether or not there are enough sperm in the sample. A normal sperm count has a wide range.  It is believed that a normal sperm count is somewhere between 40 million and 300 million sperm per ml of semen.  Those semen samples that have less than 20 million sperm per ml are said to have a low sperm count. Counts between 20 million and 40 million sperm per ml probably have a harder time with fertilizing an egg successfully but are borderline as to actually being considered to be a low sperm count.  It doesn’t mean that the man is infertile but that it may take longer to fertilize the egg and a longer time before achieving a pregnancy.  Diagnosing a Low Sperm Count When the man gives a specimen of his semen and it is determined that the sperm count is less than 20 million sperm per ml semen, this can be disheartening.  It can negatively impact is self-esteem and can decrease libido because the man doesn’t feel as though he can do his part in the conception of a pregnancy. If you have been diagnosed with a low sperm count, you need to discuss this openly with your sexual partner so that together you can find ways of overcoming this fertility problem, whether you do this by having sex more often during peak fertility times or decide to engage in some fertility treatments, such as intrauterine sperm insemination. Natural Ways of Improving Fertility with a Low Sperm Count You can try to enhance your fertility by not having too much sex or by not having too little sex. It turns out that too much sex can deplete the storage of sperm so that the sperm count will be even lower if you have sex too much.  Having sex about every 2 to 3 days is about the right frequency of intercourse to have the maximum number of sperm in the ejaculate when trying to have a baby. Of course, you need to time your sex to be in the window of time when the woman is the most fertile.  Women with regular 28-day cycles will ovulate on about the 14 th day of the cycle and you should plan to have sex every other day from about the 9 th to the 15 th day of the menstrual cycle for the maximum chances of conceiving a child. Another natural way of improving fertility is to make sure that the testicles are at the right temperature.  There is a reason why the testicles are outside the body.  It’s because sperm are more effectively made at a lower body temperature than the normal core body temperature.  Men with low sperm counts should avoid wearing underwear that is too tight and should instead wear boxer shorts that allow the temperature of the sperm to be lower. Men should also avoid exposure to saunas and hot tubs that can raise the testicular temperature, effectively decreasing the sperm count.  An occasional sauna or hut tub exposure is probably okay but regular use by men with low sperm counts can greatly affect fertility. A man with a low sperm count should eat a healthy diet and should drink plenty of water.  You need these things in order to have a decent sperm count.  In a sperm-enhancing diet, you should be eating foods that have high-quality fat and plenty of protein to make sperm cells.  The diet should be as low in junk food and sugar as possible. Exercise can also enhance male fertility.  The exercise should be no more than moderate, as excessive or extreme exercise can negatively impact the semen production.  Wearing tight clothing during exercise will increase the temperature of the testicles and will drive down the sperm count. Sperm counts can also be affected by the man’s intake of alcohol, cigarettes, and street drugs.  You should stay away from all of these things in order to have sperm that are not only healthy but are of a sufficient quantity in the semen. There are some herbal remedies out there that are believed to enhance fertility in men who have low sperm counts.  Much of the research proving this to be the case is lacking, however, but most of these supplements won’t hurt you and some of them might just be beneficial in helping you to conceive a child. Medical Ways of Treating a Low Sperm Count If all of the natural ways of improving the sperm count have been tried and the couple still can’t conceive a child, the doctor can step in and use medical ways of improving fertility.  One method is intrauterine insemination or IUI.  This involves getting a sampling of the semen, washing the sperm, and then inserting the sperm cells directly into the uterus through a catheter inserted through the cervix. Another medical way to improve fertility in situations of low sperm count include in vitro fertilization or IVF.  In this procedure, the sperm and eggs come together in a petri dish.  When the eggs become fertilized, they are implanted as embryos inside the woman’s uterus, so that the eggs are already fertilized by the time they reach the uterine environment. The Bottom Line The basic fact of the matter is that, even though it just takes one sperm to fertilize an egg, it takes millions of sperm to increase the odds of having that one sperm to get to the right place in order to create an embryo.  Of the 200 million per ml or so of sperm that are in the ejaculate, only a few hundred sperm actually make it too the fallopian tubes.  A healthy sperm cell will release an enzyme that helps the swimming process so the sperm can better reach and penetrate the egg. Men who have sperm counts of less than 20 million per ml are not considered completely infertile.  In most cases, it simply means that it will take longer, and may take some more finesse and planning in order for the couple to conceive a healthy child.  If natural ways of sperm enhancement fail, there are at least two effective medical ways of enhancing fertility that can greatly increase the chances that a normal pregnancy can be achieved.

Infertility affects 15 percent of healthy couples, and of those cases, males are the cause 40 percent of the time. Low sperm count is the cause for one-third of male infertility cases. The lower your sperm count, the lower your chances of fertilizing your partner’s eggs.  Causes Of Low Sperm Count   Low sperm count can be caused by numerous factors. Some of the most common causes are:   Damaged Ducts  Low Production  Varicocele  Antibodies  Other factors   If you are suffering from damaged ducts , blunt force trauma or an infection may have caused significant damage to your sperm ducts. Your testicles are connected to the penis by these sperm ducts. Surgical procedures can also lead to damaged ducts.  Alternatively, you may suffer from low sperm count because you are unable to produce large amounts of sperm. This may occur because of a genetic disorder or you may have issues with your organs or glands. For instance, you could have issues creating sperm in your testicles if you have problems with your purity glands.  Varicocele causes a low sperm count because of swollen veins. If you suffer from varicocele, you are unable to produce sperm due to a vein inside of your scrotum that has become swollen. The good news is that this cause can typically be corrected through minor surgery.  Antibodies fight off diseases, but some can cause you to have a low sperm count. These specific antibodies are known as “anti-sperm antibodies.” They mistake sperm as harmful invaders, and destroy the sperm before it has a chance to exit your body.  Lifestyle Choices  There are some self-inflicted causes of low sperm count. The type of lifestyle you live will play an important role in your chances of reproducing. If you use drugs and alcohol, or encounter a great deal of stress, your sperm count can be lowered. Studies show that men who do not smoke or use tobacco products have a higher sperm count than those who do. Stay away from stressful situations, both at work and home, because the hormones you need to produce sperm can be affected. You should maintain a healthy weight. Obesity has been known to reduce male fertility because of hormone changes; therefore, maintaining a good diet and exercising regularly is important. Here is a complete list of infertility causes .  Treatment  Although some low-sperm count cases cannot be treated, others can. There are medications that you can take that will improve your sperm count. Men who use Clomiphene have the ability to improve their sperm’s production and motility. You can take human chorionic gonadotriptin to boost your sperm production, as well as your testosterone levels. Always consult with a doctor or specialist before taking medications to improve your sperm count. A specialist can explain the positive and negatives, such as conception statistics and side effects.  If you have a low sperm count that does not prevent you from conceiving a child, but your chances at conception can be affected. If you are unsuccessful, there are other options available for you, such as In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), or sperm donors. A specialist will go over all of your options with you.

A low sperm count is also called oligospermia (ol-ih-go-SPUR-me-uh). A complete absence of sperm is called azoospermia. Your sperm count is considered lower than normal if you have fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen.  Having a low sperm count decreases the odds that one of your sperm will fertilize your partner's egg, resulting in pregnancy. Nonetheless, many men who have a low sperm count are still able to father a child.      Symptoms The main sign of low sperm count is the inability to conceive a child. There might be no other obvious signs or symptoms. In some cases, an underlying problem such as an inherited chromosomal abnormality, a hormonal imbalance, dilated testicular veins or a condition that blocks the passage of sperm may cause signs and symptoms. Low sperm count symptoms might include:   Problems with sexual function — for example, low sex drive or difficulty maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction)  Pain, swelling or a lump in the testicle area  Decreased facial or body hair or other signs of a chromosome or hormone abnormality   When to see a doctor  See a doctor if you have been unable to conceive a child after a year of regular, unprotected intercourse or sooner if you have any of the following:   Erection or ejaculation problems, low sex drive, or other problems with sexual function  Pain, discomfort, a lump or swelling in the testicle area  A history of testicle, prostate or sexual problems  Groin, testicle, penis or scrotum surgery   Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes The production of sperm is a complex process and requires normal functioning of the testicles (testes) as well as the hypothalamus and pituitary glands — organs in your brain that produce hormones that trigger sperm production. Once sperm are produced in the testicles, delicate tubes transport them until they mix with semen and are ejaculated out of the penis. Problems with any of these systems can affect sperm production.  Also, there can be problems of abnormal sperm shape (morphology), movement (motility) or function.  However, often the cause of low sperm count isn't identified.  Medical causes  Low sperm count can be caused by a number of health issues and medical treatments. Some of these include:   Varicocele. A varicocele (VAR-ih-koe-seel) is a swelling of the veins that drain the testicle. It's the most common reversible cause of male infertility. Although the exact reason that varicoceles cause infertility is unknown, it might be related to abnormal testicular temperature regulation. Varicoceles result in reduced quality of the sperm.  Infection. Some infections can interfere with sperm production or sperm health or can cause scarring that blocks the passage of sperm. These include inflammation of the epididymis (epididymitis) or testicles (orchitis) and some sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhea or HIV. Although some infections can result in permanent testicular damage, most often sperm can still be retrieved.   Ejaculation problems. Retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen enters the bladder during orgasm instead of emerging out of the tip of the penis. Various health conditions can cause retrograde or lack of ejaculation, including diabetes, spinal injuries, and surgery of the bladder, prostate or urethra.  Certain medications also might result in ejaculatory problems, such as blood pressure medications known as alpha blockers. Some ejaculatory problems can be reversed, while others are permanent. In most cases of permanent ejaculation problems, sperm can still be retrieved directly from the testicles.   Antibodies that attack sperm. Anti-sperm antibodies are immune system cells that mistakenly identify sperm as harmful invaders and attempt to destroy them.  Tumors. Cancers and nonmalignant tumors can affect the male reproductive organs directly, through the glands that release hormones related to reproduction, such as the pituitary gland, or through unknown causes. Surgery, radiation or chemotherapy to treat tumors can also affect male fertility.  Undescended testicles. During fetal development one or both testicles sometimes fail to descend from the abdomen into the sac that normally contains the testicles (scrotum). Decreased fertility is more likely in men with this condition.  Hormone imbalances. The hypothalamus, pituitary and testicles produce hormones that are necessary to create sperm. Alterations in these hormones, as well as from other systems such as the thyroid and adrenal gland, may impair sperm production.   Defects of tubules that transport sperm. Many different tubes carry sperm. They can be blocked due to various causes, including inadvertent injury from surgery, prior infections, trauma or abnormal development, such as with cystic fibrosis or similar inherited conditions.  Blockage can occur at any level, including within the testicle, in the tubes that drain the testicle, in the epididymis, in the vas deferens, near the ejaculatory ducts or in the urethra.   Chromosome defects. Inherited disorders such as Klinefelter's syndrome — in which a male is born with two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome instead of one X and one Y — cause abnormal development of the male reproductive organs. Other genetic syndromes associated with infertility include cystic fibrosis, Kallmann's syndrome and Kartagener's syndrome.  Celiac disease. A digestive disorder caused by sensitivity to gluten, celiac disease can cause male infertility. Fertility may improve after adopting a gluten-free diet.  Certain medications. Testosterone replacement therapy, long-term anabolic steroid use, cancer medications (chemotherapy), certain antifungal and antibiotic medications, some ulcer medications and other medications can impair sperm production and decrease male fertility.  Prior surgeries. Certain surgeries might prevent you from having sperm in your ejaculate, including vasectomy, inguinal hernia repairs, scrotal or testicular surgeries, prostate surgeries, and large abdominal surgeries performed for testicular and rectal cancers, among others. In most cases, surgery can be performed to either reverse these blockages or to retrieve sperm directly from the epididymis and testicles.   Environmental causes  Sperm production or function can be affected by overexposure to certain environmental elements, including:   Industrial chemicals. Extended exposure to benzenes, toluene, xylene, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, painting materials and lead might contribute to low sperm counts.  Heavy metal exposure. Exposure to lead or other heavy metals also can cause infertility.  Radiation or X-rays. Exposure to radiation can reduce sperm production. It can take several years for sperm production to return to normal. With high doses of radiation, sperm production can be permanently reduced.   Overheating the testicles. Elevated temperatures impair sperm production and function. Although studies are limited and are inconclusive, frequent use of saunas or hot tubs might temporarily impair sperm count.  Sitting for long periods, wearing tight clothing or working on a laptop computer for long stretches of time also might increase the temperature in your scrotum and slightly reduce sperm production.    Health, lifestyle and other causes  Other causes of low sperm count include:   Drug use. Anabolic steroids taken to stimulate muscle strength and growth can cause the testicles to shrink and sperm production to decrease. Use of cocaine or marijuana might reduce the number and quality of your sperm as well.  Alcohol use. Drinking alcohol can lower testosterone levels and cause decreased sperm production.  Occupation. Certain occupations might be linked with a risk of infertility, including welding or those associated with prolonged sitting, such as truck driving. However, the data to support these associations is inconsistent.  Tobacco smoking. Men who smoke might have a lower sperm count than do those who don't smoke.  Emotional stress. Severe or prolonged emotional stress, including stress about fertility, might interfere with hormones needed to produce sperm.  Weight. Obesity can impair fertility in several ways, including directly impacting sperm and by causing hormone changes that reduce male fertility.  Sperm testing issues. Lower than normal sperm counts can result from testing a sperm sample that was taken too soon after your last ejaculation; was taken too soon after an illness or stressful event; or didn't contain all of the semen you ejaculated because some was spilled during collection. For this reason, results are generally based on several samples taken over a period of time.   Risk factors A number of risk factors are linked to low sperm count and other problems that can cause low sperm count. They include:   Smoking tobacco  Drinking alcohol  Using certain illicit drugs  Being overweight  Having certain past or present infections  Being exposed to toxins  Overheating the testicles  Having experienced trauma to the testicles  Being born with a fertility disorder or having a blood relative with a fertility disorder  Having certain medical conditions, including tumors and chronic illnesses  Undergoing cancer treatments, such as radiation  Taking certain medications  Having a prior vasectomy or major abdominal or pelvic surgery  Having a history of undescended testicles   Complications Infertility caused by low sperm count can be stressful for both you and your partner. Complications can include:   Surgery or other treatments for an underlying cause of low sperm count  Expensive and involved assisted reproductive techniques, such as in vitro fertilization  Stress related to the inability to have a child   Prevention To protect your fertility, avoid known factors that can affect sperm count and quality. For example:   Don't smoke.  Limit or abstain from alcohol.  Steer clear of illicit drugs.  Talk to your doctor about medications that can affect sperm count.  Maintain a healthy weight.  Avoid heat.  Manage stress.  Avoid exposure to pesticides, heavy metals and other toxins.

Even if your doctor thinks low sperm count is the problem, it is recommended that your partner be evaluated to rule out potential contributing factors and determine if assisted reproductive techniques may be required.  Testing and diagnosis may involve the following:  General physical examination and medical history  This includes examination of your genitals and asking questions about any inherited conditions, chronic health problems, illnesses, injuries or surgeries that could affect fertility. Your doctor might also ask about your sexual habits and your sexual development.  Semen analysis  A low sperm count is diagnosed as part of a semen analysis test. Sperm count is generally determined by examining semen under a microscope to see how many sperm appear within squares on a grid pattern. In some cases, a computer might be used to measure sperm count.  To collect a semen sample, your doctor will have you masturbate and ejaculate into a special container. It's also possible to collect sperm for examination during intercourse, using a special condom. Because sperm counts often fluctuate, typically several semen analysis tests are done over a period of time to ensure accurate results.  New sperm are produced continually in the testicles and take about 42 to 76 days to mature. So, a current semen analysis reflects your environment over the past three months. Any positive changes you've made won't show up for several months.  One of the most common causes of low sperm count is incomplete or improper collection of a sperm sample. Most doctors will check two or more semen samples over time to ensure consistency between samples. To ensure accuracy in a collection, your doctor will:   Ask you to make sure all of your semen makes it into the collection cup or collection condom when you ejaculate  Have you abstain from ejaculating for 2 to 7 days before collecting a sample  Collect a second sample at least one to two weeks after the first  Have you avoid the use of lubricants because these products can affect sperm motility   Semen analysis results  Normal sperm densities range from 15 million to greater than 200 million sperm per milliliter of semen. You are considered to have a low sperm count if you have fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter or less than 39 million sperm total per ejaculate.  Your chance of getting your partner pregnant decreases with decreasing sperm counts. Some men have no sperm in their semen at all. This is known as azoospermia (ay-zoh-uh-SPUR-me-uh).  There are many factors involved in reproduction, and the number of sperm in your semen is only one. Some men with low sperm counts successfully father children. Likewise, some men with normal sperm counts are unable to father children. Even if you have enough sperm, other factors are important to achieve a pregnancy, including normal sperm movement (motility).  Other tests  Depending on initial findings, your doctor might recommend additional tests to look for the cause of your low sperm count and other possible causes of male infertility. These can include:   Scrotal ultrasound. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to look at the testicles and supporting structures.  Hormone testing. Your doctor might recommend a blood test to determine the level of hormones produced by the pituitary gland and testicles, which play a key role in sexual development and sperm production.  Post-ejaculation urinalysis. Sperm in your urine can indicate your sperm are traveling backward into the bladder instead of out your penis during ejaculation (retrograde ejaculation).  Genetic tests. When sperm concentration is extremely low, genetic causes could be involved. A blood test can reveal whether there are subtle changes in the Y chromosome — signs of a genetic abnormality. Genetic testing might also be ordered to diagnose various congenital or inherited syndromes.  Testicular biopsy. This test involves removing samples from the testicle with a needle. The results of the testicular biopsy can tell if sperm production is normal. If it is, your problem is likely caused by a blockage or another problem with sperm transport. However, this test is typically only used in certain situations and is not commonly used to diagnose the cause of infertility.  Anti-sperm antibody tests. These tests, which are used to check for immune cells (antibodies) that attack sperm and affect their ability to function, are not common.  Specialized sperm function tests. A number of tests can be used to check how well your sperm survive after ejaculation, how well they can penetrate an egg and whether there's any problem attaching to the egg. Generally, these tests are rarely performed and often do not significantly change treatment recommendations.  Transrectal ultrasound. A small lubricated wand is inserted into your rectum to check your prostate, and for blockages of the tubes that carry semen (ejaculatory ducts and seminal vesicles).   Treatment Treatments for low sperm count include:   Surgery. For example, a varicocele can often be surgically corrected or an obstructed vas deferens repaired. Prior vasectomies can be reversed. In cases where no sperm are present in the ejaculate, sperm can often be retrieved directly from the testicles or epididymis using sperm retrieval techniques.  Treating infections. Antibiotics can cure an infection of the reproductive tract, but this doesn't always restore fertility.  Treatments for sexual intercourse problems. Medication or counseling can help improve fertility in conditions such as erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation.  Hormone treatments and medications. Your doctor might recommend hormone replacement or medications in cases where infertility is caused by high or low levels of certain hormones or problems with the way the body uses hormones.  Assisted reproductive technology (ART). ART treatments involve obtaining sperm through normal ejaculation, surgical extraction or from donor individuals, depending on your specific case and wishes. The sperm are then inserted into the female genital tract, or used for in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection.   When treatment doesn't work  In rare cases, male fertility problems can't be treated, and it's impossible for a man to father a child. If this is the case, you and your partner can consider either using sperm from a donor or adopting a child.  Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Lifestyle and home remedies There are steps you can take at home to increase your chances of getting your partner pregnant, including:   Increasing the frequency of sex. Having sexual intercourse every day or every other day beginning at least four days before ovulation increases your chances of getting your partner pregnant.  Having sex when fertilization is possible. A woman is likely to become pregnant during ovulation — which occurs in the middle of the menstrual cycle, between periods. This will ensure that sperm, which can live several days, are present when conception is possible.  Avoiding lubricants. Some products such as Astroglide or K-Y jelly, lotions, and saliva might impair sperm movement and function. Ask your doctor about sperm-safe lubricants.   Alternative medicine Evidence is still limited on whether — or how much — herbs or supplements might help increase male fertility. None of these supplements treats a specific underlying cause of infertility, such as a sperm duct defect or chromosomal disorder. Some supplements might help only if you have a deficiency.  Supplements with studies showing potential benefits on improving sperm count or quality include:   Alpha-lipoic acid  Anthocyanins  L-arginine  Astaxanthin  Beta-carotene  Biotin  L-acetyl carnitine  L-carnitine  Cobalamin  Co-enzyme Q10  Ethylcysteine  Folic acid  Glutathione  Inositol  Lycopene  Magnesium  N-acetyl cysteine  Pentoxifylline  Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors  Polyunsaturated fatty acids  Selenium  Vitamins A, C, D and E  Zinc   Talk with your doctor before taking dietary supplements to review the risks and benefits of this therapy. Taking some supplements in high doses (megadoses) or for extended periods of time might be harmful.  Preparing for your appointment You should start with your family doctor or a general practitioner. However, he or she might refer you to an infertility specialist.  Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment, and what to expect from your doctor.  What you can do   Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. At the time you make the appointment ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as refraining from ejaculating for a certain period of time or stopping certain medications.  Write down any symptoms you're experiencing, including any that might seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.  Write down key personal information, including any major stresses or recent life changes.  Find out whether you have a family history of fertility problems. Having a male blood relative, such as your brother or father, with fertility problems or other reproductive issues might give clues to the cause of low sperm count.  Find out from your parents if you had undescended testes or other issues at birth or in early childhood.  Make a list of all medications, vitamins and supplements that you're taking.  Take your partner along. Even if you have a low sperm count, your partner also might need tests to see whether she has any problems that could be preventing pregnancy. It's also good to have your partner along to help keep track of any instructions your doctor gives you or to ask questions you may not think of.  Write down questions to ask your doctor.   Some basic questions to ask your doctor include:   What do you suspect might be causing my low sperm count?  Other than the most likely cause, what are other possible reasons my partner and I haven't been able to conceive a child?  What kinds of tests do I need?  Will my partner also need tests?  What treatments are available to increase my sperm count? Which do you recommend?  Are there any restrictions that I need to follow?  At what point should we consider other alternatives, such as a sperm donor or adoption?  Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend visiting?   Don't hesitate to ask additional questions during your appointment.  What to expect from your doctor  Some questions your doctor may ask you include:   At what age did you start puberty?  Have you had a vasectomy or a vasectomy reversal?  Do you use illicit drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine or anabolic steroids?  Have you been exposed to toxins such as chemicals, pesticides, radiation or lead, especially on a regular basis?  Are you currently taking any medications, including dietary supplements?  Do you have a history of undescended testicles?

The good news is that low sperm count does not necessarily prevent pregnancy from occurring and there is a lot you can do to improve your chances of getting pregnant.  Click here to read couples’ success stories of conceiving with low sperm count.  In this article:   Low sperm count – what is it?  What is a ‘normal’ sperm count?  Low sperm count – how low is too low?  Low sperm count – boosting your chances of pregnancy Low sperm count – what is it? Low sperm count means that the number of sperm in a man’s semen is below the threshold of what is considered normal. Sperm motility (their ability to move) and sperm morphology (their form or shape) may also be affected. Sperm count is determined through a test called a semen analysis.  It is usually the first test your doctor will request (after taking your clinical history and possibly carrying out a physical exam). Semen refers to the fluid that is released from the penis when a man ejaculates. It is made up of fluids from several glands (mainly the prostate and seminal vesicles) and sperm. Surprisingly, sperm make up only 5% of the total semen volume! A semen analysis evaluates the quality and quantity of both the sperm and the semen.  A basic semen analysis can be ordered by your family doctor and this is usually carried out through your local pathology laboratory. If further investigation is required, a more in depth analysis can be carried out at a fertility clinic. What is a ‘normal’ sperm count? The semen parameters that are usually tested during a semen analysis are listed below, along with the values that are considered ‘normal’. Macroscopic:    Semen Parameter  Normal* Values    Ejaculate Volume (ml)  > 1.5    pH  ≥ 7.2    Viscosity  Normal    Liquefaction  <60 minutes    Microscopic:    Semen Parameter  Normal* Values    Sperm Count (million)  > 39    Sperm Concentration (million/ml)  > 15    Total Sperm Motility (%)  > 40    Progressive Sperm Motility (%)  > 32    Morphology (%)  > 4    Vitality (%)  > 58    Agglutination  Absent    White blood cells (million/ml)  < 1    * These ‘normal values’ reflect the lower reference limit adopted by the 5th edition of the WHO Laboratory manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen (ie. 5th percentile lower reference limit obtained from a population of approximately 2000 fertile men whose partners had a time-to-pregnancy of 12 months or less). It’s important to remember, that there can be wide fluctuations in these values from day to day, so it is important to get 2-3 samples tested before a low sperm count is diagnosed. Low sperm count – how low is too low? Sperm counts vary considerably between individuals and unfortunately its impossible to say for certain whether or not a particular sperm count will assure fertility or infertility. If however, there is a complete absence of sperm in the semen (a condition known as azoospermia), natural conception will be impossible and this will require investigation through a fertility clinic. The quality of  sperm is often more important than the quantity . For example, small numbers of excellent quality sperm may provide a better chance of conception than large numbers of poor quality sperm. In the Fertility Focus clinic, we have seen couples conceive naturally with a sperm count as low as 2 – 5 million per ml and research has shown that even in cases where sperm count is less than 2 million/ml, there is still a chance of natural conception. Low sperm count – boosting your chances of pregnancy There are many things you can do to improve sperm quality and boost fertility: Learn fertility awareness Learning the fertility awareness method to determine your most fertile day or days as a couple each cycle, is key to enhancing your chances of conception. Cervical fluid produced by the female partner is absolutely critical for sperm transport and survival. Timing intercourse for the day(s) that the best quality cervical fluid is produced, will give sperm their greatest chance of survival and being able to swim towards the egg (1) (2) .  Timing intercourse for these peak fertile days has also been shown to minimise the effect of lowered fertility due to male age (3) . The Fast Track to Pregnancy Program™ teaches you step by step,  how to use the empowering skills of fertility awareness and fertility charting to optimise your chances of conception with low sperm count. Don’t ‘save up’ sperm Contrary to popular belief, in the case of low sperm count, it is NOT advisable to abstain from intercourse for extended periods, to build up sperm numbers. While it’s true that abstaining will increase semen volume and the number of sperm, research has revealed that in men with low sperm count and quality, FREQUENT ejaculation has a significant benefit, improving sperm motility and sperm morphology, while reducing levels of DNA fragmentation. (4) (5) In Step 3 of the Fast Track to Pregnancy Program™ , you’ll learn the ‘Ultimate Sex Timing Strategy’  which discusses in detail how to time intercourse to optimise your chances of  getting pregnant with low sperm count. Make lifestyle changes A significant cause of male infertility is something called ‘free radical damage’. Free radicals are toxic metabolites produced by normal processes in our bodies.  However, they are also produced through exposure to certain environmental factors.  These highly reactive molecules damage cells, and an excess of free radicals in semen is also responsible for damaging sperm, which can lead to infertility and miscarriage. Excess free radicals can be caused by poor diet, tobacco and alcohol consumption, illness and stress. They can also be caused by exposure to pollutants and chemicals in the environment. Below are some tips on what you can do to fight free radical damage and improve the health of your sperm: 7 Tips to Improve Your Sperm 1. Eat a diet high in antioxidants . Antioxidants help to ‘mop up’ free radicals, reducing the amount of damage to sperm. Foods high in antioxidants include berries, fruit and vegetables (particularly those that are brightly coloured), nuts and seeds, cereals and dark chocolate. 2. Take a targeted multivitamin . If you have reduced sperm count or sperm quality, a specially formulated fertility multivitamin may help. The key vitamins and minerals that are important for healthy sperm production are: Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Zinc, Selenium, Folic Acid, L-Carnitine, CoQ10 and Glutathione. 3. Ditch the cigarettes! Smoking causes free radical damage to sperm DNA and lowers sperm quality. Men who smoke are four times as likely to have children who develop childhood cancer. Smoking marijuana is also thought to affect sperm health. Remember, it takes about 72 days for sperm to fully form, so even after you cease smoking, it may take several months for the effects to be reversed. 4. Reduce alcohol intake .  Alcohol is a testicular toxin and affects sperm production and sexual function in men. Research suggests that alcohol should be limited to 5 standard drinks or less a week (one standard drink equates to a 330ml can or bottle of beer, a 100ml glass of wine or 30ml of straight spirits).  Check out this blog article for more information. 5. Avoid hot baths and spas . Heat is bad for sperm production (that is why the testicles hang outside the body!). You may like to try wearing boxers instead of tight underpants. 6. Maintain a healthy BMI . Being overweight can reduce sperm count, particularly if excess fat leads to an increased temperature around the testicles. Keeping BMI within a normal range is advisable. 7. Avoid environmental toxins and pollutants . Organic solvents, pesticides, lead, toxic fumes, phthalates and other chemicals are suspected in lowering male fertility, so it is advisable to reduce exposure to these toxins where possible and wear protective clothing when necessary.

Did you know that 30 percent of infertility is related to problems with the male partner?  Male factor infertility is diagnosed by finding a low sperm count on a semen analysis.  Millions of sperm have to be produced by the man’s testicles and delivered to the woman’s body in order for just one lucky sperm to fertilize an egg. So, what does it mean if your partner has a low sperm count? Can you still get pregnant?  Why He Needs So Many When a man ejaculates, typically some 250 million sperm are released.  To cause conception, a sperm cell has to swim all the way up from the vagina, through the cervix and uterus and into your fallopian tube to reach an egg which has been ovulated.  Of those millions of sperm, only hundreds will make it up to the fallopian tubes. All of those sperm release an enzyme which helps clear the way to the egg.  If all goes well, one sperm will swim up that pathway and fertilize the egg. The fertilized egg will move down the fallopian tube and travel to the uterus, where it can implant and grow.  Semen analysis is the first test a man will take when getting evaluated for fertility problems. It involves testing a sample of a man’s semen to estimate how many sperm there are (total count), what percentage of the sperm are moving (motility) and if they have a normal shape (morphology), according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). Concentration of sperm per milliliter of semen is one of the measures.  Total sperm count multiplies the concentration by the volume of semen in the sample.  A man’s sperm count varies from day to day.  While his testicles are semen-producing machines, anything from having a fever to taking a new medicine can reduce his sperm count temporarily.  It’s best if he is feeling well, hasn’t had any recent changes in diet or medication, and hasn’t been exposed to heat when he goes to the lab to give a sperm sample, so the results will be more typical.  Your reproductive endocrinologist will tell him how long to abstain from sex before giving the sample.  That lets the testicles accumulate a good amount of sperm for the sample.  Typically, men are told to abstain for no less than two days and no more than seven.  If the test results show a low sperm count, a man may be asked to repeat the test, just to make sure it wasn’t an off day for his testicles.  Trying to Conceive with a Low Sperm Count Low sperm count doesn’t mean you can’t get pregnant. If his sperm are healthy and moving well, it may just take more attempts to conceive, which means more time. Common causes of low sperm count include abnormal hormonal secretion, the presence of a swollen vein around the testicle called a varicocele, or problems with the testicle’s ability to make sperm. There are lifestyle factors which contribute to low sperm count, such as smoking and obesity. If you are younger than 35 and neither of you have other fertility issues, making lifestyle changes may help raise his sperm count.  If the sperm counts are very low or there are other factors, such as abnormalities in the shape of his sperm or low motility, or if you have fertility issues as well, IVF with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may be a fertility treatment to consider. IVF with ICSI allows an egg to be fertilized by a single sperm in the lab.  The embryologist can select the healthiest sperm to inject  into the egg in order to fertilize it.  If you’re under 35 and have been trying to conceive for a year or more, or you’re 35 or older and have been trying for six months without success, it’s time to consult a fertility specialist. Reproductive endocrinologists are the experts in treating infertility and will develop a plan to maximize your chances of having a baby.  Need Help?

My husband was told he had low sperm count (2 million) and basically low in everything else too. We decided to get prayed for at church and started to pray together as a couple which was sometimes a little awkward cause we had never done this before with one another. My husband was very calm about the whole thing and just kept reminding me that God would make it happen. In conjunctions with praying, we did get the fertile aid pills and within a month of taking them I got pregnant. I think the pills helped but honestly I think you should pray with your husband and proclaim out loud that your husband is healed. This may sound funny but I did this everyday and it worked. I truly believe my husband is healed and we will never have to go through this again. I&#39;ll pray for you tonight! God bless!           a BabyCenter member   Answered 7/17/16               9 found this helpful     Hi everyone hope we are all well. I am 23 and my husband is 28. We&#39;ve been trying to get pregnant for nearly 2 years but no success. We went to get some tests done and everything with me is fine but we found out my husbands sperm count is very low and the quality isn&#39;t that great either. We are on the waiting list for IVF with ICSI. I know I am young but the fact that I know now it&#39;s my husbands sperm that is not great I feel I want to have one now rather than later where more problems may occurs. I asked the doctor if there is anything we can do apart from going straight to IVF but she didn&#39;t really answer the question clearly. Does anyone know of anything my husband can do or take to help his sperm? He works in HSBC so he is always wearing suit trousers which are tight near the middle and also he sits down a lot but there&#39;s nothing we can really do about that. But please let me know if there is anything else we can try.

After all, it only takes one to fertilize an egg.  Tags: Fertility Health , Trying to Conceive      By Ann Douglas   Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter    Comments   shutterstock FACT: Men need more than one sperm—lots, lots more than one—to fertilize an egg after intercourse. In a typical ejaculate (about a teaspoon), 250 million sperm are released. But of those 250 million, only hundreds make it as far as the fallopian tubes. Functioning as a kind of synchronized sports team, most of the sperm release an enzyme that helps clear the pathway to the egg so that one sperm can penetrate it. While there’s no magic number when it comes to sperm counts, 20 million or more sperm per milliliter of ejaculate is the benchmark that most physicians consider “normal.” But a sperm count below that number doesn’t have to be devastating. “It may just mean that the time to conception will be longer,” explains Steven M. Schrader, Ph.D., lead of the reproductive health assessment team of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Sperm count isn’t the only measure of reproductive success . Male fertility also depends in part on sperm morphology (shape) and sperm motility (movement). While couples always want to know which of these three sperm measures matters most—count, morphology or motility—giving a single factor star billing doesn’t make any sense at all. Says Schrader, “It’s like asking what part of your car is most important. Maybe you think it would be the engine, but just try to get somewhere without the tires. And what about the steering wheel?” The good news is that assisted reproductive technologies—and especially intracytoplasmic sperm injection, in which a single sperm is injected into an egg—can give sperm a boost when a sperm analysis has identified a problem in one of the three key areas. Today, fertilization may be possible with even the worst semen analysis results.      comments             Video Games Security Cameras Toddler Clothes Kids Clothes Rugs Teen Clothing Kids Bikes Bath Toys Toddler Beds Bookcases Desks Board Games Laptops Kids Backpacks Playroom Furniture Potty Training Supplies Parenting Books Childrens Vitamins Teen Bedding Shower Curtains Bedroom Sets Activity Trackers TVs Birthday Party Decorations  Connect with us  Your Account Log In Join Now Customer Service Data Policy Help Update Your Account Member Benefits Newsletter Parenting.com Maternity Clothes Strollers Car Seats Feeding & Nursing Toys & Activities Shop Sitemap Shop Sitemap Parents Network Parents Parenting Family Circle Ser Padres Fit Pregnancy © Copyright 2018, Meredith Corporation .

What constitutes a low sperm count? Detecting a low sperm count can be relatively easy to do.  You simply need to provide a fresh specimen of semen (obtained through masturbation).  The semen is looked at under the microscope to see whether or not there are enough sperm in the sample. A normal sperm count has a wide range.  It is believed that a normal sperm count is somewhere between 40 million and 300 million sperm per ml of semen.  Those semen samples that have less than 20 million sperm per ml are said to have a low sperm count. Counts between 20 million and 40 million sperm per ml probably have a harder time with fertilizing an egg successfully but are borderline as to actually being considered to be a low sperm count.  It doesn’t mean that the man is infertile but that it may take longer to fertilize the egg and a longer time before achieving a pregnancy.  Diagnosing a Low Sperm Count When the man gives a specimen of his semen and it is determined that the sperm count is less than 20 million sperm per ml semen, this can be disheartening.  It can negatively impact is self-esteem and can decrease libido because the man doesn’t feel as though he can do his part in the conception of a pregnancy. If you have been diagnosed with a low sperm count, you need to discuss this openly with your sexual partner so that together you can find ways of overcoming this fertility problem, whether you do this by having sex more often during peak fertility times or decide to engage in some fertility treatments, such as intrauterine sperm insemination. Natural Ways of Improving Fertility with a Low Sperm Count You can try to enhance your fertility by not having too much sex or by not having too little sex. It turns out that too much sex can deplete the storage of sperm so that the sperm count will be even lower if you have sex too much.  Having sex about every 2 to 3 days is about the right frequency of intercourse to have the maximum number of sperm in the ejaculate when trying to have a baby. Of course, you need to time your sex to be in the window of time when the woman is the most fertile.  Women with regular 28-day cycles will ovulate on about the 14 th day of the cycle and you should plan to have sex every other day from about the 9 th to the 15 th day of the menstrual cycle for the maximum chances of conceiving a child. Another natural way of improving fertility is to make sure that the testicles are at the right temperature.  There is a reason why the testicles are outside the body.  It’s because sperm are more effectively made at a lower body temperature than the normal core body temperature.  Men with low sperm counts should avoid wearing underwear that is too tight and should instead wear boxer shorts that allow the temperature of the sperm to be lower. Men should also avoid exposure to saunas and hot tubs that can raise the testicular temperature, effectively decreasing the sperm count.  An occasional sauna or hut tub exposure is probably okay but regular use by men with low sperm counts can greatly affect fertility. A man with a low sperm count should eat a healthy diet and should drink plenty of water.  You need these things in order to have a decent sperm count.  In a sperm-enhancing diet, you should be eating foods that have high-quality fat and plenty of protein to make sperm cells.  The diet should be as low in junk food and sugar as possible. Exercise can also enhance male fertility.  The exercise should be no more than moderate, as excessive or extreme exercise can negatively impact the semen production.  Wearing tight clothing during exercise will increase the temperature of the testicles and will drive down the sperm count. Sperm counts can also be affected by the man’s intake of alcohol, cigarettes, and street drugs.  You should stay away from all of these things in order to have sperm that are not only healthy but are of a sufficient quantity in the semen. There are some herbal remedies out there that are believed to enhance fertility in men who have low sperm counts.  Much of the research proving this to be the case is lacking, however, but most of these supplements won’t hurt you and some of them might just be beneficial in helping you to conceive a child. Medical Ways of Treating a Low Sperm Count If all of the natural ways of improving the sperm count have been tried and the couple still can’t conceive a child, the doctor can step in and use medical ways of improving fertility.  One method is intrauterine insemination or IUI.  This involves getting a sampling of the semen, washing the sperm, and then inserting the sperm cells directly into the uterus through a catheter inserted through the cervix. Another medical way to improve fertility in situations of low sperm count include in vitro fertilization or IVF.  In this procedure, the sperm and eggs come together in a petri dish.  When the eggs become fertilized, they are implanted as embryos inside the woman’s uterus, so that the eggs are already fertilized by the time they reach the uterine environment. The Bottom Line The basic fact of the matter is that, even though it just takes one sperm to fertilize an egg, it takes millions of sperm to increase the odds of having that one sperm to get to the right place in order to create an embryo.  Of the 200 million per ml or so of sperm that are in the ejaculate, only a few hundred sperm actually make it too the fallopian tubes.  A healthy sperm cell will release an enzyme that helps the swimming process so the sperm can better reach and penetrate the egg. Men who have sperm counts of less than 20 million per ml are not considered completely infertile.  In most cases, it simply means that it will take longer, and may take some more finesse and planning in order for the couple to conceive a healthy child.  If natural ways of sperm enhancement fail, there are at least two effective medical ways of enhancing fertility that can greatly increase the chances that a normal pregnancy can be achieved.

Your sperm count should be 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen to be considered normal. Infertility affects 15 percent of healthy couples, and of those cases, males are the cause 40 percent of the time. Low sperm count is the cause for one-third of male infertility cases. The lower your sperm count, the lower your chances of fertilizing your partner’s eggs.  Causes Of Low Sperm Count   Low sperm count can be caused by numerous factors. Some of the most common causes are:   Damaged Ducts  Low Production  Varicocele  Antibodies  Other factors   If you are suffering from damaged ducts , blunt force trauma or an infection may have caused significant damage to your sperm ducts. Your testicles are connected to the penis by these sperm ducts. Surgical procedures can also lead to damaged ducts.  Alternatively, you may suffer from low sperm count because you are unable to produce large amounts of sperm. This may occur because of a genetic disorder or you may have issues with your organs or glands. For instance, you could have issues creating sperm in your testicles if you have problems with your purity glands.  Varicocele causes a low sperm count because of swollen veins. If you suffer from varicocele, you are unable to produce sperm due to a vein inside of your scrotum that has become swollen. The good news is that this cause can typically be corrected through minor surgery.  Antibodies fight off diseases, but some can cause you to have a low sperm count. These specific antibodies are known as “anti-sperm antibodies.” They mistake sperm as harmful invaders, and destroy the sperm before it has a chance to exit your body.  Lifestyle Choices  There are some self-inflicted causes of low sperm count. The type of lifestyle you live will play an important role in your chances of reproducing. If you use drugs and alcohol, or encounter a great deal of stress, your sperm count can be lowered. Studies show that men who do not smoke or use tobacco products have a higher sperm count than those who do. Stay away from stressful situations, both at work and home, because the hormones you need to produce sperm can be affected. You should maintain a healthy weight. Obesity has been known to reduce male fertility because of hormone changes; therefore, maintaining a good diet and exercising regularly is important. Here is a complete list of infertility causes .  Treatment  Although some low-sperm count cases cannot be treated, others can. There are medications that you can take that will improve your sperm count. Men who use Clomiphene have the ability to improve their sperm’s production and motility. You can take human chorionic gonadotriptin to boost your sperm production, as well as your testosterone levels. Always consult with a doctor or specialist before taking medications to improve your sperm count. A specialist can explain the positive and negatives, such as conception statistics and side effects.  If you have a low sperm count that does not prevent you from conceiving a child, but your chances at conception can be affected. If you are unsuccessful, there are other options available for you, such as In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), or sperm donors. A specialist will go over all of your options with you.
