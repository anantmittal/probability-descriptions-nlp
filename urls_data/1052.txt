Rak-Su beat out Grace Davies, but did the bookies get it right? Now the series is over, we give you the final odds and predictions - did the bookies get the winning act correct?  By Tilly Pearce 19th December 2017, 9:05 pm Updated: 19th December 2017, 9:06 pm THE X Factor 2017 has now aired the grand final and people placed their bets on who could possibly win the much-coveted contract.  As Rak-Su have been crowned champions, here are what the final odds were on this year's X Factor winner according to Sun Bets – odds were also available from Paddy Power and William Hill ...  PA:Press Association Rak-su have made it through to the live shows  Rak-Su 1/4  Boyband Rak-Su almost found themselves falling at the first hurdle when their version of Justin Timberlake's Senorita failed to impress the judges with Simon Cowell calling it to a halt with the words: "Sorry guys, it's not working for me."  Fortunately their original song I'm Feeling You had the judges singing along.  Their brave decision to perform their own material paid off and they were given four yeses and the chance to spend time with Nicole.  They have now been crowned winners of X Factor 2017.  Grace Davies 11/4  Grace Davies reduced Nicole Scherzinger to tears in her debut X Factor audition.  The 20-year-old hopeful performed her original song Roots for the four-strong judging panel but the song had a particular effect on Nicole as she struggled to hold back her emotional reaction.  Likewise Sharon Osbourne was spotted wiping away tears as she watched Warehouse assistant Grace sing.  Performing it to an audience for the very first time, Walsh labelled it a "hit" while Cowell described it as a "beautiful, beautiful song".  Grace came runner up as boyband Rak-Su were voted winners of this year's competition.  more x factor gossip 'MEAN' MUSIC MOGUL A few things you didn't know about X Factor and BGT mogul Simon Cowell CROHN'S FIGHT X Factor star lost 6st at uni from Crohn's disease & praises Dynamo's honesty looking scherious Nicole Scherzinger breaks silence after being dropped from The X Factor THE MANAGER Pop manager Louis Walsh was recently on X Factor - we take a look at his career OUTSPOKEN OSBOURNE The story of Sharon Osbourne, back on screens with the X Factor THE WINNER'S CIRCLE Here's EVERY X Factor winner so far - and who they beat WHAT A DOLL The lowdown on Nicole Scherzinger - singer axed as a judge on The X Factor... giving thanks Louis Tomlinson pays tribute to mum on eighth anniversary of X Factor try out BRACE FOR TRACE X Factor's Tracy Leanne Jefford releasing song after being dropped by SyCo WHITE WEDDING X Factor's Kevin Davy White gets engaged to long-term love Amy Carter FAT SHAME SHOCK Louis Walsh told X Factor's Lloyd Macey he had to lose weight LIFE ON THE ROAD The X Factor stars reveal the truth of what it's REALLY like on tour  When was the X Factor live final?  Traditionally the X Factor final has been in the last two weeks before Christmas.  This is so the winner can bag the coveted Christmas number one spot.  But this year the live finals were brought forwards, which meant it avoided a clash with rival show Strictly - and the winner gets more of a chance to get the Christmas number one.  The live finals began on Saturday December 2 at 7.05pm on ITV.  On Sunday December 3 at 7.20pm on ITV the last final aired, and Rak-Su beat out Grace Davies to be crowned this year's champions.

Created by Simon Cowell, the show began in 2004 and has since aired annually from August/September until December. The show is produced by FremantleMedia's Thames (previously Talkback Thames) and Cowell's production company Syco TV. It is broadcast on the ITV network in the UK and simulcast on TV3 in Ireland. The "X Factor" refers to the undefinable "something" that makes for star quality. The series consists of auditions, bootcamp, judges' houses, several weeks of live shows, semi-finals and the final. The series has a spin-off behind-the-scenes show called The Xtra Factor, which airs directly after the main show on ITV2.          Share  |         » Contact: info@nicerodds.co.uk 18+.

The boyband are going up against Grace Davies for the X Factor crown this year and bookies reckon the lads are headed for victory.  Coral say they are the ‘overwhelming’ favourites, giving them odds of 1-4, slashing them from the previous odds of 4-9 to win. Meanwhile Grace has odds of 7.-2 for X Factor glory.  Coral’s Harry Aitkenhead said: ‘Rak-Su negotiated their way through the first part of the final Saturday and we’ve again cut their odds to win the show as a result.        Grace is standing in Rak-Su’s way (Picture: Dymond/Thames/Syco/REX/Shutterstock) ‘It would be one of the biggest shocks in X Factor history if they didn’t go on to win in Sunday’s finale.’   Advertisement    Advertisement   The final is taking place after Kevin Davy White finished in third place on Saturday night.

X Factor viewers have accused the show of setting Rak-Su up to win after they performed with two artists during the first half of the final – producer Naughty Boy and Wyclef Jean.  Rak-Su will be performing two original songs on Sunday – Mona Lisa and Touche.   Got a story?

It's not a fix, and we don't know who's *actually* going to win. But thanks to science we can make a pretty solid guess. With Simon Cowell having decided to make this the shortest series of  The X Factor  ever, there are less than three weeks to go until the final. Currently, there are still ten acts left in the competition and fans are starting to get a feel for who might win this year . According to the bookies, Rak-Su are favourite to be crowned champion at 5/4, followed closely by Grace Davies at 3/1 and Kevin Davy White at 5/1. But the odds keep changing by the minute. Rewind a few weeks back and it was Grace at the top of the leaderboard while Kevin was nowhere to be seen. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below So what's a more reliable way of determining who is most likely to win X Factor 2017? Science, of course! To get an idea of who really stands a chance of securing that all-important record deal, Digital Spy has looked back at X Factor history. The mentor factor Judging by the stats, it looks like whichever category Simon happens to mentor stands the greatest chance of coming out on top. In total, an act from his group has won the show three times. Nicole Scherzinger has managed to lead her team to victory twice, while Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh's groups have only ever been crowned champions once.      This means that this year, the groups have a 43% chance of winning the show thanks to Simon. While The Cutkelvins and Sean and Conor Price might not be favourites as far as the bookies are concerned, having the music mogul as their mentor does appear to give them a strong advantage in the competition. The categorical imperative On the contrary, if you look back at how groups have performed previously, the future really doesn't look so bright, not even for Rak–Su. During the show's 14-year history, a group has only ever won the competition once. That was of course Little Mix back in 2011 .       ©  Digital Spy Without a doubt, the most successful category over the years has been the Boys. In total, guys aged 24 and younger have repeatedly been most popular with the nation. In fact, they've won the competition six times – almost one in every two series. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The bookies' odds Bookies expect Sam Black to be eliminated from the show during this weekend's live evictions. Lloyd, on the other hand, is one of the favourites to win.      The Welsh singer is currently in fourth place at 8/1 with a 10% chance of winning, according to Ladbrokes (we'll spare you the maths, but that's as a percentage of the sum-total implied percentage). Meanwhile, Kevin is just ahead with a 14% chance, Grace is in second place with 21% and Rak-Su are miles ahead with a 38% likelihood of being crowned this year's champions. Since the live shows started, Rak-Su and Grace have both already had singles shoot towards the top of the iTunes chart . Grace's self-penned track 'Too Young', which she performed during Express Yourself week, reached number two, while Rak-Su's original song 'Mamacita' hit number three. On Sunday night's show (November 12), X Factor guest performer Paloma Faith admitted that her single 'Guilty' hadn't reached the top of the charts yet despite her live performance, because of Rak-Su. The boys' latest self-penned track 'Dimelo' went straight to number one last week despite fierce competition from already established artists. Commenting on their chart success, the boys told fans: "Guys, we are literally so happy, thank you, to everyone who voted for us and thank you to everyone who bought it as well. Honestly, for four friends who have been doing this by ourselves for a while now, if someone had said six months ago we'd have a song at number one in the iTunes chart we would have just laughed at you. So this is is just... mad." We've got to admit it, it is looking very likely that Rak-Su will win. But we don't want to rely entirely on what the bookies say, especially as a group has only ever won The X Factor once. Combining the X, Y and Z factors So, we decided to take all factors into account to work out which act really is most likely to be crowned champion this year. To do this, we combined the likelihood of each act's category winning, the likelihood of each act's mentor winning, together with the stats provided by the bookies. After all that, we were then able to determine the percentage chance of each act succeeding. So what did our calculations find? Well, it looks like the bookies are right – but not about everything:       ©  Digital Spy While Rak-Su are the clear favourites to win X Factor 2017, our calculations found that both Lloyd and Kevin are ahead of Grace. Even Sam appears to be beating her despite the fact he's tipped to leave the competition this weekend. Frustratingly, the stats also show that Rai-Elle Williams could be set to leave the competition this week, meaning we'll never get to hear her duet with Stormzy . Although she's delivered strong performances week after week, it looks like having Sharon as a mentor, combined with poor odds from the bookies, means she may soon be a goner. Luckily, although our science is obviously spot on, statistics mean nothing to the individual. So really, this could still be anyone's race... The X Factor is on ITV, Saturdays and Sundays.

"Rak-Su will probably win, and those who took the recommended odds at the start of the series can look forward to a profitable show..."    Which acts are left in the show?  In a compressed six-week live-show schedule, one of many changes made to re-invigorate the show, we find ourselves at the Grand Final in record time, with three acts left.  Rak-Su , tipped-up prior to the live shows at [6.00], find themselves as the strong, odds-on favourites at [1.44].  Early favourite, singer-songwriter Grace Davies , is next in the betting at [4.30]. Completing the trio is French singing-contest-reject and initial outsider, Kevin Davy White at [12.00].   Which act will win?  Probably Rak-Su.  They've impressed throughout as charismatic, likeable and talented, qualities required of any X-Factor winner .  They've already topped the iTunes charts, too, with Mona Lisa and with their semi-final version of I'm Feeling You , the original song which they also sang at their first audition.  It's also worth noting that they have contested the Prize Fight in three out of four weeks, winning the last one in a public vote against Grace Davies.  Their only absence came in Week 3, with a weaker performance and the dreaded coffin-slot of singing first.  Plenty of odds-on shots have lost in finals - think Gareth Gates, Rhydian Roberts, Jahmene Douglas and Fleur East - but working in Rak-Su's favour is the venue: the stadium environment of the Excel Centre is much easier to fill with four people cavorting around the stage with a music and dance production.  They are perhaps the only act who won't get lost in it all.   Can anyone beat Rak-Su?  Grace Davies has an obvious following.  At the time of writing she has four songs in the iTunes Top 50, although her best chart position has been number two, with a cover of David Bowie's Life on Mars .  That perhaps sums up her appeal: enough people like her that she was able to win public votes early on, but that fan base has likely not grown as the field has thinned.  She will repel as many voters as she attracts - she falls into the category of "interesting" X Factor acts that never do as well as commentators think they will - and could well get lost on the big stage of this weekend's final.   Who will be first to be eliminated?  Kevin Davy White.  He's talented and likeable enough, but has only reached one Prize Fight in the series, losing in a public vote to the now-eliminated Lloyd Macey.  It's notable that his best chart showing has been a lowly 29, with a Beatles' cover, Come Together .  It will be a surprise if he survives the first elimination of the final.   Verdict  Rak-Su will probably win, and those who took the recommended odds at the start of the series can look forward to a profitable show.  Those odds have long-gone, though, and I won't be getting involved at [1.44].  A better bet is to back Kevin Davy White in the 3rd Place Market at [1.47].  Even if one of the other two acts put in a bum early performance, it's hard to see how their loyal fan bases wouldn't vote them through anyway, which makes Kevin Davy White a near-certainty to leave first.  * This article was originally publised on November 30.

Rak-Su beat out Grace Davies, but did the bookies get it right? Now the series is over, we give you the final odds and predictions - did the bookies get the winning act correct?  By Tilly Pearce 19th December 2017, 9:05 pm Updated: 19th December 2017, 9:06 pm THE X Factor 2017 has now aired the grand final and people placed their bets on who could possibly win the much-coveted contract.  As Rak-Su have been crowned champions, here are what the final odds were on this year's X Factor winner according to Sun Bets – odds were also available from Paddy Power and William Hill ...  PA:Press Association Rak-su have made it through to the live shows  Rak-Su 1/4  Boyband Rak-Su almost found themselves falling at the first hurdle when their version of Justin Timberlake's Senorita failed to impress the judges with Simon Cowell calling it to a halt with the words: "Sorry guys, it's not working for me."  Fortunately their original song I'm Feeling You had the judges singing along.  Their brave decision to perform their own material paid off and they were given four yeses and the chance to spend time with Nicole.  They have now been crowned winners of X Factor 2017.  Grace Davies 11/4  Grace Davies reduced Nicole Scherzinger to tears in her debut X Factor audition.  The 20-year-old hopeful performed her original song Roots for the four-strong judging panel but the song had a particular effect on Nicole as she struggled to hold back her emotional reaction.  Likewise Sharon Osbourne was spotted wiping away tears as she watched Warehouse assistant Grace sing.  Performing it to an audience for the very first time, Walsh labelled it a "hit" while Cowell described it as a "beautiful, beautiful song".  Grace came runner up as boyband Rak-Su were voted winners of this year's competition.  more x factor gossip 'MEAN' MUSIC MOGUL A few things you didn't know about X Factor and BGT mogul Simon Cowell CROHN'S FIGHT X Factor star lost 6st at uni from Crohn's disease & praises Dynamo's honesty looking scherious Nicole Scherzinger breaks silence after being dropped from The X Factor THE MANAGER Pop manager Louis Walsh was recently on X Factor - we take a look at his career OUTSPOKEN OSBOURNE The story of Sharon Osbourne, back on screens with the X Factor THE WINNER'S CIRCLE Here's EVERY X Factor winner so far - and who they beat WHAT A DOLL The lowdown on Nicole Scherzinger - singer axed as a judge on The X Factor... giving thanks Louis Tomlinson pays tribute to mum on eighth anniversary of X Factor try out BRACE FOR TRACE X Factor's Tracy Leanne Jefford releasing song after being dropped by SyCo WHITE WEDDING X Factor's Kevin Davy White gets engaged to long-term love Amy Carter FAT SHAME SHOCK Louis Walsh told X Factor's Lloyd Macey he had to lose weight LIFE ON THE ROAD The X Factor stars reveal the truth of what it's REALLY like on tour  When was the X Factor live final?  Traditionally the X Factor final has been in the last two weeks before Christmas.  This is so the winner can bag the coveted Christmas number one spot.  But this year the live finals were brought forwards, which meant it avoided a clash with rival show Strictly - and the winner gets more of a chance to get the Christmas number one.  The live finals began on Saturday December 2 at 7.05pm on ITV.  On Sunday December 3 at 7.20pm on ITV the last final aired, and Rak-Su beat out Grace Davies to be crowned this year's champions.

Created by Simon Cowell, the show began in 2004 and has since aired annually from August/September until December. The show is produced by FremantleMedia's Thames (previously Talkback Thames) and Cowell's production company Syco TV. It is broadcast on the ITV network in the UK and simulcast on TV3 in Ireland. The "X Factor" refers to the undefinable "something" that makes for star quality. The series consists of auditions, bootcamp, judges' houses, several weeks of live shows, semi-finals and the final. The series has a spin-off behind-the-scenes show called The Xtra Factor, which airs directly after the main show on ITV2.          Share  |         » Contact: info@nicerodds.co.uk 18+.

The boyband are going up against Grace Davies for the X Factor crown this year and bookies reckon the lads are headed for victory.  Coral say they are the ‘overwhelming’ favourites, giving them odds of 1-4, slashing them from the previous odds of 4-9 to win. Meanwhile Grace has odds of 7.-2 for X Factor glory.  Coral’s Harry Aitkenhead said: ‘Rak-Su negotiated their way through the first part of the final Saturday and we’ve again cut their odds to win the show as a result.        Grace is standing in Rak-Su’s way (Picture: Dymond/Thames/Syco/REX/Shutterstock) ‘It would be one of the biggest shocks in X Factor history if they didn’t go on to win in Sunday’s finale.’   Advertisement    Advertisement   The final is taking place after Kevin Davy White finished in third place on Saturday night.

For the first time, the winner’s single will be a duet, with Rak-Su releasing original Dimelo with Wyclef, while Grace’s single will be a duet with Paloma Faith on her original song Roots.  X Factor viewers have accused the show of setting Rak-Su up to win after they performed with two artists during the first half of the final – producer Naughty Boy and Wyclef Jean.  Rak-Su will be performing two original songs on Sunday – Mona Lisa and Touche.   Got a story?

It's not a fix, and we don't know who's *actually* going to win. But thanks to science we can make a pretty solid guess. With Simon Cowell having decided to make this the shortest series of  The X Factor  ever, there are less than three weeks to go until the final. Currently, there are still ten acts left in the competition and fans are starting to get a feel for who might win this year . According to the bookies, Rak-Su are favourite to be crowned champion at 5/4, followed closely by Grace Davies at 3/1 and Kevin Davy White at 5/1. But the odds keep changing by the minute. Rewind a few weeks back and it was Grace at the top of the leaderboard while Kevin was nowhere to be seen. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below So what's a more reliable way of determining who is most likely to win X Factor 2017? Science, of course! To get an idea of who really stands a chance of securing that all-important record deal, Digital Spy has looked back at X Factor history. The mentor factor Judging by the stats, it looks like whichever category Simon happens to mentor stands the greatest chance of coming out on top. In total, an act from his group has won the show three times. Nicole Scherzinger has managed to lead her team to victory twice, while Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh's groups have only ever been crowned champions once.      This means that this year, the groups have a 43% chance of winning the show thanks to Simon. While The Cutkelvins and Sean and Conor Price might not be favourites as far as the bookies are concerned, having the music mogul as their mentor does appear to give them a strong advantage in the competition. The categorical imperative On the contrary, if you look back at how groups have performed previously, the future really doesn't look so bright, not even for Rak–Su. During the show's 14-year history, a group has only ever won the competition once. That was of course Little Mix back in 2011 .       ©  Digital Spy Without a doubt, the most successful category over the years has been the Boys. In total, guys aged 24 and younger have repeatedly been most popular with the nation. In fact, they've won the competition six times – almost one in every two series. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The bookies' odds Bookies expect Sam Black to be eliminated from the show during this weekend's live evictions. Lloyd, on the other hand, is one of the favourites to win.      The Welsh singer is currently in fourth place at 8/1 with a 10% chance of winning, according to Ladbrokes (we'll spare you the maths, but that's as a percentage of the sum-total implied percentage). Meanwhile, Kevin is just ahead with a 14% chance, Grace is in second place with 21% and Rak-Su are miles ahead with a 38% likelihood of being crowned this year's champions. Since the live shows started, Rak-Su and Grace have both already had singles shoot towards the top of the iTunes chart . Grace's self-penned track 'Too Young', which she performed during Express Yourself week, reached number two, while Rak-Su's original song 'Mamacita' hit number three. On Sunday night's show (November 12), X Factor guest performer Paloma Faith admitted that her single 'Guilty' hadn't reached the top of the charts yet despite her live performance, because of Rak-Su. The boys' latest self-penned track 'Dimelo' went straight to number one last week despite fierce competition from already established artists. Commenting on their chart success, the boys told fans: "Guys, we are literally so happy, thank you, to everyone who voted for us and thank you to everyone who bought it as well. Honestly, for four friends who have been doing this by ourselves for a while now, if someone had said six months ago we'd have a song at number one in the iTunes chart we would have just laughed at you. So this is is just... mad." We've got to admit it, it is looking very likely that Rak-Su will win. But we don't want to rely entirely on what the bookies say, especially as a group has only ever won The X Factor once. Combining the X, Y and Z factors So, we decided to take all factors into account to work out which act really is most likely to be crowned champion this year. To do this, we combined the likelihood of each act's category winning, the likelihood of each act's mentor winning, together with the stats provided by the bookies. After all that, we were then able to determine the percentage chance of each act succeeding. So what did our calculations find? Well, it looks like the bookies are right – but not about everything:       ©  Digital Spy While Rak-Su are the clear favourites to win X Factor 2017, our calculations found that both Lloyd and Kevin are ahead of Grace. Even Sam appears to be beating her despite the fact he's tipped to leave the competition this weekend. Frustratingly, the stats also show that Rai-Elle Williams could be set to leave the competition this week, meaning we'll never get to hear her duet with Stormzy . Although she's delivered strong performances week after week, it looks like having Sharon as a mentor, combined with poor odds from the bookies, means she may soon be a goner. Luckily, although our science is obviously spot on, statistics mean nothing to the individual. So really, this could still be anyone's race... The X Factor is on ITV, Saturdays and Sundays.

"Rak-Su will probably win, and those who took the recommended odds at the start of the series can look forward to a profitable show..."    Which acts are left in the show?  In a compressed six-week live-show schedule, one of many changes made to re-invigorate the show, we find ourselves at the Grand Final in record time, with three acts left.  Rak-Su , tipped-up prior to the live shows at [6.00], find themselves as the strong, odds-on favourites at [1.44].  Early favourite, singer-songwriter Grace Davies , is next in the betting at [4.30]. Completing the trio is French singing-contest-reject and initial outsider, Kevin Davy White at [12.00].   Which act will win?  Probably Rak-Su.  They've impressed throughout as charismatic, likeable and talented, qualities required of any X-Factor winner .  They've already topped the iTunes charts, too, with Mona Lisa and with their semi-final version of I'm Feeling You , the original song which they also sang at their first audition.  It's also worth noting that they have contested the Prize Fight in three out of four weeks, winning the last one in a public vote against Grace Davies.  Their only absence came in Week 3, with a weaker performance and the dreaded coffin-slot of singing first.  Plenty of odds-on shots have lost in finals - think Gareth Gates, Rhydian Roberts, Jahmene Douglas and Fleur East - but working in Rak-Su's favour is the venue: the stadium environment of the Excel Centre is much easier to fill with four people cavorting around the stage with a music and dance production.  They are perhaps the only act who won't get lost in it all.   Can anyone beat Rak-Su?  Grace Davies has an obvious following.  At the time of writing she has four songs in the iTunes Top 50, although her best chart position has been number two, with a cover of David Bowie's Life on Mars .  That perhaps sums up her appeal: enough people like her that she was able to win public votes early on, but that fan base has likely not grown as the field has thinned.  She will repel as many voters as she attracts - she falls into the category of "interesting" X Factor acts that never do as well as commentators think they will - and could well get lost on the big stage of this weekend's final.   Who will be first to be eliminated?  Kevin Davy White.  He's talented and likeable enough, but has only reached one Prize Fight in the series, losing in a public vote to the now-eliminated Lloyd Macey.  It's notable that his best chart showing has been a lowly 29, with a Beatles' cover, Come Together .  It will be a surprise if he survives the first elimination of the final.   Verdict  Rak-Su will probably win, and those who took the recommended odds at the start of the series can look forward to a profitable show.  Those odds have long-gone, though, and I won't be getting involved at [1.44].  A better bet is to back Kevin Davy White in the 3rd Place Market at [1.47].  Even if one of the other two acts put in a bum early performance, it's hard to see how their loyal fan bases wouldn't vote them through anyway, which makes Kevin Davy White a near-certainty to leave first.  * This article was originally publised on November 30.
