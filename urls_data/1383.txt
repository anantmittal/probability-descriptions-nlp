The gene that leads to red green color blindness is found in the X Chromosome. Males only have one X chromosome whereas females have 2; typically in females the stronger chromosome takes precedence so they retain correct vision. The son of a woman carrying a faulty gene has a 50% chance of inheriting the faulty X chromosome and as a result – suffering from color blindness. The daughter of the same woman is unlikely to be color blind unless her father is color blind; however she retains a 50% chance of being a carrier for the defective gene.  Blue Color Blindness  Blue color blindness (often referred to as blue yellow color blindness) is extremely rare, so rare that only 5% of color blind people suffer from it. Unlike red green color blindness, the chance of having blue color blindness is equal in both men and women as the gene is found on a different chromosome ( chromosome 7). This gene is shared equally by men and women and blue color blindness comes from a mutation of this gene.  Color Blindness By Nationality  One might expect the percentage of affected people to be relatively constant in all countries however this is far from the truth. In most Caucasian societies up to 1 in 10 men suffer, however only 1 in 100 Eskimos are color blind. There is no solid proof as to the cause of this however it is logical to assume that less of the ‘original Eskimos’ carried the defective gene, so the likelihood of it infecting the gene pool was quite a lot lower.  Developed Color Blindness  Whilst almost all color blindness is inherited, infrequently a change in the chromosome during early development can cause color blindness. Various injuries involving trauma to the eye, and even some diseases can also cause color blindness to develop in a person of any age.  Cataracts  As mentioned elsewhere on this website, cataracts are not a form of color blindness, so you won’t see them in the table below. Cataracts are a clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye, and have the effect to dull colors, and blur vision. It is not common to mistake someone with cataracts as someone who is color blind, as color blindness normally becomes apparent early in life, whereas cataracts don’t usually form until ones senior years.

Jimmy’s dad was holding a handful of balloons, asking his son to name the colors. “Orange?” Jimmy answered. “It’s green,” his father replied.  Jimmy was then handed a pair of color-blindness glasses from EnChroma while onlookers held up balloons and a boldly colored beach towel. As seen in this heartwarming video , Jimmy was moved to tears. He handed the glasses off to his brother Jace, who was similarly overwhelmed. “It’s so bright,” he said.   They might look like sunglasses, but EnChroma’s product actually boosts the saturation of red and green light. That helps to improve color vision in people with red-green color-blindness, the most common color vision deficiency, affecting up to one in 12 men and one in 200 women (a true lack of color vision is very rare).         Most people have three types of color-sensing cones in their eyes: red, green, and blue. The wavelengths of light that these three cones absorb have overlapping regions. Color-blindness is often a result of a malfunctioning cone that causes wavelengths to overlap even more, resulting in poor color discrimination. The EnChroma glasses use a filter to cut out these overlapping wavelengths, allowing for a clearer distinction between colors, especially red and green.  The invention was derived from the work of Don McPherson, who earned his PhD in glass science at Alfred University. McPherson was trying to design protective eye wear for doctors performing laser surgeries. It wasn’t until he let a friend try on the glasses during a game of ultimate Frisbee that he realized the technology’s true potential. McPherson’s friend just happened to be color-blind, and the glasses gave both of them a shock.  That serendipity led to NIH-funded research for helping the color-blind. Early versions of the glasses were unsatisfactory, so McPherson began working with mathematician and computer scientist Andrew Schmeder to help optimize the glasses. In 2010, they cofounded EnChroma, and the first pair of glasses was released in 2012. EnChroma’s glasses cost around $269 for children and $349 for adults.  EnChroma’s website makes it clear that their glasses will not cure color-blindness, much as reading glasses won’t cure farsightedness. But a true cure could someday come in the form of gene therapy to deliver functional genes to the color-responsive cells in the retina. Jay Neitz, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Washington, demonstrated the feasibility of this idea in monkeys back in 2009. And last year he teamed up with Avalanche Biotechnologies to try to move this technology into clinical trials .  Another caveat with EnChroma’s glasses is that they are not recommended for the color vision tests required for certain jobs, including operating ships, planes, and public transportation. A competitor, the ColorCorrection System , calls itself “the world’s only guaranteed color blind treatment that can ensure a passage of the Ishihara Color Test,” one of the most common such tests.  EnChroma is careful to avoid making such claims, but this also highlights the limited use of the product. Some people may find the price tag unjustifiable, but for others the dramatic effects are more than worth it.

But some people really are color blind.  It doesn't mean they can't see any color at all, like a black and white movie. It means that they have trouble seeing the difference between certain colors.         ©Laura Evans from the short documentary No Such Thing As Color  Being color blind can make it tricky to match your shirt and pants, but it's not a serious problem. People who are color blind can do normal stuff, even drive. Most color-blind people can't tell the difference between red or green, but they can learn to respond to the way the traffic signal lights up — the red light is generally on top and green is on the bottom.  Cones and Color  To understand what causes color blindness, you need to know about the cones in your eyes . Cones in your eyes? Yes, but they're very small. These cones are cells on your retina, an area the size of a postage stamp that's at the back of your eye.  You have "red," "blue," and "green" cones, which are sensitive to those colors and combinations of them. You need all three types to see colors properly.  When your cones don't work properly, or you don't have the right combination, your brain doesn't get the right message about which colors you're seeing. To someone who's color blind, a green leaf might look tan or gray.  Color Blindness Is Passed Down  Color blindness is almost always an inherited (say: in-HER-ut-ed) trait, which means you get it from your parents. You get inherited traits through genes (say: jeenz), which determine everything about your body, including how tall you'll be and whether your hair will be straight or curly.  Eye doctors (and some school nurses) test for color blindness by showing a picture made up of different colored dots, like the one above. Someone who can't see the picture or number within the dots may be color blind.  Boys are far more likely to be color blind. In fact, if you know 12 boys, one of them is probably at least a little color blind. So, girls, the next time a boy asks you if something matches, you'd better lend him a hand!

But what about some real life probability numbers concerning color vision deficiency ?  What’s the Chance of Color Blindness?  If you are a teacher you might ask yourself: What is the probability that one of my pupils is colorblind?   And what about the chance to have a color vision deficient pupil if you have only boys in your class?  Your son is maybe colorblind and joining the kindergarten pretty soon. How big is the chance, that there is another colorblind child in his class?   …and he might also play in a soccer team. Will he be the only colorblind boy in the team?  Are you a football coach? What is the probability that one of your players from a team of 33 has a color vision deficiency?   Or you are leading at work a team of eight persons. What’s the chance, that you have a colorblind person in your team?  Let’s say you know 100 persons. The probability that one of them is colorblind has to be pretty high. But how high is it really?   In general, if two people meet, how big is the chance that they are both suffering from color vision deficiency?  Before I will reveal the answers to the questions above or before you can compute it yourself, you need some more input. To calculate probabilities certain assumptions—like a base probability of color blindness or a class size—have to be taken. The results below are therefore based on the following numbers:   Probability of color blindness in men: 8%  Probability of color blindness in women: 0.5%  Average class size: 20 pupils  Group line-up: 50% male – 50% female   Based on this assumptions I calculated the following probabilities of color vision deficiency. Hover over the letters to see the results. But before viewing them, why don’t you try to answer the questions yourself? Just take a guess and have a look how close you can get to the real probabilities of color blindness.  58%  81%  54%  57%  94%  29%  98.7%  0.18%  And in other words:   Almost every teacher or trainer has a colorblind pupil or team member.  If you are colorblind pupil, there is a big chance that there is another colorblind child in your class.  You can almost be sure that you have at least one colorblind friend.  Approximately every 500st handshake is between two colorblind persons.   If you have any further questions, don’t hesitate to contact me or just write a comment on this article.

Most of us share a common color vision sensory experience.  Some people, however, have a color vision deficiency, which means their perception of colors is different from what most of us see.  The most severe forms of these deficiencies are referred to as color blindness. People with color blindness aren’t aware of differences among colors that are obvious to the rest of us.  People who don’t have the more severe types of color blindness may not even be aware of their condition unless they’re tested in a clinic or laboratory.  Inherited color blindness is caused by abnormal photopigments. These color-detecting molecules are located in cone-shaped cells within the retina, called cone cells. In humans, several genes are needed for the body to make photopigments, and defects in these genes can lead to color blindness.  There are three main kinds of color blindness, based on photopigment defects in the three different kinds of cones that respond to blue, green, and red light.  Red-green color blindness is the most common, followed by blue-yellow color blindness. A complete absence of color vision —total color blindness – is rare.  Sometimes color blindness can be caused by physical or chemical damage to the eye, the optic nerve, or parts of the brain that process color information. Color vision can also decline with age, most often because of cataract - a clouding and yellowing of the eye’s lens.  Who gets color blindness?  As many as 8 percent of men and 0.5 percent of women with Northern European ancestry have the common form of red-green color blindness.  Men are much more likely to be colorblind than women because the genes responsible for the most common, inherited color blindness are on the X chromosome.  Males only have one X chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. In females, a functional gene on only one of the X chromosomes is enough to compensate for the loss on the other. This kind of inheritance pattern is called X-linked, and primarily affects males. Inherited color blindness can be present at birth, begin in childhood, or not appear until the adult years.   How Genes are Inherited  Genes are bundled together on structures called chromosomes. One copy of each chromosome is passed by a parent at conception through egg and sperm cells. The X and Y chromosomes, known as sex chromosomes, determine whether a person is born female (XX) or male (XY) and also carry other traits not related to gender.  In X-linked inheritance, the mother carries the mutated gene on one of her X chromosomes and will pass on the mutated gene to 50 percent of her children.  Because females have two X chromosomes, the effect of a mutation on one X chromosome is offset by the normal gene on the other X chromosome.  In this case the mother will not have the disease, but she can pass on the mutated gene and so is called a carrier. If a mother is a carrier of an X-linked disease (and the father is not affected), there is a:  1 in 2 chance that a son will have the disease,  1 in 2 chance that a daughter will be a carrier of the disease,  No chance that a daughter will have the disease.  In autosomal recessive inheritance, it takes two copies of the mutant gene to give rise to the disease.  An individual who has one copy of a recessive gene mutation is known as a carrier.  When two carriers have a child, there is a:  1 in 4 chance of having a child with the disease,  1 in 2 chance of having a child who is a carrier,  1 in 4 chance of having a child who neither has the disease nor is a carrier.  In autosomal dominant inheritance, it takes just one copy of the mutant gene to bring about the disease.  When an affected parent with one dominant gene mutation has a child, there is a 1 in 2 chance that a child will inherit the disease.   How do we see color?  Normal Human Retina  What color is a strawberry? Most of us would say red, but do we all see the same red? Color vision depends on our eyes and brain working together to perceive different properties of light.  We see the natural and artificial light that illuminates our world as white, although it is actually a mixture of colors that, perceived on their own, would span the visual spectrum from deep blue to deep red.  You can see this when rain separates sunlight into a rainbow or a glass prism separates white light into a multi-color band. The color of light is determined by its wavelength . Longer wavelength corresponds to red light and shorter wavelength corresponds to blue light.  Strawberries and other objects reflect some wavelengths of light and absorb others. The reflected light we perceive as color.  So, a strawberry is red because its surface is only reflecting the long wavelengths we see as red and absorbing the others. An object appears white when it reflects all wavelengths and black when it absorbs all wavelengths.  Vision begins when light enters the eye and the cornea and lens focus it onto the retina, a thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye that contains millions of light-sensitive cells called photoreceptors. Some photoreceptors are shaped like rods and some are shaped like cones.  In each eye there are many more rods than cones – approximately 120 million rods compared to only 6 million cones. Rods and cones both contain photopigment molecules that undergo a chemical change when they absorb light. This chemical change acts like an on-switch, triggering electrical signals that are then passed from the retina to the visual parts of the brain.  Rods and cones are different in how they respond to light.  Rods are more responsive to dim light, which makes them useful for night vision.  Cones are more responsive to bright light, such as in the daytime when light is plentiful.  Another important difference is that all rods contain only one photopigment, while cones contain one of three different photopigments. This makes cones sensitive to long (red), medium (green), or short (blue) wavelengths of light.  The presence of three types of photopigments, each sensitive to a different part of the visual spectrum, is what gives us our rich color vision.  Humans are unusual among mammals for our trichromatic vision – named for the three different types of photopigments we have. Most mammals, including dogs, have just two photopigment types. Other creatures, such as butterflies, have more than three. They may be able to see colors we can only imagine.  Most of us have a full set of the three different cone photopigments and so we share a very similar color vision experience, but because the human eye and brain together translate light into color, each of us sees colors differently. The differences may be slight. Your blue may be more blue than someone else’s, or in the case of color blindness, your red and green may be someone else’s brown.  What are the different types of color blindness?  The most common types of color blindness are inherited. They are the result of defects in the genes that contain the instructions for making the photopigments found in cones. Some defects alter the photopigment’s sensitivity to color, for example, it might be slightly more sensitive to deeper red and less sensitive to green. Other defects can result in the total loss of a photopigment. Depending on the type of defect and the cone that is affected problems can arise with red, green, or blue color vision.  Red-Green Color Blindness  The most common types of hereditary color blindness are due to the loss or limited function of red cone (known as protan) or green cone (deutran) photopigments. This kind of color blindness is commonly referred to as red-green color blindness.  Protanomaly: In males with protanomaly, the red cone photopigment is abnormal.  Red, orange, and yellow appear greener and colors are not as bright.  This condition is mild and doesn’t usually interfere with daily living. Protanomaly is an X-linked disorder estimated to affect 1 percent of males.  Protanopia: In males with protanopia, there are no working red cone cells.  Red appears as black.  Certain shades of orange, yellow, and green all appear as yellow. Protanopia is an X-linked disorder that is estimated to affect 1 percent of males.  Deuteranomaly: In males with deuteranomaly, the green cone photopigment is abnormal.  Yellow and green appear redder and it is difficult to tell violet from blue. This condition is mild and doesn’t interfere with daily living.  Deuteranomaly is the most common form of color blindness and is an X-linked disorder affecting 5 percent of males.  Deuteranopia: In males with deuteranopia, there are no working green cone cells. They tend to see reds as brownish-yellow and greens as beige. Deuteranopia is an X-linked disorder that affects about 1 percent of males.  Blue-Yellow Color Blindness  Blue-yellow color blindness is rarer than red-green color blindness. Blue-cone (tritan) photopigments are either missing or have limited function.  Tritanomaly: People with tritanomaly have functionally limited blue cone cells. Blue appears greener and it can be difficult to tell yellow and red from pink. Tritanomaly is extremely rare. It is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting males and females equally.  Tritanopia: People with tritanopia, also known as blue-yellow color blindness, lack blue cone cells. Blue appears green and yellow appears violet or light grey. Tritanopia is an extremely rare autosomal recessive disorder affecting males and females equally.  Complete color blindness  People with complete color blindness (monochromacy) don’t experience color at all and the clearness of their vision (visual acuity) may also be affected.  There are two types of monochromacy:  Cone monochromacy: This rare form of color blindness results from a failure of two of the three cone cell photopigments to work. There is red cone monochromacy, green cone monochromacy, and blue cone monochromacy.  People with cone monochromacy have trouble distinguishing colors because the brain needs to compare the signals from different types of cones in order to see color. When only one type of cone works, this comparison isn’t possible.  People with blue cone monochromacy, may also have reduced visual acuity, near-sightedness, and uncontrollable eye movements, a condition known as nystagmus. Cone monochromacy is an autosomal recessive disorder.  Rod monochromacy or achromatopsia: This type of monochromacy is rare and is the most severe form of color blindness. It is present at birth. None of the cone cells have functional photopigments. Lacking all cone vision, people with rod monochromacy see the world in black, white, and gray. And since rods respond to dim light, people with rod monochromacy tend to be photophobic – very uncomfortable in bright environments.  They also experience nystagmus.  Rod monochromacy is an autosomal recessive disorder.  How is color blindness diagnosed?  Color vision testing  Eye care professionals use a variety of tests to diagnose color blindness. These tests can quickly diagnose specific types of color blindness.  The Ishihara Color Test is the most common test for red-green color blindness. The test consists of a series of colored circles, called Ishihara plates, each of which contains a collection of dots in different colors and sizes. Within the circle are dots that form a shape clearly visible to those with normal color vision, but invisible or difficult to see for those with red-green color blindness.  The newer Cambridge Color Test uses a visual array similar to the Ishihara plates, except displayed on a computer monitor. The goal is to identify a C shape that is different in color from the background. The “C” is presented randomly in one of four orientations. When test-takers see the “C,” they are asked to press one of four keys that correspond to the orientation.  The anomaloscope uses a test in which two different light sources have to be matched in color. Looking through the eyepiece, the viewer sees a circle. The upper half is a yellow light that can be adjusted in brightness. The lower half is a combination of red and green lights that can be mixed in variable proportions. The viewer uses one knob to adjust the brightness of the top half, and another to adjust the color of the lower half. The goal is to make the upper and lower halves the same brightness and color.  The HRR Pseudoisochromatic Color Test is another red-green color blindness test that uses color plates to test for color blindness.  The Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test uses a set of blocks or pegs that are roughly the same color but in different hues (shades of the color). The goal is to arrange them in a line in order of hue.  This test measures the ability to discriminate subtle color changes. It is used by industries that depend on the accurate color perception of its employees, such as graphic design, photography, and food quality inspection.  The Farnsworth Lantern Test is used by the U.S. military to determine the severity of color blindness.  Those with mild forms pass the test and are allowed to serve in the armed forces.  Are there treatments for color blindness?  There is no cure for color blindness. However, people with red-green color blindness may be able to use a special set of lenses to help them perceive colors more accurately. These lenses can only be used outdoors under bright lighting conditions. Visual aids have also been developed to help people cope with color blindness. There are iPhone and iPad apps, for example, that help people with color blindness discriminate among colors. Some of these apps allow users to snap a photo and tap it anywhere on the image to see the color of that area. More sophisticated apps allow users to find out both color and shades of color. These kinds of apps can be helpful in selecting ripe fruits such as bananas, or finding complementary colors when picking out clothing.  How does color blindness affect daily life?  Color blindness can make it difficult to read color-coded information such as bar graphs and pie charts.  This can be particularly troubling for children who aren’t yet diagnosed with color blindness, since educational materials are often color-coded. Children with red-green color blindness may also have difficulty reading a green chalkboard when yellow chalk is used.  Art classes, which require selecting appropriate colors of paint or crayons, may be challenging.  Color blindness can go undetected for some time since children will often try to hide their disorder. It’s important to have children tested, particularly boys, if there is a family history of color blindness. Many school systems offer vision screening tests that include color blindness testing. Once a child is diagnosed, he or she can learn to ask for help with tasks that require color recognition.  Simple everyday tasks like cooking meat to the desired color or selecting ripe produce can be a challenge for adults. Children might find food without bright color as less appetizing. Traffic lights pose challenges, since they have to be read by the position of the light. Since most lights are vertical, with green on bottom and red on top, if a light is positioned horizontally, a color blind person has to do a quick mental rotation to read it.  Reading maps or buying clothes that match colors can also be difficult. However, these are relatively minor inconveniences and most people with color blindness learn to adapt.  What research is being done?  NEI-supported researchers have used gene therapy to cure color blindness in adult monkeys. While red-green color blindness affects about 8 percent of Northern European-descended men, it affects all adult male squirrel monkeys because males of the species carry either the gene that makes red photopigment or the gene that makes green photopigment, but never both.  The researchers injected the red photopigment gene into the retinas of male monkeys born without it.  The gene was targeted to green cones and allowed those cells to respond to red light. The monkeys were able to see with full three-color (trichromatic) vision. This shows that even though the monkeys’ red cones had been absent from birth, the brain circuitry for detecting red was still in place—offering hope that a similar approach could help people who’ve been colorblind since birth.  In another study, NEI-supported researchers were able to restore some color perception in an animal model of rod monochromacy (in which all three cone types are missing), using a gene therapy approach in younger animals. The therapy combined gene delivery with the addition of neurotrophic factors – molecules that are known to help nerve cells grow. Further studies will be testing whether the therapy could be safe and effective in humans.  An ongoing NEI clinical trial is testing whether treatment with a growth factor alone could be enough to improve or restore visual function of cone cells in people. This has the potential to help people with color blindness, as well as diseases that are the result of the loss of cones or cone function.  Researchers supported by NEI are also studying how cones develop in the retina and how they are maintained and preserved throughout the lifespan. This research could lead to therapies for color-blindness that occurs during childhood or later in life due to the gradual loss of cones.

Conditions          Back to Conditions           English   Español       My mom’s brother is color blind but my mother and I are not. Because color blindness is sex linked and generally passed to males by the mother, if I have a boy will he be color blind for certain?  (I am female.)        -An undergraduate from Texas   September 12, 2013  No not for certain.  Even if your mom did end up getting the gene from your grandmother and you ended up getting it from your mom, your sons would still not automatically be color blind.  They would each have a 50% chance.  As you can see, a lot has to happen for your sons to have even a chance at being color blind!  Your mom had a 50% chance of inheriting the colorblind gene from her mom.  If she got it, then you had a 50% chance of getting it too.  And if you got it, then each of your kids has a 50% chance of getting it as well.  Because of how color blindness works, only your sons that got the gene would end up color blind (assuming your partner isn’t color blind).  That last point in parentheses is an important one.  Men always pass the color blind gene to their daughters but the daughters end up color blind only under the right circumstances.  For example, if your uncle married a woman who carried the color blind gene, then each of their sons and daughters would have a 50% chance of being color blind.  In this case, it would look like the man, your uncle, passed his colorblindness down to his kids.  And if your uncle married one of those rare color blind women, then all of their kids would be color blind.  Your aunt, uncle and all your cousins would all not be able to tell red from green.  Color blindness is not an easy trait to follow!  It is more than mom passing it to her sons.  To understand all of this, we need to take a step back and look at how we inherit our genes.  Then we’ll be able to understand why your sons actually have a pretty good shot at being able to tell red from green.   X-linked Traits  Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46.  We each get one set of 23 from our moms and one set of 23 from our dads.  Sprinkled throughout these chromosomes are the instructions for building and running each of us.  These instructions mostly come in the form of genes.  Each of these genes has the instructions for one small part of you.  One might tell your eyes how much pigment to make and so determine whether or not you’ll have brown eyes.  And another might determine whether or not you have a certain receptor in your eye that lets you tell red from green.  This last gene is the one behind being color blind.  It comes in two different versions—a working version and a nonworking one.  If you have only nonworking versions, then you are color blind.  What this means is that you only need one working copy to be able to tell red from green.  This is where boys get into trouble…  As you may already know, boys have an X and a Y chromosome and girls have two X’s.  Besides deciding whether you’re a boy or a girl , this also means that boys have one copy of the red-green receptor gene while girls have two.  And this matters because, as I said, you need just one working copy to be able to tell red from green.  So if a girl gets a nonworking copy of this receptor gene from just one parent, she’ll be able to tell red from green.  The same is not true for her brother.  One bad copy means color blindness for him.  What I want to do next is flesh this out with a few examples.  First we’ll go through your example and see where all those 50%’s came from.  Then we’ll end it with a couple more examples that will help explain why, for example, a color blind dad can only pass his broken genes to his daughters.  And why a color blind mom means that all her sons will be color blind too.   Your Example  I’ll start with what might happen in your case…two parents who aren’t color blind having a son that is.  Let’s figure out what is going on in this situation.  If these two have a color blind son, then we know what each of these parents’ X chromosomes most likely looks like (at least with regard to the red-green receptor gene).  We know that dad has a working copy of the red-green receptor and mom has one working and one nonworking copy.  You’ll see below why we know this.  The way I will represent people in this answer is with a big XY for dads and sons and a big XX for mothers and daughters.  They’ll look something like this:    I’ll use different colors to tell an X that can lead to color blindness from an X that can’t.  If the X has a red-green receptor gene that works, then it will be red.  If the X has a nonworking copy, then it will be gray.  So a color blind dad would look like this:    Notice that his X is gray.  Since this is the only X he has, he is color blind because he has no working copies of the red-green receptor gene.  (We can ignore his Y.)  Here is what a mom who can see color but carries a color blind gene would look like:    Even though she has a gray X (one that has a nonworking red-green receptor gene), she can still tell red from green because of her red X.  That X has a working copy of the gene and so keeps color blindness away.  The genetic term that describes traits like color blindness is “ X-linked recessive .”  X-linked because it is on the X chromosome and recessive because a different version can dominate it.  The working version hides the nonworking one.  Now we are ready to do an example.  Let’s say that a carrier woman and a man that can tell red from green get married and have kids.  These are the four possible kids in terms of their X and Y chromosomes:    Let’s go through this in a little detail to figure out where each possibility came from.  As I said before, we inherit one of each pair of chromosomes from our mom and one from our dad.  What I didn’t say was that which one you get is random.  For example, you have a 50% chance of getting a Y from dad and a 50% chance of getting his X.  (This is why couples have a 50% chance for a boy and a 50% chance for girl.)  So brother 1 (B1), got mom’s gray X and dad’s Y and brother 2 (B2) got mom’s red X and dad’s Y.  These are the only two possible sons that can come out of this.  The same sort of thing happened with the two sisters.  Each got dad’s red X but sister 1 (S1) got mom’s gray X and sister 2 (S2) got mom’s red X.  Now we can see who is and isn’t color blind.  First off, since brother 2 and sister 2 don’t have a gray chromosome, they are not color blind.  They each only have working copies of the red-green receptor gene. The same is not true for brother 1 and sister 1.  Brother 1 and sister 1 both have a gray X but only brother 1 is color blind.  This is because sister 2 has a red X that can provide the working gene needed to tell red from green.  This is where the 50% chance for boys comes from.  If you are a carrier and your partner is not color blind, then this situation applies to you.  OK now let’s see what has to happen for you to be in this situation.  This is a big one:    As you can see, the gray X had to pass from grandmother to mother to you for your sons to even have a chance at being color blind.  If your mom actually had two red X’s like her hypothetical sister on her left, then you couldn’t get a gray.  You would not have a color blind son.  Even if your mom did get your grandmother’s gray X, she would still need to pass it to you for you to be able to pass it to your kids.  If instead she passed her red X to you, then again, none of your kids would be color blind.  This is a big reason why it is not for certain that your sons will be color blind.  You may not even have inherited the color blindness gene.  And even if you did get that gray X, each of your sons would still only have a 50% chance at being color blind.  Even in the “worst” case scenario, your sons will not automatically be color blind.  What I’ll do now is a couple more examples to show a situation where sons and daughters have a 50% chance of being color blind and another where all the kids are color blind.  As you’ll see, these depend on dad being color blind.   A Couple More Examples  Let’s start off with a color blind dad and a carrier mom.  Here are the four possibilities for their kids:    As you can see, dad has a gray X and so does mom.  Of course, only dad is color blind because mom has a red X that can give her enough receptors to tell red from green.  A quick look shows that each son has a 50% chance of being color blind.  The color blind son ended up that way because he got mom’s gray X…dad can’t pass his X to his sons.  If he did, then the son would be a daughter.  Dad will always pass his gray X to his daughters.  Otherwise they’d get a Y and be boys!  Since mom is a carrier, each daughter has a 50% chance to get a gray X and a 50% chance to get a red one from her.  If she gets a gray from mom, she will end up with two gray X’s because of dad.  She will be color blind.  So in this case, each of this couple’s children has a 50% chance for being color blind.  It doesn’t look anything like mom passing her color blindness to her kids.  As the final example, let’s imagine our color blind girl grows up and has children with a color blind man.  Here are the four possibilities for their kids:    A pretty boring family tree!  All black and grays and no reds…  Since there are only gray X’s in this family, all the kids end up with just gray X’s.  All the kids will be color blind.  Now if you feel up to it, here is one for you to solve:    What are the odds that each child has for being color blind?  Is it different for sons and daughters?  Click here to get the answer.

My dad is red-green colorblind, so my DS  (dear son) had the same 50/50 chance.  He's not quite 2 yet, so hasn't been formally tested, but I think he's not colorblind.  He can tell his red and green toys apart :)               Reply            Report this comment       0                     Beckyjoe1012    Posted 08/23/2009      I am color bllind.. which appears to be rare for women. My hubby and his bro are colorblind which i believe comes from their father... and i am pretty sure it came from my dad too... So with both my hubby and I being colorblind i assume their is prob a good chance that our son maybe as well... I know there are different kinds of colorblindness.. My hubby is the most common.. red/green... i am not.. its like blue/green..blue/yellow or something like that.

I am also a high school biology teacher, with a B.S. in Biological Sciences.  Color blindness is carried on the x-chromosomes.  My mom is a carrier and almost all of my brothers are color blind (except 1).  And I am not color blind, since my dad isn't.  If a woman is color blind, then she will pass on the gene to all of her children.    --  ~ Steph ~ DD Angelica (9),  DS Blaise (1), EDD October 22, 2011, Married to my love Eric for over 4 years now!

For color blindness in other species, see Color vision . For other uses, see Colour blind (disambiguation) .    Color blindness    Synonyms  Colour blindness, color deficiency, impaired color vision [1]       Example of an Ishihara color test plate . With properly configured computer displays, people with normal vision should see the number "74". Many people who are color blind see it as "21", and those with total color blindness may not see any numbers.    Specialty  Ophthalmology    Symptoms  Decreased ability to see colors [2]    Duration  Long term [2]    Causes  Genetic ( inherited usually X-linked ) [2]    Diagnostic method  Ishihara color test [2]    Treatment  Adjustments to teaching methods, mobile apps [1] [2]    Frequency  Red-green: 8% males, 0.5% females (Northern European descent) [2]    Color blindness , also known as color vision deficiency , is the decreased ability to see color or differences in color . [2] Color blindness can make some educational activities difficult. [2] Buying fruit, picking clothing, and reading traffic lights can be more challenging, for example. [2] Problems, however, are generally minor and most people adapt. [2] People with total color blindness , however, may also have decreased visual acuity and be uncomfortable in bright environments. [2]  The most common cause of color blindness is an inherited fault in the development of one or more of the three sets of color sensing cones in the eye. [2] Males are more likely to be color blind than females, as the genes responsible for the most common forms of color blindness are on the X chromosome . [2] As females have two X chromosomes, a defect in one is typically compensated for by the other, while males only have one X chromosome. [2] Color blindness can also result from physical or chemical damage to the eye , optic nerve , or parts of the brain . [2] Diagnosis is typically with the Ishihara color test ; however a number of other testing methods also exist. [2]  There is no cure for color blindness. [2] Diagnosis may allow a person's teacher to change their method of teaching to accommodate the decreased ability to recognize colors. [1] Special lenses may help people with red–green color blindness when under bright conditions. [2] There are also mobile apps that can help people identify colors. [2]  Red–green color blindness is the most common form, followed by blue–yellow color blindness and total color blindness. [2] Red–green color blindness affects up to 8% of males and 0.5% of females of Northern European descent. [2] The ability to see color also decreases in old age. [2] Being color blind may make people ineligible for certain jobs in certain countries. [1] This may include pilot , train driver , and armed forces . [1] The effect of color blindness on artistic ability, however, is controversial. [1] The ability to draw appears to be unchanged and a number of famous artists are believed to have been color blind.

In practice, this means that they often retain a limited discrimination along the red–green axis of color space, although their ability to separate colors in this dimension is reduced. Color blindness very rarely refers to complete monochromatism. [3]  Dichromats often confuse red and green items. For example, they may find it difficult to distinguish a Braeburn apple from a Granny Smith or red from green of traffic lights without other clues—for example, shape or position. Dichromats tend to learn to use texture and shape clues and so may be able to penetrate camouflage that has been designed to deceive individuals with normal color vision. [4]  Colors of traffic lights are confusing to some dichromats as there is insufficient apparent difference between the red/amber traffic lights and sodium street lamps; also, the green can be confused with a grubby white lamp. This is a risk on high-speed undulating roads where angular cues cannot be used. British Rail color lamp signals use more easily identifiable colors: The red is blood red, the amber is yellow and the green is a bluish color. Most British road traffic lights are mounted vertically on a black rectangle with a white border (forming a "sighting board") and so dichromats can more easily look for the position of the light within the rectangle—top, middle or bottom. In the eastern provinces of Canada horizontally mounted traffic lights are generally differentiated by shape to facilitate identification for those with color blindness. [ citation needed ] In the United States, this is not done by shape but by position, as the red light is always on the left if the light is horizontal, or on top if the light is vertical. However, a lone flashing light (e.g. red for stop, yellow for caution) is still problematic.         Normal sight           Deuteranopia sight           Tritanopia sight           Monochromacy sight      Causes [ edit ]  Color vision deficiencies can be classified as acquired or inherited.   Acquired: Diseases, drugs (e.g., Plaquenil ), and chemicals may cause color blindness. [5] [6]  Inherited: There are three types of inherited or congenital color vision deficiencies: monochromacy, dichromacy, and anomalous trichromacy.  Monochromacy , also known as "total color blindness", is the lack of ability to distinguish colors (and thus the person views everything as if it were on a black and white television); caused by cone defect or absence. Monochromacy occurs when two or all three of the cone pigments are missing and color and lightness vision is reduced to one dimension.  Rod monochromacy (achromatopsia) is an exceedingly rare, nonprogressive inability to distinguish any colors as a result of absent or nonfunctioning retinal cones. It is associated with light sensitivity ( photophobia ), involuntary eye oscillations ( nystagmus ), and poor vision.  Cone monochromacy is a rare total color blindness that is accompanied by relatively normal vision, electroretinogram, and electrooculogram. Cone monochromacy can also be a result of having more than one type of dichromatic color blindness. People who have, for instance, both protanopia and tritanopia are considered to have cone monochromacy. Since cone monochromacy is the lack of/damage of more than one cone in retinal environment, having two types of dichromacy would be an equivalent.    Dichromacy is a moderately severe color vision defect in which one of the three basic color mechanisms is absent or not functioning. It is hereditary and, in the case of protanopia or deuteranopia, sex-linked, affecting predominantly males. Dichromacy occurs when one of the cone pigments is missing and color is reduced to two dimensions. Dichromacy conditions are labeled based on whether the "first" ( Greek : prot- , referring to the red photoreceptors), "second" ( deuter- , the green), or "third" ( trit- , the blue) photoreceptors are affected.  Protanopia is a severe type of color vision deficiency caused by the complete absence of red retinal photoreceptors. Protans have difficulties distinguishing between blue and green colors and also between red and green colors. It is a form of dichromatism in which the subject can only perceive light wavelengths from 400 to 650 nm, instead of the usual 700 nm. Pure reds cannot be seen, instead appearing black; purple colors cannot be distinguished from blues; more orange-tinted reds may appear as very dim yellows, and all orange–yellow–green shades of too long a wavelength to stimulate the blue receptors appear as a similar yellow hue. It is hereditary, sex-linked, and present in 1% of males.  Deuteranopia is a type of color vision deficiency where the green photoreceptors are absent. It affects hue discrimination in the same way as protanopia, but without the dimming effect. Like protanopia, it is hereditary, sex-linked, and found in about 1% of the male population. [7]  Tritanopia is a very rare color vision disturbance in which there are only two cone pigments present and a total absence of blue retinal receptors. Blues appear greenish, yellows and oranges appear pinkish, and purple colors appear deep red. It is related to chromosome 7. Unlike protanopia and deuteranopia, tritanopia and tritanomaly are not sex-linked traits and can be acquired rather than inherited and can be reversed in some cases.    Anomalous trichromacy is a common type of inherited color vision deficiency, occurring when one of the three cone pigments is altered in its spectral sensitivity.  Protanomaly is a mild color vision defect in which an altered spectral sensitivity of red retinal receptors (closer to green receptor response) results in poor red–green hue discrimination. It is hereditary, sex-linked, and present in 1% of males. The difference with protanopia is that in this case the L-cone is present but malfunctioning, whereas in the earlier the L-cone is completely missing. [8]  Deuteranomaly, caused by a similar shift in the green retinal receptors, is by far the most common type of color vision deficiency, mildly affecting red–green hue discrimination in 5% of European males. It is hereditary and sex-linked. The difference with deuteranopia is that in this case the green sensitive cones are not missing but malfunctioning. [9]  Tritanomaly is a rare, hereditary color vision deficiency affecting blue–green and yellow–red/pink hue discrimination. It is related to chromosome "7". [10] The difference is that the S-cone is malfunctioning but not missing. [11]       Genetics [ edit ]     X-linked recessive inheritance    Color blindness is typically an inherited genetic disorder. It is most commonly inherited from mutations on the X chromosome but the mapping of the human genome has shown there are many causative mutations—mutations capable of causing color blindness originate from at least 19 different chromosomes and 56 different genes (as shown online at the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)). Two of the most common inherited forms of color blindness are protanomaly (and, more rarely, protanopia – the two together often known as "protans") and deuteranomaly (or, more rarely, deuteranopia – the two together often referred to as "deutans"). [12] Both "protans" and "deutans" (of which the deutans are by far the most common) are known as "red–green color-blind" which is present in about 8 percent of human males and 0.6 percent of females of Northern European ancestry. [13]  Some of the inherited diseases known to cause color blindness are:   cone dystrophy  cone-rod dystrophy  achromatopsia (a.k.a. rod monochromatism, stationary cone dystrophy or cone dysfunction syndrome)  blue cone monochromatism (a.k.a. blue cone monochromacy or X-linked achromatopsia)  Leber's congenital amaurosis  retinitis pigmentosa (initially affects rods but can later progress to cones and therefore color blindness).   Inherited color blindness can be congenital (from birth), or it can commence in childhood or adulthood. Depending on the mutation, it can be stationary, that is, remain the same throughout a person's lifetime, or progressive. As progressive phenotypes involve deterioration of the retina and other parts of the eye, certain forms of color blindness can progress to legal blindness, i.e., an acuity of 6/60 (20/200) or worse, and often leave a person with complete blindness.  Color blindness always pertains to the cone photoreceptors in retinas, as the cones are capable of detecting the color frequencies of light.  About 8 percent of males, and 0.6 percent of females, are red-green color blind in some way or another, whether it is one color, a color combination, or another mutation. [14] The reason males are at a greater risk of inheriting an X linked mutation is that males only have one X chromosome (XY, with the Y chromosome carrying altogether different genes than the X chromosome), and females have two (XX); if a woman inherits a normal X chromosome in addition to the one that carries the mutation, she will not display the mutation. Men do not have a second X chromosome to override the chromosome that carries the mutation. If 8% of variants of a given gene are defective, the probability of a single copy being defective is 8%, but the probability that two copies are both defective is 0.08 × 0.08 = 0.0064, or just 0.64%.  Other causes [ edit ]  Other causes of color blindness include brain or retinal damage caused by shaken baby syndrome , accidents and other trauma which produce swelling of the brain in the occipital lobe, and damage to the retina caused by exposure to ultraviolet light (10–300 nm). Damage often presents itself later on in life.  Color blindness may also present itself in the spectrum of degenerative diseases of the eye, such as age-related macular degeneration , and as part of the retinal damage caused by diabetes . Another factor that may affect color blindness includes a deficiency in Vitamin A . [15]  Some subtle forms of colorblindness may be associated with chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy (CSE), caused by longtime exposure to solvent vapors. [16]  Red–green color blindness can be caused by ethambutol , [17] a drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis .  Types [ edit ]     These color charts show how different colorblind people see compared to a person with normal color vision.    Based on clinical appearance, color blindness may be described as total or partial. Total color blindness is much less common than partial color blindness. [18] There are two major types of color blindness: those who have difficulty distinguishing between red and green, and who have difficulty distinguishing between blue and yellow. [19] [20]  Immunofluorescent imaging is a way to determine red–green color coding. Conventional color coding is difficult for individuals with red–green color blindness (protanopia or deuteranopia) to discriminate. Replacing red with magenta or green with turquoise improves visibility for such individuals. [21]  The different kinds of inherited color blindness result from partial or complete loss of function of one or more of the different cone systems. When one cone system is compromised, dichromacy results. The most frequent forms of human color blindness result from problems with either the middle or long wavelength sensitive cone systems, and involve difficulties in discriminating reds, yellows, and greens from one another. They are collectively referred to as "red–green color blindness", though the term is an over-simplification and is somewhat misleading. Other forms of color blindness are much more rare. They include problems in discriminating blues from greens and yellows from reds/pinks, and the rarest forms of all, complete color blindness or monochromacy , where one cannot distinguish any color from grey , as in a black-and-white movie or photograph.  Protanopes, deuteranopes, and tritanopes are dichromats; that is, they can match any color they see with some mixture of just two primary colors (whereas normally humans are trichromats and require three primary colors). These individuals normally know they have a color vision problem and it can affect their lives on a daily basis. Two percent of the male population exhibit severe difficulties distinguishing between red, orange, yellow, and green. A certain pair of colors, that seem very different to a normal viewer, appear to be the same color (or different shades of same color) for such a dichromat. The terms protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia come from Greek and literally mean "inability to see ( anopia ) with the first ( prot- ), second ( deuter- ), or third ( trit- ) [cone]", respectively.  Anomalous trichromacy is the least serious type of color deficiency. [22] People with protanomaly, deuteranomaly, or tritanomaly are trichromats, but the color matches they make differ from the normal. They are called anomalous trichromats. In order to match a given spectral yellow light, protanomalous observers need more red light in a red/green mixture than a normal observer, and deuteranomalous observers need more green. From a practical standpoint though, many protanomalous and deuteranomalous people have very little difficulty carrying out tasks that require normal color vision. Some may not even be aware that their color perception is in any way different from normal.  Protanomaly and deuteranomaly can be diagnosed using an instrument called an anomaloscope , which mixes spectral red and green lights in variable proportions, for comparison with a fixed spectral yellow. If this is done in front of a large audience of males, as the proportion of red is increased from a low value, first a small proportion of the audience will declare a match, while most will see the mixed light as greenish; these are the deuteranomalous observers. Next, as more red is added the majority will say that a match has been achieved. Finally, as yet more red is added, the remaining, protanomalous, observers will declare a match at a point where normal observers will see the mixed light as definitely reddish. [ citation needed ]  Red–green color blindness [ edit ]  Protanopia, deuteranopia, protanomaly, and deuteranomaly are commonly inherited forms of red–green color blindness which affect a substantial portion of the human population. Those affected have difficulty with discriminating red and green hues due to the absence or mutation of the red or green retinal photoreceptors. [12] [23] It is sex-linked : genetic red–green color blindness affects males much more often than females, because the genes for the red and green color receptors are located on the X chromosome , of which males have only one and females have two. Females (46, XX) are red–green color blind only if both their X chromosomes are defective with a similar deficiency, whereas males (46, XY) are color blind if their single X chromosome is defective. [24]  The gene for red–green color blindness is transmitted from a color blind male to all his daughters who are heterozygote carriers and are usually unaffected. In turn, a carrier woman has a fifty percent chance of passing on a mutated X chromosome region to each of her male offspring. The sons of an affected male will not inherit the trait from him, since they receive his Y chromosome and not his (defective) X chromosome. Should an affected male have children with a carrier or colorblind woman, their daughters may be colorblind by inheriting an affected X chromosome from each parent. [24]  Because one X chromosome is inactivated at random in each cell during a woman's development, deuteranomalous heterozygotes (i.e. female carriers of deuteranomaly) are potentially tetrachromats , because they will have the normal long wave (red) receptors, the normal medium wave (green) receptors, the abnormal medium wave (deuteranomalous) receptors and the normal autosomal short wave (blue) receptors in their retinas. [25] [26] [27] The same applies to the carriers of protanomaly (who have two types of short wave receptors, normal medium wave receptors, and normal autosomal short wave receptors in their retinas). If, by chance, a woman is heterozygous for both protanomaly and deuteranomaly she could be pentachromatic. This situation could arise if, for instance, she inherited the X chromosome with the abnormal long wave gene (but normal medium wave gene) from her mother who is a carrier of protanomaly, and her other X chromosome from a deuteranomalous father. Such a woman would have a normal and an abnormal long wave receptor, a normal and abnormal medium wave receptor, and a normal autosomal short wave receptor – 5 different types of color receptors in all. The degree to which women who are carriers of either protanomaly or deuteranomaly are demonstrably tetrachromatic and require a mixture of four spectral lights to match an arbitrary light is very variable. In many cases it is almost unnoticeable, but in a minority the tetrachromacy is very pronounced. [25] [26] [27] However, Jameson et al. [28] have shown that with appropriate and sufficiently sensitive equipment all female carriers of red-green color blindness (i.e. heterozygous protanomaly, or heterozygous deuteranomaly) are tetrachromats to a greater or lesser extent.  Since deuteranomaly is by far the most common form of red-green blindness among men of northwestern European descent (with an incidence of 8%), then the carrier frequency (and of potential deuteranomalous tetrachromacy ) among the females of that genetic stock is 14.7% (= [92% x 8%] x 2 ). [24]     Illustration of the distribution of cone cells in the fovea of an individual with normal color vision (left), and a color blind (protanopic) retina. The center of the fovea holds very few blue-sensitive cones.      Protanopia (1% of males): Lacking the red cones for long-wavelength sensitive retinal cones, those with this condition are unable to distinguish between colors in the green – yellow – red section of the spectrum. They have a neutral point at a cyan -like wavelength around 492 nm (see spectral color for comparison) – that is, they cannot discriminate light of this wavelength from white . For a protanope, the brightness of red, orange, and yellow are much reduced compared to normal. This dimming can be so pronounced that reds may be confused with black or dark gray, and red traffic lights may appear to be extinguished. They may learn to distinguish reds from yellows primarily on the basis of their apparent brightness or lightness, not on any perceptible hue difference. Violet , lavender, and purple are indistinguishable from various shades of blue because their reddish components are so dimmed as to be invisible. For example, pink flowers, reflecting both red light and blue light, may appear just blue to the protanope. A very few people have been found who have one normal eye and one protanopic eye. These unilateral dichromats report that with only their protanopic eye open, they see wavelengths shorter than neutral point as blue and those longer than it as yellow. This is a rare form of color blindness.     Deuteranopia (1% of males): Lacking the green cones for medium-wavelength cones, those affected are again unable to distinguish between colors in the green–yellow–red section of the spectrum. Their neutral point is at a slightly longer wavelength, 498 nm, a more greenish hue of cyan. A deuteranope suffers the same hue discrimination problems as protanopes, but without the abnormal dimming. Purple colors are not perceived as something opposite to spectral colors; all these appear similarly. This form of colorblindness is also known as Daltonism after John Dalton (his diagnosis was confirmed as deuteranopia in 1995, some 150 years after his death, by DNA analysis of his preserved eyeball). Equivalent terms for Daltonism in Romanic languages such as daltonismo ( Spanish , Portuguese and Italian ), daltonisme ( French ), daltonism ( Romanian ) are still used to describe color blindess in a broad sense or deuteranopia in a more restricted sense. Deuteranopic unilateral dichromats report that with only their deuteranopic eye open, they see wavelengths shorter than neutral point as blue and longer than it as yellow. [29]     Protanomaly (1% of males, 0.01% of females): [30] Having a mutated form of the long-wavelength (red) pigment, whose peak sensitivity is at a shorter wavelength than in the normal retina, protanomalous individuals are less sensitive to red light than normal. This means that they are less able to discriminate colors, and they do not see mixed lights as having the same colors as normal observers. They also suffer from a darkening of the red end of the spectrum. This causes reds to reduce in intensity to the point where they can be mistaken for black. Protanomaly is a fairly rare form of color blindness, making up about 1% of the male population. Both protanomaly and deuteranomaly are carried on the X chromosome.     Deuteranomaly (most common—6% of males, 0.4% of females): [30] These individuals have a mutated form of the medium-wavelength (green) pigment. The medium-wavelength pigment is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum resulting in a reduction in sensitivity to the green area of the spectrum. Unlike protanomaly the intensity of colors is unchanged. The deuteranomalous person is considered "green weak". For example, in the evening, dark green cars appear to be black to Deuteranomalous people. Similar to the protanomates, deuteranomates are poor at discriminating small differences in hues in the red, orange, yellow, green region of the spectrum. They make errors in the naming of hues in this region because the hues appear somewhat shifted towards green. One very important difference between deuteranomalous individuals and protanomalous individuals is deuteranomalous individuals do not have the loss of "brightness" problem.   Blue–yellow color blindness [ edit ]  Those with tritanopia and tritanomaly have difficulty discriminating between bluish and greenish hues, as well as yellowish and reddish hues.  Color blindness involving the inactivation of the short-wavelength sensitive cone system (whose absorption spectrum peaks in the bluish-violet) is called tritanopia or, loosely, blue–yellow color blindness. The tritanope's neutral point occurs near a yellowish 570 nm; green is perceived at shorter wavelengths and red at longer wavelengths. [31] Mutation of the short-wavelength sensitive cones is called tritanomaly . Tritanopia is equally distributed among males and females. Jeremy H. Nathans (with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute ) demonstrated that the gene coding for the blue receptor lies on chromosome 7 , which is shared equally by males and females. Therefore, it is not sex-linked. This gene does not have any neighbor whose DNA sequence is similar. Blue color blindness is caused by a simple mutation in this gene.   Tritanopia (less than 1% of males and females): Lacking the short-wavelength cones, those affected see short-wavelength colors ( blue , indigo and a spectral violet ) greenish and drastically dimmed, some of these colors even as black . Yellow is indistinguishable from pink , and purple colors are perceived as various shades of red . This form of color blindness is not sex-linked.     Tritanomaly (equally rare for males and females [0.01% for both]): [30] Having a mutated form of the short-wavelength (blue) pigment. The short-wavelength pigment is shifted towards the green area of the spectrum. This is the rarest form of anomalous trichromacy color blindness. Unlike the other anomalous trichromacy color deficiencies, the mutation for this color blindness is carried on chromosome 7. Therefore, it is equally prevalent in both male and female populations. The OMIM gene code for this mutation is 304000 "Colorblindness, Partial Tritanomaly". [32]   Total color blindness [ edit ]  Total color blindness is defined as the inability to see color. Although the term may refer to acquired disorders such as cerebral achromatopsia also known as color agnosia, it typically refers to congenital color vision disorders (i.e. more frequently rod monochromacy and less frequently cone monochromacy ). [33] [34]  In cerebral achromatopsia, a person cannot perceive colors even though the eyes are capable of distinguishing them. Some sources do not consider these to be true color blindness, because the failure is of perception, not of vision. They are forms of visual agnosia . [34]  Monochromacy is the condition of possessing only a single channel for conveying information about color. Monochromats possess a complete inability to distinguish any colors and perceive only variations in brightness. It occurs in two primary forms:   Rod monochromacy , frequently called achromatopsia , where the retina contains no cone cells, so that in addition to the absence of color discrimination, vision in lights of normal intensity is difficult. While normally rare, achromatopsia is very common on the island of Pingelap , a part of the Pohnpei state, Federated States of Micronesia , where it is called maskun : about 10% of the population there has it, and 30% are unaffected carriers. The island was devastated by a storm in the 18th century (an example of a genetic bottleneck ) and one of the few male survivors carried a gene for achromatopsia. The population grew to several thousand before foreign troops introduced diseases to the island in the 1940s.  Cone monochromacy is the condition of having both rods and cones, but only a single kind of cone. A cone monochromat can have good pattern vision at normal daylight levels, but will not be able to distinguish hues. Blue cone monochromacy (X chromosome) is caused by lack of functionality of L and M cones (red and green). It is encoded at the same place as red–green color blindness on the X chromosome. Peak spectral sensitivities are in the blue region of the visible spectrum (near 440 nm). People with this condition generally show nystagmus ("jiggling eyes"), photophobia (light sensitivity), reduced visual acuity , and myopia (nearsightedness). [35] Visual acuity usually falls to the 20/50 to 20/400 range.   Mechanism [ edit ]  See also: Trichromatic color vision  The typical human retina contains two kinds of light cells: the rod cells ( active in low light ) and the cone cells ( active in normal daylight ). Normally, there are three kinds of cone cells, each containing a different pigment, which are activated when the pigments absorb light. The spectral sensitivities of the cones differ; one is most sensitive to short wavelengths, one to medium wavelengths, and the third to medium-to-long wavelengths within the visible spectrum , with their peak sensitivities in the blue, green, and yellow-green regions of the spectrum, respectively. The absorption spectra of the three systems overlap, and combine to cover the visible spectrum. These receptors are known as short (S), medium (M), and long (L) wavelength cones, but are also often referred to as blue, green, and red cones, although this terminology is inaccurate. [36]  The receptors are each responsive to a wide range of wavelengths. For example, the long wavelength "red" receptor has its peak sensitivity in the yellow-green, some way from the red end (longest wavelength) of the visible spectrum. The sensitivity of normal color vision actually depends on the overlap between the absorption ranges of the three systems: different colors are recognized when the different types of cone are stimulated to different degrees. Red light, for example, stimulates the long wavelength cones much more than either of the others, and reducing the wavelength causes the other two cone systems to be increasingly stimulated, causing a gradual change in hue.  Many of the genes involved in color vision are on the X chromosome , making color blindness much more common in males than in females because males only have one X chromosome, while females have two. Because this is an X-linked trait, an estimated 2–3% of women have a 4th color cone [25] and can be considered tetrachromats . One such woman has been reported to be a true or functional tetrachromat, as she can discriminate colors most other people can't. [26] [27]  Diagnosis [ edit ]     An Ishihara test image as seen by subjects with normal color vision and by those with a variety of color deficiencies    The Ishihara color test , which consists of a series of pictures of colored spots, is the test most often used to diagnose red–green color deficiencies. [37] A figure (usually one or more Arabic digits ) is embedded in the picture as a number of spots in a slightly different color, and can be seen with normal color vision, but not with a particular color defect. The full set of tests has a variety of figure/background color combinations, and enable diagnosis of which particular visual defect is present. The anomaloscope, described above, is also used in diagnosing anomalous trichromacy.   Position yourself about 75cm from your monitor so that the colour test image you are looking at is at eye level, read the description of the image and see what you can see!! It is not necessary in all cases to use the entire set of images. In a large scale examination the test can be simplified to six tests; test, one of tests 2 or 3, one of tests 4, 5, 6, or 7, one of tests 8 or 9, one of tests 10, 11, 12, or 13 and one of tests 14 or 15. [ this quote needs a citation ]   Because the Ishihara color test contains only numerals, it may not be useful in diagnosing young children, who have not yet learned to use numbers. In the interest of identifying these problems early on in life, alternative color vision tests were developed using only symbols (square, circle, car).  Besides the Ishihara color test, the US Navy and US Army also allow testing with the Farnsworth Lantern Test . This test allows 30% of color deficient individuals, whose deficiency is not too severe, to pass.  Another test used by clinicians to measure chromatic discrimination is the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test . The patient is asked to arrange a set of colored caps or chips to form a gradual transition of color between two anchor caps. [38]  The HRR color test (developed by Hardy, Rand , and Rittler) is a red–green color test that, unlike the Ishihara, also has plates for the detection of the tritan defects. [39]  Most clinical tests are designed to be fast, simple, and effective at identifying broad categories of color blindness. In academic studies of color blindness, on the other hand, there is more interest in developing flexible tests to collect thorough datasets, identify copunctal points , and measure just noticeable differences . [40]  Management [ edit ]  There is generally no treatment to cure color deficiencies. ″The American Optometric Association reports a contact lens on one eye can increase the ability to differentiate between colors, though nothing can make you truly see the deficient color.″ [41]  Lenses [ edit ]  Optometrists can supply colored spectacle lenses or a single red-tint contact lens to wear on the non-dominant eye, but although this may improve discrimination of some colors, it can make other colors more difficult to distinguish. A 1981 review of various studies to evaluate the effect of the X-chrom contact lens concluded that, while the lens may allow the wearer to achieve a better score on certain color vision tests, it did not correct color vision in the natural environment. [42] A case history using the X-Chrom lens for a rod monochromat is reported [43] and an X-Chrom manual is online. [44]  Lenses that filter certain wavelengths of light can allow people with a cone anomaly, but not dichromacy, to see better separation of colors, especially those with classic "red/green" color blindness. They work by notching out wavelengths that strongly stimulate both red and green cones in a deuter- or protanomalous person, improving the distinction between the two cones' signals. As of 2013, sunglasses that notch out color wavelengths are available commercially. [45]  Apps [ edit ]  Many applications for iPhone and iPad have been developed to help colorblind people to view the colors in a better way. Many applications launch a sort of simulation of colorblind vision to make normal-view people understand how the color-blinds see the world. Others allow a correction of the image grabbed from the camera with a special "daltonizer" algorithm.  The GNOME  desktop environment provides colorblind accessibility using the gnome-mag and the libcolorblind software. Using a gnome applet, the user may switch a color filter on and off, choosing from a set of possible color transformations that will displace the colors in order to disambiguate them. The software enables, for instance, a colorblind person to see the numbers in the Ishihara test.  Epidemiology [ edit ]   Rates of color blindness [ clarification needed ] [46]    Males  Females    Dichromacy  2.4%  0.03%    Protanopia (red deficient: L cone absent)  1.3%  0.02%    Deuteranopia (green deficient: M cone absent)  1.2%  0.01%    Tritanopia (blue deficient: S cone absent)  0.001%  0.03%    Anomalous trichromacy  6.3%  0.37%    Protanomaly (red deficient: L cone defect)  1.3%  0.02%    Deuteranomaly (green deficient: M cone defect)  5.0%  0.35%    Tritanomaly (blue deficient: S cone defect)  0.0001%  0.0001%    Color blindness affects a large number of individuals, with protanopia and deuteranopia being the most common types. [12] In individuals with Northern European ancestry, as many as 8 percent of men and 0.4 percent of women experience congenital color deficiency. [47]  The number affected varies among groups. Isolated communities with a restricted gene pool sometimes produce high proportions of color blindness, including the less usual types. Examples include rural Finland , Hungary , and some of the Scottish islands. [ citation needed ] In the United States, about 7 percent of the male population—or about 10.5 million men—and 0.4 percent of the female population either cannot distinguish red from green, or see red and green differently from how others do (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 2006 [ clarification needed ] ). More than 95 percent of all variations in human color vision involve the red and green receptors in male eyes. It is very rare for males or females to be "blind" to the blue end of the spectrum.

Because of Dalton's work, the general condition has been called daltonism , although in English this term is now used only for deuteranopia .  Society and culture [ edit ]  Design implications [ edit ]     Testing the colors of a web chart, (center) , to ensure that no information is lost to the various forms of color-blindness.          This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.  (August 2012)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Color codes present particular problems for those with color deficiencies as they are often difficult or impossible for them to perceive.  Good graphic design avoids using color coding or using color contrasts alone to express information; [51] this not only helps color blind people, but also aids understanding by normally sighted people by providing them with multiple reinforcing cues. [ citation needed ]  Designers need to take into account that color-blindness is highly sensitive to differences in material. For example, a red–green colorblind person who is incapable of distinguishing colors on a map printed on paper may have no such difficulty when viewing the map on a computer screen or television. In addition, some color blind people find it easier to distinguish problem colors on artificial materials, such as plastic or in acrylic paints, than on natural materials, such as paper or wood. Third, for some color blind people, color can only be distinguished if there is a sufficient "mass" of color: thin lines might appear black, while a thicker line of the same color can be perceived as having color. [ citation needed ]  Designers should also note that red–blue and yellow–blue color combinations are generally safe. So instead of the ever-popular "red means bad and green means good" system, using these combinations can lead to a much higher ability to use color coding effectively. This will still cause problems for those with monochromatic color blindness, but it is still something worth considering. [52]  When the need to process visual information as rapidly as possible arises, for example in an emergency situation, the visual system may operate only in shades of gray, with the extra information load in adding color being dropped. [ citation needed ] This is an important possibility to consider when designing, for example, emergency brake handles or emergency phones.  Occupations [ edit ]  Color blindness may make it difficult or impossible for a person to engage in certain occupations. Persons with color blindness may be legally or practically barred from occupations in which color perception is an essential part of the job ( e.g., mixing paint colors), or in which color perception is important for safety ( e.g., operating vehicles in response to color-coded signals). This occupational safety principle originates from the Lagerlunda train crash of 1875 in Sweden. Following the crash, Professor Alarik Frithiof Holmgren , a physiologist, investigated and concluded that the color blindness of the engineer (who had died) had caused the crash. Professor Holmgren then created the first test using different-colored skeins to exclude people from jobs in the transportation industry on the basis of color blindness. [53] However, there is a claim that there is no firm evidence that color deficiency did cause the collision, or that it might have not been the sole cause. [54]  Color vision is important for occupations using telephone or computer networking cabling, as the individual wires inside the cables are color-coded using green, orange, brown, blue and white colors. [55] Electronic wiring, transformers, resistors, and capacitors are color-coded as well, using black, brown, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, gray, white, silver, gold. [56]  Driving [ edit ]  Some countries have refused to grant driving licenses to individuals with color blindness. In Romania , there is an ongoing campaign to remove the legal restrictions that prohibit colorblind citizens from getting drivers' licenses. [57]  The usual justification for such restrictions is that drivers of motor vehicles must be able to recognize color-coded signals, such as traffic lights or warning lights. [52]  Piloting aircraft [ edit ]  While many aspects of aviation depend on color coding, only a few of them are critical enough to be interfered with by some milder types of color blindness. Some examples include color-gun signaling of aircraft that have lost radio communication, color-coded glide-path indications on runways, and the like. Some jurisdictions restrict the issuance of pilot credentials to persons who suffer from color blindness for this reason. Restrictions may be partial, allowing color-blind persons to obtain certification but with restrictions, or total, in which case color-blind persons are not permitted to obtain piloting credentials at all. [ citation needed ]  In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration requires that pilots be tested for normal color vision as part of their medical clearance in order to obtain the required medical certificate, a prerequisite to obtaining a pilot's certification. If testing reveals color blindness, the applicant may be issued a license with restrictions, such as no night flying and no flying by color signals—such a restriction effectively prevents a pilot from holding certain flying occupations, such as that of an airline pilot, although commercial pilot certification is still possible, and there are a few flying occupations that do not require night flight and thus are still available to those with restrictions due to color blindness (e.g., agricultural aviation). The government allows several types of tests, including medical standard tests ( e.g., the Ishihara , Dvorine , and others) and specialized tests oriented specifically to the needs of aviation. If an applicant fails the standard tests, they will receive a restriction on their medical certificate that states: "Not valid for night flying or by color signal control". They may apply to the FAA to take a specialized test, administered by the FAA. Typically, this test is the "color vision light gun test". For this test an FAA inspector will meet the pilot at an airport with an operating control tower. The color signal light gun will be shone at the pilot from the tower, and they must identify the color. If they pass they may be issued a waiver, which states that the color vision test is no longer required during medical examinations. They will then receive a new medical certificate with the restriction removed. This was once a Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA), but the SODA was dropped, and converted to a simple waiver (letter) early in the 2000s. [58]  Research published in 2009 carried out by the City University of London 's Applied Vision Research Centre, sponsored by the UK's Civil Aviation Authority and the US Federal Aviation Administration, has established a more accurate assessment of color deficiencies in pilot applicants' red–green and yellow–blue color range which could lead to a 35% reduction in the number of prospective pilots who fail to meet the minimum medical threshold. [59]  Art [ edit ]  Inability to distinguish color does not necessarily preclude the ability to become a celebrated artist. The 20th century expressionist painter Clifton Pugh , three-time winner of Australia's Archibald Prize , on biographical, gene inheritance and other grounds has been identified as a protanope. [60] 19th century French artist Charles Méryon became successful by concentrating on etching rather than painting after he was diagnosed as having a red–green deficiency. [61]  Rights of the color blind [ edit ]  Brazil [ edit ]  A Brazilian court ruled that people with color blindness are protected by the Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Person with Disabilities. [62] [63] [64]  At trial, it was decided that the carriers of color blindness have a right of access to wider knowledge, or the full enjoyment of their human condition.  United States [ edit ]  In the United States, under federal anti-discrimination laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act , color vision deficiencies have not been found to constitute a disability that triggers protection from workplace discrimination. [65]  A famous traffic light on Tipperary Hill in Syracuse, New York , is upside-down due to the sentiments of its Irish American community, [66] but has been criticized due to the potential hazard it poses for color-blind persons. [67]  Research [ edit ]  Some tentative evidence finds that color blind people are better at penetrating certain color camouflages. Such findings may give an evolutionary reason for the high rate of red–green color blindness. [4] There is also a study suggesting that people with some types of color blindness can distinguish colors that people with normal color vision are not able to distinguish. [68] In World War II, color blind observers were used to penetrate camouflage. [69]  In September 2009, the journal Nature reported that researchers at the University of Washington and University of Florida were able to give trichromatic vision to squirrel monkeys , which normally have only dichromatic vision, using gene therapy . [70]  In 2003, a cybernetic device called eyeborg was developed to allow the wearer to hear sounds representing different colors. [71] Achromatopsic artist Neil Harbisson was the first to use such a device in early 2004; the eyeborg allowed him to start painting in color by memorizing the sound corresponding to each color. In 2012, at a TED Conference , Harbisson explained how he could now perceive colors outside the ability of human vision.

Mar. 03, 2014    Men are at much higher risk for being born with color blindness than women, who seldom have the problem. An estimated one in ten males has some form of color deficiency. Color blindness is more common among men of Northern European descent.  Having certain conditions, including glaucoma,  macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, chronic alcoholism, leukemia and sickle cell anemia, may increase your risk for acquired color deficiency.  Certain drugs may also increase your risk for acquiring color blindness. The drug hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) can cause color blindness. It is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, among other conditions.    Previous What Are the Symptoms and Causes of Color Blindness?

The gene that leads to red green color blindness is found in the X Chromosome. Males only have one X chromosome whereas females have 2; typically in females the stronger chromosome takes precedence so they retain correct vision. The son of a woman carrying a faulty gene has a 50% chance of inheriting the faulty X chromosome and as a result – suffering from color blindness. The daughter of the same woman is unlikely to be color blind unless her father is color blind; however she retains a 50% chance of being a carrier for the defective gene.  Blue Color Blindness  Blue color blindness (often referred to as blue yellow color blindness) is extremely rare, so rare that only 5% of color blind people suffer from it. Unlike red green color blindness, the chance of having blue color blindness is equal in both men and women as the gene is found on a different chromosome ( chromosome 7). This gene is shared equally by men and women and blue color blindness comes from a mutation of this gene.  Color Blindness By Nationality  One might expect the percentage of affected people to be relatively constant in all countries however this is far from the truth. In most Caucasian societies up to 1 in 10 men suffer, however only 1 in 100 Eskimos are color blind. There is no solid proof as to the cause of this however it is logical to assume that less of the ‘original Eskimos’ carried the defective gene, so the likelihood of it infecting the gene pool was quite a lot lower.  Developed Color Blindness  Whilst almost all color blindness is inherited, infrequently a change in the chromosome during early development can cause color blindness. Various injuries involving trauma to the eye, and even some diseases can also cause color blindness to develop in a person of any age.  Cataracts  As mentioned elsewhere on this website, cataracts are not a form of color blindness, so you won’t see them in the table below. Cataracts are a clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye, and have the effect to dull colors, and blur vision. It is not common to mistake someone with cataracts as someone who is color blind, as color blindness normally becomes apparent early in life, whereas cataracts don’t usually form until ones senior years. However if you are unsure, you can take the free online tests available on this website in the menu on the left to find out now.

Jimmy’s dad was holding a handful of balloons, asking his son to name the colors. “Orange?” Jimmy answered. “It’s green,” his father replied.  Jimmy was then handed a pair of color-blindness glasses from EnChroma while onlookers held up balloons and a boldly colored beach towel. As seen in this heartwarming video , Jimmy was moved to tears. He handed the glasses off to his brother Jace, who was similarly overwhelmed. “It’s so bright,” he said.   They might look like sunglasses, but EnChroma’s product actually boosts the saturation of red and green light. That helps to improve color vision in people with red-green color-blindness, the most common color vision deficiency, affecting up to one in 12 men and one in 200 women (a true lack of color vision is very rare).         Most people have three types of color-sensing cones in their eyes: red, green, and blue. The wavelengths of light that these three cones absorb have overlapping regions. Color-blindness is often a result of a malfunctioning cone that causes wavelengths to overlap even more, resulting in poor color discrimination. The EnChroma glasses use a filter to cut out these overlapping wavelengths, allowing for a clearer distinction between colors, especially red and green.  The invention was derived from the work of Don McPherson, who earned his PhD in glass science at Alfred University. McPherson was trying to design protective eye wear for doctors performing laser surgeries. It wasn’t until he let a friend try on the glasses during a game of ultimate Frisbee that he realized the technology’s true potential. McPherson’s friend just happened to be color-blind, and the glasses gave both of them a shock.  That serendipity led to NIH-funded research for helping the color-blind. Early versions of the glasses were unsatisfactory, so McPherson began working with mathematician and computer scientist Andrew Schmeder to help optimize the glasses. In 2010, they cofounded EnChroma, and the first pair of glasses was released in 2012. EnChroma’s glasses cost around $269 for children and $349 for adults.  EnChroma’s website makes it clear that their glasses will not cure color-blindness, much as reading glasses won’t cure farsightedness. But a true cure could someday come in the form of gene therapy to deliver functional genes to the color-responsive cells in the retina. Jay Neitz, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Washington, demonstrated the feasibility of this idea in monkeys back in 2009. And last year he teamed up with Avalanche Biotechnologies to try to move this technology into clinical trials .  Another caveat with EnChroma’s glasses is that they are not recommended for the color vision tests required for certain jobs, including operating ships, planes, and public transportation. A competitor, the ColorCorrection System , calls itself “the world’s only guaranteed color blind treatment that can ensure a passage of the Ishihara Color Test,” one of the most common such tests.  EnChroma is careful to avoid making such claims, but this also highlights the limited use of the product. Some people may find the price tag unjustifiable, but for others the dramatic effects are more than worth it.

But some people really are color blind.  It doesn't mean they can't see any color at all, like a black and white movie. It means that they have trouble seeing the difference between certain colors.         ©Laura Evans from the short documentary No Such Thing As Color  Being color blind can make it tricky to match your shirt and pants, but it's not a serious problem. People who are color blind can do normal stuff, even drive. Most color-blind people can't tell the difference between red or green, but they can learn to respond to the way the traffic signal lights up — the red light is generally on top and green is on the bottom.  Cones and Color  To understand what causes color blindness, you need to know about the cones in your eyes . Cones in your eyes? Yes, but they're very small. These cones are cells on your retina, an area the size of a postage stamp that's at the back of your eye.  You have "red," "blue," and "green" cones, which are sensitive to those colors and combinations of them. You need all three types to see colors properly.  When your cones don't work properly, or you don't have the right combination, your brain doesn't get the right message about which colors you're seeing. To someone who's color blind, a green leaf might look tan or gray.  Color Blindness Is Passed Down  Color blindness is almost always an inherited (say: in-HER-ut-ed) trait, which means you get it from your parents. You get inherited traits through genes (say: jeenz), which determine everything about your body, including how tall you'll be and whether your hair will be straight or curly.  Eye doctors (and some school nurses) test for color blindness by showing a picture made up of different colored dots, like the one above. Someone who can't see the picture or number within the dots may be color blind.  Boys are far more likely to be color blind. In fact, if you know 12 boys, one of them is probably at least a little color blind. So, girls, the next time a boy asks you if something matches, you'd better lend him a hand!

But what about some real life probability numbers concerning color vision deficiency ?  What’s the Chance of Color Blindness?  If you are a teacher you might ask yourself: What is the probability that one of my pupils is colorblind?   And what about the chance to have a color vision deficient pupil if you have only boys in your class?  Your son is maybe colorblind and joining the kindergarten pretty soon. How big is the chance, that there is another colorblind child in his class?   …and he might also play in a soccer team. Will he be the only colorblind boy in the team?  Are you a football coach? What is the probability that one of your players from a team of 33 has a color vision deficiency?   Or you are leading at work a team of eight persons. What’s the chance, that you have a colorblind person in your team?  Let’s say you know 100 persons. The probability that one of them is colorblind has to be pretty high. But how high is it really?   In general, if two people meet, how big is the chance that they are both suffering from color vision deficiency?  Before I will reveal the answers to the questions above or before you can compute it yourself, you need some more input. To calculate probabilities certain assumptions—like a base probability of color blindness or a class size—have to be taken. The results below are therefore based on the following numbers:   Probability of color blindness in men: 8%  Probability of color blindness in women: 0.5%  Average class size: 20 pupils  Group line-up: 50% male – 50% female   Based on this assumptions I calculated the following probabilities of color vision deficiency. Hover over the letters to see the results. But before viewing them, why don’t you try to answer the questions yourself? Just take a guess and have a look how close you can get to the real probabilities of color blindness.  58%  81%  54%  57%  94%  29%  98.7%  0.18%  And in other words:   Almost every teacher or trainer has a colorblind pupil or team member.  If you are colorblind pupil, there is a big chance that there is another colorblind child in your class.  You can almost be sure that you have at least one colorblind friend.  Approximately every 500st handshake is between two colorblind persons.   If you have any further questions, don’t hesitate to contact me or just write a comment on this article.

The gene that leads to red green color blindness is found in the X Chromosome. Males only have one X chromosome whereas females have 2; typically in females the stronger chromosome takes precedence so they retain correct vision. The son of a woman carrying a faulty gene has a 50% chance of inheriting the faulty X chromosome and as a result – suffering from color blindness. The daughter of the same woman is unlikely to be color blind unless her father is color blind; however she retains a 50% chance of being a carrier for the defective gene.  Blue Color Blindness  Blue color blindness (often referred to as blue yellow color blindness) is extremely rare, so rare that only 5% of color blind people suffer from it. Unlike red green color blindness, the chance of having blue color blindness is equal in both men and women as the gene is found on a different chromosome ( chromosome 7). This gene is shared equally by men and women and blue color blindness comes from a mutation of this gene.  Color Blindness By Nationality  One might expect the percentage of affected people to be relatively constant in all countries however this is far from the truth. In most Caucasian societies up to 1 in 10 men suffer, however only 1 in 100 Eskimos are color blind. There is no solid proof as to the cause of this however it is logical to assume that less of the ‘original Eskimos’ carried the defective gene, so the likelihood of it infecting the gene pool was quite a lot lower.  Developed Color Blindness  Whilst almost all color blindness is inherited, infrequently a change in the chromosome during early development can cause color blindness. Various injuries involving trauma to the eye, and even some diseases can also cause color blindness to develop in a person of any age.  Cataracts  As mentioned elsewhere on this website, cataracts are not a form of color blindness, so you won’t see them in the table below. Cataracts are a clouding that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye, and have the effect to dull colors, and blur vision. It is not common to mistake someone with cataracts as someone who is color blind, as color blindness normally becomes apparent early in life, whereas cataracts don’t usually form until ones senior years. However if you are unsure, you can take the free online tests available on this website in the menu on the left to find out now.

Most of us share a common color vision sensory experience.  Some people, however, have a color vision deficiency, which means their perception of colors is different from what most of us see.  The most severe forms of these deficiencies are referred to as color blindness. People with color blindness aren’t aware of differences among colors that are obvious to the rest of us.  People who don’t have the more severe types of color blindness may not even be aware of their condition unless they’re tested in a clinic or laboratory.  Inherited color blindness is caused by abnormal photopigments. These color-detecting molecules are located in cone-shaped cells within the retina, called cone cells. In humans, several genes are needed for the body to make photopigments, and defects in these genes can lead to color blindness.  There are three main kinds of color blindness, based on photopigment defects in the three different kinds of cones that respond to blue, green, and red light.  Red-green color blindness is the most common, followed by blue-yellow color blindness. A complete absence of color vision —total color blindness – is rare.  Sometimes color blindness can be caused by physical or chemical damage to the eye, the optic nerve, or parts of the brain that process color information. Color vision can also decline with age, most often because of cataract - a clouding and yellowing of the eye’s lens.  Who gets color blindness?  As many as 8 percent of men and 0.5 percent of women with Northern European ancestry have the common form of red-green color blindness.  Men are much more likely to be colorblind than women because the genes responsible for the most common, inherited color blindness are on the X chromosome.  Males only have one X chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. In females, a functional gene on only one of the X chromosomes is enough to compensate for the loss on the other. This kind of inheritance pattern is called X-linked, and primarily affects males. Inherited color blindness can be present at birth, begin in childhood, or not appear until the adult years.   How Genes are Inherited  Genes are bundled together on structures called chromosomes. One copy of each chromosome is passed by a parent at conception through egg and sperm cells. The X and Y chromosomes, known as sex chromosomes, determine whether a person is born female (XX) or male (XY) and also carry other traits not related to gender.  In X-linked inheritance, the mother carries the mutated gene on one of her X chromosomes and will pass on the mutated gene to 50 percent of her children.  Because females have two X chromosomes, the effect of a mutation on one X chromosome is offset by the normal gene on the other X chromosome.  In this case the mother will not have the disease, but she can pass on the mutated gene and so is called a carrier. If a mother is a carrier of an X-linked disease (and the father is not affected), there is a:  1 in 2 chance that a son will have the disease,  1 in 2 chance that a daughter will be a carrier of the disease,  No chance that a daughter will have the disease.  In autosomal recessive inheritance, it takes two copies of the mutant gene to give rise to the disease.  An individual who has one copy of a recessive gene mutation is known as a carrier.  When two carriers have a child, there is a:  1 in 4 chance of having a child with the disease,  1 in 2 chance of having a child who is a carrier,  1 in 4 chance of having a child who neither has the disease nor is a carrier.  In autosomal dominant inheritance, it takes just one copy of the mutant gene to bring about the disease.  When an affected parent with one dominant gene mutation has a child, there is a 1 in 2 chance that a child will inherit the disease.   How do we see color?  Normal Human Retina  What color is a strawberry? Most of us would say red, but do we all see the same red? Color vision depends on our eyes and brain working together to perceive different properties of light.  We see the natural and artificial light that illuminates our world as white, although it is actually a mixture of colors that, perceived on their own, would span the visual spectrum from deep blue to deep red.  You can see this when rain separates sunlight into a rainbow or a glass prism separates white light into a multi-color band. The color of light is determined by its wavelength . Longer wavelength corresponds to red light and shorter wavelength corresponds to blue light.  Strawberries and other objects reflect some wavelengths of light and absorb others. The reflected light we perceive as color.  So, a strawberry is red because its surface is only reflecting the long wavelengths we see as red and absorbing the others. An object appears white when it reflects all wavelengths and black when it absorbs all wavelengths.  Vision begins when light enters the eye and the cornea and lens focus it onto the retina, a thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye that contains millions of light-sensitive cells called photoreceptors. Some photoreceptors are shaped like rods and some are shaped like cones.  In each eye there are many more rods than cones – approximately 120 million rods compared to only 6 million cones. Rods and cones both contain photopigment molecules that undergo a chemical change when they absorb light. This chemical change acts like an on-switch, triggering electrical signals that are then passed from the retina to the visual parts of the brain.  Rods and cones are different in how they respond to light.  Rods are more responsive to dim light, which makes them useful for night vision.  Cones are more responsive to bright light, such as in the daytime when light is plentiful.  Another important difference is that all rods contain only one photopigment, while cones contain one of three different photopigments. This makes cones sensitive to long (red), medium (green), or short (blue) wavelengths of light.  The presence of three types of photopigments, each sensitive to a different part of the visual spectrum, is what gives us our rich color vision.  Humans are unusual among mammals for our trichromatic vision – named for the three different types of photopigments we have. Most mammals, including dogs, have just two photopigment types. Other creatures, such as butterflies, have more than three. They may be able to see colors we can only imagine.  Most of us have a full set of the three different cone photopigments and so we share a very similar color vision experience, but because the human eye and brain together translate light into color, each of us sees colors differently. The differences may be slight. Your blue may be more blue than someone else’s, or in the case of color blindness, your red and green may be someone else’s brown.  What are the different types of color blindness?  The most common types of color blindness are inherited. They are the result of defects in the genes that contain the instructions for making the photopigments found in cones. Some defects alter the photopigment’s sensitivity to color, for example, it might be slightly more sensitive to deeper red and less sensitive to green. Other defects can result in the total loss of a photopigment. Depending on the type of defect and the cone that is affected problems can arise with red, green, or blue color vision.  Red-Green Color Blindness  The most common types of hereditary color blindness are due to the loss or limited function of red cone (known as protan) or green cone (deutran) photopigments. This kind of color blindness is commonly referred to as red-green color blindness.  Protanomaly: In males with protanomaly, the red cone photopigment is abnormal.  Red, orange, and yellow appear greener and colors are not as bright.  This condition is mild and doesn’t usually interfere with daily living. Protanomaly is an X-linked disorder estimated to affect 1 percent of males.  Protanopia: In males with protanopia, there are no working red cone cells.  Red appears as black.  Certain shades of orange, yellow, and green all appear as yellow. Protanopia is an X-linked disorder that is estimated to affect 1 percent of males.  Deuteranomaly: In males with deuteranomaly, the green cone photopigment is abnormal.  Yellow and green appear redder and it is difficult to tell violet from blue. This condition is mild and doesn’t interfere with daily living.  Deuteranomaly is the most common form of color blindness and is an X-linked disorder affecting 5 percent of males.  Deuteranopia: In males with deuteranopia, there are no working green cone cells. They tend to see reds as brownish-yellow and greens as beige. Deuteranopia is an X-linked disorder that affects about 1 percent of males.  Blue-Yellow Color Blindness  Blue-yellow color blindness is rarer than red-green color blindness. Blue-cone (tritan) photopigments are either missing or have limited function.  Tritanomaly: People with tritanomaly have functionally limited blue cone cells. Blue appears greener and it can be difficult to tell yellow and red from pink. Tritanomaly is extremely rare. It is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting males and females equally.  Tritanopia: People with tritanopia, also known as blue-yellow color blindness, lack blue cone cells. Blue appears green and yellow appears violet or light grey. Tritanopia is an extremely rare autosomal recessive disorder affecting males and females equally.  Complete color blindness  People with complete color blindness (monochromacy) don’t experience color at all and the clearness of their vision (visual acuity) may also be affected.  There are two types of monochromacy:  Cone monochromacy: This rare form of color blindness results from a failure of two of the three cone cell photopigments to work. There is red cone monochromacy, green cone monochromacy, and blue cone monochromacy.  People with cone monochromacy have trouble distinguishing colors because the brain needs to compare the signals from different types of cones in order to see color. When only one type of cone works, this comparison isn’t possible.  People with blue cone monochromacy, may also have reduced visual acuity, near-sightedness, and uncontrollable eye movements, a condition known as nystagmus. Cone monochromacy is an autosomal recessive disorder.  Rod monochromacy or achromatopsia: This type of monochromacy is rare and is the most severe form of color blindness. It is present at birth. None of the cone cells have functional photopigments. Lacking all cone vision, people with rod monochromacy see the world in black, white, and gray. And since rods respond to dim light, people with rod monochromacy tend to be photophobic – very uncomfortable in bright environments.  They also experience nystagmus.  Rod monochromacy is an autosomal recessive disorder.  How is color blindness diagnosed?  Color vision testing  Eye care professionals use a variety of tests to diagnose color blindness. These tests can quickly diagnose specific types of color blindness.  The Ishihara Color Test is the most common test for red-green color blindness. The test consists of a series of colored circles, called Ishihara plates, each of which contains a collection of dots in different colors and sizes. Within the circle are dots that form a shape clearly visible to those with normal color vision, but invisible or difficult to see for those with red-green color blindness.  The newer Cambridge Color Test uses a visual array similar to the Ishihara plates, except displayed on a computer monitor. The goal is to identify a C shape that is different in color from the background. The “C” is presented randomly in one of four orientations. When test-takers see the “C,” they are asked to press one of four keys that correspond to the orientation.  The anomaloscope uses a test in which two different light sources have to be matched in color. Looking through the eyepiece, the viewer sees a circle. The upper half is a yellow light that can be adjusted in brightness. The lower half is a combination of red and green lights that can be mixed in variable proportions. The viewer uses one knob to adjust the brightness of the top half, and another to adjust the color of the lower half. The goal is to make the upper and lower halves the same brightness and color.  The HRR Pseudoisochromatic Color Test is another red-green color blindness test that uses color plates to test for color blindness.  The Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test uses a set of blocks or pegs that are roughly the same color but in different hues (shades of the color). The goal is to arrange them in a line in order of hue.  This test measures the ability to discriminate subtle color changes. It is used by industries that depend on the accurate color perception of its employees, such as graphic design, photography, and food quality inspection.  The Farnsworth Lantern Test is used by the U.S. military to determine the severity of color blindness.  Those with mild forms pass the test and are allowed to serve in the armed forces.  Are there treatments for color blindness?  There is no cure for color blindness. However, people with red-green color blindness may be able to use a special set of lenses to help them perceive colors more accurately. These lenses can only be used outdoors under bright lighting conditions. Visual aids have also been developed to help people cope with color blindness. There are iPhone and iPad apps, for example, that help people with color blindness discriminate among colors. Some of these apps allow users to snap a photo and tap it anywhere on the image to see the color of that area. More sophisticated apps allow users to find out both color and shades of color. These kinds of apps can be helpful in selecting ripe fruits such as bananas, or finding complementary colors when picking out clothing.  How does color blindness affect daily life?  Color blindness can make it difficult to read color-coded information such as bar graphs and pie charts.  This can be particularly troubling for children who aren’t yet diagnosed with color blindness, since educational materials are often color-coded. Children with red-green color blindness may also have difficulty reading a green chalkboard when yellow chalk is used.  Art classes, which require selecting appropriate colors of paint or crayons, may be challenging.  Color blindness can go undetected for some time since children will often try to hide their disorder. It’s important to have children tested, particularly boys, if there is a family history of color blindness. Many school systems offer vision screening tests that include color blindness testing. Once a child is diagnosed, he or she can learn to ask for help with tasks that require color recognition.  Simple everyday tasks like cooking meat to the desired color or selecting ripe produce can be a challenge for adults. Children might find food without bright color as less appetizing. Traffic lights pose challenges, since they have to be read by the position of the light. Since most lights are vertical, with green on bottom and red on top, if a light is positioned horizontally, a color blind person has to do a quick mental rotation to read it.  Reading maps or buying clothes that match colors can also be difficult. However, these are relatively minor inconveniences and most people with color blindness learn to adapt.  What research is being done?  NEI-supported researchers have used gene therapy to cure color blindness in adult monkeys. While red-green color blindness affects about 8 percent of Northern European-descended men, it affects all adult male squirrel monkeys because males of the species carry either the gene that makes red photopigment or the gene that makes green photopigment, but never both.  The researchers injected the red photopigment gene into the retinas of male monkeys born without it.  The gene was targeted to green cones and allowed those cells to respond to red light. The monkeys were able to see with full three-color (trichromatic) vision. This shows that even though the monkeys’ red cones had been absent from birth, the brain circuitry for detecting red was still in place—offering hope that a similar approach could help people who’ve been colorblind since birth.  In another study, NEI-supported researchers were able to restore some color perception in an animal model of rod monochromacy (in which all three cone types are missing), using a gene therapy approach in younger animals. The therapy combined gene delivery with the addition of neurotrophic factors – molecules that are known to help nerve cells grow. Further studies will be testing whether the therapy could be safe and effective in humans.  An ongoing NEI clinical trial is testing whether treatment with a growth factor alone could be enough to improve or restore visual function of cone cells in people. This has the potential to help people with color blindness, as well as diseases that are the result of the loss of cones or cone function.  Researchers supported by NEI are also studying how cones develop in the retina and how they are maintained and preserved throughout the lifespan. This research could lead to therapies for color-blindness that occurs during childhood or later in life due to the gradual loss of cones.

Conditions          Back to Conditions           English   Español       My mom’s brother is color blind but my mother and I are not. Because color blindness is sex linked and generally passed to males by the mother, if I have a boy will he be color blind for certain?  (I am female.)        -An undergraduate from Texas   September 12, 2013  No not for certain.  Even if your mom did end up getting the gene from your grandmother and you ended up getting it from your mom, your sons would still not automatically be color blind.  They would each have a 50% chance.  As you can see, a lot has to happen for your sons to have even a chance at being color blind!  Your mom had a 50% chance of inheriting the colorblind gene from her mom.  If she got it, then you had a 50% chance of getting it too.  And if you got it, then each of your kids has a 50% chance of getting it as well.  Because of how color blindness works, only your sons that got the gene would end up color blind (assuming your partner isn’t color blind).  That last point in parentheses is an important one.  Men always pass the color blind gene to their daughters but the daughters end up color blind only under the right circumstances.  For example, if your uncle married a woman who carried the color blind gene, then each of their sons and daughters would have a 50% chance of being color blind.  In this case, it would look like the man, your uncle, passed his colorblindness down to his kids.  And if your uncle married one of those rare color blind women, then all of their kids would be color blind.  Your aunt, uncle and all your cousins would all not be able to tell red from green.  Color blindness is not an easy trait to follow!  It is more than mom passing it to her sons.  To understand all of this, we need to take a step back and look at how we inherit our genes.  Then we’ll be able to understand why your sons actually have a pretty good shot at being able to tell red from green.   X-linked Traits  Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46.  We each get one set of 23 from our moms and one set of 23 from our dads.  Sprinkled throughout these chromosomes are the instructions for building and running each of us.  These instructions mostly come in the form of genes.  Each of these genes has the instructions for one small part of you.  One might tell your eyes how much pigment to make and so determine whether or not you’ll have brown eyes.  And another might determine whether or not you have a certain receptor in your eye that lets you tell red from green.  This last gene is the one behind being color blind.  It comes in two different versions—a working version and a nonworking one.  If you have only nonworking versions, then you are color blind.  What this means is that you only need one working copy to be able to tell red from green.  This is where boys get into trouble…  As you may already know, boys have an X and a Y chromosome and girls have two X’s.  Besides deciding whether you’re a boy or a girl , this also means that boys have one copy of the red-green receptor gene while girls have two.  And this matters because, as I said, you need just one working copy to be able to tell red from green.  So if a girl gets a nonworking copy of this receptor gene from just one parent, she’ll be able to tell red from green.  The same is not true for her brother.  One bad copy means color blindness for him.  What I want to do next is flesh this out with a few examples.  First we’ll go through your example and see where all those 50%’s came from.  Then we’ll end it with a couple more examples that will help explain why, for example, a color blind dad can only pass his broken genes to his daughters.  And why a color blind mom means that all her sons will be color blind too.   Your Example  I’ll start with what might happen in your case…two parents who aren’t color blind having a son that is.  Let’s figure out what is going on in this situation.  If these two have a color blind son, then we know what each of these parents’ X chromosomes most likely looks like (at least with regard to the red-green receptor gene).  We know that dad has a working copy of the red-green receptor and mom has one working and one nonworking copy.  You’ll see below why we know this.  The way I will represent people in this answer is with a big XY for dads and sons and a big XX for mothers and daughters.  They’ll look something like this:    I’ll use different colors to tell an X that can lead to color blindness from an X that can’t.  If the X has a red-green receptor gene that works, then it will be red.  If the X has a nonworking copy, then it will be gray.  So a color blind dad would look like this:    Notice that his X is gray.  Since this is the only X he has, he is color blind because he has no working copies of the red-green receptor gene.  (We can ignore his Y.)  Here is what a mom who can see color but carries a color blind gene would look like:    Even though she has a gray X (one that has a nonworking red-green receptor gene), she can still tell red from green because of her red X.  That X has a working copy of the gene and so keeps color blindness away.  The genetic term that describes traits like color blindness is “ X-linked recessive .”  X-linked because it is on the X chromosome and recessive because a different version can dominate it.  The working version hides the nonworking one.  Now we are ready to do an example.  Let’s say that a carrier woman and a man that can tell red from green get married and have kids.  These are the four possible kids in terms of their X and Y chromosomes:    Let’s go through this in a little detail to figure out where each possibility came from.  As I said before, we inherit one of each pair of chromosomes from our mom and one from our dad.  What I didn’t say was that which one you get is random.  For example, you have a 50% chance of getting a Y from dad and a 50% chance of getting his X.  (This is why couples have a 50% chance for a boy and a 50% chance for girl.)  So brother 1 (B1), got mom’s gray X and dad’s Y and brother 2 (B2) got mom’s red X and dad’s Y.  These are the only two possible sons that can come out of this.  The same sort of thing happened with the two sisters.  Each got dad’s red X but sister 1 (S1) got mom’s gray X and sister 2 (S2) got mom’s red X.  Now we can see who is and isn’t color blind.  First off, since brother 2 and sister 2 don’t have a gray chromosome, they are not color blind.  They each only have working copies of the red-green receptor gene. The same is not true for brother 1 and sister 1.  Brother 1 and sister 1 both have a gray X but only brother 1 is color blind.  This is because sister 2 has a red X that can provide the working gene needed to tell red from green.  This is where the 50% chance for boys comes from.  If you are a carrier and your partner is not color blind, then this situation applies to you.  OK now let’s see what has to happen for you to be in this situation.  This is a big one:    As you can see, the gray X had to pass from grandmother to mother to you for your sons to even have a chance at being color blind.  If your mom actually had two red X’s like her hypothetical sister on her left, then you couldn’t get a gray.  You would not have a color blind son.  Even if your mom did get your grandmother’s gray X, she would still need to pass it to you for you to be able to pass it to your kids.  If instead she passed her red X to you, then again, none of your kids would be color blind.  This is a big reason why it is not for certain that your sons will be color blind.  You may not even have inherited the color blindness gene.  And even if you did get that gray X, each of your sons would still only have a 50% chance at being color blind.  Even in the “worst” case scenario, your sons will not automatically be color blind.  What I’ll do now is a couple more examples to show a situation where sons and daughters have a 50% chance of being color blind and another where all the kids are color blind.  As you’ll see, these depend on dad being color blind.   A Couple More Examples  Let’s start off with a color blind dad and a carrier mom.  Here are the four possibilities for their kids:    As you can see, dad has a gray X and so does mom.  Of course, only dad is color blind because mom has a red X that can give her enough receptors to tell red from green.  A quick look shows that each son has a 50% chance of being color blind.  The color blind son ended up that way because he got mom’s gray X…dad can’t pass his X to his sons.  If he did, then the son would be a daughter.  Dad will always pass his gray X to his daughters.  Otherwise they’d get a Y and be boys!  Since mom is a carrier, each daughter has a 50% chance to get a gray X and a 50% chance to get a red one from her.  If she gets a gray from mom, she will end up with two gray X’s because of dad.  She will be color blind.  So in this case, each of this couple’s children has a 50% chance for being color blind.  It doesn’t look anything like mom passing her color blindness to her kids.  As the final example, let’s imagine our color blind girl grows up and has children with a color blind man.  Here are the four possibilities for their kids:    A pretty boring family tree!  All black and grays and no reds…  Since there are only gray X’s in this family, all the kids end up with just gray X’s.  All the kids will be color blind.  Now if you feel up to it, here is one for you to solve:    What are the odds that each child has for being color blind?  Is it different for sons and daughters?  Click here to get the answer.

My dad is red-green colorblind, so my DS  (dear son) had the same 50/50 chance.  He's not quite 2 yet, so hasn't been formally tested, but I think he's not colorblind.  He can tell his red and green toys apart :)               Reply            Report this comment       0                     Beckyjoe1012    Posted 08/23/2009      I am color bllind.. which appears to be rare for women. My hubby and his bro are colorblind which i believe comes from their father... and i am pretty sure it came from my dad too... So with both my hubby and I being colorblind i assume their is prob a good chance that our son maybe as well... I know there are different kinds of colorblindness.. My hubby is the most common.. red/green... i am not.. its like blue/green..blue/yellow or something like that.

I am also a high school biology teacher, with a B.S. in Biological Sciences.  Color blindness is carried on the x-chromosomes.  My mom is a carrier and almost all of my brothers are color blind (except 1).  And I am not color blind, since my dad isn't.  If a woman is color blind, then she will pass on the gene to all of her children.    --  ~ Steph ~ DD Angelica (9),  DS Blaise (1), EDD October 22, 2011, Married to my love Eric for over 4 years now!

For color blindness in other species, see Color vision . For other uses, see Colour blind (disambiguation) .    Color blindness    Synonyms  Colour blindness, color deficiency, impaired color vision [1]       Example of an Ishihara color test plate . With properly configured computer displays, people with normal vision should see the number "74". Many people who are color blind see it as "21", and those with total color blindness may not see any numbers.    Specialty  Ophthalmology    Symptoms  Decreased ability to see colors [2]    Duration  Long term [2]    Causes  Genetic ( inherited usually X-linked ) [2]    Diagnostic method  Ishihara color test [2]    Treatment  Adjustments to teaching methods, mobile apps [1] [2]    Frequency  Red-green: 8% males, 0.5% females (Northern European descent) [2]    Color blindness , also known as color vision deficiency , is the decreased ability to see color or differences in color . [2] Color blindness can make some educational activities difficult. [2] Buying fruit, picking clothing, and reading traffic lights can be more challenging, for example. [2] Problems, however, are generally minor and most people adapt. [2] People with total color blindness , however, may also have decreased visual acuity and be uncomfortable in bright environments. [2]  The most common cause of color blindness is an inherited fault in the development of one or more of the three sets of color sensing cones in the eye. [2] Males are more likely to be color blind than females, as the genes responsible for the most common forms of color blindness are on the X chromosome . [2] As females have two X chromosomes, a defect in one is typically compensated for by the other, while males only have one X chromosome. [2] Color blindness can also result from physical or chemical damage to the eye , optic nerve , or parts of the brain . [2] Diagnosis is typically with the Ishihara color test ; however a number of other testing methods also exist. [2]  There is no cure for color blindness. [2] Diagnosis may allow a person's teacher to change their method of teaching to accommodate the decreased ability to recognize colors. [1] Special lenses may help people with red–green color blindness when under bright conditions. [2] There are also mobile apps that can help people identify colors. [2]  Red–green color blindness is the most common form, followed by blue–yellow color blindness and total color blindness. [2] Red–green color blindness affects up to 8% of males and 0.5% of females of Northern European descent. [2] The ability to see color also decreases in old age. [2] Being color blind may make people ineligible for certain jobs in certain countries. [1] This may include pilot , train driver , and armed forces . [1] The effect of color blindness on artistic ability, however, is controversial. [1] The ability to draw appears to be unchanged and a number of famous artists are believed to have been color blind.

In practice, this means that they often retain a limited discrimination along the red–green axis of color space, although their ability to separate colors in this dimension is reduced. Color blindness very rarely refers to complete monochromatism. [3]  Dichromats often confuse red and green items. For example, they may find it difficult to distinguish a Braeburn apple from a Granny Smith or red from green of traffic lights without other clues—for example, shape or position. Dichromats tend to learn to use texture and shape clues and so may be able to penetrate camouflage that has been designed to deceive individuals with normal color vision. [4]  Colors of traffic lights are confusing to some dichromats as there is insufficient apparent difference between the red/amber traffic lights and sodium street lamps; also, the green can be confused with a grubby white lamp. This is a risk on high-speed undulating roads where angular cues cannot be used. British Rail color lamp signals use more easily identifiable colors: The red is blood red, the amber is yellow and the green is a bluish color. Most British road traffic lights are mounted vertically on a black rectangle with a white border (forming a "sighting board") and so dichromats can more easily look for the position of the light within the rectangle—top, middle or bottom. In the eastern provinces of Canada horizontally mounted traffic lights are generally differentiated by shape to facilitate identification for those with color blindness. [ citation needed ] In the United States, this is not done by shape but by position, as the red light is always on the left if the light is horizontal, or on top if the light is vertical. However, a lone flashing light (e.g. red for stop, yellow for caution) is still problematic.         Normal sight           Deuteranopia sight           Tritanopia sight           Monochromacy sight      Causes [ edit ]  Color vision deficiencies can be classified as acquired or inherited.   Acquired: Diseases, drugs (e.g., Plaquenil ), and chemicals may cause color blindness. [5] [6]  Inherited: There are three types of inherited or congenital color vision deficiencies: monochromacy, dichromacy, and anomalous trichromacy.  Monochromacy , also known as "total color blindness", is the lack of ability to distinguish colors (and thus the person views everything as if it were on a black and white television); caused by cone defect or absence. Monochromacy occurs when two or all three of the cone pigments are missing and color and lightness vision is reduced to one dimension.  Rod monochromacy (achromatopsia) is an exceedingly rare, nonprogressive inability to distinguish any colors as a result of absent or nonfunctioning retinal cones. It is associated with light sensitivity ( photophobia ), involuntary eye oscillations ( nystagmus ), and poor vision.  Cone monochromacy is a rare total color blindness that is accompanied by relatively normal vision, electroretinogram, and electrooculogram. Cone monochromacy can also be a result of having more than one type of dichromatic color blindness. People who have, for instance, both protanopia and tritanopia are considered to have cone monochromacy. Since cone monochromacy is the lack of/damage of more than one cone in retinal environment, having two types of dichromacy would be an equivalent.    Dichromacy is a moderately severe color vision defect in which one of the three basic color mechanisms is absent or not functioning. It is hereditary and, in the case of protanopia or deuteranopia, sex-linked, affecting predominantly males. Dichromacy occurs when one of the cone pigments is missing and color is reduced to two dimensions. Dichromacy conditions are labeled based on whether the "first" ( Greek : prot- , referring to the red photoreceptors), "second" ( deuter- , the green), or "third" ( trit- , the blue) photoreceptors are affected.  Protanopia is a severe type of color vision deficiency caused by the complete absence of red retinal photoreceptors. Protans have difficulties distinguishing between blue and green colors and also between red and green colors. It is a form of dichromatism in which the subject can only perceive light wavelengths from 400 to 650 nm, instead of the usual 700 nm. Pure reds cannot be seen, instead appearing black; purple colors cannot be distinguished from blues; more orange-tinted reds may appear as very dim yellows, and all orange–yellow–green shades of too long a wavelength to stimulate the blue receptors appear as a similar yellow hue. It is hereditary, sex-linked, and present in 1% of males.  Deuteranopia is a type of color vision deficiency where the green photoreceptors are absent. It affects hue discrimination in the same way as protanopia, but without the dimming effect. Like protanopia, it is hereditary, sex-linked, and found in about 1% of the male population. [7]  Tritanopia is a very rare color vision disturbance in which there are only two cone pigments present and a total absence of blue retinal receptors. Blues appear greenish, yellows and oranges appear pinkish, and purple colors appear deep red. It is related to chromosome 7. Unlike protanopia and deuteranopia, tritanopia and tritanomaly are not sex-linked traits and can be acquired rather than inherited and can be reversed in some cases.    Anomalous trichromacy is a common type of inherited color vision deficiency, occurring when one of the three cone pigments is altered in its spectral sensitivity.  Protanomaly is a mild color vision defect in which an altered spectral sensitivity of red retinal receptors (closer to green receptor response) results in poor red–green hue discrimination. It is hereditary, sex-linked, and present in 1% of males. The difference with protanopia is that in this case the L-cone is present but malfunctioning, whereas in the earlier the L-cone is completely missing. [8]  Deuteranomaly, caused by a similar shift in the green retinal receptors, is by far the most common type of color vision deficiency, mildly affecting red–green hue discrimination in 5% of European males. It is hereditary and sex-linked. The difference with deuteranopia is that in this case the green sensitive cones are not missing but malfunctioning. [9]  Tritanomaly is a rare, hereditary color vision deficiency affecting blue–green and yellow–red/pink hue discrimination. It is related to chromosome "7". [10] The difference is that the S-cone is malfunctioning but not missing. [11]       Genetics [ edit ]     X-linked recessive inheritance    Color blindness is typically an inherited genetic disorder. It is most commonly inherited from mutations on the X chromosome but the mapping of the human genome has shown there are many causative mutations—mutations capable of causing color blindness originate from at least 19 different chromosomes and 56 different genes (as shown online at the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)). Two of the most common inherited forms of color blindness are protanomaly (and, more rarely, protanopia – the two together often known as "protans") and deuteranomaly (or, more rarely, deuteranopia – the two together often referred to as "deutans"). [12] Both "protans" and "deutans" (of which the deutans are by far the most common) are known as "red–green color-blind" which is present in about 8 percent of human males and 0.6 percent of females of Northern European ancestry. [13]  Some of the inherited diseases known to cause color blindness are:   cone dystrophy  cone-rod dystrophy  achromatopsia (a.k.a. rod monochromatism, stationary cone dystrophy or cone dysfunction syndrome)  blue cone monochromatism (a.k.a. blue cone monochromacy or X-linked achromatopsia)  Leber's congenital amaurosis  retinitis pigmentosa (initially affects rods but can later progress to cones and therefore color blindness).   Inherited color blindness can be congenital (from birth), or it can commence in childhood or adulthood. Depending on the mutation, it can be stationary, that is, remain the same throughout a person's lifetime, or progressive. As progressive phenotypes involve deterioration of the retina and other parts of the eye, certain forms of color blindness can progress to legal blindness, i.e., an acuity of 6/60 (20/200) or worse, and often leave a person with complete blindness.  Color blindness always pertains to the cone photoreceptors in retinas, as the cones are capable of detecting the color frequencies of light.  About 8 percent of males, and 0.6 percent of females, are red-green color blind in some way or another, whether it is one color, a color combination, or another mutation. [14] The reason males are at a greater risk of inheriting an X linked mutation is that males only have one X chromosome (XY, with the Y chromosome carrying altogether different genes than the X chromosome), and females have two (XX); if a woman inherits a normal X chromosome in addition to the one that carries the mutation, she will not display the mutation. Men do not have a second X chromosome to override the chromosome that carries the mutation. If 8% of variants of a given gene are defective, the probability of a single copy being defective is 8%, but the probability that two copies are both defective is 0.08 × 0.08 = 0.0064, or just 0.64%.  Other causes [ edit ]  Other causes of color blindness include brain or retinal damage caused by shaken baby syndrome , accidents and other trauma which produce swelling of the brain in the occipital lobe, and damage to the retina caused by exposure to ultraviolet light (10–300 nm). Damage often presents itself later on in life.  Color blindness may also present itself in the spectrum of degenerative diseases of the eye, such as age-related macular degeneration , and as part of the retinal damage caused by diabetes . Another factor that may affect color blindness includes a deficiency in Vitamin A . [15]  Some subtle forms of colorblindness may be associated with chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy (CSE), caused by longtime exposure to solvent vapors. [16]  Red–green color blindness can be caused by ethambutol , [17] a drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis .  Types [ edit ]     These color charts show how different colorblind people see compared to a person with normal color vision.    Based on clinical appearance, color blindness may be described as total or partial. Total color blindness is much less common than partial color blindness. [18] There are two major types of color blindness: those who have difficulty distinguishing between red and green, and who have difficulty distinguishing between blue and yellow. [19] [20]  Immunofluorescent imaging is a way to determine red–green color coding. Conventional color coding is difficult for individuals with red–green color blindness (protanopia or deuteranopia) to discriminate. Replacing red with magenta or green with turquoise improves visibility for such individuals. [21]  The different kinds of inherited color blindness result from partial or complete loss of function of one or more of the different cone systems. When one cone system is compromised, dichromacy results. The most frequent forms of human color blindness result from problems with either the middle or long wavelength sensitive cone systems, and involve difficulties in discriminating reds, yellows, and greens from one another. They are collectively referred to as "red–green color blindness", though the term is an over-simplification and is somewhat misleading. Other forms of color blindness are much more rare. They include problems in discriminating blues from greens and yellows from reds/pinks, and the rarest forms of all, complete color blindness or monochromacy , where one cannot distinguish any color from grey , as in a black-and-white movie or photograph.  Protanopes, deuteranopes, and tritanopes are dichromats; that is, they can match any color they see with some mixture of just two primary colors (whereas normally humans are trichromats and require three primary colors). These individuals normally know they have a color vision problem and it can affect their lives on a daily basis. Two percent of the male population exhibit severe difficulties distinguishing between red, orange, yellow, and green. A certain pair of colors, that seem very different to a normal viewer, appear to be the same color (or different shades of same color) for such a dichromat. The terms protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia come from Greek and literally mean "inability to see ( anopia ) with the first ( prot- ), second ( deuter- ), or third ( trit- ) [cone]", respectively.  Anomalous trichromacy is the least serious type of color deficiency. [22] People with protanomaly, deuteranomaly, or tritanomaly are trichromats, but the color matches they make differ from the normal. They are called anomalous trichromats. In order to match a given spectral yellow light, protanomalous observers need more red light in a red/green mixture than a normal observer, and deuteranomalous observers need more green. From a practical standpoint though, many protanomalous and deuteranomalous people have very little difficulty carrying out tasks that require normal color vision. Some may not even be aware that their color perception is in any way different from normal.  Protanomaly and deuteranomaly can be diagnosed using an instrument called an anomaloscope , which mixes spectral red and green lights in variable proportions, for comparison with a fixed spectral yellow. If this is done in front of a large audience of males, as the proportion of red is increased from a low value, first a small proportion of the audience will declare a match, while most will see the mixed light as greenish; these are the deuteranomalous observers. Next, as more red is added the majority will say that a match has been achieved. Finally, as yet more red is added, the remaining, protanomalous, observers will declare a match at a point where normal observers will see the mixed light as definitely reddish. [ citation needed ]  Red–green color blindness [ edit ]  Protanopia, deuteranopia, protanomaly, and deuteranomaly are commonly inherited forms of red–green color blindness which affect a substantial portion of the human population. Those affected have difficulty with discriminating red and green hues due to the absence or mutation of the red or green retinal photoreceptors. [12] [23] It is sex-linked : genetic red–green color blindness affects males much more often than females, because the genes for the red and green color receptors are located on the X chromosome , of which males have only one and females have two. Females (46, XX) are red–green color blind only if both their X chromosomes are defective with a similar deficiency, whereas males (46, XY) are color blind if their single X chromosome is defective. [24]  The gene for red–green color blindness is transmitted from a color blind male to all his daughters who are heterozygote carriers and are usually unaffected. In turn, a carrier woman has a fifty percent chance of passing on a mutated X chromosome region to each of her male offspring. The sons of an affected male will not inherit the trait from him, since they receive his Y chromosome and not his (defective) X chromosome. Should an affected male have children with a carrier or colorblind woman, their daughters may be colorblind by inheriting an affected X chromosome from each parent. [24]  Because one X chromosome is inactivated at random in each cell during a woman's development, deuteranomalous heterozygotes (i.e. female carriers of deuteranomaly) are potentially tetrachromats , because they will have the normal long wave (red) receptors, the normal medium wave (green) receptors, the abnormal medium wave (deuteranomalous) receptors and the normal autosomal short wave (blue) receptors in their retinas. [25] [26] [27] The same applies to the carriers of protanomaly (who have two types of short wave receptors, normal medium wave receptors, and normal autosomal short wave receptors in their retinas). If, by chance, a woman is heterozygous for both protanomaly and deuteranomaly she could be pentachromatic. This situation could arise if, for instance, she inherited the X chromosome with the abnormal long wave gene (but normal medium wave gene) from her mother who is a carrier of protanomaly, and her other X chromosome from a deuteranomalous father. Such a woman would have a normal and an abnormal long wave receptor, a normal and abnormal medium wave receptor, and a normal autosomal short wave receptor – 5 different types of color receptors in all. The degree to which women who are carriers of either protanomaly or deuteranomaly are demonstrably tetrachromatic and require a mixture of four spectral lights to match an arbitrary light is very variable. In many cases it is almost unnoticeable, but in a minority the tetrachromacy is very pronounced. [25] [26] [27] However, Jameson et al. [28] have shown that with appropriate and sufficiently sensitive equipment all female carriers of red-green color blindness (i.e. heterozygous protanomaly, or heterozygous deuteranomaly) are tetrachromats to a greater or lesser extent.  Since deuteranomaly is by far the most common form of red-green blindness among men of northwestern European descent (with an incidence of 8%), then the carrier frequency (and of potential deuteranomalous tetrachromacy ) among the females of that genetic stock is 14.7% (= [92% x 8%] x 2 ). [24]     Illustration of the distribution of cone cells in the fovea of an individual with normal color vision (left), and a color blind (protanopic) retina. The center of the fovea holds very few blue-sensitive cones.      Protanopia (1% of males): Lacking the red cones for long-wavelength sensitive retinal cones, those with this condition are unable to distinguish between colors in the green – yellow – red section of the spectrum. They have a neutral point at a cyan -like wavelength around 492 nm (see spectral color for comparison) – that is, they cannot discriminate light of this wavelength from white . For a protanope, the brightness of red, orange, and yellow are much reduced compared to normal. This dimming can be so pronounced that reds may be confused with black or dark gray, and red traffic lights may appear to be extinguished. They may learn to distinguish reds from yellows primarily on the basis of their apparent brightness or lightness, not on any perceptible hue difference. Violet , lavender, and purple are indistinguishable from various shades of blue because their reddish components are so dimmed as to be invisible. For example, pink flowers, reflecting both red light and blue light, may appear just blue to the protanope. A very few people have been found who have one normal eye and one protanopic eye. These unilateral dichromats report that with only their protanopic eye open, they see wavelengths shorter than neutral point as blue and those longer than it as yellow. This is a rare form of color blindness.     Deuteranopia (1% of males): Lacking the green cones for medium-wavelength cones, those affected are again unable to distinguish between colors in the green–yellow–red section of the spectrum. Their neutral point is at a slightly longer wavelength, 498 nm, a more greenish hue of cyan. A deuteranope suffers the same hue discrimination problems as protanopes, but without the abnormal dimming. Purple colors are not perceived as something opposite to spectral colors; all these appear similarly. This form of colorblindness is also known as Daltonism after John Dalton (his diagnosis was confirmed as deuteranopia in 1995, some 150 years after his death, by DNA analysis of his preserved eyeball). Equivalent terms for Daltonism in Romanic languages such as daltonismo ( Spanish , Portuguese and Italian ), daltonisme ( French ), daltonism ( Romanian ) are still used to describe color blindess in a broad sense or deuteranopia in a more restricted sense. Deuteranopic unilateral dichromats report that with only their deuteranopic eye open, they see wavelengths shorter than neutral point as blue and longer than it as yellow. [29]     Protanomaly (1% of males, 0.01% of females): [30] Having a mutated form of the long-wavelength (red) pigment, whose peak sensitivity is at a shorter wavelength than in the normal retina, protanomalous individuals are less sensitive to red light than normal. This means that they are less able to discriminate colors, and they do not see mixed lights as having the same colors as normal observers. They also suffer from a darkening of the red end of the spectrum. This causes reds to reduce in intensity to the point where they can be mistaken for black. Protanomaly is a fairly rare form of color blindness, making up about 1% of the male population. Both protanomaly and deuteranomaly are carried on the X chromosome.     Deuteranomaly (most common—6% of males, 0.4% of females): [30] These individuals have a mutated form of the medium-wavelength (green) pigment. The medium-wavelength pigment is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum resulting in a reduction in sensitivity to the green area of the spectrum. Unlike protanomaly the intensity of colors is unchanged. The deuteranomalous person is considered "green weak". For example, in the evening, dark green cars appear to be black to Deuteranomalous people. Similar to the protanomates, deuteranomates are poor at discriminating small differences in hues in the red, orange, yellow, green region of the spectrum. They make errors in the naming of hues in this region because the hues appear somewhat shifted towards green. One very important difference between deuteranomalous individuals and protanomalous individuals is deuteranomalous individuals do not have the loss of "brightness" problem.   Blue–yellow color blindness [ edit ]  Those with tritanopia and tritanomaly have difficulty discriminating between bluish and greenish hues, as well as yellowish and reddish hues.  Color blindness involving the inactivation of the short-wavelength sensitive cone system (whose absorption spectrum peaks in the bluish-violet) is called tritanopia or, loosely, blue–yellow color blindness. The tritanope's neutral point occurs near a yellowish 570 nm; green is perceived at shorter wavelengths and red at longer wavelengths. [31] Mutation of the short-wavelength sensitive cones is called tritanomaly . Tritanopia is equally distributed among males and females. Jeremy H. Nathans (with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute ) demonstrated that the gene coding for the blue receptor lies on chromosome 7 , which is shared equally by males and females. Therefore, it is not sex-linked. This gene does not have any neighbor whose DNA sequence is similar. Blue color blindness is caused by a simple mutation in this gene.   Tritanopia (less than 1% of males and females): Lacking the short-wavelength cones, those affected see short-wavelength colors ( blue , indigo and a spectral violet ) greenish and drastically dimmed, some of these colors even as black . Yellow is indistinguishable from pink , and purple colors are perceived as various shades of red . This form of color blindness is not sex-linked.     Tritanomaly (equally rare for males and females [0.01% for both]): [30] Having a mutated form of the short-wavelength (blue) pigment. The short-wavelength pigment is shifted towards the green area of the spectrum. This is the rarest form of anomalous trichromacy color blindness. Unlike the other anomalous trichromacy color deficiencies, the mutation for this color blindness is carried on chromosome 7. Therefore, it is equally prevalent in both male and female populations. The OMIM gene code for this mutation is 304000 "Colorblindness, Partial Tritanomaly". [32]   Total color blindness [ edit ]  Total color blindness is defined as the inability to see color. Although the term may refer to acquired disorders such as cerebral achromatopsia also known as color agnosia, it typically refers to congenital color vision disorders (i.e. more frequently rod monochromacy and less frequently cone monochromacy ). [33] [34]  In cerebral achromatopsia, a person cannot perceive colors even though the eyes are capable of distinguishing them. Some sources do not consider these to be true color blindness, because the failure is of perception, not of vision. They are forms of visual agnosia . [34]  Monochromacy is the condition of possessing only a single channel for conveying information about color. Monochromats possess a complete inability to distinguish any colors and perceive only variations in brightness. It occurs in two primary forms:   Rod monochromacy , frequently called achromatopsia , where the retina contains no cone cells, so that in addition to the absence of color discrimination, vision in lights of normal intensity is difficult. While normally rare, achromatopsia is very common on the island of Pingelap , a part of the Pohnpei state, Federated States of Micronesia , where it is called maskun : about 10% of the population there has it, and 30% are unaffected carriers. The island was devastated by a storm in the 18th century (an example of a genetic bottleneck ) and one of the few male survivors carried a gene for achromatopsia. The population grew to several thousand before foreign troops introduced diseases to the island in the 1940s.  Cone monochromacy is the condition of having both rods and cones, but only a single kind of cone. A cone monochromat can have good pattern vision at normal daylight levels, but will not be able to distinguish hues. Blue cone monochromacy (X chromosome) is caused by lack of functionality of L and M cones (red and green). It is encoded at the same place as red–green color blindness on the X chromosome. Peak spectral sensitivities are in the blue region of the visible spectrum (near 440 nm). People with this condition generally show nystagmus ("jiggling eyes"), photophobia (light sensitivity), reduced visual acuity , and myopia (nearsightedness). [35] Visual acuity usually falls to the 20/50 to 20/400 range.   Mechanism [ edit ]  See also: Trichromatic color vision  The typical human retina contains two kinds of light cells: the rod cells ( active in low light ) and the cone cells ( active in normal daylight ). Normally, there are three kinds of cone cells, each containing a different pigment, which are activated when the pigments absorb light. The spectral sensitivities of the cones differ; one is most sensitive to short wavelengths, one to medium wavelengths, and the third to medium-to-long wavelengths within the visible spectrum , with their peak sensitivities in the blue, green, and yellow-green regions of the spectrum, respectively. The absorption spectra of the three systems overlap, and combine to cover the visible spectrum. These receptors are known as short (S), medium (M), and long (L) wavelength cones, but are also often referred to as blue, green, and red cones, although this terminology is inaccurate. [36]  The receptors are each responsive to a wide range of wavelengths. For example, the long wavelength "red" receptor has its peak sensitivity in the yellow-green, some way from the red end (longest wavelength) of the visible spectrum. The sensitivity of normal color vision actually depends on the overlap between the absorption ranges of the three systems: different colors are recognized when the different types of cone are stimulated to different degrees. Red light, for example, stimulates the long wavelength cones much more than either of the others, and reducing the wavelength causes the other two cone systems to be increasingly stimulated, causing a gradual change in hue.  Many of the genes involved in color vision are on the X chromosome , making color blindness much more common in males than in females because males only have one X chromosome, while females have two. Because this is an X-linked trait, an estimated 2–3% of women have a 4th color cone [25] and can be considered tetrachromats . One such woman has been reported to be a true or functional tetrachromat, as she can discriminate colors most other people can't. [26] [27]  Diagnosis [ edit ]     An Ishihara test image as seen by subjects with normal color vision and by those with a variety of color deficiencies    The Ishihara color test , which consists of a series of pictures of colored spots, is the test most often used to diagnose red–green color deficiencies. [37] A figure (usually one or more Arabic digits ) is embedded in the picture as a number of spots in a slightly different color, and can be seen with normal color vision, but not with a particular color defect. The full set of tests has a variety of figure/background color combinations, and enable diagnosis of which particular visual defect is present. The anomaloscope, described above, is also used in diagnosing anomalous trichromacy.   Position yourself about 75cm from your monitor so that the colour test image you are looking at is at eye level, read the description of the image and see what you can see!! It is not necessary in all cases to use the entire set of images. In a large scale examination the test can be simplified to six tests; test, one of tests 2 or 3, one of tests 4, 5, 6, or 7, one of tests 8 or 9, one of tests 10, 11, 12, or 13 and one of tests 14 or 15. [ this quote needs a citation ]   Because the Ishihara color test contains only numerals, it may not be useful in diagnosing young children, who have not yet learned to use numbers. In the interest of identifying these problems early on in life, alternative color vision tests were developed using only symbols (square, circle, car).  Besides the Ishihara color test, the US Navy and US Army also allow testing with the Farnsworth Lantern Test . This test allows 30% of color deficient individuals, whose deficiency is not too severe, to pass.  Another test used by clinicians to measure chromatic discrimination is the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test . The patient is asked to arrange a set of colored caps or chips to form a gradual transition of color between two anchor caps. [38]  The HRR color test (developed by Hardy, Rand , and Rittler) is a red–green color test that, unlike the Ishihara, also has plates for the detection of the tritan defects. [39]  Most clinical tests are designed to be fast, simple, and effective at identifying broad categories of color blindness. In academic studies of color blindness, on the other hand, there is more interest in developing flexible tests to collect thorough datasets, identify copunctal points , and measure just noticeable differences . [40]  Management [ edit ]  There is generally no treatment to cure color deficiencies. ″The American Optometric Association reports a contact lens on one eye can increase the ability to differentiate between colors, though nothing can make you truly see the deficient color.″ [41]  Lenses [ edit ]  Optometrists can supply colored spectacle lenses or a single red-tint contact lens to wear on the non-dominant eye, but although this may improve discrimination of some colors, it can make other colors more difficult to distinguish. A 1981 review of various studies to evaluate the effect of the X-chrom contact lens concluded that, while the lens may allow the wearer to achieve a better score on certain color vision tests, it did not correct color vision in the natural environment. [42] A case history using the X-Chrom lens for a rod monochromat is reported [43] and an X-Chrom manual is online. [44]  Lenses that filter certain wavelengths of light can allow people with a cone anomaly, but not dichromacy, to see better separation of colors, especially those with classic "red/green" color blindness. They work by notching out wavelengths that strongly stimulate both red and green cones in a deuter- or protanomalous person, improving the distinction between the two cones' signals. As of 2013, sunglasses that notch out color wavelengths are available commercially. [45]  Apps [ edit ]  Many applications for iPhone and iPad have been developed to help colorblind people to view the colors in a better way. Many applications launch a sort of simulation of colorblind vision to make normal-view people understand how the color-blinds see the world. Others allow a correction of the image grabbed from the camera with a special "daltonizer" algorithm.  The GNOME  desktop environment provides colorblind accessibility using the gnome-mag and the libcolorblind software. Using a gnome applet, the user may switch a color filter on and off, choosing from a set of possible color transformations that will displace the colors in order to disambiguate them. The software enables, for instance, a colorblind person to see the numbers in the Ishihara test.  Epidemiology [ edit ]   Rates of color blindness [ clarification needed ] [46]    Males  Females    Dichromacy  2.4%  0.03%    Protanopia (red deficient: L cone absent)  1.3%  0.02%    Deuteranopia (green deficient: M cone absent)  1.2%  0.01%    Tritanopia (blue deficient: S cone absent)  0.001%  0.03%    Anomalous trichromacy  6.3%  0.37%    Protanomaly (red deficient: L cone defect)  1.3%  0.02%    Deuteranomaly (green deficient: M cone defect)  5.0%  0.35%    Tritanomaly (blue deficient: S cone defect)  0.0001%  0.0001%    Color blindness affects a large number of individuals, with protanopia and deuteranopia being the most common types. [12] In individuals with Northern European ancestry, as many as 8 percent of men and 0.4 percent of women experience congenital color deficiency. [47]  The number affected varies among groups. Isolated communities with a restricted gene pool sometimes produce high proportions of color blindness, including the less usual types. Examples include rural Finland , Hungary , and some of the Scottish islands. [ citation needed ] In the United States, about 7 percent of the male population—or about 10.5 million men—and 0.4 percent of the female population either cannot distinguish red from green, or see red and green differently from how others do (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 2006 [ clarification needed ] ). More than 95 percent of all variations in human color vision involve the red and green receptors in male eyes. It is very rare for males or females to be "blind" to the blue end of the spectrum.

Because of Dalton's work, the general condition has been called daltonism , although in English this term is now used only for deuteranopia .  Society and culture [ edit ]  Design implications [ edit ]     Testing the colors of a web chart, (center) , to ensure that no information is lost to the various forms of color-blindness.          This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.  (August 2012)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Color codes present particular problems for those with color deficiencies as they are often difficult or impossible for them to perceive.  Good graphic design avoids using color coding or using color contrasts alone to express information; [51] this not only helps color blind people, but also aids understanding by normally sighted people by providing them with multiple reinforcing cues. [ citation needed ]  Designers need to take into account that color-blindness is highly sensitive to differences in material. For example, a red–green colorblind person who is incapable of distinguishing colors on a map printed on paper may have no such difficulty when viewing the map on a computer screen or television. In addition, some color blind people find it easier to distinguish problem colors on artificial materials, such as plastic or in acrylic paints, than on natural materials, such as paper or wood. Third, for some color blind people, color can only be distinguished if there is a sufficient "mass" of color: thin lines might appear black, while a thicker line of the same color can be perceived as having color. [ citation needed ]  Designers should also note that red–blue and yellow–blue color combinations are generally safe. So instead of the ever-popular "red means bad and green means good" system, using these combinations can lead to a much higher ability to use color coding effectively. This will still cause problems for those with monochromatic color blindness, but it is still something worth considering. [52]  When the need to process visual information as rapidly as possible arises, for example in an emergency situation, the visual system may operate only in shades of gray, with the extra information load in adding color being dropped. [ citation needed ] This is an important possibility to consider when designing, for example, emergency brake handles or emergency phones.  Occupations [ edit ]  Color blindness may make it difficult or impossible for a person to engage in certain occupations. Persons with color blindness may be legally or practically barred from occupations in which color perception is an essential part of the job ( e.g., mixing paint colors), or in which color perception is important for safety ( e.g., operating vehicles in response to color-coded signals). This occupational safety principle originates from the Lagerlunda train crash of 1875 in Sweden. Following the crash, Professor Alarik Frithiof Holmgren , a physiologist, investigated and concluded that the color blindness of the engineer (who had died) had caused the crash. Professor Holmgren then created the first test using different-colored skeins to exclude people from jobs in the transportation industry on the basis of color blindness. [53] However, there is a claim that there is no firm evidence that color deficiency did cause the collision, or that it might have not been the sole cause. [54]  Color vision is important for occupations using telephone or computer networking cabling, as the individual wires inside the cables are color-coded using green, orange, brown, blue and white colors. [55] Electronic wiring, transformers, resistors, and capacitors are color-coded as well, using black, brown, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, gray, white, silver, gold. [56]  Driving [ edit ]  Some countries have refused to grant driving licenses to individuals with color blindness. In Romania , there is an ongoing campaign to remove the legal restrictions that prohibit colorblind citizens from getting drivers' licenses. [57]  The usual justification for such restrictions is that drivers of motor vehicles must be able to recognize color-coded signals, such as traffic lights or warning lights. [52]  Piloting aircraft [ edit ]  While many aspects of aviation depend on color coding, only a few of them are critical enough to be interfered with by some milder types of color blindness. Some examples include color-gun signaling of aircraft that have lost radio communication, color-coded glide-path indications on runways, and the like. Some jurisdictions restrict the issuance of pilot credentials to persons who suffer from color blindness for this reason. Restrictions may be partial, allowing color-blind persons to obtain certification but with restrictions, or total, in which case color-blind persons are not permitted to obtain piloting credentials at all. [ citation needed ]  In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration requires that pilots be tested for normal color vision as part of their medical clearance in order to obtain the required medical certificate, a prerequisite to obtaining a pilot's certification. If testing reveals color blindness, the applicant may be issued a license with restrictions, such as no night flying and no flying by color signals—such a restriction effectively prevents a pilot from holding certain flying occupations, such as that of an airline pilot, although commercial pilot certification is still possible, and there are a few flying occupations that do not require night flight and thus are still available to those with restrictions due to color blindness (e.g., agricultural aviation). The government allows several types of tests, including medical standard tests ( e.g., the Ishihara , Dvorine , and others) and specialized tests oriented specifically to the needs of aviation. If an applicant fails the standard tests, they will receive a restriction on their medical certificate that states: "Not valid for night flying or by color signal control". They may apply to the FAA to take a specialized test, administered by the FAA. Typically, this test is the "color vision light gun test". For this test an FAA inspector will meet the pilot at an airport with an operating control tower. The color signal light gun will be shone at the pilot from the tower, and they must identify the color. If they pass they may be issued a waiver, which states that the color vision test is no longer required during medical examinations. They will then receive a new medical certificate with the restriction removed. This was once a Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA), but the SODA was dropped, and converted to a simple waiver (letter) early in the 2000s. [58]  Research published in 2009 carried out by the City University of London 's Applied Vision Research Centre, sponsored by the UK's Civil Aviation Authority and the US Federal Aviation Administration, has established a more accurate assessment of color deficiencies in pilot applicants' red–green and yellow–blue color range which could lead to a 35% reduction in the number of prospective pilots who fail to meet the minimum medical threshold. [59]  Art [ edit ]  Inability to distinguish color does not necessarily preclude the ability to become a celebrated artist. The 20th century expressionist painter Clifton Pugh , three-time winner of Australia's Archibald Prize , on biographical, gene inheritance and other grounds has been identified as a protanope. [60] 19th century French artist Charles Méryon became successful by concentrating on etching rather than painting after he was diagnosed as having a red–green deficiency. [61]  Rights of the color blind [ edit ]  Brazil [ edit ]  A Brazilian court ruled that people with color blindness are protected by the Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Person with Disabilities. [62] [63] [64]  At trial, it was decided that the carriers of color blindness have a right of access to wider knowledge, or the full enjoyment of their human condition.  United States [ edit ]  In the United States, under federal anti-discrimination laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act , color vision deficiencies have not been found to constitute a disability that triggers protection from workplace discrimination. [65]  A famous traffic light on Tipperary Hill in Syracuse, New York , is upside-down due to the sentiments of its Irish American community, [66] but has been criticized due to the potential hazard it poses for color-blind persons. [67]  Research [ edit ]  Some tentative evidence finds that color blind people are better at penetrating certain color camouflages. Such findings may give an evolutionary reason for the high rate of red–green color blindness. [4] There is also a study suggesting that people with some types of color blindness can distinguish colors that people with normal color vision are not able to distinguish. [68] In World War II, color blind observers were used to penetrate camouflage. [69]  In September 2009, the journal Nature reported that researchers at the University of Washington and University of Florida were able to give trichromatic vision to squirrel monkeys , which normally have only dichromatic vision, using gene therapy . [70]  In 2003, a cybernetic device called eyeborg was developed to allow the wearer to hear sounds representing different colors. [71] Achromatopsic artist Neil Harbisson was the first to use such a device in early 2004; the eyeborg allowed him to start painting in color by memorizing the sound corresponding to each color. In 2012, at a TED Conference , Harbisson explained how he could now perceive colors outside the ability of human vision.

Leer en Español:   ¿Quién está en riesgo de desarrollar daltonismo?             Mar. 03, 2014    Men are at much higher risk for being born with color blindness than women, who seldom have the problem. An estimated one in ten males has some form of color deficiency. Color blindness is more common among men of Northern European descent.  Having certain conditions, including glaucoma,  macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, chronic alcoholism, leukemia and sickle cell anemia, may increase your risk for acquired color deficiency.  Certain drugs may also increase your risk for acquiring color blindness. The drug hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) can cause color blindness. It is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, among other conditions.    Previous What Are the Symptoms and Causes of Color Blindness?
