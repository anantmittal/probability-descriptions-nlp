I was helping my kid with probability lessons provided on http://www.mathgoodies.com/worksheets/pdf/unit6_wks1_key.pdf . One of the questions,  "What is the probability of choosing the letter i from the word probability?" has the answer 2/9 (following logic of having a sample set of 9 letters in "probability"). I contacted mathgoodies.com and suggested that if they follow that logic, then (a famous example, I guess) the probability of choosing S from MISSISSIPPI is 4/4. Which obviously isn't. Or am I confused?  Thank you    probability     share | cite | improve this question     asked Nov 4 '14 at 1:27       Sasha   13 1 4                  Thank you, Clement. I was not confused after all. – Sasha  Nov 4 '14 at 23:23            I actually had trouble understanding the question until I noticed that the last "probability" should have been in quotes, as it is about the word "probability" (a sequence of 11 letters), not about some unspecified word probability (the probability of some word(s)). Of course the mistake was already in the linked exercise sheet. – celtschk  Jan 21 '17 at 11:04        add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  3  down vote  accepted      It depends on how they define "choosing from", I reckon, but indeed according to the natural interpretation (picking a letter uniformly at random), it should be $2/11$ The sample space is of size 9, indeed, but not all elements have equal probability:   p,r,o,a,l,t,y have each probability 1/11  b,i have each probability 2/11   The total is indeed $7\cdot \frac{1}{11}+2\cdot \frac{2}{11}=1$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 4 '14 at 1:45       Clement C.   42.7k 2 31 76              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

However if you mean with single choice from the 11 characters of the word Mississippi, then the probability is 4 chances in 11 which is just over 36% or a probability of 0.363636 recurring. My odd answer illustrates the need to pose questions without ambiguity.

Suppose we have a completely shuffled standard deck of cards. It includes 52 cards, 13 from each figure. If we pick a card at random, we have a chance of 13/52 = 1/4 of picking a heart. Therefore, the probability of picking a heart at random is 0.25.               CogitoErgoCogitoSum  136 Contributions      What is the probability that a letter picked at random is a vowel?  Well, consider that there are 26 letters in the alphabet. 5 of these are vowels (a, e, i, o and u).    Therefore the probability is 5/26 - or 0.192307692.    This assumes, of course, that you are randomly picking a letter from the alphabet... or rather, that each letter occurs in equal proportion within a larger text.    This assumes the English alphabet. In other alphabets from other languages, there may be a different quantity of vowels and a different quantity of consonants (or possibly other letters all together).    In writing, however, it is not the case that each letter appears in equal proportion. In a typical written document, for example, vowels make up about 38% of a text, on average. But it depends on a particular text, too, it may vary a little.    Of course, it matters which language you draw a text from. Those languages which use the exact same alphabet as in English dont necessarily have the same distribution of vowels in text.

The probability of any  event is a number in the range [0, 1] so theanswer cannot be 13!  A normal deck two coulours, not 4: red and black. It thereforecontains 26 red cards and so the probability is 26/52 = 1/2.            Probability of picking a four digit lottery number?

Phelikx  1,925 Contributions      What is the probability that a letter picked at random is not a vowel?  To work out probability you have to know the number of possible options, and how many of those options meet the criteria. In this case there are 26 possible options (all the letters) and 21 that meet the criteria (21 non-vowels). The probability is the number that match divided by the total number possible. In this case it would be 21/26. This comes out to approximately 0.80769.

He plays a teenager who moves to a small town where dancing is illegal. Dean Pitchford, who wrote the screenplay to the film and the lyrics to all the songs in the movie, got the idea from a 1979 newspaper article about the town of Elmore City, Oklahoma, where a law against dancing was on the books since the 1800s. The 14 high school seniors decided they wanted a prom, and got the town council to overturn the antiquated interdiction so they could dance. Pitchford visited Elmore City to research his screenplay, where he spent a week immersing himself in their culture. Pitchford was an actor, appearing in stage productions of Godspell and Pippin before getting a chance to write lyrics for songs in the 1980 movie Fame . He started working on Footloose when he was a staff songwriter for Warner Brothers Publishing. For a while it looked like 20th Century Fox was going to pick up the screenplay, but it ended up being produced by Paramount, who were rewarded with $80 million in ticket sales from the film, which cost about $8 million to make. Dean Pitchford called his screenplay "Cheek To Cheek" as a placeholder for a real title. Once it became clear that studios were interested, he had to come up with a real title. In our 2012 interview, Pitchford explained: "I really had to come up with a better title. So I did what I do with lyric writing: I took a yellow legal tablet, and any ideas that I had, I did not edit. I just wrote down, line after line after line. I filled page after page after page with variations and ideas that I had for it. About Day 2, I wrote down 'footloose and fancy free,' and then I wrote down 'footloose,' and then separately 'fancy free.' When I went back over the list, I think I had four that I thought might be good ideas. But 'Footloose' was by far my favorite. I typed up hypothetical title pages, and I put, 'this title by Dean Pitchford,' as the title of the new screenplay. Then I put the four of them in a stack, and I put 'Footloose' on the bottom. I took them into a meeting with Craig (Melnick) and Dan (Zadan, producers at Fox), and I said, 'Here are some ideas for the title.' They looked at number one, they went, 'Okay. All right.' And they flipped it over, and number two, and they flipped it over, and number three, 'Okay.' And then they flipped over the last one, which was 'Footloose by Dean Pitchford,' and they lit up like a Christmas tree. I had deliberately done it that way, because it was my favorite and I was saving it for the end. And they felt what I felt, which was it was just such an interesting looking word and it didn't mean anything, but it did. And all those 'O's' gave it a visual kind of punch. We all just went for it. It sort of sold itself. I certainly didn't have an idea for a song, because I hadn't yet gotten together with Kenny Loggins. But it's one of those interesting words that looks good on paper - you see it scrawled across a billboard, and it sells itself." (Here's the full Dean Pitchford interview .) Kenny Loggins was a big star and helped make Caddyshack a huge success with his song " I'm Alright " in 1980. In 1982, he had a hit with "Don't Fight It," which he wrote with Pitchford and Steve Perry, who also sang on the track. Getting Loggins for the title track was huge for Pitchford, who had never written a screenplay before and was trying to sell a movie based around nine songs - not a popular concept at the time. Losing Loggins could have derailed the entire project, and when Kenny broke a rib from a fall he took at a show in Provo, Footloose almost met its doom. Loggins had to take time off to recover, and the only chance for Dean to write with him was during his engagement at Lake Tahoe, Nevada, where he was performing before heading to Asia. Said Pitchford: "Paramount was chomping at the bit. They wanted to know that Kenny Loggins was going to be doing the title song, and if he wasn't then we had to move on and get somebody else. So it became absolutely vital that as soon as Kenny was back on his feet, I had to go and seal the deal, and the only place that we could seal the deal, he was going to attempt to get himself back on his feet in Tahoe, play one last engagement in the States, and then go off to Asia. So it was decided that although Kenny lived at the time in the L.A. area, I should fly to Tahoe, and during the days when he was playing a show at night, we would try to at least get the beginning of a song so that I could go back to Paramount and say, 'Look, Kenny Loggins is pregnant, he is on board.' So I flew up to Tahoe in January of 1983, I think. I flew up sick, and I proceeded to get sicker and sicker and sicker while I was there. I had strep throat, as it turned out, but I could not let on to Kenny that I had strep throat, because I didn't want him going, 'Ooo, I can't come to your room, we can't be doing that.' And he was indeed coming to my room, because his wife Eva was there, and they had three kids at the time. I think she had given birth to their third, Isabella, so there were two little boys and a baby in his room. So that was not a place to work. So each day he would come to my room with a guitar and he was still taped up, with gauze and tape around his midriff while his rib was healing. He would show up with a guitar and he would ease himself into a chair, and it was obvious that sitting down was painful - if he was standing he was fine. I was spraying my throat full of Chloraseptic to kill the pain and taking decongestants so it didn't sound like I had a cold or any kind of problems. I was running a fever, like 101, but I wasn't going to let on to him, because I didn't want him running out of my hotel room. I think it was two or three days we kept up this charade with him showing up on his painkillers and me on my painkillers, and us getting the gist of the song. We wrote the verses and the chorus melodies, we wrote the first verse, and we knew what we were going to do for the chorus. Then he went off and he left me with the melody for 'I'm Free,' which is his other contribution to the movie. While he was gone, I wrote the rest of the lyric to 'Footloose,' except the bridge. We finished the bridge after he came back to the States and I went over to his house, which may have been in the Valley. I was newish to L.A. so I was kind of foggy on where the neighborhoods were. But we wrote two verses and two choruses in advance, and then put the 'First we got to turn you around,' all that stuff was the final addition that completed the song." A key songwriting device on this one is the use of various names: Louise, Jack, Marie and Milo. Marie was Dean Pitchford's mother; Milo was Loggins' idea because he liked the sound of the vowels. Pitchford explained: "Once I had cracked the back of the song with the 'Oo-wee, Marie, shake it shake it for me,' once we had the idea of using names throughout the chorus and calling out, 'Jack, get back, come on before we crack,' once that had been set up as a convention, he threw out Milo because he liked the way that the words felt in his mouth. And there may have been one or two other lines that he came up with. And he did that on several other songs that we wrote. Like, we did a song for his next album called 'Let There Be Love,' and he gave me a couple of not even lines, at least the ends of lines. The word that he wanted the line to end on, or the word that he wanted the high note to be on. So it was like somebody stepping up to a canvas and putting a couple of strokes of paint on and saying, 'Okay, now go finish the painting,' and you having to figure out how to incorporate the strokes of paint into the ultimate picture." There were nine original songs the Footloose movie, and six of them were Top 40 US hits. The film was released on February 17, 1984, and the week of April 14, four songs from the movie were in the Top 40: the title track, " Let's Hear It For The Boy " (by Deniece Williams, it also peaked at #1), " Holding Out For A Hero " (Bonnie Tyler) and "Dancing in the Sheets" (Shalamar). " Almost Paradise " entered the chart in May and became a #1 Adult Contemporary hit; the last single was the other one from Kenny Loggins, "I'm Free (Heaven Helps The Man)." Another popular song in the film that was not released as a single was "The Girl Gets Around" by Sammy Hagar. Dean Pitchford wrote the lyrics to all of these songs with a variety of co-writers. He knew what kind of songs he wanted in different part of the film, and he also wanted to avoid repetition. This led to a variety of styles and some serious crossover success. The soundtrack spent 10 weeks at #1, knocking Michael Jackson's Thriller album from the top spot in the US. We know it doesn't make a lot of sense, but we really thought Kenny Loggins was "punching my car" and kicking off his "Sundance shoes," when he was really punching his card and putting on his Sunday shoes (which goes along with the religious theme in the movie - church shoes aren't good for dancing). When we asked Pitchford about the way Loggins sang his words, Dean replied: "The way that Kenny sings, I was just so in love with the way that his voice worked around the words, I was never really aware that they were hard to understand, because I knew what the words were, and I never called him on that. But I would imagine maybe if you were listening to the song for the first time, there might be a couple of things that you go, 'Come again?'" Pitchford adds that as he got older, he got more particular about how his lyrics were sung. He even asked Barbra Streisand to redo a vocal on his song "If I Never Met You" to clarify a word, which she graciously did. After the film was released, Dean Pitchford realized that in a way, he was telling his own story with Footloose . He told us, "I was asked to speak at a seminar in Seattle for a film festival. This was about two years after Footloose opened, the original movie in 1984. I was picked up at the airport by an intern who on the way into town was making conversation. He'd obviously done his research, and he asked me whether or not my writing Footloose had anything to do with the fact that when I was a teenager, my family had been uprooted - I had grown up in Honolulu and I moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where my father had gotten work, and I was really a fish out of water there. He asked me whether my choosing to write a story about a boy who was transplanted to a small Midwest town had anything to do with my having been transplanted myself. And I was stunned, because in the entire time that I had been writing that movie, making that movie, promoting that movie, I had never made that connection, and it took this guy who had done a little bit of research about my background to draw the line to that connection. I honestly had never thought of it." This single was released a few weeks ahead of the movie, and the video, which used scenes from the film, got a lot of airplay on MTV, building anticipation for the release. By the time the film hit theaters, the song was already in the Top 40, and it went to #1 on March 31, 1984, where it remained for 3 weeks. MTV played a key role in marketing the film, and movie studios tried to follow this template, enlisting major acts to record a song for their movies and producing slick videos with scenes from the movie, essentially creating a preview. Dean Pitchford refused to make a sequel to Footloose , but he did help turn it into a Broadway play that ran from 1998-2000. In 2011, a remake of the movie hit theaters, with the Country star Blake Shelton recording a new version of this title track. Shelton told The Boot about it: "It's like a lot of stuff from that era - it was rock at the time, but is pretty much what we hear on country radio today. So I knew that we didn't have to stray that far away from the original," said Shelton. "When I open my mouth, what comes out is country. It was going to sound country no matter what, but I didn't want it to be too different. There's two ways to bring back a song: one is to try to make it your own, and in this instance, you have to remove yourself from it and step into the role of what's best for the movie and that particular scene. There's really only one way to approach it when you think of it that way: a fun, uptempo, catchy version just like Kenny Loggins did." This was the biggest hit and the only #1 for Loggins. It exposed him to an international audience when the movie did well outside of America. Two years later, Loggins contributed " Danger Zone " to the Top Gun soundtrack. Loggins stated in 2007 that of all his soundtrack hits, this is the one he most likes performing. "It's such a lighthearted tune. It's like doing a Chuck Berry song every night," said Loggins. Kevin Bacon revealed to Conan O'Brien that he bribes DJ's at weddings with cash so they won't play the song. "I go to the disc jockey and hand him $20 and say, 'Please don't play that song,'" he told the talk show host. "Because, first off, a wedding is really not about me. It's about the bride and groom."

This was to be one of the first concerts after the release of the movie Footloose, which was filmed in the area, so everyone was all pumped up for the concert... The lights were down and the anticipation was building for the start of the concert...only for the dark lights to linger too long, and people started wondering what was up.....and then later the lights came on, and an announcer broke the news to all the audience that Loggins had fallen and was hurt and was now on his way to the hospital...we all stood there, not wanting to leave, thinking it was some kind of a joke...the announcer had to tell the disbelieving audience two more times to leave... But some weeks later he recovered and came back to do a special make-up concert performance for us that really rocked! He even went a little linger than usual, just to make it uo to everyone...He really was gracious and apologetic about it all...the audience just loved him in concert! Bruce - San Jose, Calif. Country singer Blake Shelton redid the song for the upcoming remake starring Kenny Wormwald in the Kevin Bacon role which was originally to have been played by Zac Efron. Sara - Silver Spring, Md i like the song because it movited me.I like to sing and dance to it. Isabella Dray - Ohio, Oh "Footloose", a movie title theme song, was replaced at No.1  by another movie title theme song; "Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)" by Phil Collins!!! Barry - Sauquoit, Ny It was nominated for an Academy Award. The movie is not one of the worst ever made. The other Oscar nominated song was Deniece Williams who did perform her song at the Oscars! Sara - Silver Spring, Md Oddly enough at the Oscars ceremony the choreographer Debbie "Fame" Allen sang (or danced to Footloose) and Loggins didn't perform it at all. Perhaps it was the same reason Phil Collins didn't sing "Against All Odds" the writers were too old to know who he was... Sara - Silver Spring, Md This was in the film Romy and Michele's High School Reunion. Also female singer Aoife sang it for the UK reality show "Maria" produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber, it's much more better when a guy sings it. Sara - Silver Spring, Md This is Kenny Loggins' signature tune and he always does it as an encore. I believe the Beastie Boys or some rap group sampled it Sara - Silver Spring, Md Personally, I loved this movie.  I still like watching it every once in a while...epecially now that the 80's are over.  It's fun to watch them dance in it.  And the clothes they wear.  It's just a fun movie.  'Course I also loved Xanadu and Seargent Peppers (with the Bee Gees)Ha! Mary - Phoenix, Az If you think Footloose was Bad, try to find the Kevin and Kyra movie called Pyrates. A couple actually cause fires to start every time they try to make love(and they do it a lot). Larry - Des Moines, Ia we love footloose. greatest song ever invented. Backky - Baton Rouge, La If you think this is the worst movie ever made, you're being far too kind to thousands of other worse movies. Rob - Vancouver, Canada if you really like Kevin Bacon, watch Sleepers! Such a good and creepy movie!  The movie Footloose wasn't a bad movie - it was actually a fairly good movie but you've also gotta look at it from a musical perspective because the movie has a fair bit of music (and fairly good music) in it. Lynz - Ontario, Canada Well, he does have a really, really big.....um, screen presence. Ash - Charleston, Wv the songs fun to dance to if your in a crazy mood. the movies pretty good to...but i guess i just really like kevin bacon. Kristina - Houston, Tx Dani:  please!  This movie features a scene in which a game of "chicken" is played between two people riding tractors.  TRACTORS!! Ash - Charleston, Wv all these comments totally dis this movie! personally i think this movie is awsome! the music in it is sooo up beat and it gets u in a good mood. Dani - Winnipeg, Canada This song is a complete ripoff of Funk 49 by the James Gang. Joe - New York City, United States I'm sure if I thought about it long enough, I could come up with a lot of movies that are worse than Footloose.  I don't actually think it's THE worst movie.  But boy, it's pretty damn bad. Ashley - Charleston, Wv Main melody ripped from The James Gang's Funk #49 Rob - Heerlen, Netherlands ash, there are far worse movies out there (try Space Muntiny or Alexander) heck there are worse Kevin Bacon movies out there (Hollow Man, that one where he is a bicicle messenger) This is however the worst Kevin Bacon film made into a broadway musical... Tremors on Ice coming in second Monty - Omaha, Ne Quite possibly the worst movie ever made. Ash - Charleston, Wv The video for this is notable in that it was one of the first music videos where the artist was nowhere to be seen. Kei - Salem, Or Menatally chalenged singer songwriter Larry Melvin wrote "Larry Loose" based on this song.

Decoding the modern Indian flyer  The present generation is truly distinctive when it comes to travel—right from the destinations they pick and the adventures they pursue, to how they choose to get there and back. Understanding this unique mindset will go a long way in transforming the future of travel.  brand stories  Updated: Dec 12, 2017 16:29 IST          Promotional Feature , HT Brand Studio        (Vistara)                            Bangalore-based consultant Debanuj Chakraborti takes an average of 16 flights a month, mostly within major Indian cities and metros. A senior market research executive in his 30s, he’s no stranger to red-eye travel and frequent layovers. “I try and schedule meetings early enough, so as to make the most of the city I’m flying to,” he explains. “Often I’ve lined up three meetings in one city, before flying back in time for a late dinner.” Does he not find it stressful? “I like being on the move,” he grins. “Besides, it also gives me the chance to catch up for a quick lunch or drink with friends in whichever city I am in. And I get a lot done on flights!” So does Nikhil S, (34) a senior content professional who works remotely from New Delhi for a technology start-up based out of Dona Paula, Goa. He flies down twice, sometimes thrice every month, for meetings with his content and business teams. “I usually fly in early on a Wednesday morning and work out of Goa for the rest of the week,” he explains. “I’m usually fine-tuning my 9 AM presentation on the flight or catching up on reports, so it’s really an extension of my work day.” Both professionals, in many ways, illustrate how the present generation of Indian travels differently from their predecessors. Business trips, frequent flights, and hotel beds are no longer likely to ruffle the modern executive; in fact, many look at it as a chance to explore new places and meet people. And, for both, spending their transit time as productively as possible seems to be of utmost essence. Time is of essence As the nature of business travel evolves, it only follows that forward-thinking service providers must reinvent themselves to suit the new breed of corporate travellers, which is well-heeled, motivated, and very particular about their time. One example of business travel innovation was when the Marriott Group started designing their hotel rooms to be desk-free , citing that millennial travellers tend to use their laptops, tabs, and phones from anywhere and not necessarily a traditional roll-top study table. Similarly, airlines and airports around the world are also reinventing their technologies keeping this new generation in mind. From biometric check-ins and one-stop boarding, to robots picking up your luggage – innovation labs across the globe are brimming with ideas. In India, Vistara is revolutionizing flying for business through its exclusive Premium Economy services. Designed specifically keeping the high-flying corporate traveller in mind, it centres its offerings on being not just luxurious and high-end, but also practical and efficient. For example, airport security lines, long check-in wait times, and delays in boarding are sore points for nearly all the business travellers we spoke to. To this end, Premium Economy allows travellers the chance to beat all queues in one sweep. Not only do guests have dedicated check-in counters at terminals, they also get to board before others and settle into their seats before the rest. In another example, business travellers as a general rule, tend to carry only cabin baggage due to the short nature of their trips. But, not everyone can afford such flexibility. Angira Mitra, 31, a marketing professional with an MNC in New Delhi, often travels for two weeks straight – covering multiple cities on her distribution schedule. “It’s happened more than once that my entire day has run haywire because my check-in baggage took over 45 minutes to come,” she recollects. “So much for arriving early.” Keeping professionals like her and many others in mind, Vistara’s Premium Economy service also ensures that guests can claim their checked-in bags on priority, before the rest of the passengers, thus saving time once again. Preferential treatments, flexible rules Essentially, businesses with foresight have understood that customization is a key factor towards retaining millennial customers. Just like one traveller differs from another, so will their baggage requirements and expectations. For instance, even on short trips, corporate travellers often combine several commitments within the span of one or two nights; apart from work meetings, they may have several high-profile events, networking dinners, or social events on their calendar. This often means carrying a combination of formal, festive, and evening wear for what is essentially a two-day trip. Here, too, Vistara steps in with an acute understanding of its audience—by allowing an additional 5kgs of cabin baggage for its Premium Economy guests. This gives them the flexibility to pack as per their convenience and schedule, while also avoiding the hassles of checking in. Interestingly, the airline also extends the same courtesy for those travelling with more than carry-on; PE guests also get 5kgs extra for their check-in luggage. Flying into the new Even as the last two decades saw a massive rise in fuss-free budget airlines in India, many corporate travellers still seem to prefer the feeling of indulgence and exclusivity of flying business class. In fact, according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group, millennials are 60% more likely to upgrade for extra legroom and are far more open to paying for roomier seats, more head-room, and in-flight entertainment. Apart from fostering a sense of accomplishment, this choice is also governed by practical reasons. “Look, new-age airlines have a lot going for them, in terms of efficiency and convenience. But I like a nice meal on my morning flights, and preferably a strong cup of coffee to wake me up,” asserts Rahul Sinha, 36, co-founder of a media start-up in Mumbai. He goes on to explain how given a choice between a full-service flight and a budget one, he’s often opted for the former, despite the difference of a few thousand rupees in tickets. “It’s not just the food itself, you know,” he says. “I like the entire experience of full-service flights – it makes me feel more cared for, and I don’t mind spending a bit extra to get that.” Airlines that strike the balance between luxury and efficiency, therefore, go a long way in fostering customer loyalty. Once again, Vistara illustrates this balance through its Premium Economy services. Apart from saving precious time, guests also enjoy a luxurious, well-appointed exclusive cabin towards the front of the craft with 20% more legroom and 4.5-inch recline for added comfort—not just to accommodate essentials but also to work, watch movies, or catch some much-needed sleep. Together with on-board gourmet meals and your favourite Starbucks coffee, it ensures that guests reach their destinations refreshed, and ready to take on the challenges ahead.

I was helping my kid with probability lessons provided on http://www.mathgoodies.com/worksheets/pdf/unit6_wks1_key.pdf . One of the questions,  "What is the probability of choosing the letter i from the word probability?" has the answer 2/9 (following logic of having a sample set of 9 letters in "probability"). I contacted mathgoodies.com and suggested that if they follow that logic, then (a famous example, I guess) the probability of choosing S from MISSISSIPPI is 4/4. Which obviously isn't. Or am I confused?  Thank you    probability     share | cite | improve this question     asked Nov 4 '14 at 1:27       Sasha   13 1 4                  Thank you, Clement. I was not confused after all. – Sasha  Nov 4 '14 at 23:23            I actually had trouble understanding the question until I noticed that the last "probability" should have been in quotes, as it is about the word "probability" (a sequence of 11 letters), not about some unspecified word probability (the probability of some word(s)). Of course the mistake was already in the linked exercise sheet. – celtschk  Jan 21 '17 at 11:04        add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  3  down vote  accepted      It depends on how they define "choosing from", I reckon, but indeed according to the natural interpretation (picking a letter uniformly at random), it should be $2/11$ The sample space is of size 9, indeed, but not all elements have equal probability:   p,r,o,a,l,t,y have each probability 1/11  b,i have each probability 2/11   The total is indeed $7\cdot \frac{1}{11}+2\cdot \frac{2}{11}=1$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Nov 4 '14 at 1:45       Clement C.   42.7k 2 31 76              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

However if you mean with single choice from the 11 characters of the word Mississippi, then the probability is 4 chances in 11 which is just over 36% or a probability of 0.363636 recurring. My odd answer illustrates the need to pose questions without ambiguity.

Well, consider that there are 26 letters in the alphabet. 5 of these are vowels (a, e, i, o and u).    Therefore the probability is 5/26 - or 0.192307692.    This assumes, of course, that you are randomly picking a letter from the alphabet... or rather, that each letter occurs in equal proportion within a larger text.    This assumes the English alphabet. In other alphabets from other languages, there may be a different quantity of vowels and a different quantity of consonants (or possibly other letters all together).    In writing, however, it is not the case that each letter appears in equal proportion. In a typical written document, for example, vowels make up about 38% of a text, on average. But it depends on a particular text, too, it may vary a little.    Of course, it matters which language you draw a text from. Those languages which use the exact same alphabet as in English dont necessarily have the same distribution of vowels in text.

What is the probability of picking any red coloured card from a pack?  it is 13/52 because there are always 4 different card colours ineach deck so divide 4 in 52 and your answer is 13  hope you understand my equation  * * * * *  Hope you don't because it is incorrect! The probability of any  event is a number in the range [0, 1] so theanswer cannot be 13!  A normal deck two coulours, not 4: red and black. It thereforecontains 26 red cards and so the probability is 26/52 = 1/2.            Probability of picking a four digit lottery number?

Phelikx  1,925 Contributions      What is the probability that a letter picked at random is not a vowel?  To work out probability you have to know the number of possible options, and how many of those options meet the criteria. In this case there are 26 possible options (all the letters) and 21 that meet the criteria (21 non-vowels). The probability is the number that match divided by the total number possible. In this case it would be 21/26. This comes out to approximately 0.80769. Thus the probability that a letter picked at random is not a vowel is 0.80769               Al Cohen  126,337 Contributions  Senior Fellow in Electrical Engineering      What is the probability that you pick an odd number at random from 75 to 100?

Decoding the modern Indian flyer  The present generation is truly distinctive when it comes to travel—right from the destinations they pick and the adventures they pursue, to how they choose to get there and back. Understanding this unique mindset will go a long way in transforming the future of travel.  brand stories  Updated: Dec 12, 2017 16:29 IST          Promotional Feature , HT Brand Studio        (Vistara)                            Bangalore-based consultant Debanuj Chakraborti takes an average of 16 flights a month, mostly within major Indian cities and metros. A senior market research executive in his 30s, he’s no stranger to red-eye travel and frequent layovers. “I try and schedule meetings early enough, so as to make the most of the city I’m flying to,” he explains. “Often I’ve lined up three meetings in one city, before flying back in time for a late dinner.” Does he not find it stressful? “I like being on the move,” he grins. “Besides, it also gives me the chance to catch up for a quick lunch or drink with friends in whichever city I am in. And I get a lot done on flights!” So does Nikhil S, (34) a senior content professional who works remotely from New Delhi for a technology start-up based out of Dona Paula, Goa. He flies down twice, sometimes thrice every month, for meetings with his content and business teams. “I usually fly in early on a Wednesday morning and work out of Goa for the rest of the week,” he explains. “I’m usually fine-tuning my 9 AM presentation on the flight or catching up on reports, so it’s really an extension of my work day.” Both professionals, in many ways, illustrate how the present generation of Indian travels differently from their predecessors. Business trips, frequent flights, and hotel beds are no longer likely to ruffle the modern executive; in fact, many look at it as a chance to explore new places and meet people. And, for both, spending their transit time as productively as possible seems to be of utmost essence. Time is of essence As the nature of business travel evolves, it only follows that forward-thinking service providers must reinvent themselves to suit the new breed of corporate travellers, which is well-heeled, motivated, and very particular about their time. One example of business travel innovation was when the Marriott Group started designing their hotel rooms to be desk-free , citing that millennial travellers tend to use their laptops, tabs, and phones from anywhere and not necessarily a traditional roll-top study table. Similarly, airlines and airports around the world are also reinventing their technologies keeping this new generation in mind. From biometric check-ins and one-stop boarding, to robots picking up your luggage – innovation labs across the globe are brimming with ideas. In India, Vistara is revolutionizing flying for business through its exclusive Premium Economy services. Designed specifically keeping the high-flying corporate traveller in mind, it centres its offerings on being not just luxurious and high-end, but also practical and efficient. For example, airport security lines, long check-in wait times, and delays in boarding are sore points for nearly all the business travellers we spoke to. To this end, Premium Economy allows travellers the chance to beat all queues in one sweep. Not only do guests have dedicated check-in counters at terminals, they also get to board before others and settle into their seats before the rest. In another example, business travellers as a general rule, tend to carry only cabin baggage due to the short nature of their trips. But, not everyone can afford such flexibility. Angira Mitra, 31, a marketing professional with an MNC in New Delhi, often travels for two weeks straight – covering multiple cities on her distribution schedule. “It’s happened more than once that my entire day has run haywire because my check-in baggage took over 45 minutes to come,” she recollects. “So much for arriving early.” Keeping professionals like her and many others in mind, Vistara’s Premium Economy service also ensures that guests can claim their checked-in bags on priority, before the rest of the passengers, thus saving time once again. Preferential treatments, flexible rules Essentially, businesses with foresight have understood that customization is a key factor towards retaining millennial customers. Just like one traveller differs from another, so will their baggage requirements and expectations. For instance, even on short trips, corporate travellers often combine several commitments within the span of one or two nights; apart from work meetings, they may have several high-profile events, networking dinners, or social events on their calendar. This often means carrying a combination of formal, festive, and evening wear for what is essentially a two-day trip. Here, too, Vistara steps in with an acute understanding of its audience—by allowing an additional 5kgs of cabin baggage for its Premium Economy guests. This gives them the flexibility to pack as per their convenience and schedule, while also avoiding the hassles of checking in. Interestingly, the airline also extends the same courtesy for those travelling with more than carry-on; PE guests also get 5kgs extra for their check-in luggage. Flying into the new Even as the last two decades saw a massive rise in fuss-free budget airlines in India, many corporate travellers still seem to prefer the feeling of indulgence and exclusivity of flying business class. In fact, according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group, millennials are 60% more likely to upgrade for extra legroom and are far more open to paying for roomier seats, more head-room, and in-flight entertainment. Apart from fostering a sense of accomplishment, this choice is also governed by practical reasons. “Look, new-age airlines have a lot going for them, in terms of efficiency and convenience. But I like a nice meal on my morning flights, and preferably a strong cup of coffee to wake me up,” asserts Rahul Sinha, 36, co-founder of a media start-up in Mumbai. He goes on to explain how given a choice between a full-service flight and a budget one, he’s often opted for the former, despite the difference of a few thousand rupees in tickets. “It’s not just the food itself, you know,” he says. “I like the entire experience of full-service flights – it makes me feel more cared for, and I don’t mind spending a bit extra to get that.” Airlines that strike the balance between luxury and efficiency, therefore, go a long way in fostering customer loyalty. Once again, Vistara illustrates this balance through its Premium Economy services. Apart from saving precious time, guests also enjoy a luxurious, well-appointed exclusive cabin towards the front of the craft with 20% more legroom and 4.5-inch recline for added comfort—not just to accommodate essentials but also to work, watch movies, or catch some much-needed sleep. Together with on-board gourmet meals and your favourite Starbucks coffee, it ensures that guests reach their destinations refreshed, and ready to take on the challenges ahead.
