Credit: Daniel Martin | CDC     Young children who are infected with Ebola may be more likely to die from the virus than older children or adults who are infected, according to a new study.  In the study, researchers examined Ebola cases in children younger than 16 during the current outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and compared them with adult cases. They found that the outbreak's death rate has been higher among younger children than among older children and adults.  The disease has killed about 90 percent of infected children under age 1, and about 80 percent of kids ages 1 to 4 who have been infected. Older children who have been infected with Ebola may have a much better chance of surviving , as the death rate has been lower — 52 percent — for children ages 10 to 15. Among children older than 15 and adults, the mortality rate was 65 percent.  "The very youngest of children — neonates  —appear to have the worst outcomes from Ebola," study co-author Dr. Robert Fowler, an associate professor of critical-care medicine at the University of Toronto, said in a statement. (Neonates, or newborns, are babies younger than 1 month.)  There are a number of factors that may explain the high Ebola mortality rate in newborns, Fowler said. For instance, the youngest children are often heavily dependent on others to care for them, and their caregivers may have also been sick with Ebola. Younger kids may also be particularly prone to dehydration and metabolic abnormalities that result from vomiting and diarrhea, which are common symptoms of the disease.  To prevent dehydration, children need to receive a sufficient amount of fluids , which are usually administered intravenously when the children can no longer keep fluids down because they have been vomiting, Fowler said.  However, getting those fluids into the body by "placing intravenous catheters in young children can be challenging," he said. [ Where Did Ebola Come From? ]  The study shows that Ebola affects young children differently from adults, study co-author Christl Donnelly, a professor at Imperial College London, said in a statement.  Therefore, "it's especially important that we get them [children] into treatment quickly," she said. "We also need to look at whether young children are getting treatment that's appropriate for their age."  The researchers were surprised by the relatively low mortality rate among children ages 10 to 15, said study co-author Dr. Christopher M. Dye, head of the World Health Organization's Ebola epidemiology team in Geneva.  "That has not been seen before for Ebola, and we have been able to uncover this partly because this large epidemic has generated so much data," Dye told Live Science. "Put another way, usually we expect to see higher case fatalities from infections only in the very youngest and the very oldest, but the pattern here is different."  The new study was published today (March 25) in the New England Journal of Medicine.   Follow Agata Blaszczak-Boxe on Twitter . Follow Live Science @livescience , Facebook  & Google+ .

Sia Kamano talks to medical workers as she leaves the airlock of an Ebola treatment facility set up by Doctors Without Borders in Guinea. The doctor and nurse informed her that her lab results are negative and she can now return home after surviving the Ebola outbreak. No specific treatment or vaccine is yet available for Ebola.   Sylvain Cherkaoui/Cosmos via Doctors Without Borders        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     As the Ebola virus continues to ravage West Africa, one thing has become all too clear: this highly contagious virus has an incredibly poor prognosis. This outbreak is the largest ever recorded . At least 319 have been killed in Guinea, 224 in Sierra Leone and 129 in Liberia. Anywhere from about 60 to 96 percent of people who contract Ebola will die from it. There are currently no effective drugs to fight the virus. But what exactly happens to those few patients fortunate enough to survive the disease's deadly clutches ? Any chance of surviving Ebola largely hinges upon early access to medical care when symptoms such as fever, headache, and joint and muscle pain first arise. By the time the disease progresses to hemorrhaging, it's almost always too late. Patients who receive supportive therapies early on to manage symptoms and complications have a better chance of living through it, although survival is still far from certain. Early interventions may include intravenous fluids and electrolytes for dehydration, maintaining blood pressure, transfusions to replace blood lost due to hemorrhaging, as well as treating any subsequent infections that result from the virus. Most Ebola patients actually die from low blood pressure and shock rather than blood loss.     26  Photos   Ebola outbreak  Officials try to contain the largest-ever Ebola outbreak that has spread across West Africa since March and infected thousands   Medical experts say most people who manage to recover from an acute Ebola infection will likely be able to return to their life and resume normal activities. But unfortunately, Ebola survivors do often develop certain chronic inflammatory conditions that affect the joints and eyes, problems that can follow a survivor through the remainder of their life. Dr. Amar Safdar, associate professor of infectious diseases and immunology at NYU Langone Medical Center, told CBS News these chronic conditions are a result of the body's immune response. He said Ebola survivors are at risk for arthralgia, a type of joint and bone pain that can feel similar to arthritis. Ebola survivors also frequently report complications with eyes and vision, an inflammatory condition known as uveitis which can cause excess tearing, eye sensitivity, eye inflammation and even blindness. "No one knows exactly why," Safdar told CBS News. "Certain infections or certain viruses have been known to cause uveitis. It is treated with giving steroids and primarily something that will dilate the pupil." It's not completely known how long a person can continue to shed the virus once the acute infection has subsided. It's likely that the recovery from Ebola varies as much as the incubation period of the virus, which can last anywhere between 2 to 21 days. According to the World Health Organization, a  lab worker who contracted Ebola on the job was found to have traces of the virus in his semen 61 days after the initial infection. Though it has not been documented, this could theoretically mean a man could infect his partner during sexual intercourse weeks after he seemed to get over the disease. Researchers are still trying to understand what factors help some patients survive Ebola when so many others do not. Sadfar and others speculate that genetics may be linked to Ebola survival. "There's something about the host population, not the virus itself," said Sadfar. "Which is why in certain demographic regions it's devastating."   © 2014 CBS Interactive Inc.

Both viruses are native to Africa, where sporadic outbreaks have occurred for decades.  Ebola virus and Marburg virus live in animal hosts, and humans can contract the viruses from infected animals. After the initial transmission, the viruses can spread from person to person through contact with body fluids or contaminated needles.  No drug has been approved to treat either virus. People diagnosed with Ebola or Marburg virus receive supportive care and treatment for complications. Scientists are coming closer to developing vaccines for these deadly diseases.      Symptoms Signs and symptoms typically begin abruptly within five to 10 days of infection with Ebola or Marburg virus. Early signs and symptoms include:   Fever  Severe headache  Joint and muscle aches  Chills  Weakness   Over time, symptoms become increasingly severe and may include:   Nausea and vomiting  Diarrhea (may be bloody)  Red eyes  Raised rash  Chest pain and cough  Sore throat  Stomach pain  Severe weight loss  Bruising  Bleeding, usually from the eyes, and when close to death, possible bleeding from the ears, nose and rectum  Internal bleeding   Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Ebola virus has been found in African monkeys, chimps and other nonhuman primates. A milder strain of Ebola has been discovered in monkeys and pigs in the Philippines.  Marburg virus has been found in monkeys, chimps and fruit bats in Africa.  Transmission from animals to humans  Experts suspect that both viruses are transmitted to humans through an infected animal's bodily fluids. Examples include:   Blood. Butchering or eating infected animals can spread the viruses. Scientists who have operated on infected animals as part of their research have also contracted the virus.  Waste products. Tourists in certain African caves and some underground mine workers have been infected with the Marburg virus, possibly through contact with the feces or urine of infected bats.   Transmission from person to person  Infected people typically don't become contagious until they develop symptoms. Family members are often infected as they care for sick relatives or prepare the dead for burial.  Medical personnel can be infected if they don't use protective gear, such as surgical masks and gloves.  There's no evidence that Ebola virus or Marburg virus can be spread via insect bites.  Risk factors For most people, the risk of getting Ebola hemorrhagic fever or Marburg hemorrhagic fever is low. The risk increases if you:   Travel to Africa. You're at increased risk if you visit or work in areas where Ebola virus or Marburg virus outbreaks have occurred.  Conduct animal research. People are more likely to contract the Ebola or Marburg virus if they conduct animal research with monkeys imported from Africa or the Philippines.  Provide medical or personal care. Family members are often infected as they care for sick relatives. Medical personnel also can be infected if they don't use protective gear, such as surgical masks and gloves.  Prepare people for burial. The bodies of people who have died of Ebola or Marburg hemorrhagic fever are still contagious. Helping prepare these bodies for burial can increase your risk of developing the disease.   Complications Both Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers lead to death for a high percentage of people who are affected. As the illness progresses, it can cause:   Multiple organ failure  Severe bleeding  Jaundice  Delirium  Seizures  Coma  Shock   One reason the viruses are so deadly is that they interfere with the immune system's ability to mount a defense. But scientists don't understand why some people recover from Ebola and Marburg and others don't.  For people who survive, recovery is slow. It may take months to regain weight and strength, and the viruses remain in the body for weeks. People may experience:   Hair loss  Sensory changes  Liver inflammation (hepatitis)  Weakness  Fatigue  Headaches  Eye inflammation  Testicular inflammation   Prevention Prevention focuses on avoiding contact with the viruses. The following precautions can help prevent infection and spread of Ebola and Marburg.   Avoid areas of known outbreaks. Before traveling to Africa, find out about current epidemics by checking the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.  Wash your hands frequently. As with other infectious diseases, one of the most important preventive measures is frequent hand-washing. Use soap and water, or use alcohol-based hand rubs containing at least 60 percent alcohol when soap and water aren't available.  Avoid bush meat. In developing countries, avoid buying or eating the wild animals, including nonhuman primates, sold in local markets.  Avoid contact with infected people. In particular, caregivers should avoid contact with an infected person's body fluids and tissues, including blood, semen, vaginal secretions and saliva. People with Ebola or Marburg are most contagious in the later stages of the disease.  Follow infection-control procedures. If you're a health care worker, wear protective clothing, such as gloves, masks, gowns and eye shields. Keep infected people isolated from others. Dispose of needles and sterilize other instruments.  Don't handle remains. The bodies of people who have died of Ebola or Marburg disease are still contagious. Specially organized and trained teams should bury the remains, using appropriate safety equipment.   Vaccine development  Scientists are working on a variety of vaccines that would protect people from Ebola and Marburg viruses. Some of the results have been promising, but further testing is needed.

In fact, the epidemic killed five times more than all other known Ebola outbreaks combined. More than 21 months on from the first confirmed case recorded on 23 March 2014, 11,315 people have been reported as having died from the disease in six countries; Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, the US and Mali. The total number of reported cases is about 28,637. But on 13 January, 2016, the World Health Organisation declared the last of the countries affected, Liberia, to be Ebola-free.            Ebola deaths  Figures up to 13 January 2016     11,315  Deaths - probable, confirmed and suspected     (Includes one in the US and six in Mali)      4,809 Liberia    3,955 Sierra Leone    2,536 Guinea    8 Nigeria    Source: WHO   Getty      The World Health Organization (WHO) admits the figures are underestimates, given the difficulty collecting the data. There needs to be 42 days without any new cases for a country to be declared Ebola-free. The outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal were declared officially over by the WHO in October 2014. Sierra Leone and Guinea both had much larger outbreaks and it took a little longer. Sierra Leone was declared Ebola-free on 7 November 2015, Guinea followed in December. Liberia has been the worst-hit, with more than 4,800 dead and 10,672 becoming infected. The WHO said that at the peak of transmission, during August and September 2014, Liberia was reporting between 300 and 400 new cases every week. The epidemic seemed to abate and the outbreak in Liberia was declared over on 9 May 2015 - only to re-emerge seven weeks later when a 17-year-old man died from the disease and more cases were reported. The same happened in September,  which is why the latest declaration of Liberia being Ebola-free, while welcome, should be treated with caution, say correspondents. The WHO has warned that West Africa may see flare-ups of the virus.     How the virus spread Researchers from the New England Journal of Medicine traced the outbreak to a two-year-old toddler , who died in December 2013 in Meliandou, a small village in south-eastern Guinea. In March, hospital staff alerted Guinea's Ministry of Health and then medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).  They reported a mysterious disease in the south-eastern regions of Gueckedou, Macenta, Nzerekore, and Kissidougou. It caused fever, diarrhoea and vomiting. It also had a high death rate. Of the first 86 cases, 59 people died. The WHO later confirmed the disease as Ebola.

Ebola diary Tracing the outbreak Full special report Disease spreads The Gueckedou prefecture in Guinea, where the outbreak started, is a major regional trading centre and, by the end of March, Ebola had crossed the border into Liberia. It was confirmed in Sierra Leone in May. In June, MSF described the Ebola outbreak as out of control . Nigeria had its first case of the disease in July and, in the same month, two leading doctors died from Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone . In August, the United Nations health agency declared an "international public health emergency", saying that a co-ordinated response was essential to halt the spread of the virus. Senegal reported its first case of Ebola on 29 August. A young man from Guinea had travelled to Senegal despite having been infected with the virus, officials said. By September, WHO director general Margaret Chan said the number of patients was "moving far faster than the capacity to manage them". Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US, Thomas Frieden, said in October that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was unlike anything since the emergence of HIV/Aids. But Senegal managed to halt transmissions by mid October. Authorities in Mali confirmed the death of the country's first Ebola patient, a two-year-old girl, on 25 October. The girl had travelled hundreds of kilometres by bus from Guinea through Mali showing symptoms of the disease, the WHO said. An infected Islamic preacher from Guinea, who was initially diagnosed with a kidney problem, was treated at a clinic in Bamako. The preacher died a few days after entering the country. Two health workers who cared for the preacher also died after contracting the virus. In total, Mali recorded six deaths from Ebola.  By January 2015 however, the country was declared ebola-free. Ebola outside West Africa     *In all but three cases the patient was infected with Ebola while in West Africa. Infection outside Africa has been restricted to health workers in Madrid and in Dallas. DR Congo also reported a separate outbreak of an unrelated strain of Ebola. The first case of the deadly virus diagnosed on US soil was announced on 1 October . Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, who contracted the virus in Liberia before travelling to the US, died on 8 October. He had not displayed symptoms of the disease until 24 September, five days after his arrival. Other people with whom he came into contact are being monitored for symptoms. Two medical workers in Dallas, Texas, who treated Duncan tested positive for Ebola since his death but have both recovered.  The second death on US soil was  surgeon Martin Salia, from Sierra Leone. He was flown back to the United States in November and treated for Ebola at a hospital in Nebraska. But Dr Salia, who had US residency and was married to an American, died a short time later. Spanish nurse Teresa Romero was the first person to contract the virus outside West Africa. She was part of a team of about 30 staff at the Carlos II hospital in Madrid looking after two missionaries who returned from Liberia and Sierra Leone after becoming infected. Germany, Norway, France, Italy, Switzerland and the UK have all treated patients who contracted the virus in West Africa. 2014 outbreak in context Ebola was first identified in 1976 and occurs in regions of sub-Saharan Africa. There are normally fewer than 500 cases reported each year, and no cases were reported at all between 1979 and 1994. In August 2014, the WHO confirmed a separate outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo. By the beginning of October there had been 70 cases reported and 43 deaths. However, the outbreak in DR Congo was a different strain of the virus and unrelated to the epidemic in West Africa, which now dwarfs all previous outbreaks.

medicine (e.g., antiviral drug) is available for Ebola.  Symptoms of Ebola and complications are treated as they appear. The following basic interventions, when used early, can significantly improve the chances of survival:   Providing intravenous fluids (IV) and balancing electrolytes (body salts).  Maintaining oxygen status and blood pressure.  Treating other infections if they occur.   Experimental vaccines and treatments for Ebola are under development, but they have not yet been fully tested for safety or effectiveness.  Recovery from Ebola depends on good supportive care and the patient’s immune response. People who recover from Ebola infection develop antibodies that last for at least 10 years, possibly longer. It is not known if people who recover are immune for life or if they can become infected with a different species of Ebola. Some people who have recovered from Ebola have developed long-term complications, such as joint and vision problems.  Even after recovery, Ebola might be found in some body fluids, including semen. The time it takes for Ebola to leave the semen is different for each man. For some men who survived Ebola, the virus left their semen in three months. For other men, the virus did not leave their semen for more than nine months. Based on the results from limited studies conducted to date, it appears that the amount of virus decreases over time and eventually leaves the semen.

Scientists are saying it. Heck, even many journalists are saying it: "The risk of Ebola infection remains vanishingly small in this country," The New York Times  wrote Wednesday.  But what does that mean? Are you more likely to be struck by lightning or catch Ebola?      Goats and Soda  Plane Of Good Samaritans: Why Fly To (And From) West Africa        It all depends on what you do for a living and where you travel. For instance, three of us from NPR are spending 10 days in Monrovia, Liberia, to report on the outbreak. What's our chance of catching the virus?  So far in the U.S., we've had too little data to calculate a real risk. But we can do some back-of-the-napkin math to give some perspective.  Up until now, two people have caught Ebola in the U.S. Both were nurses in Dallas, who cared for Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who was diagnosed with the virus.  Updated on Oct. 24 at 4:13 a.m. ET. Second Imported Case:  A doctor in New York City tested positive for Ebola Thursday . The Doctors Without Borders staff member — who has been identified as Dr. Craig Spencer — was treating patients in Guinea when he caught the virus. This is the fourth case reported in the U.S. and the second imported case. (Note: An earlier update said the doctor was the fifth case of Ebola in the U.S.)  Our Original Post Continues:  Ebola is spread through contact with sick people's fluids. So, clearly, nurses and doctors who treat patients have a higher risk than others.     But let's pretend for a minute that the probability of getting Ebola in the U.S. is the same across the whole population (aka, the risk is evenly distributed).  The U.S. encounter with Ebola is unlikely to stop in Dallas. Computational biologists predict air traffic will bring more sick people to the States as the epidemic continues in West Africa.  No one knows exactly how many cases this will be. But one team at Northeastern University finds there's about a 70 percent chance we'll get another imported case by the end of this month. Let's say that trend continues, and we get 12 more cases imported over the next year.  On average, each of these sick people will spread the virus to two more people (that's what has happened in West Africa). Then about 24 people in the U.S. will have caught Ebola.  By comparison, 33 people in the U.S. are struck and killed by lightning each year. So the chance of catching Ebola — even with 12 more imported cases like Duncan — is on par with the odds of getting killed by a lightning bolt (1 out of every 9.6 million people).  So we can all breathe a sigh of relief.  But what about us journalists covering the epidemic in Liberia? Or people who call Monrovia their home?  Here we can calculate a risk based on actual data. More than 2,000 people have caught the virus in Monrovia since the epidemic began.  Right now, Monrovia is reporting about 200 Ebola cases each week. The city has a population of about 1 million people. So that means 1 out of every 5,000 people gets infected with Ebola each week. That puts the risk of getting Ebola each week in Monrovia right about on par with the risk of dying during childbirth in the U.S. ( 1 out of 5,500 births ) or about two times the risk of dying in a traffic accident each year ( 1 in 9,100 people ).  Of course, the longer you stay in Monrovia, the more your risk goes up because you are continually in situations where you might be exposed to the virus.  For instance, a full year in Monrovia raises your chance of getting Ebola to around 1 percent — assuming the epidemic doesn't grow any faster than it is now.  I told my husband all these stats to help ease his worry. He has been very concerned about my 10-day trip to Liberia. His response? "That's fine, Michaeleen. I understand the risk. But there's just one number I can't get out of my head: the 70 percent fatality rate."     ebola  Liberia  United States  Risk       Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard  Email               Goats and Soda  STORIES OF LIFE IN A CHANGING WORLD          Goats and Soda  STORIES OF LIFE IN A CHANGING WORLD         About     We're all neighbors on our tiny globe.

To date, about 6,000 people have died . And while the disease has been brought under control in many areas, the World Health Organization acknowledges that there are places where it is still outpacing the international response . If you are wondering about the risk of a global pandemic with scenes reminiscent of movies like “Outbreak” and “28 days later,” here are two things to keep in mind.  RELATED: Few preparations in event of Ebola in US  First, while Ebola is an extremely virulent disease, its impact pales in comparison to other global killers like measles, AIDS, or even the flu.   Advertisement     Second, the likelihood of Ebola spreading across the US is vanishingly small. It isn’t a particularly contagious disease, and in a developed country with strong health infrastructure, it probably wouldn’t spread much at all.  What is Ebola?

Sign up for more newsletters here    Ebola is a virus, like the flu or the common cold. In fact, the official name is Ebola Virus Disease. It was first identified in the 1970s, and since that time, there have been dozens of Ebola outbreaks, most of them in Central and East Africa.  RELATED: Infected aid workers given experimental Ebola drug     Related Links   Few preparations in event of Ebola in US    The early symptoms of Ebola are flu-like, including fever, weakness and muscle pain. Quickly, though, this progresses to vomiting, diarrhea, organ failure, and spontaneous bleeding (internal and external).  Do most people die?  In the current outbreak, well over half of all infected people have died. Previous outbreaks have seen death tolls as high as 90 percent and as low as 25 percent. Ebola comes in different strains (think of swine flu and bird flu), and these have different mortality rates. The type currently spreading through Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and now Nigeria is the Zaire strain , which is not just the deadliest form of Ebola but one of the deadliest diseases on earth.             How do you get it?    Advertisement     Ebola isn’t that contagious. Unlike the flu, for instance, it doesn’t travel through the air. You can only get it from direct contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of infected people. One reason it has been spreading through West Africa is that in some communities, it is common for mourners to touch the bodies of deceased loved ones before burial, and people who’ve succumbed to Ebola are still contagious after death. Health workers, too, face increased risk, because caring for Ebola patients requires close contact. This is likely how the two infected US doctors contracted the disease. Generally speaking, though, Ebola doesn’t spread easily. People who study disease transmission tend to look at two major variables when predicting how far diseases will travel. • Generation time . This is a measure of how long it takes for one person to infect another. If you’re sick and you pass your germs on to someone else, will they get sick the next day? A week later? A month? With flu, the generation time is very short, just 2-4 days, which is one reason flu can spread so quickly through a group of people. Ebola has a much longer generation time, upwards of 2 weeks. That slows down transmission.  RELATED: Vaccines not available for Ebola, but some being developed  • Reproductive number . If you’re sick and you nonetheless decide to go about your everyday routine how many people are you likely to infect? That’s what the “reproductive number” measures. When you walk around with the flu, you’re likely to infect two people. If you have measles, it’s seven or more. With Ebola, it’s roughly 1.5 to 2.   Advertisement     Putting these together, you see that Ebola scores relatively low on both these measures of infectiousness, meaning there isn’t a clear mechanism for rapid spread. Flu, for instance, may have a low reproductive number but its speedy generation time still gives it a means to move quickly through a population. And while Smallpox had a generation time quite similar to Ebola, it  jumped much more readily from person to person.       Reproductive number Generation time (days)  Ebola 1.5-2 14-21  Flu 1.5-2 2-4  Dengue 1.3-6.3 19-24  SARS 1.2-3.6 8.4  Rubella 2.9-7.8 15-23  Smallpox 3.2-6.9 14-20  Cholera 4-15 7-10  Measles 7.1-29.3 9-17   Source: Infectious Disease Epidemiology: Theory and Practice. Also, Dr. Donald Burke and Dr. Justin Lessler .    Are there any treatments?  At this point, there’s very little doctors can do for Ebola victims, beyond keeping them hydrated.  There are some experimental treatments at different stages of review, including a vaccine and some medications , but nothing proven or approved. One reason there are currently no treatments is that, horrific as the disease may be, it mainly affects poor people in poor communities. That makes it harder for drug companies to earn money from potential products, and thus reduces their incentive to spend money on research. Of course, money isn’t the only incentive, and there are other ways to encourage drug research, including medical prizes, but for now finding a working treatment remains an open challenge.  On a scale of one to 10, how worried should I be?  If you live in the US your worry-level should be quite low. Ebola doesn’t have the disease profile to spread in a place with reasonable medical resources. If you find yourself in West Africa, you have more cause for concern. Developing nations lack the public health resources needed to properly quarantine people, provide health workers with protective gear, and educate the population about risks and best practices. The deadliness of this Ebola outbreak has as much to do with the social and political structures in West Africa as with the structure of the virus itself.  RELATED: FDA to regulate tests for Lyme disease, other illnesses  And yet even if you do live in a country where poor public health infrastructure makes you more vulnerable to Ebola, there are other diseases you should be much more worried about. UNICEF estimates that 9.7 million children under 5 die each year of preventable diseases. That’s 25,000 every day, compared to the 6,000 who have died from this Ebola outbreak--the worst outbreak ever. Across the globe, a bad flu season can kill over 250,000 people. Measles and cholera both kill over 100,000. Diarrheal diseases kill 1.5 million. In terms of global killers, Ebola just isn’t in the same class.            Still, while there are other, more infectious illnesses, Ebola remains a deadly disease that’s killing thousands of people and wreaking havoc across West Africa. That’s the broader context for the current crisis. It may not be the beginning of a global pandemic, but without better treatment and more support for public health services this flare-up could continue, and future outbreaks will remain largely unavoidable.

If you live in the United States, it almost certainly won't be Ebola. Although a Sierra Leone doctor in Nebraska and a Liberian visitor in Dallas have died of the disease, the odds favor death by almost every other alternative. A 2014 National Safety Council report uses mortality data and U.S. population statistics from 2010 to synthesize the likelihood of dying by various methods. Most likely, something far less exotic will get you.  Note: All death odds were calculated using 2010 population data.

Credit: Daniel Martin | CDC     Young children who are infected with Ebola may be more likely to die from the virus than older children or adults who are infected, according to a new study.  In the study, researchers examined Ebola cases in children younger than 16 during the current outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and compared them with adult cases. They found that the outbreak's death rate has been higher among younger children than among older children and adults.  The disease has killed about 90 percent of infected children under age 1, and about 80 percent of kids ages 1 to 4 who have been infected. Older children who have been infected with Ebola may have a much better chance of surviving , as the death rate has been lower — 52 percent — for children ages 10 to 15. Among children older than 15 and adults, the mortality rate was 65 percent.  "The very youngest of children — neonates  —appear to have the worst outcomes from Ebola," study co-author Dr. Robert Fowler, an associate professor of critical-care medicine at the University of Toronto, said in a statement. (Neonates, or newborns, are babies younger than 1 month.)  There are a number of factors that may explain the high Ebola mortality rate in newborns, Fowler said. For instance, the youngest children are often heavily dependent on others to care for them, and their caregivers may have also been sick with Ebola. Younger kids may also be particularly prone to dehydration and metabolic abnormalities that result from vomiting and diarrhea, which are common symptoms of the disease.  To prevent dehydration, children need to receive a sufficient amount of fluids , which are usually administered intravenously when the children can no longer keep fluids down because they have been vomiting, Fowler said.  However, getting those fluids into the body by "placing intravenous catheters in young children can be challenging," he said. [ Where Did Ebola Come From? ]  The study shows that Ebola affects young children differently from adults, study co-author Christl Donnelly, a professor at Imperial College London, said in a statement.  Therefore, "it's especially important that we get them [children] into treatment quickly," she said. "We also need to look at whether young children are getting treatment that's appropriate for their age."  The researchers were surprised by the relatively low mortality rate among children ages 10 to 15, said study co-author Dr. Christopher M. Dye, head of the World Health Organization's Ebola epidemiology team in Geneva.  "That has not been seen before for Ebola, and we have been able to uncover this partly because this large epidemic has generated so much data," Dye told Live Science. "Put another way, usually we expect to see higher case fatalities from infections only in the very youngest and the very oldest, but the pattern here is different."  The new study was published today (March 25) in the New England Journal of Medicine.   Follow Agata Blaszczak-Boxe on Twitter . Follow Live Science @livescience , Facebook  & Google+ .

What is Ebola virus disease?   Ebola virus disease (formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever) is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90% caused by Ebola virus, a member of the filovirus family.   The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 when 2 simultaneous outbreaks occurred, 1 in Yambuku, a village not far from the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the other in a remote area of Sudan.   The origin of the virus is unknown, but current evidence suggests that fruit bats ( Pteropodidae ) may be a  host.  2. How do people become infected with the Ebola virus?   People become infected with Ebola either through contact with infected animals (usually following butchering, cooking or eating) or through contact with the bodily fluids of infected humans. Most cases are caused by human to human transmission which occurs when blood or other bodily fluids or secretions (stool, urine, saliva, semen) of infected people enters a healthy person’s body through broken skin or mucous membranes.   Infection can also occur if the broken skin or the mucous membranes of a healthy person comes into contact with items or environments contaminated with bodily fluids from an infected person. These may include soiled clothing, bed linen, gloves, protective equipment and medical waste such as used hypodermic syringes.  3. Who is most at risk?   During an outbreak, those at higher risk of infection are:   health workers;  family members or others in close contact with infected people;  mourners who have direct contact with bodies during burial rituals.   4. Why are mourners at burial ceremonies considered at risk of contracting Ebola?   Levels of Ebola virus remain high after death, thus bodies of those who have died from Ebola virus disease must be handled only by people wearing appropriate personal protective equipment and must be buried immediately. WHO advises that bodies of people who may have died from Ebola virus disease should be handled only by trained burial teams, who are equipped to properly bury the dead, safely and with dignity.    How to conduct safe and dignified burial of a patient who has died from suspected or confirmed Ebola virus disease    5. Why are health-care workers at greater risk of catching Ebola?   Health-care workers are at greater risk of infection if they are not wearing correct personal protective equipment (PPE) or are not applying infection prevention and control (IPC) measures when caring for patients. All health-care providers working at all levels of the health system – hospitals, clinics and health posts – should be fully informed about the disease and its mode of transmission and should follow recommended precautions strictly.

Sexual transmission of the Ebola virus, from males to females, is a strong possibility, but has not yet been proven. Less probable, but theoretically possible, is female to male transmission. More surveillance data and research are needed on the risks of sexual transmission, and particularly on the prevalence of viable and transmissible virus in semen over time. In the interim, and based on present evidence, WHO recommends that:   All Ebola survivors and their sexual partners should receive counselling to ensure safe sexual practices until their semen has twice tested negative. Survivors should be provided with condoms.  Male Ebola survivors should be offered semen testing at 3 months after onset of disease, and then, for those who test positive, every month thereafter until their semen tests negative for virus twice by RT-PCR, with an interval of one week between tests.  Ebola survivors and their sexual partners should either:   abstain from all types of sex, or  observe safe sex through correct and consistent condom use until their semen has twice tested negative.   Having tested negative, survivors can safely resume normal sexual practices without fear of Ebola virus transmission.  Based on further analysis of ongoing research and consideration by the WHO Advisory Group on the Ebola Virus Disease Response, WHO recommends that male survivors of Ebola virus disease practice safe sex and hygiene for 12 months from onset of symptoms or until their semen tests negative twice for Ebola virus.  Until such time as their semen has twice tested negative for Ebola, survivors should practise good hand and personal hygiene by immediately and thoroughly washing with soap and water after any physical contact with semen, including after masturbation. During this period used condoms should be handled safely, and safely disposed of, so as to prevent contact with seminal fluids.  All survivors, their partners and families should be shown respect, dignity and compassion.     Clinical care for survivors of Ebola virus disease    7. What are the typical signs and symptoms of Ebola virus infection?   Ebola symptoms vary but sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat are commonly experienced at the beginning of the disease (‘the dry phase’). As the disease progresses, people commonly develop vomiting and diarrhoea (‘the wet phase’), rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.  8. How long does it take for people to develop symptoms after being infected?   The incubation period, or the time interval from infection to onset of symptoms, is from 2 to 21 days. People are not contagious until they develop symptoms. Ebola virus disease infections can only be confirmed through laboratory testing.  9. When should someone seek medical care?   A person with Ebola-like symptoms (fever, headache, muscle aches, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea) who has been in contact with living or dead people suspected to have had Ebola or has travelled to an area known to have cases of Ebola virus disease should seek medical care immediately.  10. Is there any treatment for Ebola?   Supportive care, especially fluid replacement therapy, carefully managed and monitored by trained health workers improves chances of survival. Other treatments being used to help people survive Ebola virus disease include, where available, kidney dialysis, blood transfusions, plasma replacement therapy.   An experimental Ebola vaccine proved highly protective against Ebola virus in a major trial in Guinea.  The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11 841 people during 2015.  11. Can people with Ebola be cared for at home?   WHO does not advise families or communities to care for individuals with symptoms of Ebola virus disease at home. People with such symptoms should seek treatment in a hospital or treatment centre staffed by doctors and nurses equipped to treat Ebola virus disease.   If a person dies at home and is suspected of having died from Ebola virus disease, family and community members should refrain from handling or preparing the body for burial. The local health authorities should be contacted immediately and asked to send  a dead body management team.  12. Can Ebola be prevented?   People can protect themselves from infection with Ebola virus following specific infection prevention and control measures. These include hand washing, avoiding contact with the bodily fluids of individuals who are suspected of or confirmed to have Ebola, and refraining from handling or preparing bodies of persons who are suspected of or confirmed to have died from Ebola.  13. Is there an Ebola vaccine?   An experimental Ebola vaccine proved highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea.  The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11 841 people during 2015. Among the 5837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine.   The trial was led by WHO, together with Guinea’s Ministry of Health, Médecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with other international partners. A ring vaccination protocol was chosen for the trial, where some of the rings are vaccinated shortly after a case is detected, and other rings are vaccinated after a delay of 3 weeks.

Critics call the government’s response to Ebola “shambolic” as a national exercise to test Britain’s readiness for an outbreak takes place. But what danger does the killer virus pose to Britain?                 What is Ebola?  Ebola virus disease, or EVD, was first identified in 1976 near the Ebola river in Congo. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded more than 20 outbreaks since then, all beginning in Africa.  Scientists think Ebola was first introduced to humans by people living in remote jungle areas handling infected wild animals like fruit bats, apes and monkeys.  The disease is a haemorrhagic fever, causing internal and external bleeding along with a wide range of other symptoms that progress rapidly.  Although the deadliest strain has been known to kill up to 90 per cent of infected patients, the WHO says the average fatality rate is around 50 per cent.  There is no known cure or vaccine.  How bad is this outbreak?  According to the latest WHO figures , there have been 8,033 confirmed cases and 3,865 deaths in 40 weeks, making this by far the deadliest outbreak of Ebola in history.  Liberia is the worst-affected country, with 2,210 deaths, followed by Sierra Leone (879 fatalities) and Guinea (768 deaths).   The WHO says the situation in the three west African countries at the centre of the outbreak “continues to deteriorate, with widespread and persistent transmission of EVD”.  Nigeria has seen eight deaths but the authorities there have been praised for effectively containing the spread of the disease.  The first confirmed case outside west Africa was Spanish nurse Teresa Romero , who is currently being treated in an isolation unit at a Madrid hospital. A Liberian man, Thomas Duncan, died in Dallas, Texas, this week.  How many Britons have caught the disease?  Nurse Will Pooley remains the only Briton known to have contracted Ebola . He caught the disease while treating patients in Sierra Leone.   Mr Pooley was flown back to Britain by the RAF. He was treated at an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London, given the experimental drug ZMapp, and has made a full recovery .  There were reports that a British man who died in Skopje, Macedonia, had Ebola-like symptoms , but the authorities later said they did not believe his death was caused by the virus and a man travelling with him showed no signs of illness.  So will there be an outbreak here?  Experts say it is highly likely that someone infected with ebola will arrive in the UK at some point – but they say NHS staff are well-trained at isolating and containing diseases from abroad.  David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “I think it’s bound to happen. We have a lot of links with west Africa. There is lots of coming and going so I’m sure there will be a few cases.”  Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, said: “Whilst the risk of imported Ebola virus remains small, it’s still a very real risk.”  What plans are in place?  The Royal Free is home to the country’s only high-level isolation unit and is likely to feature heavily if Ebola arrives in Britain.  Other hospitals in Liverpool, Sheffield and Newcastle with expertise in dealing with highly infectious diseases could take cases too.  Amid some confusion, the government has now said border staff at Heathrow, Gatwick and Eurostar rail terminals will carry out screening measures on passengers arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guineau.  Airlines cancelled direct flights from those countries some weeks ago but there are fears travellers carrying Ebola could transfer to the UK.  ‘No plans for entry screening’   Downing Street’s sudden announcement of screening measures at UK ports came after Public Health England said it had no plans to introduce entry screening.  The health body says it cannot give any details of the screening process, and officials at Gatwick and Eurostar said they had not been told how the measures would be carried out.  Downing Street said there would be checks on passengers’ recent travel history, people they have been in contact with, and their onward travel arrangements, as well as a possible health assessment conducted by trained medics.  Checks are already in place to stop passengers with symptoms boarding planes leaving the stricken west African countries.  ‘Blunt instrument’   Experts have questioned how useful the screening measures will be.  Professor George Griffin, chair of the government advisory committee on dangerous pathogens, told the BBC: “It is somewhat surprising after, I think, we were all led to believe that the decision was not to screen.”  He added: “Most of the scientific community feel that the instrument is very, very blunt.”  Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, welcomed the new checks but said: “There is a touch of the shambolic about the way this is being handled.”   Will I catch Ebola?  There seems little reason to panic. Most experts agree the risk of cases arriving in the UK is small and the threat of transmission is manageable.  The disease is not airborne so is very unlikely to spread through coughs and sneezes.  Ebola is mainly spread when a patient’s blood or other bodily fluids come into direct contact with the broken skin or mucous membrane of another person.  The main risk of transmission is through mourners handling dead bodies of victims or health workers coming into close contact with victims without wearing protective clothing.  The WHO says the illness is only infectious when a patient develops symptoms – typically a sudden fever followed by flu-like symptoms, then vomiting, diarrhoea and other serious complications. Symptoms can show up anywhere from two to 21 days after infection.  It can be difficult to distinguish Ebola from other infection diseases like malaria and meningitis and lab tests are needed to confirm a case.  I think I’ve got Ebola – what do I do?  Current advice from Public Health England states: “If you feel unwell with symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, sore throat or rash within 21 days of coming back from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone, you should stay at home and immediately, telephone 111 or 999 and explain that you have recently visited west Africa.  “These services will provide advice and arrange for you to be seen in a hospital if necessary so that the cause of your illness can be determined.  “There are other illnesses which are much more common than Ebola (such as flu, typhoid fever and malaria) that have similar symptoms in the early stages, so proper medical assessment is really important to ensure you get the right diagnosis and treatment.  “It is also really important that medical services are expecting your arrival and calling 111 or 999 will ensure that this happen.”  The official advices stresses that there is little chance of catching Ebola unless you have come into contact with the blood or bodily fluid of an infected person in the danger zone.

James Giahyue/Reuters/Landov         Tara Fowler  September 18, 2014 02:00 PM       As the Ebola virus continues to spread through West Africa, the possibility that the disease could reach the U.S. is growing.  Dr. Kent Brantly, one of the American survivors of Ebola , testified before Congress on Tuesday, stressing the importance of stopping the outbreak in its tracks.  “We can’t afford to wait months, or even weeks, to take action, to put people on the ground,” he said.  Also on Tuesday, President Obama declared a “major increase” in America’s response to the deadly outbreak in West Africa, CNN reports.  “Men and women and children are just sitting, waiting to die right now,” Obama said.  He added: “This is a daunting task, but here’s what gives us hope. The world knows how to fight this disease. It’s not a mystery.  “We know the science. We know how to prevent it from spreading. We know how to care for those who contract it. We know that if we take the proper steps, we can save lives. But we have to act fast.”  To date, the virus has killed at least 2,400 people, and cases are growing exponentially, with 5,000 people infected, according to the World Health Organization .  While the disease has not yet spread outside Africa, officials say it’s only a matter of time with an outbreak of this caliber.                        President Barack Obama speaks at the CDC  Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP      PEOPLE spoke to experts at the Center for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health to get their perspective on the threat of Ebola to Americans.  What are the chances the Ebola virus will reach the U.S.?  Researchers say the chance of seeing an imported case in the U.S. is as high as 18 percent by the end of September (it was less than 5 percent at the start of the month). Restricting air travel “generates only a three- to four-week delay in the international spreading,” according to a study published this month in PLOS Currents: Outbreaks .  How likely am I to contract Ebola?  Not very. Even if an imported case does make it to the U.S., it’s unlikely it will spread through the general population. Basically, the only way for an average American to contract the disease is to visit one of the afflicted countries in Africa.  “It’s healthcare providers caring for Ebola patients and the family and friends in close contact with Ebola patients that are at the highest risk of getting sick,” says Kristen Nordlund, health communications specialist at the CDC. “They may come in contact with the blood or body fluids of sick patients, which is how the disease is spread.”  “The chances of an average American who hasn’t visited Africa getting Ebola are so vanishingly small, it’s almost non-quantitative,” adds Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH’s Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  He illustrates a worst-case scenario: “A person could walk into an ER and not tell them he just got off a plane from West Africa, which would alert people to quarantine him. Let’s say they didn’t and a nurse and a doctor got infected. That small cluster would be contained almost immediately.”  I’m flying to Africa next week. Are there any travel restrictions in place?  The CDC currently recommends that travelers avoid going to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone unless such travel is absolutely essential. There is also an alert in place for Nigeria urging travelers to “take enhanced precautions,” says Nordlund.  And what are “enhanced precautions”? The CDC recommends avoiding wild animals or raw or undercooked meat; avoiding the body fluids of people who have contracted the illness; and avoiding any burial rites that involve handling the body of someone who died from Ebola.  What is the best way to prevent myself from getting Ebola?  In addition to following the precautions mentioned above, you should make sure to practice good hygiene by washing your hands with soap and water and using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  Adds Nordlund: “Seek medical care immediately if you develop fever, headache, muscle pain, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain or unexplained bruising or bleeding. Limit your contact with other people when you go to the doctor. Do not travel anywhere else.”  Is there a treatment for Ebola?  There is a small human trial for a vaccine being carried out at the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, right now. Ten volunteers have been given a dose of an experimental vaccine and “thus far there have been no red flags,” said Fauci .  This is merely Phase I of the trial, which tests to see that the vaccine is safe and that it works in humans. The first phase should be completed by November or December, at which point the vaccine will go into wider human trials.  While the vaccine looked promising in animals, Fauci cautions that doesn’t mean it will be a viable treatment in humans. “We have many, many vaccines that look good in an animal model, and then when they get to a human, they just don’t work,” he says. “At this stage of development, it’s impossible to say how promising it’s going to be. Right now it looks like it’s safe. That doesn’t mean it’s going to work.”  One Man’s Ebola Diary            Want more stories like this?

in several African countries. Ebola was first discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, outbreaks of Ebola among humans have appeared sporadically in Africa.  Risk  Healthcare providers caring for Ebola patients and family and friends in close contact with Ebola patients are at the highest risk of getting sick because they may come in contact with infected blood or body fluids. Ebola also can be spread through direct contact with objects (like clothes, bedding, needles, syringes/sharps or medical equipment) that have been contaminated with infected body fluids. Additionally, people can become sick with Ebola after coming in contact with infected wildlife. For example, in Africa, Ebola may spread as a result of handling bushmeat (wild animals hunted for food) and contact with infected bats.  It is also possible that Ebola could be spread through sex or other contact with semen from men who have survived Ebola. Until more information is known, avoid contact with semen from a man who has had Ebola. It is not known if Ebola can be spread through sex or other contact with vaginal fluids from a woman who has had Ebola.  CDC and other public health partners are continuing to study Ebola transmission and will share what is known as it becomes available.

Odds of Catching Ebola on the Subway and Other Handy Facts   By ABC NEWS  Oct 24, 2014, 11:17 AM ET   0 Shares               Email      Star     Play Andrew A. Smith/Getty Images WATCH NYC Officials Try to Calm Public Fears After Ebola Diagnosis  0 Shares               Email      Ebola continues to dominate the news with the latest diagnosis of a patient in New York City, leaving many Americans on edge, especially New Yorkers, who awoke this morning to learn that the patient had take three subway lines before he was diagnosed. So, what are the odds of catching Ebola on the subway? Here are a few Ebola facts to calm your nerves. "There are fundamental things we do know about Ebola and it's those things that can make most people in America rest very well at night that they don't have a risk of contracting this disease,” said ABC News chief health and medical editor Dr. Richard Besser during a recent ABC News Ebola town hall event.  Ebola World View: Who Has It and Where     Ebola in America: Timeline of the Deadly Virus     Number of U.S. Biocontainment Beds May Surprise You     What If I Stand Next to Someone With Ebola on a Subway?  You probably won't catch it in that situation, Dr. Jay Varma, New York City’s deputy commissioner for disease control, said during the town hall event. "Casual contact like you would have somebody pass you on the bus or on the subway, I’m not worried about it for myself and I’m not worried about it for my wife and kids," Varma said.  When Does Ebola Become Contagious?  Ebola is contagious when someone is symptomatic, Besser said. A fever is the first symptom of Ebola, which means the virus is beginning to multiply in the patient’s blood when a fever sets in. As an Ebola patient gets sicker and sicker, the amount of virus in his or her blood multiplies, making them even more contagious.  How Is Ebola Spread?  Ebola is spread through close contact with an infected person, and it’s not airborne, Besser said. “We also know from the studies in Africa that it’s a hard disease to get,” Besser said. “If this disease was spread through the air or was spread easily -- that you could get it from someone you’re standing next to in the market or sitting next to on a plane -- this outbreak would be far larger than it is today.” People who contract Ebola usually do so because they've cared for someone who was infected in a hospital setting or at home, Besser noted, or they've touched the body of a person who died of Ebola.  Can It Become Airborne?  “The majority of scientists say that while it’s possible, it’s highly unlikely,” Besser said, explaining that the virus would have to mutate significantly.  What If Someone With Ebola Sneezes on Me?  Sneezing is not a symptom of Ebola, Besser said. Neither is coughing until the very late stages of the disease, when the person is clearly sick and near death. On top of that, the disease is not airborne.  How Long Can the Virus Survive on Surfaces Like Tabletops and Doorknobs?  “This is one of these areas where we don’t really know enough,” Varma said. “We do know that these viruses can survive on surfaces for a few hours.” He said how long it can survive depends on the surface and the environment.  Should You Take Precautions Before Taking Public Transportation?  “We think this is not a disease that you can get from simply being next to somebody,” Varma said. “Absolutely if somebody vomits on you or you get their body fluids on it, of course you can be at risk, but we think that airplane travel, traveling on subways -- all of that -- is the type of contact where this is not a disease that's transmitted.” He said he’s more worried about getting the flu on public transportation than Ebola.  Can I Get Ebola From Someone’s Sweat?  There’s very little data on how much of the virus is in a sick person’s sweat, Besser said. He added that carrying a person who is sick with Ebola can be a “risky situation.” He said one man who had Ebola on a plane didn't spread it to fellow passengers but inadvertently gave it to the people who helped carry him once he got off the plane. “Touching the skin -- whether he had other body fluids or sweat on his skin at that point -- was a risk,” Besser said.  Can Ebola Be Spread Through the Water Supply?  Ebola is not a water-borne disease, according to researchers at the Water Research Foundation. Therefore, it cannot spread through the water supply. “Once in water, the host cell will take in water in an attempt to equalize the osmotic pressure, causing the cell to swell and burst, thus killing the virus,” the foundation noted in a statement. Bodily fluids flushed by an infected person would not contaminate the water supply, the statement went on to say, because the virus is so fragile. Once separated from its host it is neutralized within minutes.  Can Ebola Be Used as a Terrorist Weapon?  Ebola could theoretically be used by terrorists but it is unlikely, Varma said Studies suggest that Ebola could in theory be delivered in mist form by spraying it out of an aerosol can. However, since the virus is not known to take an airborne route, this would likely be ineffective. It is also possible that a terrorist willing to be infected with the virus could walk among the general population. However, since the virus has a long incubation period and is not highly contagious until the later stages of the disease, most experts say this would be impractical.  Can Ebola Be Spread by Mosquitoes?  Neither mosquitoes nor rats can spread Ebola, Besser said. "Not all viruses are adapted to survival and transmission through every vector," he noted. Only mammals such as humans, bats, monkeys and apes have shown the ability to spread and become infected with the Ebola virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other studies have shown that dogs and pigs can be infected with the virus but they don't show symptoms and there are no known cases of these animals passing the virus along to humans.  Is There a Vaccine Coming?  There are two vaccines being tested in clinical trials now, Besser said. “There’s a lot of efforts underway to try and move a vaccine forward but vaccine development takes a long time,” he said, adding that one of the companies working on one has said it won’t know whether it works until 2015. Even if it does work, it will take more time to manufacture.  What About Other Drugs?  Ebola patients in the United States are receiving experimental drugs, but it’s not yet clear whether they've helped, hurt or made no difference in those patients’ outcomes, Besser said.  Why Don't We Just Close Our Borders to West Africa?  Keeping people from leaving the Ebola-affected countries would be a "major mistake," Besser said, noting that he saw aid workers, journalists and family members aboard his plane on his two trips to Liberia in the last few months, and that letting them in and out is important. "You want to make sure that people who leave that area are being monitored and doing it safely," he said. "You want to encourage people to go there who have expertise and can help these governments, these health workers, control this disease. That will save lives there and will also improve the health and protection of Americans right here." Varma said the biggest concern in America should be containing the outbreak in Africa. Until that happens, he said "we will always be at risk." "You can't just wrap a wall around these countries and not expect people to get out," he said.       0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

Credit: Daniel Martin | CDC     Young children who are infected with Ebola may be more likely to die from the virus than older children or adults who are infected, according to a new study.  In the study, researchers examined Ebola cases in children younger than 16 during the current outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and compared them with adult cases. They found that the outbreak's death rate has been higher among younger children than among older children and adults.  The disease has killed about 90 percent of infected children under age 1, and about 80 percent of kids ages 1 to 4 who have been infected. Older children who have been infected with Ebola may have a much better chance of surviving , as the death rate has been lower — 52 percent — for children ages 10 to 15. Among children older than 15 and adults, the mortality rate was 65 percent.  "The very youngest of children — neonates  —appear to have the worst outcomes from Ebola," study co-author Dr. Robert Fowler, an associate professor of critical-care medicine at the University of Toronto, said in a statement. (Neonates, or newborns, are babies younger than 1 month.)  There are a number of factors that may explain the high Ebola mortality rate in newborns, Fowler said. For instance, the youngest children are often heavily dependent on others to care for them, and their caregivers may have also been sick with Ebola. Younger kids may also be particularly prone to dehydration and metabolic abnormalities that result from vomiting and diarrhea, which are common symptoms of the disease.  To prevent dehydration, children need to receive a sufficient amount of fluids , which are usually administered intravenously when the children can no longer keep fluids down because they have been vomiting, Fowler said.  However, getting those fluids into the body by "placing intravenous catheters in young children can be challenging," he said. [ Where Did Ebola Come From? ]  The study shows that Ebola affects young children differently from adults, study co-author Christl Donnelly, a professor at Imperial College London, said in a statement.  Therefore, "it's especially important that we get them [children] into treatment quickly," she said. "We also need to look at whether young children are getting treatment that's appropriate for their age."  The researchers were surprised by the relatively low mortality rate among children ages 10 to 15, said study co-author Dr. Christopher M. Dye, head of the World Health Organization's Ebola epidemiology team in Geneva.  "That has not been seen before for Ebola, and we have been able to uncover this partly because this large epidemic has generated so much data," Dye told Live Science. "Put another way, usually we expect to see higher case fatalities from infections only in the very youngest and the very oldest, but the pattern here is different."  The new study was published today (March 25) in the New England Journal of Medicine.   Follow Agata Blaszczak-Boxe on Twitter . Follow Live Science @livescience , Facebook  & Google+ .

Sia Kamano talks to medical workers as she leaves the airlock of an Ebola treatment facility set up by Doctors Without Borders in Guinea. The doctor and nurse informed her that her lab results are negative and she can now return home after surviving the Ebola outbreak. No specific treatment or vaccine is yet available for Ebola.   Sylvain Cherkaoui/Cosmos via Doctors Without Borders        Share       Tweet      Reddit      Flipboard       Email     As the Ebola virus continues to ravage West Africa, one thing has become all too clear: this highly contagious virus has an incredibly poor prognosis. This outbreak is the largest ever recorded . At least 319 have been killed in Guinea, 224 in Sierra Leone and 129 in Liberia. Anywhere from about 60 to 96 percent of people who contract Ebola will die from it. There are currently no effective drugs to fight the virus. But what exactly happens to those few patients fortunate enough to survive the disease's deadly clutches ? Any chance of surviving Ebola largely hinges upon early access to medical care when symptoms such as fever, headache, and joint and muscle pain first arise. By the time the disease progresses to hemorrhaging, it's almost always too late. Patients who receive supportive therapies early on to manage symptoms and complications have a better chance of living through it, although survival is still far from certain. Early interventions may include intravenous fluids and electrolytes for dehydration, maintaining blood pressure, transfusions to replace blood lost due to hemorrhaging, as well as treating any subsequent infections that result from the virus. Most Ebola patients actually die from low blood pressure and shock rather than blood loss.     26  Photos   Ebola outbreak  Officials try to contain the largest-ever Ebola outbreak that has spread across West Africa since March and infected thousands   Medical experts say most people who manage to recover from an acute Ebola infection will likely be able to return to their life and resume normal activities. But unfortunately, Ebola survivors do often develop certain chronic inflammatory conditions that affect the joints and eyes, problems that can follow a survivor through the remainder of their life. Dr. Amar Safdar, associate professor of infectious diseases and immunology at NYU Langone Medical Center, told CBS News these chronic conditions are a result of the body's immune response. He said Ebola survivors are at risk for arthralgia, a type of joint and bone pain that can feel similar to arthritis. Ebola survivors also frequently report complications with eyes and vision, an inflammatory condition known as uveitis which can cause excess tearing, eye sensitivity, eye inflammation and even blindness. "No one knows exactly why," Safdar told CBS News. "Certain infections or certain viruses have been known to cause uveitis. It is treated with giving steroids and primarily something that will dilate the pupil." It's not completely known how long a person can continue to shed the virus once the acute infection has subsided. It's likely that the recovery from Ebola varies as much as the incubation period of the virus, which can last anywhere between 2 to 21 days. According to the World Health Organization, a  lab worker who contracted Ebola on the job was found to have traces of the virus in his semen 61 days after the initial infection. Though it has not been documented, this could theoretically mean a man could infect his partner during sexual intercourse weeks after he seemed to get over the disease. Researchers are still trying to understand what factors help some patients survive Ebola when so many others do not. Sadfar and others speculate that genetics may be linked to Ebola survival. "There's something about the host population, not the virus itself," said Sadfar. "Which is why in certain demographic regions it's devastating."   © 2014 CBS Interactive Inc.

Both viruses are native to Africa, where sporadic outbreaks have occurred for decades.  Ebola virus and Marburg virus live in animal hosts, and humans can contract the viruses from infected animals. After the initial transmission, the viruses can spread from person to person through contact with body fluids or contaminated needles.  No drug has been approved to treat either virus. People diagnosed with Ebola or Marburg virus receive supportive care and treatment for complications. Scientists are coming closer to developing vaccines for these deadly diseases.      Symptoms Signs and symptoms typically begin abruptly within five to 10 days of infection with Ebola or Marburg virus. Early signs and symptoms include:   Fever  Severe headache  Joint and muscle aches  Chills  Weakness   Over time, symptoms become increasingly severe and may include:   Nausea and vomiting  Diarrhea (may be bloody)  Red eyes  Raised rash  Chest pain and cough  Sore throat  Stomach pain  Severe weight loss  Bruising  Bleeding, usually from the eyes, and when close to death, possible bleeding from the ears, nose and rectum  Internal bleeding   Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic  Causes Ebola virus has been found in African monkeys, chimps and other nonhuman primates. A milder strain of Ebola has been discovered in monkeys and pigs in the Philippines.  Marburg virus has been found in monkeys, chimps and fruit bats in Africa.  Transmission from animals to humans  Experts suspect that both viruses are transmitted to humans through an infected animal's bodily fluids. Examples include:   Blood. Butchering or eating infected animals can spread the viruses. Scientists who have operated on infected animals as part of their research have also contracted the virus.  Waste products. Tourists in certain African caves and some underground mine workers have been infected with the Marburg virus, possibly through contact with the feces or urine of infected bats.   Transmission from person to person  Infected people typically don't become contagious until they develop symptoms. Family members are often infected as they care for sick relatives or prepare the dead for burial.  Medical personnel can be infected if they don't use protective gear, such as surgical masks and gloves.  There's no evidence that Ebola virus or Marburg virus can be spread via insect bites.  Risk factors For most people, the risk of getting Ebola hemorrhagic fever or Marburg hemorrhagic fever is low. The risk increases if you:   Travel to Africa. You're at increased risk if you visit or work in areas where Ebola virus or Marburg virus outbreaks have occurred.  Conduct animal research. People are more likely to contract the Ebola or Marburg virus if they conduct animal research with monkeys imported from Africa or the Philippines.  Provide medical or personal care. Family members are often infected as they care for sick relatives. Medical personnel also can be infected if they don't use protective gear, such as surgical masks and gloves.  Prepare people for burial. The bodies of people who have died of Ebola or Marburg hemorrhagic fever are still contagious. Helping prepare these bodies for burial can increase your risk of developing the disease.   Complications Both Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers lead to death for a high percentage of people who are affected. As the illness progresses, it can cause:   Multiple organ failure  Severe bleeding  Jaundice  Delirium  Seizures  Coma  Shock   One reason the viruses are so deadly is that they interfere with the immune system's ability to mount a defense. But scientists don't understand why some people recover from Ebola and Marburg and others don't.  For people who survive, recovery is slow. It may take months to regain weight and strength, and the viruses remain in the body for weeks. People may experience:   Hair loss  Sensory changes  Liver inflammation (hepatitis)  Weakness  Fatigue  Headaches  Eye inflammation  Testicular inflammation   Prevention Prevention focuses on avoiding contact with the viruses. The following precautions can help prevent infection and spread of Ebola and Marburg.   Avoid areas of known outbreaks. Before traveling to Africa, find out about current epidemics by checking the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.  Wash your hands frequently. As with other infectious diseases, one of the most important preventive measures is frequent hand-washing. Use soap and water, or use alcohol-based hand rubs containing at least 60 percent alcohol when soap and water aren't available.  Avoid bush meat. In developing countries, avoid buying or eating the wild animals, including nonhuman primates, sold in local markets.  Avoid contact with infected people. In particular, caregivers should avoid contact with an infected person's body fluids and tissues, including blood, semen, vaginal secretions and saliva. People with Ebola or Marburg are most contagious in the later stages of the disease.  Follow infection-control procedures. If you're a health care worker, wear protective clothing, such as gloves, masks, gowns and eye shields. Keep infected people isolated from others. Dispose of needles and sterilize other instruments.  Don't handle remains. The bodies of people who have died of Ebola or Marburg disease are still contagious. Specially organized and trained teams should bury the remains, using appropriate safety equipment.   Vaccine development  Scientists are working on a variety of vaccines that would protect people from Ebola and Marburg viruses. Some of the results have been promising, but further testing is needed.

In fact, the epidemic killed five times more than all other known Ebola outbreaks combined. More than 21 months on from the first confirmed case recorded on 23 March 2014, 11,315 people have been reported as having died from the disease in six countries; Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, the US and Mali. The total number of reported cases is about 28,637. But on 13 January, 2016, the World Health Organisation declared the last of the countries affected, Liberia, to be Ebola-free.            Ebola deaths  Figures up to 13 January 2016     11,315  Deaths - probable, confirmed and suspected     (Includes one in the US and six in Mali)      4,809 Liberia    3,955 Sierra Leone    2,536 Guinea    8 Nigeria    Source: WHO   Getty      The World Health Organization (WHO) admits the figures are underestimates, given the difficulty collecting the data. There needs to be 42 days without any new cases for a country to be declared Ebola-free. The outbreaks in Nigeria and Senegal were declared officially over by the WHO in October 2014. Sierra Leone and Guinea both had much larger outbreaks and it took a little longer. Sierra Leone was declared Ebola-free on 7 November 2015, Guinea followed in December. Liberia has been the worst-hit, with more than 4,800 dead and 10,672 becoming infected. The WHO said that at the peak of transmission, during August and September 2014, Liberia was reporting between 300 and 400 new cases every week. The epidemic seemed to abate and the outbreak in Liberia was declared over on 9 May 2015 - only to re-emerge seven weeks later when a 17-year-old man died from the disease and more cases were reported. The same happened in September,  which is why the latest declaration of Liberia being Ebola-free, while welcome, should be treated with caution, say correspondents. The WHO has warned that West Africa may see flare-ups of the virus.     How the virus spread Researchers from the New England Journal of Medicine traced the outbreak to a two-year-old toddler , who died in December 2013 in Meliandou, a small village in south-eastern Guinea. In March, hospital staff alerted Guinea's Ministry of Health and then medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).  They reported a mysterious disease in the south-eastern regions of Gueckedou, Macenta, Nzerekore, and Kissidougou. It caused fever, diarrhoea and vomiting. It also had a high death rate. Of the first 86 cases, 59 people died. The WHO later confirmed the disease as Ebola.

Ebola diary Tracing the outbreak Full special report Disease spreads The Gueckedou prefecture in Guinea, where the outbreak started, is a major regional trading centre and, by the end of March, Ebola had crossed the border into Liberia. It was confirmed in Sierra Leone in May. In June, MSF described the Ebola outbreak as out of control . Nigeria had its first case of the disease in July and, in the same month, two leading doctors died from Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone . In August, the United Nations health agency declared an "international public health emergency", saying that a co-ordinated response was essential to halt the spread of the virus. Senegal reported its first case of Ebola on 29 August. A young man from Guinea had travelled to Senegal despite having been infected with the virus, officials said. By September, WHO director general Margaret Chan said the number of patients was "moving far faster than the capacity to manage them". Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US, Thomas Frieden, said in October that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was unlike anything since the emergence of HIV/Aids. But Senegal managed to halt transmissions by mid October. Authorities in Mali confirmed the death of the country's first Ebola patient, a two-year-old girl, on 25 October. The girl had travelled hundreds of kilometres by bus from Guinea through Mali showing symptoms of the disease, the WHO said. An infected Islamic preacher from Guinea, who was initially diagnosed with a kidney problem, was treated at a clinic in Bamako. The preacher died a few days after entering the country. Two health workers who cared for the preacher also died after contracting the virus. In total, Mali recorded six deaths from Ebola.  By January 2015 however, the country was declared ebola-free. Ebola outside West Africa     *In all but three cases the patient was infected with Ebola while in West Africa. Infection outside Africa has been restricted to health workers in Madrid and in Dallas. DR Congo also reported a separate outbreak of an unrelated strain of Ebola. The first case of the deadly virus diagnosed on US soil was announced on 1 October . Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, who contracted the virus in Liberia before travelling to the US, died on 8 October. He had not displayed symptoms of the disease until 24 September, five days after his arrival. Other people with whom he came into contact are being monitored for symptoms. Two medical workers in Dallas, Texas, who treated Duncan tested positive for Ebola since his death but have both recovered.  The second death on US soil was  surgeon Martin Salia, from Sierra Leone. He was flown back to the United States in November and treated for Ebola at a hospital in Nebraska. But Dr Salia, who had US residency and was married to an American, died a short time later. Spanish nurse Teresa Romero was the first person to contract the virus outside West Africa. She was part of a team of about 30 staff at the Carlos II hospital in Madrid looking after two missionaries who returned from Liberia and Sierra Leone after becoming infected. Germany, Norway, France, Italy, Switzerland and the UK have all treated patients who contracted the virus in West Africa. 2014 outbreak in context Ebola was first identified in 1976 and occurs in regions of sub-Saharan Africa. There are normally fewer than 500 cases reported each year, and no cases were reported at all between 1979 and 1994. In August 2014, the WHO confirmed a separate outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo. By the beginning of October there had been 70 cases reported and 43 deaths. However, the outbreak in DR Congo was a different strain of the virus and unrelated to the epidemic in West Africa, which now dwarfs all previous outbreaks.

medicine (e.g., antiviral drug) is available for Ebola.  Symptoms of Ebola and complications are treated as they appear. The following basic interventions, when used early, can significantly improve the chances of survival:   Providing intravenous fluids (IV) and balancing electrolytes (body salts).  Maintaining oxygen status and blood pressure.  Treating other infections if they occur.   Experimental vaccines and treatments for Ebola are under development, but they have not yet been fully tested for safety or effectiveness.  Recovery from Ebola depends on good supportive care and the patient’s immune response. People who recover from Ebola infection develop antibodies that last for at least 10 years, possibly longer. It is not known if people who recover are immune for life or if they can become infected with a different species of Ebola. Some people who have recovered from Ebola have developed long-term complications, such as joint and vision problems.  Even after recovery, Ebola might be found in some body fluids, including semen. The time it takes for Ebola to leave the semen is different for each man. For some men who survived Ebola, the virus left their semen in three months. For other men, the virus did not leave their semen for more than nine months. Based on the results from limited studies conducted to date, it appears that the amount of virus decreases over time and eventually leaves the semen.

Scientists are saying it. Heck, even many journalists are saying it: "The risk of Ebola infection remains vanishingly small in this country," The New York Times  wrote Wednesday.  But what does that mean? Are you more likely to be struck by lightning or catch Ebola?      Goats and Soda  Plane Of Good Samaritans: Why Fly To (And From) West Africa        It all depends on what you do for a living and where you travel. For instance, three of us from NPR are spending 10 days in Monrovia, Liberia, to report on the outbreak. What's our chance of catching the virus?  So far in the U.S., we've had too little data to calculate a real risk. But we can do some back-of-the-napkin math to give some perspective.  Up until now, two people have caught Ebola in the U.S. Both were nurses in Dallas, who cared for Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who was diagnosed with the virus.  Updated on Oct. 24 at 4:13 a.m. ET. Second Imported Case:  A doctor in New York City tested positive for Ebola Thursday . The Doctors Without Borders staff member — who has been identified as Dr. Craig Spencer — was treating patients in Guinea when he caught the virus. This is the fourth case reported in the U.S. and the second imported case. (Note: An earlier update said the doctor was the fifth case of Ebola in the U.S.)  Our Original Post Continues:  Ebola is spread through contact with sick people's fluids. So, clearly, nurses and doctors who treat patients have a higher risk than others.     But let's pretend for a minute that the probability of getting Ebola in the U.S. is the same across the whole population (aka, the risk is evenly distributed).  The U.S. encounter with Ebola is unlikely to stop in Dallas. Computational biologists predict air traffic will bring more sick people to the States as the epidemic continues in West Africa.  No one knows exactly how many cases this will be. But one team at Northeastern University finds there's about a 70 percent chance we'll get another imported case by the end of this month. Let's say that trend continues, and we get 12 more cases imported over the next year.  On average, each of these sick people will spread the virus to two more people (that's what has happened in West Africa). Then about 24 people in the U.S. will have caught Ebola.  By comparison, 33 people in the U.S. are struck and killed by lightning each year. So the chance of catching Ebola — even with 12 more imported cases like Duncan — is on par with the odds of getting killed by a lightning bolt (1 out of every 9.6 million people).  So we can all breathe a sigh of relief.  But what about us journalists covering the epidemic in Liberia? Or people who call Monrovia their home?  Here we can calculate a risk based on actual data. More than 2,000 people have caught the virus in Monrovia since the epidemic began.  Right now, Monrovia is reporting about 200 Ebola cases each week. The city has a population of about 1 million people. So that means 1 out of every 5,000 people gets infected with Ebola each week. That puts the risk of getting Ebola each week in Monrovia right about on par with the risk of dying during childbirth in the U.S. ( 1 out of 5,500 births ) or about two times the risk of dying in a traffic accident each year ( 1 in 9,100 people ).  Of course, the longer you stay in Monrovia, the more your risk goes up because you are continually in situations where you might be exposed to the virus.  For instance, a full year in Monrovia raises your chance of getting Ebola to around 1 percent — assuming the epidemic doesn't grow any faster than it is now.  I told my husband all these stats to help ease his worry. He has been very concerned about my 10-day trip to Liberia. His response? "That's fine, Michaeleen. I understand the risk. But there's just one number I can't get out of my head: the 70 percent fatality rate."     ebola  Liberia  United States  Risk       Facebook  Twitter  Flipboard  Email               Goats and Soda  STORIES OF LIFE IN A CHANGING WORLD          Goats and Soda  STORIES OF LIFE IN A CHANGING WORLD         About     We're all neighbors on our tiny globe.

To date, about 6,000 people have died . And while the disease has been brought under control in many areas, the World Health Organization acknowledges that there are places where it is still outpacing the international response . If you are wondering about the risk of a global pandemic with scenes reminiscent of movies like “Outbreak” and “28 days later,” here are two things to keep in mind.  RELATED: Few preparations in event of Ebola in US  First, while Ebola is an extremely virulent disease, its impact pales in comparison to other global killers like measles, AIDS, or even the flu.   Advertisement     Second, the likelihood of Ebola spreading across the US is vanishingly small. It isn’t a particularly contagious disease, and in a developed country with strong health infrastructure, it probably wouldn’t spread much at all.  What is Ebola?

Sign up for more newsletters here    Ebola is a virus, like the flu or the common cold. In fact, the official name is Ebola Virus Disease. It was first identified in the 1970s, and since that time, there have been dozens of Ebola outbreaks, most of them in Central and East Africa.  RELATED: Infected aid workers given experimental Ebola drug     Related Links   Few preparations in event of Ebola in US    The early symptoms of Ebola are flu-like, including fever, weakness and muscle pain. Quickly, though, this progresses to vomiting, diarrhea, organ failure, and spontaneous bleeding (internal and external).  Do most people die?  In the current outbreak, well over half of all infected people have died. Previous outbreaks have seen death tolls as high as 90 percent and as low as 25 percent. Ebola comes in different strains (think of swine flu and bird flu), and these have different mortality rates. The type currently spreading through Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and now Nigeria is the Zaire strain , which is not just the deadliest form of Ebola but one of the deadliest diseases on earth.             How do you get it?    Advertisement     Ebola isn’t that contagious. Unlike the flu, for instance, it doesn’t travel through the air. You can only get it from direct contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of infected people. One reason it has been spreading through West Africa is that in some communities, it is common for mourners to touch the bodies of deceased loved ones before burial, and people who’ve succumbed to Ebola are still contagious after death. Health workers, too, face increased risk, because caring for Ebola patients requires close contact. This is likely how the two infected US doctors contracted the disease. Generally speaking, though, Ebola doesn’t spread easily. People who study disease transmission tend to look at two major variables when predicting how far diseases will travel. • Generation time . This is a measure of how long it takes for one person to infect another. If you’re sick and you pass your germs on to someone else, will they get sick the next day? A week later? A month? With flu, the generation time is very short, just 2-4 days, which is one reason flu can spread so quickly through a group of people. Ebola has a much longer generation time, upwards of 2 weeks. That slows down transmission.  RELATED: Vaccines not available for Ebola, but some being developed  • Reproductive number . If you’re sick and you nonetheless decide to go about your everyday routine how many people are you likely to infect? That’s what the “reproductive number” measures. When you walk around with the flu, you’re likely to infect two people. If you have measles, it’s seven or more. With Ebola, it’s roughly 1.5 to 2.   Advertisement     Putting these together, you see that Ebola scores relatively low on both these measures of infectiousness, meaning there isn’t a clear mechanism for rapid spread. Flu, for instance, may have a low reproductive number but its speedy generation time still gives it a means to move quickly through a population. And while Smallpox had a generation time quite similar to Ebola, it  jumped much more readily from person to person.       Reproductive number Generation time (days)  Ebola 1.5-2 14-21  Flu 1.5-2 2-4  Dengue 1.3-6.3 19-24  SARS 1.2-3.6 8.4  Rubella 2.9-7.8 15-23  Smallpox 3.2-6.9 14-20  Cholera 4-15 7-10  Measles 7.1-29.3 9-17   Source: Infectious Disease Epidemiology: Theory and Practice. Also, Dr. Donald Burke and Dr. Justin Lessler .    Are there any treatments?  At this point, there’s very little doctors can do for Ebola victims, beyond keeping them hydrated.  There are some experimental treatments at different stages of review, including a vaccine and some medications , but nothing proven or approved. One reason there are currently no treatments is that, horrific as the disease may be, it mainly affects poor people in poor communities. That makes it harder for drug companies to earn money from potential products, and thus reduces their incentive to spend money on research. Of course, money isn’t the only incentive, and there are other ways to encourage drug research, including medical prizes, but for now finding a working treatment remains an open challenge.  On a scale of one to 10, how worried should I be?  If you live in the US your worry-level should be quite low. Ebola doesn’t have the disease profile to spread in a place with reasonable medical resources. If you find yourself in West Africa, you have more cause for concern. Developing nations lack the public health resources needed to properly quarantine people, provide health workers with protective gear, and educate the population about risks and best practices. The deadliness of this Ebola outbreak has as much to do with the social and political structures in West Africa as with the structure of the virus itself.  RELATED: FDA to regulate tests for Lyme disease, other illnesses  And yet even if you do live in a country where poor public health infrastructure makes you more vulnerable to Ebola, there are other diseases you should be much more worried about. UNICEF estimates that 9.7 million children under 5 die each year of preventable diseases. That’s 25,000 every day, compared to the 6,000 who have died from this Ebola outbreak--the worst outbreak ever. Across the globe, a bad flu season can kill over 250,000 people. Measles and cholera both kill over 100,000. Diarrheal diseases kill 1.5 million. In terms of global killers, Ebola just isn’t in the same class.            Still, while there are other, more infectious illnesses, Ebola remains a deadly disease that’s killing thousands of people and wreaking havoc across West Africa. That’s the broader context for the current crisis. It may not be the beginning of a global pandemic, but without better treatment and more support for public health services this flare-up could continue, and future outbreaks will remain largely unavoidable.

If you live in the United States, it almost certainly won't be Ebola. Although a Sierra Leone doctor in Nebraska and a Liberian visitor in Dallas have died of the disease, the odds favor death by almost every other alternative. A 2014 National Safety Council report uses mortality data and U.S. population statistics from 2010 to synthesize the likelihood of dying by various methods. Most likely, something far less exotic will get you.  Note: All death odds were calculated using 2010 population data.

Credit: Daniel Martin | CDC     Young children who are infected with Ebola may be more likely to die from the virus than older children or adults who are infected, according to a new study.  In the study, researchers examined Ebola cases in children younger than 16 during the current outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and compared them with adult cases. They found that the outbreak's death rate has been higher among younger children than among older children and adults.  The disease has killed about 90 percent of infected children under age 1, and about 80 percent of kids ages 1 to 4 who have been infected. Older children who have been infected with Ebola may have a much better chance of surviving , as the death rate has been lower — 52 percent — for children ages 10 to 15. Among children older than 15 and adults, the mortality rate was 65 percent.  "The very youngest of children — neonates  —appear to have the worst outcomes from Ebola," study co-author Dr. Robert Fowler, an associate professor of critical-care medicine at the University of Toronto, said in a statement. (Neonates, or newborns, are babies younger than 1 month.)  There are a number of factors that may explain the high Ebola mortality rate in newborns, Fowler said. For instance, the youngest children are often heavily dependent on others to care for them, and their caregivers may have also been sick with Ebola. Younger kids may also be particularly prone to dehydration and metabolic abnormalities that result from vomiting and diarrhea, which are common symptoms of the disease.  To prevent dehydration, children need to receive a sufficient amount of fluids , which are usually administered intravenously when the children can no longer keep fluids down because they have been vomiting, Fowler said.  However, getting those fluids into the body by "placing intravenous catheters in young children can be challenging," he said. [ Where Did Ebola Come From? ]  The study shows that Ebola affects young children differently from adults, study co-author Christl Donnelly, a professor at Imperial College London, said in a statement.  Therefore, "it's especially important that we get them [children] into treatment quickly," she said. "We also need to look at whether young children are getting treatment that's appropriate for their age."  The researchers were surprised by the relatively low mortality rate among children ages 10 to 15, said study co-author Dr. Christopher M. Dye, head of the World Health Organization's Ebola epidemiology team in Geneva.  "That has not been seen before for Ebola, and we have been able to uncover this partly because this large epidemic has generated so much data," Dye told Live Science. "Put another way, usually we expect to see higher case fatalities from infections only in the very youngest and the very oldest, but the pattern here is different."  The new study was published today (March 25) in the New England Journal of Medicine.   Follow Agata Blaszczak-Boxe on Twitter . Follow Live Science @livescience , Facebook  & Google+ .

What is Ebola virus disease?   Ebola virus disease (formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever) is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90% caused by Ebola virus, a member of the filovirus family.   The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 when 2 simultaneous outbreaks occurred, 1 in Yambuku, a village not far from the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the other in a remote area of Sudan.   The origin of the virus is unknown, but current evidence suggests that fruit bats ( Pteropodidae ) may be a  host.  2. How do people become infected with the Ebola virus?   People become infected with Ebola either through contact with infected animals (usually following butchering, cooking or eating) or through contact with the bodily fluids of infected humans. Most cases are caused by human to human transmission which occurs when blood or other bodily fluids or secretions (stool, urine, saliva, semen) of infected people enters a healthy person’s body through broken skin or mucous membranes.   Infection can also occur if the broken skin or the mucous membranes of a healthy person comes into contact with items or environments contaminated with bodily fluids from an infected person. These may include soiled clothing, bed linen, gloves, protective equipment and medical waste such as used hypodermic syringes.  3. Who is most at risk?   During an outbreak, those at higher risk of infection are:   health workers;  family members or others in close contact with infected people;  mourners who have direct contact with bodies during burial rituals.   4. Why are mourners at burial ceremonies considered at risk of contracting Ebola?   Levels of Ebola virus remain high after death, thus bodies of those who have died from Ebola virus disease must be handled only by people wearing appropriate personal protective equipment and must be buried immediately. WHO advises that bodies of people who may have died from Ebola virus disease should be handled only by trained burial teams, who are equipped to properly bury the dead, safely and with dignity.    How to conduct safe and dignified burial of a patient who has died from suspected or confirmed Ebola virus disease    5. Why are health-care workers at greater risk of catching Ebola?   Health-care workers are at greater risk of infection if they are not wearing correct personal protective equipment (PPE) or are not applying infection prevention and control (IPC) measures when caring for patients. All health-care providers working at all levels of the health system – hospitals, clinics and health posts – should be fully informed about the disease and its mode of transmission and should follow recommended precautions strictly.    Health worker Ebola infections in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone    How to put on and how to remove personal protective equipment - posters    6. Can Ebola be transmitted sexually?   Sexual transmission of the Ebola virus, from males to females, is a strong possibility, but has not yet been proven. Less probable, but theoretically possible, is female to male transmission. More surveillance data and research are needed on the risks of sexual transmission, and particularly on the prevalence of viable and transmissible virus in semen over time. In the interim, and based on present evidence, WHO recommends that:   All Ebola survivors and their sexual partners should receive counselling to ensure safe sexual practices until their semen has twice tested negative. Survivors should be provided with condoms.  Male Ebola survivors should be offered semen testing at 3 months after onset of disease, and then, for those who test positive, every month thereafter until their semen tests negative for virus twice by RT-PCR, with an interval of one week between tests.  Ebola survivors and their sexual partners should either:   abstain from all types of sex, or  observe safe sex through correct and consistent condom use until their semen has twice tested negative.   Having tested negative, survivors can safely resume normal sexual practices without fear of Ebola virus transmission.  Based on further analysis of ongoing research and consideration by the WHO Advisory Group on the Ebola Virus Disease Response, WHO recommends that male survivors of Ebola virus disease practice safe sex and hygiene for 12 months from onset of symptoms or until their semen tests negative twice for Ebola virus.  Until such time as their semen has twice tested negative for Ebola, survivors should practise good hand and personal hygiene by immediately and thoroughly washing with soap and water after any physical contact with semen, including after masturbation. During this period used condoms should be handled safely, and safely disposed of, so as to prevent contact with seminal fluids.  All survivors, their partners and families should be shown respect, dignity and compassion.     Clinical care for survivors of Ebola virus disease    7. What are the typical signs and symptoms of Ebola virus infection?   Ebola symptoms vary but sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat are commonly experienced at the beginning of the disease (‘the dry phase’). As the disease progresses, people commonly develop vomiting and diarrhoea (‘the wet phase’), rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.  8. How long does it take for people to develop symptoms after being infected?   The incubation period, or the time interval from infection to onset of symptoms, is from 2 to 21 days. People are not contagious until they develop symptoms. Ebola virus disease infections can only be confirmed through laboratory testing.  9. When should someone seek medical care?   A person with Ebola-like symptoms (fever, headache, muscle aches, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea) who has been in contact with living or dead people suspected to have had Ebola or has travelled to an area known to have cases of Ebola virus disease should seek medical care immediately.  10. Is there any treatment for Ebola?   Supportive care, especially fluid replacement therapy, carefully managed and monitored by trained health workers improves chances of survival. Other treatments being used to help people survive Ebola virus disease include, where available, kidney dialysis, blood transfusions, plasma replacement therapy.   An experimental Ebola vaccine proved highly protective against Ebola virus in a major trial in Guinea.  The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11 841 people during 2015.  11. Can people with Ebola be cared for at home?   WHO does not advise families or communities to care for individuals with symptoms of Ebola virus disease at home. People with such symptoms should seek treatment in a hospital or treatment centre staffed by doctors and nurses equipped to treat Ebola virus disease.   If a person dies at home and is suspected of having died from Ebola virus disease, family and community members should refrain from handling or preparing the body for burial. The local health authorities should be contacted immediately and asked to send  a dead body management team.  12. Can Ebola be prevented?   People can protect themselves from infection with Ebola virus following specific infection prevention and control measures. These include hand washing, avoiding contact with the bodily fluids of individuals who are suspected of or confirmed to have Ebola, and refraining from handling or preparing bodies of persons who are suspected of or confirmed to have died from Ebola.  13. Is there an Ebola vaccine?   An experimental Ebola vaccine proved highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea.  The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, was studied in a trial involving 11 841 people during 2015. Among the 5837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine.   The trial was led by WHO, together with Guinea’s Ministry of Health, Médecins sans Frontieres and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with other international partners. A ring vaccination protocol was chosen for the trial, where some of the rings are vaccinated shortly after a case is detected, and other rings are vaccinated after a delay of 3 weeks.

Critics call the government’s response to Ebola “shambolic” as a national exercise to test Britain’s readiness for an outbreak takes place. But what danger does the killer virus pose to Britain?                 What is Ebola?  Ebola virus disease, or EVD, was first identified in 1976 near the Ebola river in Congo. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded more than 20 outbreaks since then, all beginning in Africa.  Scientists think Ebola was first introduced to humans by people living in remote jungle areas handling infected wild animals like fruit bats, apes and monkeys.  The disease is a haemorrhagic fever, causing internal and external bleeding along with a wide range of other symptoms that progress rapidly.  Although the deadliest strain has been known to kill up to 90 per cent of infected patients, the WHO says the average fatality rate is around 50 per cent.  There is no known cure or vaccine.  How bad is this outbreak?  According to the latest WHO figures , there have been 8,033 confirmed cases and 3,865 deaths in 40 weeks, making this by far the deadliest outbreak of Ebola in history.  Liberia is the worst-affected country, with 2,210 deaths, followed by Sierra Leone (879 fatalities) and Guinea (768 deaths).   The WHO says the situation in the three west African countries at the centre of the outbreak “continues to deteriorate, with widespread and persistent transmission of EVD”.  Nigeria has seen eight deaths but the authorities there have been praised for effectively containing the spread of the disease.  The first confirmed case outside west Africa was Spanish nurse Teresa Romero , who is currently being treated in an isolation unit at a Madrid hospital. A Liberian man, Thomas Duncan, died in Dallas, Texas, this week.  How many Britons have caught the disease?  Nurse Will Pooley remains the only Briton known to have contracted Ebola . He caught the disease while treating patients in Sierra Leone.   Mr Pooley was flown back to Britain by the RAF. He was treated at an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London, given the experimental drug ZMapp, and has made a full recovery .  There were reports that a British man who died in Skopje, Macedonia, had Ebola-like symptoms , but the authorities later said they did not believe his death was caused by the virus and a man travelling with him showed no signs of illness.  So will there be an outbreak here?  Experts say it is highly likely that someone infected with ebola will arrive in the UK at some point – but they say NHS staff are well-trained at isolating and containing diseases from abroad.  David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “I think it’s bound to happen. We have a lot of links with west Africa. There is lots of coming and going so I’m sure there will be a few cases.”  Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, said: “Whilst the risk of imported Ebola virus remains small, it’s still a very real risk.”  What plans are in place?  The Royal Free is home to the country’s only high-level isolation unit and is likely to feature heavily if Ebola arrives in Britain.  Other hospitals in Liverpool, Sheffield and Newcastle with expertise in dealing with highly infectious diseases could take cases too.  Amid some confusion, the government has now said border staff at Heathrow, Gatwick and Eurostar rail terminals will carry out screening measures on passengers arriving from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guineau.  Airlines cancelled direct flights from those countries some weeks ago but there are fears travellers carrying Ebola could transfer to the UK.  ‘No plans for entry screening’   Downing Street’s sudden announcement of screening measures at UK ports came after Public Health England said it had no plans to introduce entry screening.  The health body says it cannot give any details of the screening process, and officials at Gatwick and Eurostar said they had not been told how the measures would be carried out.  Downing Street said there would be checks on passengers’ recent travel history, people they have been in contact with, and their onward travel arrangements, as well as a possible health assessment conducted by trained medics.  Checks are already in place to stop passengers with symptoms boarding planes leaving the stricken west African countries.  ‘Blunt instrument’   Experts have questioned how useful the screening measures will be.  Professor George Griffin, chair of the government advisory committee on dangerous pathogens, told the BBC: “It is somewhat surprising after, I think, we were all led to believe that the decision was not to screen.”  He added: “Most of the scientific community feel that the instrument is very, very blunt.”  Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, welcomed the new checks but said: “There is a touch of the shambolic about the way this is being handled.”   Will I catch Ebola?  There seems little reason to panic. Most experts agree the risk of cases arriving in the UK is small and the threat of transmission is manageable.  The disease is not airborne so is very unlikely to spread through coughs and sneezes.  Ebola is mainly spread when a patient’s blood or other bodily fluids come into direct contact with the broken skin or mucous membrane of another person.  The main risk of transmission is through mourners handling dead bodies of victims or health workers coming into close contact with victims without wearing protective clothing.  The WHO says the illness is only infectious when a patient develops symptoms – typically a sudden fever followed by flu-like symptoms, then vomiting, diarrhoea and other serious complications. Symptoms can show up anywhere from two to 21 days after infection.  It can be difficult to distinguish Ebola from other infection diseases like malaria and meningitis and lab tests are needed to confirm a case.  I think I’ve got Ebola – what do I do?  Current advice from Public Health England states: “If you feel unwell with symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, sore throat or rash within 21 days of coming back from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone, you should stay at home and immediately, telephone 111 or 999 and explain that you have recently visited west Africa.  “These services will provide advice and arrange for you to be seen in a hospital if necessary so that the cause of your illness can be determined.  “There are other illnesses which are much more common than Ebola (such as flu, typhoid fever and malaria) that have similar symptoms in the early stages, so proper medical assessment is really important to ensure you get the right diagnosis and treatment.  “It is also really important that medical services are expecting your arrival and calling 111 or 999 will ensure that this happen.”  The official advices stresses that there is little chance of catching Ebola unless you have come into contact with the blood or bodily fluid of an infected person in the danger zone.

James Giahyue/Reuters/Landov         Tara Fowler  September 18, 2014 02:00 PM       As the Ebola virus continues to spread through West Africa, the possibility that the disease could reach the U.S. is growing.  Dr. Kent Brantly, one of the American survivors of Ebola , testified before Congress on Tuesday, stressing the importance of stopping the outbreak in its tracks.  “We can’t afford to wait months, or even weeks, to take action, to put people on the ground,” he said.  Also on Tuesday, President Obama declared a “major increase” in America’s response to the deadly outbreak in West Africa, CNN reports.  “Men and women and children are just sitting, waiting to die right now,” Obama said.  He added: “This is a daunting task, but here’s what gives us hope. The world knows how to fight this disease. It’s not a mystery.  “We know the science. We know how to prevent it from spreading. We know how to care for those who contract it. We know that if we take the proper steps, we can save lives. But we have to act fast.”  To date, the virus has killed at least 2,400 people, and cases are growing exponentially, with 5,000 people infected, according to the World Health Organization .  While the disease has not yet spread outside Africa, officials say it’s only a matter of time with an outbreak of this caliber.                        President Barack Obama speaks at the CDC  Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP      PEOPLE spoke to experts at the Center for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health to get their perspective on the threat of Ebola to Americans.  What are the chances the Ebola virus will reach the U.S.?  Researchers say the chance of seeing an imported case in the U.S. is as high as 18 percent by the end of September (it was less than 5 percent at the start of the month). Restricting air travel “generates only a three- to four-week delay in the international spreading,” according to a study published this month in PLOS Currents: Outbreaks .  How likely am I to contract Ebola?  Not very. Even if an imported case does make it to the U.S., it’s unlikely it will spread through the general population. Basically, the only way for an average American to contract the disease is to visit one of the afflicted countries in Africa.  “It’s healthcare providers caring for Ebola patients and the family and friends in close contact with Ebola patients that are at the highest risk of getting sick,” says Kristen Nordlund, health communications specialist at the CDC. “They may come in contact with the blood or body fluids of sick patients, which is how the disease is spread.”  “The chances of an average American who hasn’t visited Africa getting Ebola are so vanishingly small, it’s almost non-quantitative,” adds Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH’s Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  He illustrates a worst-case scenario: “A person could walk into an ER and not tell them he just got off a plane from West Africa, which would alert people to quarantine him. Let’s say they didn’t and a nurse and a doctor got infected. That small cluster would be contained almost immediately.”  I’m flying to Africa next week. Are there any travel restrictions in place?  The CDC currently recommends that travelers avoid going to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone unless such travel is absolutely essential. There is also an alert in place for Nigeria urging travelers to “take enhanced precautions,” says Nordlund.  And what are “enhanced precautions”? The CDC recommends avoiding wild animals or raw or undercooked meat; avoiding the body fluids of people who have contracted the illness; and avoiding any burial rites that involve handling the body of someone who died from Ebola.  What is the best way to prevent myself from getting Ebola?  In addition to following the precautions mentioned above, you should make sure to practice good hygiene by washing your hands with soap and water and using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  Adds Nordlund: “Seek medical care immediately if you develop fever, headache, muscle pain, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain or unexplained bruising or bleeding. Limit your contact with other people when you go to the doctor. Do not travel anywhere else.”  Is there a treatment for Ebola?  There is a small human trial for a vaccine being carried out at the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, right now. Ten volunteers have been given a dose of an experimental vaccine and “thus far there have been no red flags,” said Fauci .  This is merely Phase I of the trial, which tests to see that the vaccine is safe and that it works in humans. The first phase should be completed by November or December, at which point the vaccine will go into wider human trials.  While the vaccine looked promising in animals, Fauci cautions that doesn’t mean it will be a viable treatment in humans. “We have many, many vaccines that look good in an animal model, and then when they get to a human, they just don’t work,” he says. “At this stage of development, it’s impossible to say how promising it’s going to be. Right now it looks like it’s safe. That doesn’t mean it’s going to work.”  One Man’s Ebola Diary            Want more stories like this?

in several African countries. Ebola was first discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, outbreaks of Ebola among humans have appeared sporadically in Africa.  Risk  Healthcare providers caring for Ebola patients and family and friends in close contact with Ebola patients are at the highest risk of getting sick because they may come in contact with infected blood or body fluids. Ebola also can be spread through direct contact with objects (like clothes, bedding, needles, syringes/sharps or medical equipment) that have been contaminated with infected body fluids. Additionally, people can become sick with Ebola after coming in contact with infected wildlife. For example, in Africa, Ebola may spread as a result of handling bushmeat (wild animals hunted for food) and contact with infected bats.  It is also possible that Ebola could be spread through sex or other contact with semen from men who have survived Ebola. Until more information is known, avoid contact with semen from a man who has had Ebola. It is not known if Ebola can be spread through sex or other contact with vaginal fluids from a woman who has had Ebola.  CDC and other public health partners are continuing to study Ebola transmission and will share what is known as it becomes available.

Odds of Catching Ebola on the Subway and Other Handy Facts   By ABC NEWS  Oct 24, 2014, 11:17 AM ET   0 Shares               Email      Star     Play Andrew A. Smith/Getty Images WATCH NYC Officials Try to Calm Public Fears After Ebola Diagnosis  0 Shares               Email      Ebola continues to dominate the news with the latest diagnosis of a patient in New York City, leaving many Americans on edge, especially New Yorkers, who awoke this morning to learn that the patient had take three subway lines before he was diagnosed. So, what are the odds of catching Ebola on the subway? Here are a few Ebola facts to calm your nerves. "There are fundamental things we do know about Ebola and it's those things that can make most people in America rest very well at night that they don't have a risk of contracting this disease,” said ABC News chief health and medical editor Dr. Richard Besser during a recent ABC News Ebola town hall event.  Ebola World View: Who Has It and Where     Ebola in America: Timeline of the Deadly Virus     Number of U.S. Biocontainment Beds May Surprise You     What If I Stand Next to Someone With Ebola on a Subway?  You probably won't catch it in that situation, Dr. Jay Varma, New York City’s deputy commissioner for disease control, said during the town hall event. "Casual contact like you would have somebody pass you on the bus or on the subway, I’m not worried about it for myself and I’m not worried about it for my wife and kids," Varma said.  When Does Ebola Become Contagious?  Ebola is contagious when someone is symptomatic, Besser said. A fever is the first symptom of Ebola, which means the virus is beginning to multiply in the patient’s blood when a fever sets in. As an Ebola patient gets sicker and sicker, the amount of virus in his or her blood multiplies, making them even more contagious.  How Is Ebola Spread?  Ebola is spread through close contact with an infected person, and it’s not airborne, Besser said. “We also know from the studies in Africa that it’s a hard disease to get,” Besser said. “If this disease was spread through the air or was spread easily -- that you could get it from someone you’re standing next to in the market or sitting next to on a plane -- this outbreak would be far larger than it is today.” People who contract Ebola usually do so because they've cared for someone who was infected in a hospital setting or at home, Besser noted, or they've touched the body of a person who died of Ebola.  Can It Become Airborne?  “The majority of scientists say that while it’s possible, it’s highly unlikely,” Besser said, explaining that the virus would have to mutate significantly.  What If Someone With Ebola Sneezes on Me?  Sneezing is not a symptom of Ebola, Besser said. Neither is coughing until the very late stages of the disease, when the person is clearly sick and near death. On top of that, the disease is not airborne.  How Long Can the Virus Survive on Surfaces Like Tabletops and Doorknobs?  “This is one of these areas where we don’t really know enough,” Varma said. “We do know that these viruses can survive on surfaces for a few hours.” He said how long it can survive depends on the surface and the environment.  Should You Take Precautions Before Taking Public Transportation?  “We think this is not a disease that you can get from simply being next to somebody,” Varma said. “Absolutely if somebody vomits on you or you get their body fluids on it, of course you can be at risk, but we think that airplane travel, traveling on subways -- all of that -- is the type of contact where this is not a disease that's transmitted.” He said he’s more worried about getting the flu on public transportation than Ebola.  Can I Get Ebola From Someone’s Sweat?  There’s very little data on how much of the virus is in a sick person’s sweat, Besser said. He added that carrying a person who is sick with Ebola can be a “risky situation.” He said one man who had Ebola on a plane didn't spread it to fellow passengers but inadvertently gave it to the people who helped carry him once he got off the plane. “Touching the skin -- whether he had other body fluids or sweat on his skin at that point -- was a risk,” Besser said.  Can Ebola Be Spread Through the Water Supply?  Ebola is not a water-borne disease, according to researchers at the Water Research Foundation. Therefore, it cannot spread through the water supply. “Once in water, the host cell will take in water in an attempt to equalize the osmotic pressure, causing the cell to swell and burst, thus killing the virus,” the foundation noted in a statement. Bodily fluids flushed by an infected person would not contaminate the water supply, the statement went on to say, because the virus is so fragile. Once separated from its host it is neutralized within minutes.  Can Ebola Be Used as a Terrorist Weapon?  Ebola could theoretically be used by terrorists but it is unlikely, Varma said Studies suggest that Ebola could in theory be delivered in mist form by spraying it out of an aerosol can. However, since the virus is not known to take an airborne route, this would likely be ineffective. It is also possible that a terrorist willing to be infected with the virus could walk among the general population. However, since the virus has a long incubation period and is not highly contagious until the later stages of the disease, most experts say this would be impractical.  Can Ebola Be Spread by Mosquitoes?  Neither mosquitoes nor rats can spread Ebola, Besser said. "Not all viruses are adapted to survival and transmission through every vector," he noted. Only mammals such as humans, bats, monkeys and apes have shown the ability to spread and become infected with the Ebola virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other studies have shown that dogs and pigs can be infected with the virus but they don't show symptoms and there are no known cases of these animals passing the virus along to humans.  Is There a Vaccine Coming?  There are two vaccines being tested in clinical trials now, Besser said. “There’s a lot of efforts underway to try and move a vaccine forward but vaccine development takes a long time,” he said, adding that one of the companies working on one has said it won’t know whether it works until 2015. Even if it does work, it will take more time to manufacture.  What About Other Drugs?  Ebola patients in the United States are receiving experimental drugs, but it’s not yet clear whether they've helped, hurt or made no difference in those patients’ outcomes, Besser said.  Why Don't We Just Close Our Borders to West Africa?  Keeping people from leaving the Ebola-affected countries would be a "major mistake," Besser said, noting that he saw aid workers, journalists and family members aboard his plane on his two trips to Liberia in the last few months, and that letting them in and out is important. "You want to make sure that people who leave that area are being monitored and doing it safely," he said. "You want to encourage people to go there who have expertise and can help these governments, these health workers, control this disease. That will save lives there and will also improve the health and protection of Americans right here." Varma said the biggest concern in America should be containing the outbreak in Africa. Until that happens, he said "we will always be at risk." "You can't just wrap a wall around these countries and not expect people to get out," he said.       0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.
