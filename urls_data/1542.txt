Nearly 13,000 people in the US were murdered with firearms in 2015. Gun violence is a leading cause of death in the US, according to the CDC. But research is bootstrapped because of federal funding restrictions passed by Congress. AR-15 rifle that he purchased legally It was the deadliest school shooting in Florida history. The suspected gunman, Nikolas Cruz, had reportedly been known as a threat to the school, and teachers have bemoaned how they were powerless to stop him. Cruz's victims join a growing number of people in the US intentionally killed at the end of a gun. Below is how the lifetime odds of dying from gun violence (highlighted in red; suicides and accidents excluded) stack up against many causes of death for Americans: Skye Gould/Business Insider Assaults by firearm kill about 13,000 people in the US each year, which translates to a roughly 1-in-315 lifetime chance of death from gun violence. That's about 56% more likely than the lifetime risk of dying while riding inside a car, truck, or van. It's also more than 11 times as high as dying from any force of nature, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, flood, or lightning strike. These measures also suggest Americans are more likely to die from gun violence than the combined risks of drowning, fire and smoke, stabbing, choking on food, airplane crashes, animal attacks, and natural disasters. Where the data comes from Parents wait for news after a report of a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Wednesday, February 14, 2018. Associated Press/Joel Auerbach The chart above does not account for a person's specific behaviors, age, sex, location, or other factors that could shift the results; it's an average of the entire US population. But it clearly shows that gun violence in the US is a leading cause of death, which is how the CDC describes firearm homicides in its National Vital Statistics Reports. Most of the data comes from an October 2017 report by the National Safety Council and a November 2017 report by the National Center for Health Statistics on causes of death in the US, primarily those that occurred in 2015. (The NSC report uses 2014 data wherever newer data was unavailable.) Mass shootings aren't part of the data sets above, but the Gun Violence Archive project keeps a sourced tally , which we've independently counted. The organization considers any event where four or more victims were injured (regardless of death) to be a mass shooting. In 2015, some 333 mass shootings left 367 people dead and 1,328 injured. The statistics rose in 2016 to 383 mass shootings, 456 deaths, and 1,537 injuries. In 2017, there were 346 mass shootings that led to 437 deaths and 1,802 injuries. Foreign-born terrorism data comes from Cato Institute terrorism data , and some natural-disaster data comes from Tulane University . We calculated the lifetime odds of death by applying 2015 life expectancy and population numbers in the US, and our analysis assumes each cause of death won't change drastically in the near future. (Mortality data from previous years suggests these rankings are relatively consistent, with the exception of skyrocketing accidental poisonings due to the opioid epidemic. ) You can view our full dataset and sourcing here . A dearth of US gun-violence research Although gun violence is one of the leading causes of death in America, it is also one of the most poorly researched, according to a January 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. "In relation to mortality rates, gun violence research was the least-researched cause of death and the second-least-funded cause of death after falls," the study's authors wrote. The study ascribed this dearth of research to restrictions — namely a 21-year-old congressional appropriations bill called the Dickey Amendment that stipulated "none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control." Research into gun violence is the most poorly funded relative to other causes of death. Dr. David E. Stark, Dr. Nigam H. Shah/JAMA This and other federal funding restrictions are still active, hindering many scientists from understanding the problem. "The fundamental, foundational work of documenting the full scale of the health consequences of firearms has not been done," Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist and the dean of the Boston University School of Public Health, told Mother Jones in a January 2017 story . "It's the kind of project that we do all the time. It just hasn't been done with firearms because there haven't been resources." But what questions have been researched by private institutions like the Harvard Injury Control Research Center show a clear connection between gun ownership, gun availability, homicides, and violent death. A roundup of gun-control and gun-violence studies by German Lopez at Vox shows Americans represent less than 5% of the world population but possess nearly 50% of the world's civilian-owned guns, police are about three times more likely to be killed in states with high gun ownership, countries with more guns see more gun deaths , and states with tighter gun control laws see fewer gun-related deaths . This story was updated with the latest final data from CDC, which covers the year 2015. We previously stated that about 11,000 people in the US are killed during firearm assaults; that was a 2014 statistic. In 2015, nearly 13,000 people in the US were killed during firearm assaults.

Shutterstock A gunman in Las Vegas killed dozens and injured hundreds at a country music festival on Sunday. Some 11,000 people in the US are killed in firearm assaults each year. Gun violence is a leading cause of death in America, but research on the problem is bootstrapped due to federal funding restrictions passed by Congress. A gunman fired on a Las Vegas country music festival on Sunday evening, killing at least 59 and injuring more than 525 people. Police identified the shooter as Stephen Paddock , a 64-year-old man from Nevada. Members of the SWAT team who raided Paddock's room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino said they believe he took his own life. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department's sheriff also said officers found 23 guns in his room, including what appeared to be at least one modified automatic weapon . Nineteen additional guns were later found in his home, police said. The motive is not yet known for the attack, though the FBI on Monday contradicted ISIS's claim that it was responsible for the massacre, saying Paddock appeared to have "no connection with an international terrorist group." Whatever spurred the event, it is now the deadliest mass shooting in US history — and Paddock's victims join a growing number of people in the US that were intentionally killed at the end of a gun.

How Scared Should I Be of Getting Shot? The raw numbers for gun deaths in the US are terrifying. SHARE TWEET Mike Pearl Oct 19 2015, 4:00am Photo via Wikimedia Commons user Mikhail Evstafiev  As someone who regularly finds himself immersed in terrifying news stories about shooting sprees , I sometimes feel like I'm living in a war zone. Moments of everyday chaos—commotion in a movie theater, or a weird clatter in the furthest corner of my office—have become scarier lately. They don't make me lunge for the nearest exit quite yet, but the phrase "active shooter scenario" does briefly bubble up from the depths of my imagination. Just now, as I was writing this paragraph, I got a push notification on my phone about a "Doc Shot in LA's Boyle Heights," and my first assumption was that a nearby doctor was murdered. It turned out to be an ad for a documentary. So as a sane American person, and non-gun owner, how scared should I really be of meeting my maker at the wrong end of a gun barrel? The first place to look if you want to be scared is at data on the number of mass shootings in the United States. For this, I turned to Mass Shooting Tracker , which counts the number of incidents in the US in which four or more people were shot in one setting (the FBI, by contrast, only keeps statistics on mass murders.) According to a downloadable spreadsheet available via the Mass Shooting Tracker site , the number just hit 300 for 2015 on October 10, when someone opened fire at a party in Charlotte, North Carolina. There have now been more than 1,000 mass shootings in the US since 2013. It's hard to make that number mean something, but I can try: If every mass shooting since 2013 happened in an Olive Garden, there could have been a mass shooting in every Olive Garden in America by now —actually we would have hit that mark back in 2014. At last count there have been 1,236 fatalities in all of the shootings since 2013; by comparison, 1,215 coalition soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since 2011 . Scarier still is the fact that those numbers don't take into account all the people who have been shot in incidents that didn't qualify as mass shootings. After all, being gunned down by a mugger is no less scary a thought than being done in by a spree killer, and as Rachel M. Cohen recently wrote here at VICE , mass shootings aren't a very complete picture of gun violence in the United States. In fact, according to some number crunching by Mayors Against Illegal Guns , less than 1 percent of all victims of homicide in 2010 were killed in mass shootings. According to Ted Alcorn, research director at the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety , because of the lack of data on gun injuries in the US, counting the number of gun deaths is actually the best way to measure the scariness of these weapons. "There's no census-style database for injuries," Alcorn said, so groups like his "have less ability to quantify them." The raw numbers for gun deaths in the US are even more alarming. In 2013, the most recent year for which government data is available, 33,636 people were killed by guns—roughly 92 people each day and about twice the number of Japanese soldiers killed in the monthlong bloodbath that was the Battle of Iwo Jima . To get a better sense of what that means, we have to look at the rate, rather than just the raw numbers: In 2013, the rate of gun deaths was 10.6, which means that 10.6 people out of every 100,000 in the US died by firearm that year. But even though these numbers are scarily high, they are absolutely dwarfed by the number of people killed by their own weak hearts each year: 610,000 , or about one in every four deaths. So should I be more scared of heart disease than guns? No, because heart disease tends to kill people when they are old, and death is inevitable. That may sound grim, but public health officials look at it the same way. "Things that affect young people have a disproportionate impact on the wellbeing of the population as a whole, and gun violence is among them," Alcorn explained, adding, "so are automotive injuries." The car crash comparison turned out to be important. An April report from the Violence Policy Center, a gun control advocacy group, pointed out that due to increased automotive safety—and increased gun violence—the numbers of deaths by car and by gun are now comparable: In 2013, 35,612 people died in auto accidents; 33,636 died by firearm.  Expressed as a rate, the average person's risk from gun homicides and car crashes is almost the same—about 10.3 per 100,000, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety . In other words, if you're an American, you should be approximately as scared of being shot to death as you are of dying in a car crash. That's a dramatic oversimplification, because unlike most car accidents, people generally choose who they shoot—or at least try to. "It's all very different depending on your circumstances," said David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health. How scared someone should be of gun death, he explained, depends "on who you want to talk to—who's of interest." Once you've determined that, Hemenway said, then you can "give what their likelihood is." To figure out these likelihoods, we turned to the CDC database known as WISQARS , or "Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System," which houses these statistics. With WISQARS, you can choose what kind of people are, as Hemenway put it, "of interest," and look up their demographics to see how their chances of dying from a gun compare to the average. So I chose to look at myself: a 31-year-old white guy. According to WISQARS, I'm at a little bit higher risk than most Americans, with a gun death rate of 18.36, compared to the national age-adjusted average of 10.3. Still, in my state (California), the overall age-adjusted rate is a little lower than average at 7.68, which is nice. If I lived in a state with higher rates of gun death, like say, Louisiana, the rate of risk for my demographic would go up to 19 deaths for every 100,000 30-something white dudes. Graphic via CDC But it turns out that, because of my age, my risk for gun death is among the lowest it will be in my lifetime. I was at a slightly higher risk when I was in my early 20s: Graphic via Centers for Disease Control In a couple of years, the odds that I will die from a gun shot go will go up again, and will keep going up all the way into my old age. That's largely because these numbers include gun suicides, and the suicide risk among men—particularly white men— increases with age . According to data from the Pew Research Center , American men age 65 and older die by suicide with guns at a rate of 10.6 per 100,000 people. Eventually, if I reach 85 or older, the rate will reach an eye-popping 41.85 per 100,000, according to WISQARS. Read: Meet the South Central LA School Counselor Who Helps Students Combat PTSD From Gang Violence Of course, one of my white privileges is that I am much less likely to be killed by a gun. A black guy my age is almost four times as likely to die this way than I am, with a rate of 70 deaths for every 100,000 people. A close look at how scared I should be of gun death only makes this observation more critical: Black people should be really, really scared of being shot to death. A cross-sectional report last year from the British Medical Journal looked at demographics on gun deaths for all ethnicities in the US. Among other trends, it found that on average, people who are black are twice as likely to be shot to death than white people. Murder—by gun or otherwise—is the single leading cause of death among black men between the ages of 15 and 24 in the US. Finally, while white people are about six times as likely to shoot themselves to death as they are to be shot to death by another person, for black people, the opposite is true . That's fucking scary. According to separate data from the CDC , all Americans between the ages of 15 and 34 are more likely to die from homicide—by gun or any other means—than of a more plausible-sounding cause like cancer or heart disease. As a white person, my odds of being shot to death by anyone, including by myself, are close to the average for Americans of any age in any state, meaning they're comparable to a fatal car accident. In fact, according to 2010 data from the National Safety Council, the lifetime odds of an American being killed with a gun are actually slightly greater than the odds of croaking in a car crash. Again, your suggested level of fear may vary, particularly if you're a black male. It should also be noted that according to WISQARS data, women in my age range are much, much less likely to be shot to death than me: the rate is 4 per 100,000 for white women, and 6.8 for black women, compared to my 18.36. (Interestingly, the rates are much lower for Asian men and women, although the sample size for these groups are so small that WISQARS warns me against quoting it.) Anyway, the bottom line is that the appropriate level of fear over dying by gun depends on who you are—and I recommend digging through these numbers to find out how scared you should be. In my case, I've decided I'm a little scared. Final Verdict: How Scared Should I Be of Getting Shot? 3/5: Sweating it Follow Mike Pearl on Twitter .

Medioimages/Photodisc/ Thinkstock       Unlike in the cartoon universe, anvils don't fall from overhead in the real world. We don't expect them. Or bricks, or bullets, or anything but rain and snow. We don't know anyone who has been injured by an anvil falling on them. We have no prior history with the Acme product line. So most of us would likely consider being struck on the head by an anvil a freak accident. An act of God. Bad luck.  Freak accidents and acts of God are generally considered to be unlikely events that we could not have predicted, controlled or prevented. For example, what are your odds of being struck by a falling bullet that was fired straight up into the air? Let's break it down.            What goes up must come down, right? What goes up: A bullet fired from a Kalashnikov rifle leaves the muzzle traveling faster than 1,500 miles (2414 kilometers) per hour. What comes down: If that bullet is shot straight into the air it would be traveling at about 150 miles per hour (241.4 kilometers per hour) as it falls to the ground -- you can thank air resistance for slowing it down -- and would hit the ground, or your head, with the same amount of energy as if you were struck by a brick (or an anvil) falling from about 4 feet (1.2 meters) above you [source: Matthews ]. Bullets falling at 68 mph (109.4 kilometers per hour) easily penetrate the skin, and those that are traveling at least 136 mph (218.9 kilometers per hour) may penetrate bones, as well as cause internal injuries or death [source: Maugh ]. The likelihood you'll suffer an accidental injury from a firearm discharge in your lifetime? Just shy of 1 out of 6,000 [source: National Center for Health Statistics ].  Dodging bullets shouldn't be your only concern, though. Circumstances such as being struck by lightning (your odds are about 1 in 10,000 in a lifetime), being struck by a meteorite (those lifetime odds are about 1 in 700,000) and being injured by a vending machine (you may be surprised, but vending machines get about two or three of us every year) are also examples of freak accidents, as are events such as Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters [sources: NOAA , Plait ]. Do you know your odds of being injured or killed at an amusement park? We do, and we'll roll out the numbers next, along with how the pros calculate those odds.          1  2  3  4  NEXT       Print |  Citation & Date | Reprint      Print |  Citation & Date | Reprint                     More to Explore          Related Content          " "       Top 10 Heart Attack Symptoms That Should Have You Calling 911            " "       20 Diseases You've Probably Never Heard Of            " "       Identifying Fibromyalgia                 Related Articles        " "       Accident-proof Your Home: A Checklist          " "       5 Worst Places to Be in a Thunderstorm          " "       10 Potential Death Traps Lurking in Your Home            Recommended                           Advertise With Us      About  Podcasts  Privacy  Ad Choices  Terms    Store  Careers  Contact Us  Help  Reprints    Copyright © 2018 HowStuffWorks , a division of InfoSpace Holdings LLC, a System1 Company     Newsletter Get the best of HowStuffWorks by email.

This Interesting Chart Puts It in Perspective    Feb 15, 2013 6:15 pm        129  Follow       Jason Howerton        Share  Tweet       It’s clear that the gun control debate is here to stay for the time being. That being the case, it’s important that we really examine all the facts surrounding gun violence.  So just how likely are you to be killed by a gun in the United States? The Economist has put together an interesting graphic that demonstrates your chances of getting killed by an array of things, including guns, heart disease, fire and more.  According to the Economist’s chart, your chances of dying as a result of “assault by firearm” is about 1 in 25,000. Americans also have a 1 in 514,147 chance of being killed by “firearms discharge. While still considered one of the leading causes of death in the U.S., the data certainly is at odds with the mainstream media narrative that all guns are simply mass killing machines.  The data from America’s National Safety Council suggests you are more likely to die from “intentional self harm,” an accidental injury or heart disease.  You are more likely to be killed by a gun than “walking,” choking or falling down the stairs. You are least likely to be killed by an asteroid impact (74,817,414 to 1), fireworks (50,729,141 to 1) or a bee sting (25,364,571 to 1).  Check out the graphic below (Click chart to see more):  (The Economist)  Now, we also know that twice as many people are killed by “hands and feet” than semi-automatic rifles, which President Barack Obama and Democrats are looking to ban. There are also nearly five times more murders by knife than murders by so-called “assault weapons.”  This graph puts it in perspective, and calls into question how effective an “assault weapons” ban would actually be.

We've got the odds    Share    Tweet    Pin    Share    Tumble            Combined comments & shares on social media          You hear people throwing out random facts all the time, preaching them as truth. You know what we're talking about. We're willing to bet you've heard, "You're more likely to die driving to work than to be eaten by a shark," like a million times.  But it got us wondering: How many of these statistical musings are actually true? So we did a little research to get the real lowdown on the odds.  More:  I'm applying to be one of the first people on Mars  Just note you that a number of factors affect the real odds of something, especially your specific behavior. Someone who surfs everyday has a greater likelihood of being attacked by a shark than someone who never goes into the water, for instance. That being said, we rounded up some interesting general stats.  1. Odds of being diagnosed with cancer — 1 in 2 for men, 1 in 3 for women  A 50 percent chance of getting cancer in your lifetime is pretty alarming, but don't freak out just yet.  " The numbers reflect a few things : First, people are living longer, and advancing age is a significant risk factor for cancer," Len Lichtenfeld, M.D., deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, told Men's Health . "Also, we’re diagnosing cancer at greater rates because of technological advances in screening, such as mammography for breast cancer and PSA tests for prostate cancer."  Dr. Lichtenfeld also pointed out that cancer deaths have actually declined 20 percent since the early 1990s.  2. Odds of being a victim of a serious crime — 1 in 47 for men, 1 in 52 for women  According to crimeinamerica.net's 2016 statistics, men are more likely than women to be victims of serious crime (serious crimes include things like murder, assault, robbery and rape).  Obviously there's all kinds of factors that contribute to your own personal risk of being victimized. Check out this handy dandy little assessment to rate yours.  3. Odds of being called to “Come on down!” on The Price is Right — 1 in 36  1 in 36? Not too shabby. Given the stats on becoming a billionaire or winning the lotto, which we cover later, this is pretty good news.  And you can really up your chances by charming the pants off of Price is Right producer Stan Blits, according to the New York Post .  4. Odds of being audited by the IRS — 1 in 100  This number seems super high, but don't panic. This factors in all tax returns filed — including those filed by billionaires and huge corporations. But if you are earning a middle-class income, you don't have a whole lot to worry about.  "If you earn less than $200,000 annually and don’t attach Schedules C or E to your tax return, statistically speaking, you have a better chance of being abducted by aliens or dating Taylor Swift than being audited," says Forbes .  5. Odds of being involved in a drunk driving crash — 2 out of 3  Two out of three people will be involved in a drunk driving accident in their lifetime, according to MADD. Lower your risk by always designating a driver.  6. Odds of being born with 11 fingers or toes — 1 in 500  This means that if you follow 1,000 people on Twitter, one or two of them were probably born with an extra appendage — which is medically known as polydactyly , according to MedicineNet .  7. Odds of dying from firearm assault — 1 in 358  Your odds of being shot and killed in your lifetime are 1 in 358 , according to the National Safety Council.  8. Odds of dying in a car accident — 1 in 113  These odds , provided by the National Safety Council, are pretty scary. If you text while driving, you increase you chances by six times — the same as driving after four beers.  9. Odds of winning an Oscar — 1 in 11,500  Keep in mind, though, your odds are zero if you don't try. However, the odds of becoming a movie star are 1 in 1,505,000 , according to U.S. News . Not exactly encouraging.  10. Odds of finding a pearl in an oyster — 1 in 12,000  Given how hard it is to shuck an oyster, we hardly think it’s worth it.  11. Odds of being drafted by the NBA — 1 in 6,864,000  Don't mean to put a damper on your dreams, but yikes. Statistics presented by thesportdigest.com are pretty bleak .  12. Odds of going blind after laser eye surgery — 1 in 5 million  According to London Vision Clinic, if you choose a good surgeon your chances of going blind are extremely slim .  13. Odds of being injured by a toilet — 1 in 10,000  Kind of surprised that this stat (provided by London Vision Clinic) is so high. Be careful out there, people.  14. Odds of dying in an airplane crash — 1 in 9,737  Not too bad as compared to cars... or motorcycles, on which you have a 1 in 948 chance of dying, according to the National Safety Council.  15. Odds of getting killed by fireworks — 1 in 340,733  Odds by being killed by fireworks aren't super high, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History, but it does happen. And, as you can imagine, most of those deaths occur on the Fourth of July.  16. Odds of being struck and killed by lightening — 1 in 174,426  It's true, there's not a whole lot of people that get struck by lightening, according to the National Safety Council — but it does happen. Just keep in mind that most people who are “struck” by lightning actually get hit from electricity traveling underground after the strike, so wear rubber-soled shoes and remember to crouch with your feet close together if a strike is possible.  17. Odds of becoming a billionaire — Pretty much none  Forbes says there's now 1,426 billionaires out there running amok , and roughly 7 billion people on the planet. You do the math.  18. Odds of becoming President of the U.S. — 1 in 10 million  And, yet, somehow Donald Trump beat the odds .  19. Odds of getting attacked by a shark — 1 in 11.5 million  Shark attacks get all kinds of media attention, but turns out they hardly ever happen , according to the University of Florida's 2010 International Shark Attack File, via Seeker . You're actually much more likely to die as a result of coming into contact with hornets, wasps or bees (1 in 64,706) than even being bitten by a shark, according to the National Safety Council.  20. Odds of winning $1 million in the McDonald’s Monopoly game — 1 in 513,591,720  Um, yeah, according to research done by StarPulse , you're gonna have to eat a whole lotta Mickey D's to win that money.  21. Odds of winning the Powerball jackpot — 1 in 175,223,510  Image: Giphy At least you can still be president, right?  More:  20 Interesting sex facts  Before you go, check out our slideshow below.

Nearly 13,000 people in the US were murdered with firearms in 2015. Gun violence is a leading cause of death in the US, according to the CDC. But research is bootstrapped because of federal funding restrictions passed by Congress. AR-15 rifle that he purchased legally It was the deadliest school shooting in Florida history. The suspected gunman, Nikolas Cruz, had reportedly been known as a threat to the school, and teachers have bemoaned how they were powerless to stop him. Cruz's victims join a growing number of people in the US intentionally killed at the end of a gun. Below is how the lifetime odds of dying from gun violence (highlighted in red; suicides and accidents excluded) stack up against many causes of death for Americans: Skye Gould/Business Insider Assaults by firearm kill about 13,000 people in the US each year, which translates to a roughly 1-in-315 lifetime chance of death from gun violence. That's about 56% more likely than the lifetime risk of dying while riding inside a car, truck, or van. It's also more than 11 times as high as dying from any force of nature, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, flood, or lightning strike. These measures also suggest Americans are more likely to die from gun violence than the combined risks of drowning, fire and smoke, stabbing, choking on food, airplane crashes, animal attacks, and natural disasters. Where the data comes from Parents wait for news after a report of a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Wednesday, February 14, 2018. Associated Press/Joel Auerbach The chart above does not account for a person's specific behaviors, age, sex, location, or other factors that could shift the results; it's an average of the entire US population. But it clearly shows that gun violence in the US is a leading cause of death, which is how the CDC describes firearm homicides in its National Vital Statistics Reports. Most of the data comes from an October 2017 report by the National Safety Council and a November 2017 report by the National Center for Health Statistics on causes of death in the US, primarily those that occurred in 2015. (The NSC report uses 2014 data wherever newer data was unavailable.) Mass shootings aren't part of the data sets above, but the Gun Violence Archive project keeps a sourced tally , which we've independently counted. The organization considers any event where four or more victims were injured (regardless of death) to be a mass shooting. In 2015, some 333 mass shootings left 367 people dead and 1,328 injured. The statistics rose in 2016 to 383 mass shootings, 456 deaths, and 1,537 injuries. In 2017, there were 346 mass shootings that led to 437 deaths and 1,802 injuries. Foreign-born terrorism data comes from Cato Institute terrorism data , and some natural-disaster data comes from Tulane University . We calculated the lifetime odds of death by applying 2015 life expectancy and population numbers in the US, and our analysis assumes each cause of death won't change drastically in the near future. (Mortality data from previous years suggests these rankings are relatively consistent, with the exception of skyrocketing accidental poisonings due to the opioid epidemic. ) You can view our full dataset and sourcing here . A dearth of US gun-violence research Although gun violence is one of the leading causes of death in America, it is also one of the most poorly researched, according to a January 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. "In relation to mortality rates, gun violence research was the least-researched cause of death and the second-least-funded cause of death after falls," the study's authors wrote. The study ascribed this dearth of research to restrictions — namely a 21-year-old congressional appropriations bill called the Dickey Amendment that stipulated "none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control." Research into gun violence is the most poorly funded relative to other causes of death. Dr. David E. Stark, Dr. Nigam H. Shah/JAMA This and other federal funding restrictions are still active, hindering many scientists from understanding the problem. "The fundamental, foundational work of documenting the full scale of the health consequences of firearms has not been done," Sandro Galea, an epidemiologist and the dean of the Boston University School of Public Health, told Mother Jones in a January 2017 story . "It's the kind of project that we do all the time. It just hasn't been done with firearms because there haven't been resources." But what questions have been researched by private institutions like the Harvard Injury Control Research Center show a clear connection between gun ownership, gun availability, homicides, and violent death. A roundup of gun-control and gun-violence studies by German Lopez at Vox shows Americans represent less than 5% of the world population but possess nearly 50% of the world's civilian-owned guns, police are about three times more likely to be killed in states with high gun ownership, countries with more guns see more gun deaths , and states with tighter gun control laws see fewer gun-related deaths . This story was updated with the latest final data from CDC, which covers the year 2015. We previously stated that about 11,000 people in the US are killed during firearm assaults; that was a 2014 statistic. In 2015, nearly 13,000 people in the US were killed during firearm assaults.

Shutterstock A gunman in Las Vegas killed dozens and injured hundreds at a country music festival on Sunday. Some 11,000 people in the US are killed in firearm assaults each year. Gun violence is a leading cause of death in America, but research on the problem is bootstrapped due to federal funding restrictions passed by Congress. A gunman fired on a Las Vegas country music festival on Sunday evening, killing at least 59 and injuring more than 525 people. Police identified the shooter as Stephen Paddock , a 64-year-old man from Nevada. Members of the SWAT team who raided Paddock's room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino said they believe he took his own life. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department's sheriff also said officers found 23 guns in his room, including what appeared to be at least one modified automatic weapon . Nineteen additional guns were later found in his home, police said. The motive is not yet known for the attack, though the FBI on Monday contradicted ISIS's claim that it was responsible for the massacre, saying Paddock appeared to have "no connection with an international terrorist group." Whatever spurred the event, it is now the deadliest mass shooting in US history — and Paddock's victims join a growing number of people in the US that were intentionally killed at the end of a gun.

How Scared Should I Be of Getting Shot? The raw numbers for gun deaths in the US are terrifying. SHARE TWEET Mike Pearl Oct 19 2015, 4:00am Photo via Wikimedia Commons user Mikhail Evstafiev  As someone who regularly finds himself immersed in terrifying news stories about shooting sprees , I sometimes feel like I'm living in a war zone. Moments of everyday chaos—commotion in a movie theater, or a weird clatter in the furthest corner of my office—have become scarier lately. They don't make me lunge for the nearest exit quite yet, but the phrase "active shooter scenario" does briefly bubble up from the depths of my imagination. Just now, as I was writing this paragraph, I got a push notification on my phone about a "Doc Shot in LA's Boyle Heights," and my first assumption was that a nearby doctor was murdered. It turned out to be an ad for a documentary. So as a sane American person, and non-gun owner, how scared should I really be of meeting my maker at the wrong end of a gun barrel? The first place to look if you want to be scared is at data on the number of mass shootings in the United States. For this, I turned to Mass Shooting Tracker , which counts the number of incidents in the US in which four or more people were shot in one setting (the FBI, by contrast, only keeps statistics on mass murders.) According to a downloadable spreadsheet available via the Mass Shooting Tracker site , the number just hit 300 for 2015 on October 10, when someone opened fire at a party in Charlotte, North Carolina. There have now been more than 1,000 mass shootings in the US since 2013. It's hard to make that number mean something, but I can try: If every mass shooting since 2013 happened in an Olive Garden, there could have been a mass shooting in every Olive Garden in America by now —actually we would have hit that mark back in 2014. At last count there have been 1,236 fatalities in all of the shootings since 2013; by comparison, 1,215 coalition soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since 2011 . Scarier still is the fact that those numbers don't take into account all the people who have been shot in incidents that didn't qualify as mass shootings. After all, being gunned down by a mugger is no less scary a thought than being done in by a spree killer, and as Rachel M. Cohen recently wrote here at VICE , mass shootings aren't a very complete picture of gun violence in the United States. In fact, according to some number crunching by Mayors Against Illegal Guns , less than 1 percent of all victims of homicide in 2010 were killed in mass shootings. According to Ted Alcorn, research director at the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety , because of the lack of data on gun injuries in the US, counting the number of gun deaths is actually the best way to measure the scariness of these weapons. "There's no census-style database for injuries," Alcorn said, so groups like his "have less ability to quantify them." The raw numbers for gun deaths in the US are even more alarming. In 2013, the most recent year for which government data is available, 33,636 people were killed by guns—roughly 92 people each day and about twice the number of Japanese soldiers killed in the monthlong bloodbath that was the Battle of Iwo Jima . To get a better sense of what that means, we have to look at the rate, rather than just the raw numbers: In 2013, the rate of gun deaths was 10.6, which means that 10.6 people out of every 100,000 in the US died by firearm that year. But even though these numbers are scarily high, they are absolutely dwarfed by the number of people killed by their own weak hearts each year: 610,000 , or about one in every four deaths. So should I be more scared of heart disease than guns? No, because heart disease tends to kill people when they are old, and death is inevitable. That may sound grim, but public health officials look at it the same way. "Things that affect young people have a disproportionate impact on the wellbeing of the population as a whole, and gun violence is among them," Alcorn explained, adding, "so are automotive injuries." The car crash comparison turned out to be important. An April report from the Violence Policy Center, a gun control advocacy group, pointed out that due to increased automotive safety—and increased gun violence—the numbers of deaths by car and by gun are now comparable: In 2013, 35,612 people died in auto accidents; 33,636 died by firearm.  Expressed as a rate, the average person's risk from gun homicides and car crashes is almost the same—about 10.3 per 100,000, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety . In other words, if you're an American, you should be approximately as scared of being shot to death as you are of dying in a car crash. That's a dramatic oversimplification, because unlike most car accidents, people generally choose who they shoot—or at least try to. "It's all very different depending on your circumstances," said David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health. How scared someone should be of gun death, he explained, depends "on who you want to talk to—who's of interest." Once you've determined that, Hemenway said, then you can "give what their likelihood is." To figure out these likelihoods, we turned to the CDC database known as WISQARS , or "Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System," which houses these statistics. With WISQARS, you can choose what kind of people are, as Hemenway put it, "of interest," and look up their demographics to see how their chances of dying from a gun compare to the average. So I chose to look at myself: a 31-year-old white guy. According to WISQARS, I'm at a little bit higher risk than most Americans, with a gun death rate of 18.36, compared to the national age-adjusted average of 10.3. Still, in my state (California), the overall age-adjusted rate is a little lower than average at 7.68, which is nice. If I lived in a state with higher rates of gun death, like say, Louisiana, the rate of risk for my demographic would go up to 19 deaths for every 100,000 30-something white dudes. Graphic via CDC But it turns out that, because of my age, my risk for gun death is among the lowest it will be in my lifetime. I was at a slightly higher risk when I was in my early 20s: Graphic via Centers for Disease Control In a couple of years, the odds that I will die from a gun shot go will go up again, and will keep going up all the way into my old age. That's largely because these numbers include gun suicides, and the suicide risk among men—particularly white men— increases with age . According to data from the Pew Research Center , American men age 65 and older die by suicide with guns at a rate of 10.6 per 100,000 people. Eventually, if I reach 85 or older, the rate will reach an eye-popping 41.85 per 100,000, according to WISQARS. Read: Meet the South Central LA School Counselor Who Helps Students Combat PTSD From Gang Violence Of course, one of my white privileges is that I am much less likely to be killed by a gun. A black guy my age is almost four times as likely to die this way than I am, with a rate of 70 deaths for every 100,000 people. A close look at how scared I should be of gun death only makes this observation more critical: Black people should be really, really scared of being shot to death. A cross-sectional report last year from the British Medical Journal looked at demographics on gun deaths for all ethnicities in the US. Among other trends, it found that on average, people who are black are twice as likely to be shot to death than white people. Murder—by gun or otherwise—is the single leading cause of death among black men between the ages of 15 and 24 in the US. Finally, while white people are about six times as likely to shoot themselves to death as they are to be shot to death by another person, for black people, the opposite is true . That's fucking scary. According to separate data from the CDC , all Americans between the ages of 15 and 34 are more likely to die from homicide—by gun or any other means—than of a more plausible-sounding cause like cancer or heart disease. As a white person, my odds of being shot to death by anyone, including by myself, are close to the average for Americans of any age in any state, meaning they're comparable to a fatal car accident. In fact, according to 2010 data from the National Safety Council, the lifetime odds of an American being killed with a gun are actually slightly greater than the odds of croaking in a car crash. Again, your suggested level of fear may vary, particularly if you're a black male. It should also be noted that according to WISQARS data, women in my age range are much, much less likely to be shot to death than me: the rate is 4 per 100,000 for white women, and 6.8 for black women, compared to my 18.36. (Interestingly, the rates are much lower for Asian men and women, although the sample size for these groups are so small that WISQARS warns me against quoting it.) Anyway, the bottom line is that the appropriate level of fear over dying by gun depends on who you are—and I recommend digging through these numbers to find out how scared you should be. In my case, I've decided I'm a little scared. Final Verdict: How Scared Should I Be of Getting Shot? 3/5: Sweating it Follow Mike Pearl on Twitter .

Medioimages/Photodisc/ Thinkstock       Unlike in the cartoon universe, anvils don't fall from overhead in the real world. We don't expect them. Or bricks, or bullets, or anything but rain and snow. We don't know anyone who has been injured by an anvil falling on them. We have no prior history with the Acme product line. So most of us would likely consider being struck on the head by an anvil a freak accident. An act of God. Bad luck.  Freak accidents and acts of God are generally considered to be unlikely events that we could not have predicted, controlled or prevented. For example, what are your odds of being struck by a falling bullet that was fired straight up into the air? Let's break it down.            What goes up must come down, right? What goes up: A bullet fired from a Kalashnikov rifle leaves the muzzle traveling faster than 1,500 miles (2414 kilometers) per hour. What comes down: If that bullet is shot straight into the air it would be traveling at about 150 miles per hour (241.4 kilometers per hour) as it falls to the ground -- you can thank air resistance for slowing it down -- and would hit the ground, or your head, with the same amount of energy as if you were struck by a brick (or an anvil) falling from about 4 feet (1.2 meters) above you [source: Matthews ]. Bullets falling at 68 mph (109.4 kilometers per hour) easily penetrate the skin, and those that are traveling at least 136 mph (218.9 kilometers per hour) may penetrate bones, as well as cause internal injuries or death [source: Maugh ]. The likelihood you'll suffer an accidental injury from a firearm discharge in your lifetime? Just shy of 1 out of 6,000 [source: National Center for Health Statistics ].  Dodging bullets shouldn't be your only concern, though. Circumstances such as being struck by lightning (your odds are about 1 in 10,000 in a lifetime), being struck by a meteorite (those lifetime odds are about 1 in 700,000) and being injured by a vending machine (you may be surprised, but vending machines get about two or three of us every year) are also examples of freak accidents, as are events such as Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters [sources: NOAA , Plait ]. Do you know your odds of being injured or killed at an amusement park? We do, and we'll roll out the numbers next, along with how the pros calculate those odds.          1  2  3  4  NEXT       Print |  Citation & Date | Reprint      Print |  Citation & Date | Reprint                     More to Explore          Related Content          " "       Top 10 Heart Attack Symptoms That Should Have You Calling 911            " "       20 Diseases You've Probably Never Heard Of            " "       Identifying Fibromyalgia                 Related Articles        " "       Accident-proof Your Home: A Checklist          " "       5 Worst Places to Be in a Thunderstorm          " "       10 Potential Death Traps Lurking in Your Home            Recommended                           Advertise With Us      About  Podcasts  Privacy  Ad Choices  Terms    Store  Careers  Contact Us  Help  Reprints    Copyright © 2018 HowStuffWorks , a division of InfoSpace Holdings LLC, a System1 Company     Newsletter Get the best of HowStuffWorks by email.

This Interesting Chart Puts It in Perspective    Feb 15, 2013 6:15 pm        129  Follow       Jason Howerton        Share  Tweet       It’s clear that the gun control debate is here to stay for the time being. That being the case, it’s important that we really examine all the facts surrounding gun violence.  So just how likely are you to be killed by a gun in the United States? The Economist has put together an interesting graphic that demonstrates your chances of getting killed by an array of things, including guns, heart disease, fire and more.  According to the Economist’s chart, your chances of dying as a result of “assault by firearm” is about 1 in 25,000. Americans also have a 1 in 514,147 chance of being killed by “firearms discharge. While still considered one of the leading causes of death in the U.S., the data certainly is at odds with the mainstream media narrative that all guns are simply mass killing machines.  The data from America’s National Safety Council suggests you are more likely to die from “intentional self harm,” an accidental injury or heart disease.  You are more likely to be killed by a gun than “walking,” choking or falling down the stairs. You are least likely to be killed by an asteroid impact (74,817,414 to 1), fireworks (50,729,141 to 1) or a bee sting (25,364,571 to 1).  Check out the graphic below (Click chart to see more):  (The Economist)  Now, we also know that twice as many people are killed by “hands and feet” than semi-automatic rifles, which President Barack Obama and Democrats are looking to ban. There are also nearly five times more murders by knife than murders by so-called “assault weapons.”  This graph puts it in perspective, and calls into question how effective an “assault weapons” ban would actually be.

We've got the odds    Share    Tweet    Pin    Share    Tumble            Combined comments & shares on social media          You hear people throwing out random facts all the time, preaching them as truth. You know what we're talking about. We're willing to bet you've heard, "You're more likely to die driving to work than to be eaten by a shark," like a million times.  But it got us wondering: How many of these statistical musings are actually true? So we did a little research to get the real lowdown on the odds.  More:  I'm applying to be one of the first people on Mars  Just note you that a number of factors affect the real odds of something, especially your specific behavior. Someone who surfs everyday has a greater likelihood of being attacked by a shark than someone who never goes into the water, for instance. That being said, we rounded up some interesting general stats.  1. Odds of being diagnosed with cancer — 1 in 2 for men, 1 in 3 for women  A 50 percent chance of getting cancer in your lifetime is pretty alarming, but don't freak out just yet.  " The numbers reflect a few things : First, people are living longer, and advancing age is a significant risk factor for cancer," Len Lichtenfeld, M.D., deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, told Men's Health . "Also, we’re diagnosing cancer at greater rates because of technological advances in screening, such as mammography for breast cancer and PSA tests for prostate cancer."  Dr. Lichtenfeld also pointed out that cancer deaths have actually declined 20 percent since the early 1990s.  2. Odds of being a victim of a serious crime — 1 in 47 for men, 1 in 52 for women  According to crimeinamerica.net's 2016 statistics, men are more likely than women to be victims of serious crime (serious crimes include things like murder, assault, robbery and rape).  Obviously there's all kinds of factors that contribute to your own personal risk of being victimized. Check out this handy dandy little assessment to rate yours.  3. Odds of being called to “Come on down!” on The Price is Right — 1 in 36  1 in 36? Not too shabby. Given the stats on becoming a billionaire or winning the lotto, which we cover later, this is pretty good news.  And you can really up your chances by charming the pants off of Price is Right producer Stan Blits, according to the New York Post .  4. Odds of being audited by the IRS — 1 in 100  This number seems super high, but don't panic. This factors in all tax returns filed — including those filed by billionaires and huge corporations. But if you are earning a middle-class income, you don't have a whole lot to worry about.  "If you earn less than $200,000 annually and don’t attach Schedules C or E to your tax return, statistically speaking, you have a better chance of being abducted by aliens or dating Taylor Swift than being audited," says Forbes .  5. Odds of being involved in a drunk driving crash — 2 out of 3  Two out of three people will be involved in a drunk driving accident in their lifetime, according to MADD. Lower your risk by always designating a driver.  6. Odds of being born with 11 fingers or toes — 1 in 500  This means that if you follow 1,000 people on Twitter, one or two of them were probably born with an extra appendage — which is medically known as polydactyly , according to MedicineNet .  7. Odds of dying from firearm assault — 1 in 358  Your odds of being shot and killed in your lifetime are 1 in 358 , according to the National Safety Council.  8. Odds of dying in a car accident — 1 in 113  These odds , provided by the National Safety Council, are pretty scary. If you text while driving, you increase you chances by six times — the same as driving after four beers.  9. Odds of winning an Oscar — 1 in 11,500  Keep in mind, though, your odds are zero if you don't try. However, the odds of becoming a movie star are 1 in 1,505,000 , according to U.S. News . Not exactly encouraging.  10. Odds of finding a pearl in an oyster — 1 in 12,000  Given how hard it is to shuck an oyster, we hardly think it’s worth it.  11. Odds of being drafted by the NBA — 1 in 6,864,000  Don't mean to put a damper on your dreams, but yikes. Statistics presented by thesportdigest.com are pretty bleak .  12. Odds of going blind after laser eye surgery — 1 in 5 million  According to London Vision Clinic, if you choose a good surgeon your chances of going blind are extremely slim .  13. Odds of being injured by a toilet — 1 in 10,000  Kind of surprised that this stat (provided by London Vision Clinic) is so high. Be careful out there, people.  14. Odds of dying in an airplane crash — 1 in 9,737  Not too bad as compared to cars... or motorcycles, on which you have a 1 in 948 chance of dying, according to the National Safety Council.  15. Odds of getting killed by fireworks — 1 in 340,733  Odds by being killed by fireworks aren't super high, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History, but it does happen. And, as you can imagine, most of those deaths occur on the Fourth of July.  16. Odds of being struck and killed by lightening — 1 in 174,426  It's true, there's not a whole lot of people that get struck by lightening, according to the National Safety Council — but it does happen. Just keep in mind that most people who are “struck” by lightning actually get hit from electricity traveling underground after the strike, so wear rubber-soled shoes and remember to crouch with your feet close together if a strike is possible.  17. Odds of becoming a billionaire — Pretty much none  Forbes says there's now 1,426 billionaires out there running amok , and roughly 7 billion people on the planet. You do the math.  18. Odds of becoming President of the U.S. — 1 in 10 million  And, yet, somehow Donald Trump beat the odds .  19. Odds of getting attacked by a shark — 1 in 11.5 million  Shark attacks get all kinds of media attention, but turns out they hardly ever happen , according to the University of Florida's 2010 International Shark Attack File, via Seeker . You're actually much more likely to die as a result of coming into contact with hornets, wasps or bees (1 in 64,706) than even being bitten by a shark, according to the National Safety Council.  20. Odds of winning $1 million in the McDonald’s Monopoly game — 1 in 513,591,720  Um, yeah, according to research done by StarPulse , you're gonna have to eat a whole lotta Mickey D's to win that money.  21. Odds of winning the Powerball jackpot — 1 in 175,223,510  Image: Giphy At least you can still be president, right?  More:  20 Interesting sex facts  Before you go, check out our slideshow below.
