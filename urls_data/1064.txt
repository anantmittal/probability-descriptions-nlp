On a player’s turn, he or she begins by rolling five dice. After this roll, a player may decide to reroll any number of dice. At most, there are a total of three rolls for each turn. Following these three rolls, the result of the dice is entered onto a score sheet. This score sheet contains different categories, such as a full house or large straight .         Each of the categories is satisfied with different combinations of dice. The most difficult category to fill-in is that of a Yahtzee. A Yahtzee occurs when a player rolls five of the same number. Just how unlikely is a Yahtzee? This is a problem that is much more complicated than finding probabilities for two or even three dice . The main reason for this is that there are a number of ways to obtain five matching dice during three rolls. We can calculate the probability of rolling a Yahtzee by using the combinatorics formula for combinations, and by breaking the problem into several mutually exclusive cases. One Roll The easiest case to consider is obtaining a Yahtzee immediately on the first roll. We will first look at the probability of rolling a particular Yahtzee of five twos, and then easily extend this to the probability of any Yahtzee. The probability of rolling a two is 1/6, and the outcome of each die is independent of the rest.   Thus the probability of rolling five twos is (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/7776. The probability of rolling five of a kind of any other number is also 1/7776. Since there are a total of six different numbers on a die, we multiply the above probability by 6. This means that the probability of a Yahtzee on the first roll is 6 x 1/7776 = 1/1296 = 0.08%.         Two Rolls If we roll anything other than five of a kind of the first roll, we will have to reroll some of our dice to try to get a Yahtzee. Suppose that our first roll has four of a kind, we reroll the one die that doesn’t match and then get a Yahtzee on this second roll. The probability of rolling a total of five twos in this way is found as follows: On the first roll, we have four twos. Since there is a probability 1/6 of rolling a two, and 5/6 of not rolling a two, we multiply (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (5/6) = 5/7776. Any of the five dice rolled could be the non-two. We use our combination formula for C(5, 1) = 5 to count how many ways we can roll four twos and something that is not a two. We multiply and see that the probability of rolling exactly four twos on the first roll is 25/7776. On the second roll, we need to calculate the probability of rolling one two. This is 1/6. Thus the probability of rolling a Yahtzee of twos in the above way is (25/7776) x (1/6) = 25/46656. To find the probability of rolling any Yahtzee in this way is found by multiplying the above probability by 6 because there are six different numbers on a die. This gives a probability of 6 x 25/46656 = 0.32% But this is not the only way to roll a Yahtzee with two rolls.  All of the following probabilities are found in much the same way as above: We could roll three of a kind, and then two dice that match on our second roll. The probability of this is 6 x C(5 ,3) x (25/7776) x (1/36) = 0.54%. We could roll a matching pair, and on our second roll three dice that match. The probability of this is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x (1/216) = 0.36 % We could roll five different dice, save one die from our first roll, then roll four dice that match on the second roll. The probability of this is (6!/7776) x (1/1296) = 0.01%. The above cases are mutually exclusive. This means that to calculate the probability of rolling a Yahtzee in two rolls, we add the above probabilities together and we have is approximately 1.23%. Three Rolls For the most complicated situation yet, we will now examine the case where we use all three of our rolls to obtain a Yahtzee.  We could do this in several different ways and must account for all of them. The probabilities these possibilities are calculated below: The probability of rolling four of a kind, then nothing, then matching the last die on the last roll is 6 x C(5, 4) x (5/7776) x (5/6) x (1/6) = 0.27%. The probability of rolling three of a kind, then nothing, then matching with the correct pair on the last roll is 6 x C(5, 3) x (25/7776) x (25/36) x (1/36) = 0.37%. The probability of rolling a matching pair, then nothing, then matching with the correct three of a kind on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x (125/216) x (1/216) = 0.21%. The probability of rolling a single die, then nothing matching this, then matching with the correct four of a kind on the third roll is (6!/7776) x (625/1296) x (1/1296) = 0.003% The probability of rolling three of a kind, matching an additional die on the next roll, followed by matching the fifth die on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 3) x (25/7776) x C(2, 1) x (5/36) x (1/6) = 0.89%. The probability of rolling a pair, matching an additional pair on the next roll, followed by matching the fifth die on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x C(3, 2) x (5/216) x (1/6) = 0.89%. The probability of rolling a pair, matching an additional die on the next roll, followed by matching the last two dice on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x C(3, 1) x (25/216) x (1/36) = 0.74%. The probability of rolling one of a kind, another die to match it on the second roll, and then a three of a kind on the third roll is (6!/7776) x C(4, 1) x (100/1296) x (1/216) = 0.01%.  The probability of rolling one of a kind, a three of a kind to match on the second roll, followed by a match on the third roll is (6!/7776) x C(4, 3) x (5/1296) x (1/6) = 0.02%. The probability of rolling one of a kind, a pair to match it on the second roll, and then another pair to match on the third roll is (6!/7776) x C(4, 2) x (25/1296) x (1/36) = 0.03%. We add all of the above probabilities together to determine the probability of rolling a Yahtzee in three rolls of the dice. This probability is 3.43%. Total Probability The probability of a Yahtzee in one roll is 0.08%, the probability of a Yahtzee in two rolls is 1.23% and the probability of a Yahtzee in three rolls is 3.43%. Since each of these are mutually exclusive, we add the probabilities together. This means that the probability of obtaining a Yahtzee in a given turn is approximately 4.74%. To put this into perspective, since 1/21 is approximately 4.74%, by chance alone a player should expect a Yahtzee once every 21 turns. In practice, it may take longer as an initial pair may be discarded in order to roll for something else, such as a straight.                                           cite cite this article          Format  mla  apa  chicago  Your Citation   Taylor, Courtney.

Home > Mathematics > A Truth Universally Acknowledged        No Dice - The Probability Of Yahtzee*  By Becky Jungbauer | May 28th 2010 08:38 PM | Print | E-mail         Tweet       Becky Jungbauer       While going through old boxes of miscellaneous detritus, I came upon several sheets of paper from my health journalism grad school days. The scribes packed a lot of wisdom into those articles and bullet points, and I'll share various nuggets of knowledge in upcoming articles. 1 One of the articles talked about framing scientific information to make it relevant to different audiences, and for some odd reason I thought of my dad and Yahtzee. My dad is crazy brilliant. It's ridiculous how smart this man is. Yet every time I came home from break in college I'd have to re-explain DNA, starting from the beginning. A lot of people have this mental block with anything scientific or mathematic. But if we frame it in a way that is relevant, maybe we can convey complex (or even simple) scientific ideas in a way that will resonate and stick with the audience. Framing organizes central ideas; pares down complex issues by giving some aspects greater emphasis. My paternal grandma played the Penny Game with us bazillion grandchildren growing up to help teach us simple math (and it was a good game to play with a lot of people, and there were a lot of us around). 2 And growing up (and even now) my family played a ton of Yahtzee , which is (for those not in the know) a dice game that requires you to roll five dice each turn and check off various combinations (three of a kind, a straight, etc). 3 Perhaps I could use Yahtzee to teach Dad, a master Yahtzee player, simple statistical concepts. Take probability, for example. Anyone who has taken a stats class had heard the line, "Probability has no memory." This is key - probability is how probable or how likely an event is. To calculate probability, you divide the number of ways an event can occur by the total number of possible outcomes. Since I'm talking about Yahtzee, let's go with dice as an example. A single 6-sided die has, obviously, six sides. So, the probability of rolling a 1 on this 6-sided die is 1 (you can only roll the 1 once) divided by 6 (six total possible sides) = 1/6, or 0.167. Yet this is not additive - if I roll a 1 (my 1 in 6 chance), on the next roll probability starts all over again with a 1 in 6 chance. The probability that I roll a Yahtzee - all five dice are the same number, e.g. all five dice rolled come up as a 1 - in any particular game is about 1 in 22, or a 4.6% chance , although the real probability is likely slightly less. This is why Yahtzees are scored as 50 points, because they're more difficult to roll. 4 But what if I want to pull a Babe Ruth and call my Yahtzee beforehand? Say I roll five dice and I announce that my plan is to get a Yahtzee in ones. 5 For any one die to come up as a 1, there is a 6^1 possibility of getting a one - 6 possible outcomes, 1 outcome I want (6x1 = 6, or a 1 in 6 chance). For any two dice to come up both as 1, there are 6^2 possibilities (6x6 = 36). And so on, up to 6^5 (=7776, or a 1 in 7776 chance). So, the probability of rolling a Yahtzee with ones on my first roll is 1 in 7776. Not good. Anyway, say by some statistical anomaly that I roll four dice that come up as 1 (a 1 in 1296 chance - 6^4, or 6x6x6x6=1296). What is the probability that the fifth die comes up as a 1? Surely fate has a hand in my game, and I'm more likely to roll a 1 since my other four dice are all 1, right? Nope. It's still back to that original 1 in 6 chance. Probability doesn't give a damn that if I score a Yahtzee I can beat my siblings and earn bragging rights until the next game. Anyway, this small example shows that no matter what you roll, the dice you have on the table won't influence the dice in your hand - probability has no memory of what it just rolled. Or, take a descriptive representation of statistics. Say I happen to have a list of every Yahtzee game I've played on my phone (which I do), and I want to know my average (mean) score. I have a total of 231 games saved (n=31). My high score is 522 (not too shabby!) and my low score is a laughingstock-worthy 126. 6 I add all 231 of my scores and (sum=57,647) and divide by the number of games, so 57,647 / 231 = 249.55. A trial of 300 Yahtzee games played on a handheld device (so you can't cheat, sadly) showed the following probabilities of obtaining certain scores: Score At Least     Probability 150                     98% 200                     81% 250                     45% 300                     13% 400                     3% 500                     1% Credit: Chris Young So, the probability of getting my average 249.55 score (let's just round up to 250, shall we? I had a baaaaad run of games there) is slightly higher than 45%. This of course is just something I plucked out of the air, but it shows how you can take something with which a person is familiar - a game of Yahtzee - and use it to illustrate scientific concepts. As I said above, framing pares down complex issues by giving some aspects greater emphasis. In this case, I used Yahtzee to illustrate probability and mean. A comprehensive stats lesson? Not by any stretch. But if I want my listener/reader to understand probability, I don't need to give the full history of the development of statistics, and it's a lot easier to use familiar examples so the reader/listener can imagine the concept. ------------------------------------------------------------------ *As far as I can tell this is the first EVER mention of Yahtzee on Scientific Blogging, which is in itself a travesty. I think this means I get a prize, right, Hank? If I was allowed to pick, I'd want the secret of your fabulous hair. But, as I assume that would require changing my name to Delilah, I'll settle for kudos. ;) 1 Seriously, it's good stuff, both for aspiring writers who have yet to pick up the pen (or keyboard) and those of us who have been doing it a long time. 2 It was also a good way for us grandkids to earn some money, as we were allowed to keep our winnings. Given that we played with pennies it was a pittance but to a kid a dollar is a LOT of money! Thus Grandma instilled in us a love of gambling and swearing in German. 3 The best part of the game was when anyone got a Yahtzee - all five dice were the same number - we would all throw up our arms and yell at the top of our lungs, "YAHTZEEEEEEEEEE!" and pound our fists on the table like drums. That was awesome. Not gonna lie, I still do it. 4 My aunt Margie always said that in Yahtzee, fours are hard to come by. Statistically this is inaccurate. But it's a good catch-phrase. 5 If you really did this in Yahtzee, you'd be hit with incredulous glances on all sides, as well as "WTF are you doing?" exclamations. And for good reason. This is an asinine move. 6 The average score in a game of Yahtzee is about 250, assuming you don't get a Yahtzee. If you get a Yahtzee, the average score is anywhere from 270-320, depending on whether you get the top bonus. Note that this is simply a calculation from the games on my phone - I have scored higher than 522 in my life, and sadly lower than 126.

The object of the game is to roll certain combinations of numbers with five dice.  At each turn you throw dice trying to get a good combination of numbers; different combinations give different scores.  While luck plays a big role in Yahtzee, strategy makes a significant difference. The reason for this is that you score each combination just once, and the number of different combinations in which you can score is equal to the number of turns in the game. This means that you have to make wise choices about when to score in each combination and you have to be careful about what combinations you seek at each turn.  Rules and Scoring  The game takes thirteen turns. Each turn consists of up to three separate rolls of the dice.  On the first roll you roll all five of the dice.  After the first and second roll, you can hold any subset of the five dice you want (including none of the dice or all of the dice) and roll the rest trying to get a good combination.  After the three rolls (or after the first or second roll if you choose to stop) you must find a place among the thirteen boxes in the scorecard to put your score. The score you get depends on the box that you choose and the combination that you have rolled.  After a box is used, you can't use it again, so you have to choose wisely. This means that, in general, you don't have to choose the box that gives you the highest score for the combination you have rolled, since it may be advantageous to save that box for an even better roll later in the game. In fact, there are many situations it which it makes sense to put a 0 in a "bad" box instead of a low score in another "good" box because doing so would block the good box for future turns.  The Yahtzee scorecard contains two sections: the upper section and the lower section.      The Upper Section  In the upper section, there are six boxes, each corresponding to one of the six face values of the dice. For these boxes, you enter the sum of the dice with the corresponding face value (and ignore all other dice). For example, if you roll 5 3 3 5 3 you may enter a score of 9 in the third spot or a score of 10 in the fifth spot.   Bonus: At the end of the game, you get a bonus of 35 points if the total number of points you scored in the upper section is 63 or higher.  The seemingly random number 63 corresponds to having scored a combination with three dice of the corresponding face value in each of the upper section boxes (though any upper section total of 63 or greater is rewarded with the bonus).  The Lower Section  Here you can score for various combinations.   3 of a kind: Score in this box if the dice include 3 or more of the same number. The score is the total of all five dice (unlike the upper section, where only the dice of one number are summed).   4 of a kind: Score in this box if the dice include 4 or more of the same number. The score is the total of all five dice.   Full House: Score in this box if the dice show three of one number and two of another (for example, 2 6 6 2 2). The score is 25 points.   Small Straight: Score in this box if the dice show any sequence of 4 numbers (for example 3 2 4 4 5).  The score is 30 points.   Large Straight: Score in this box if the dice show any sequence of 5 numbers (for example 5 2 4 6 3).  The score is 40 points.   Chance: Score in this box with any combination. The score is the total of the five dice.   Yahtzee: Score in this box if the dice show five of the same number. The score is 50 points.   Yahtzee Bonus: If you roll a second Yahtzee and the Yahtzee box is already filled with 50 points, you get a 100 points bonus. If you roll a Yahtzee and your Yahtzee box is filled with a zero, you do not receive this bonus.  In either case, you must fill one of the other boxes on your scorecard using the "joker rules" as follows:  if possible, you must fill the upper section box corresponding to the number you rolled. If that box is already filled, you must fill in any open lower section box.  For the 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, and chance boxes, this means scoring the total of all 5 dice.  For the full house, small straight, and large straight boxes, this means scoring 25, 30, or 40 points respectively (even though you did not actually roll the corresponding combination).  If the entire lower section is filled you must enter a zero in any open box in the upper section.  Strategy  Now we are going to review a little bit of strategy for playing Yahtzee.  Basic Tips  The following are generally regarded as the basic things to keep in mind while playing Yahtzee.   You should generally aim for the 35 points bonus by filling the upper section with high scores (so as to get at least 63 points) near the beginning of the game.  If you roll a combination for which your available boxes give a low score, fill in a zero in the 1's box (or even the 2's or 3's), since high scores in the other boxes may compensate for this.  Early in the game you should use the chance box only as a fall-back for when you are trying for a high point combination and fail.  You want to keep the chance box available for a situation where your options are very limited.  If you have a bad roll of the dice near the end of the game, you may enter a zero in the Yahtzee box or one of the other difficult combinations.  If you roll a pair of 1's or 2's early in the game, go for a full house, straight, or one of the other high numbers you rolled.  Keeping the 1's or 2's to seek a 3 or 4 of a kind will not get you many points.  Plus, it is a good idea to keep the 1's and 2's boxes available for later in the game to have the possibility of putting a zero there.  As an example, if on your first turn your initial roll is 1 1 2 5 6, it turns out that keeping only the 5 is the choice that maximizes your expected score for the game.  If you roll four of a kind with 4's, 5's, or 6's, take the points in the upper section if they are available, not in the 4 of a kind box. This will help you get the 35 points bonus at the end of the game.  You should always try for a Yahtzee early in the game. If you roll a 3 or 4 of a kind on your first or second roll and you have the corresponding box in the upper section open, you should definitely go for the Yahtzee. Plus, if you saved your chance, 1's, or 2's boxes, you can score a zero there if you fail to get the Yahtzee.   Advanced Strategy  Any kind of advanced strategy for Yahtzee has to rely on calculating or estimating the expected final score you will get with respect to your current position in the game and the different possibilities you have for scoring. This is a very difficult task, since in general it involves too many calculations.  As with most board games, the best way to actually apply this principle is by playing a lot and developing some intuition as to what the best choices are. In general, you should be able to discard many possibilities just by looking at them, and then choose among the remaining ones in the best way you can.  To get a grasp of the kind of calculations you would need to do in order to determine the best move in Yahtzee, we will consider the following simplified example.  Suppose that you are playing a "1-turn Yahtzee" game (all the boxes are empty and you are tying to maximize your score for a single turn), and your second roll leaves you with 3 3 3 1 1.  Which (if any) of the dice should you keep for the last roll?  To solve this, observe first that since this is the 1-turn version of Yahtzee, all boxes are available and your only goal is to get the highest possible score in this turn. It should be clear that the only sensible choices are keeping everything (scoring 25 points for a full house) or re-rolling both 1's (trying for a Yahtzee). What is the best choice?  If you keep everything, the best score you can get is scoring the full house box, and you get 25 points. If you re-roll both 1's, three things may happen:   You get two different numbers. This will happen with probability 5/6. In this case, your best score corresponds to either the 3 or 4 of a kind box, where you add up the five numbers. In this case, the maximum score you can get is 20 (if you rolled a 5 and a 6).  You get two equal numbers, different from 3. This happens with probability (5/6) * (1/6) = 5/36.  In this case you rolled a full house, and it is the best box to score in this case, since any other possibility scores at most 3 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 21 points. Thus, you score 25 points.  You get two 3's. This will happen with probability 1/36, and you score 50 points for a Yahtzee.   With all this, we can say that the average score you get if you re-roll the 1's is less than   Thus, we see that your average score when re-rolling is less than 25, so you should keep all the dice and score a full house. As you observe, even in this very simplified situation, the calculations get impossible to carry out during a game.  Links  You can find more information on Yahtzee's rules, strategies and history on the Internet. For instance, you can try Wikipedia.   You can find an optimal Yahtzee player and proficiency test at here.     Problems   Some of the problems are very easy, but some are more involved, especially the last two. You may want to go over the review of basic probability before trying them.   If you roll a die three times, what is the probability that you will get at least one six?  Suppose that on the first roll you get 5 5 4 3 2. If you pick up one of the fives and try for a large straight, what is the probability you will succeed in the two rolls that remain?  Suppose that on the first roll you get 6 5 5 3 2. If you pick up one of the fives and try for a large straight, what is the probability you will succeed in the two rolls that remain? Is it the same as in the previous problem?  In the top six rows of the score card you want to score at least three of a given number (especially for the high numbers like 5 and 6). Suppose you roll 6, 6, 5, 2, 1 the first time, and re-roll all non 6's on the next two tries. What is the probability you will end up with at least three 6's? Exactly four 6's? A Yahtzee (five 6's)?   Suppose on the first roll you get 5, 4, 4, 3, 1. To try to get a large straight you pick up a 4 and the 1 and then roll again. If you get a 6 or 2 you keep it, and you re-roll the others. Of course if you happen to get a 2 and 1 on the second roll you stop and are happy. What is the probability you will end up with a large straight? What is the probability you will end up with a small straight?  Suppose instead you keep 5, 4, 3, 1, and re-roll 1 die. If you get a 2 you are happy. If you get a 6 you re-roll the 1. Otherwise you take a second chance at rolling the 2. What is the probability you will end up with a large straight? a small straight?  Suppose you are playing a game where you can roll a single die one or two times. Your objective is to get a high number. After the first roll you can choose whether to keep the number you got or re-roll. Then the best strategy is to keep a 4, 5, or 6, while re-rolling a 1, 2, or 3 (try to convince yourself of this). Now suppose we play the same game but with the option of rolling the single die one, two, or three times. As before, after the second roll you should keep a 4, 5, or 6, and re-roll a 1, 2, or 3. Can you come up with a strategy on what to do after the first roll such that the expected (or average) score you get in the three rolls game is better than the expected score in the two rolls game with the strategy we proposed? What is the expected score when playing with your proposed strategy?  These types of calculations are useful in the actual Yahtzee game, for example when you are trying to score well in the chance box.  It is the last roll of the game and you need a Yahtzee to win. After the first roll you keep the dice of the most common number you rolled and then re-roll twice to see if you can end up with all of that number. (We ignore the possibility that you change the number for which you are looking after the first roll, e.g., you only had one 5 after the first roll and then rolled two 4's.)  In the case of a tie on the first roll, choose one of the numbers that appears the maximal number of times and keep only the dice with that number. What is the probability you end up with a Yahtzee?  This problem is rather difficult, so don't expect to get a fast answer.  Here is a hint: first compute the probability of getting 2, 3, 4, or 5 of a kind, or all different numbers in the first roll; then try to compute the probability of passing from having i of a kind in a roll to having j on the next roll and try to use these "transition probabilities".  In reality, if you are going for a Yahtzee and you keep two 4's after you first roll but roll three 5's on your second roll, you will try for a Yahtzee in 5's on your last roll.  Repeat the previous problem, but now incorporating the fact that after your second roll you may change the number that you are seeking.  Once again, if there is a tie, choose one number to keep.  If you get all different numbers on your first roll, re-roll all of the dice.

We’ve been playing it a lot in the evenings. When a Yahtzee is rolled, my kids go wild.  In this blog posting I'm going to look into the probability of rolling a Yahtzee .    Yahtzee is a game played with five six-sided dice.  A player rolls the dice, examines the results and can keep as many of the dice as they like, re-rolling the remainder.  After the second roll, the process is repeated (if desired, the player can pick-up dice held on the first round).  After (up-to) three rolls, the dice are scored according to various categories.  The Yahtzee (scoring 50 points) is achieved by getting all five dice the same.    Assumptions  We’re going to assume the player is a smart player, and at each decision point makes the smartest possible re-roll and hold choices.  The probability of getting a Yahtzee in a single roll is easy to calculate.  There are five dice, so whatever the first die rolls there is a 1/6 chance that the second die is the same number.  If that occurs, there’s a 1/6 chance that the third die is the same, ditto the fourth and the fifth.  So probability of Yahztee in one roll is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/1296 .  With three rolls and holding, however, things get a little more complicated.  The number of dice we roll each turn can be changed, and there are many possible combinations to consider.   Because the state of dice at the start of each roll is independent of how the dice were rolled, this is a perfect chance to roll out one of my favorite tools, the Markov Chain (for more background on this, see my earlier postings on CandyLand , and Chutes and Ladders ).  Combinatronics     Before delving in the Markov Chain, however, it will benefit us to examine the various ways that combinations of dice can be rolled.  This exercise will greatly simplify the creation of the Transition Matrix (trust me on this).  Here we go …      2 dice  This is the trivial case.  There are only two patterns for the way that two dice can be rolled.  They either match, or they do not.  There is a 1/6 chance that the second of the two dice will match the first, and conversely, there is a 5/6 chance that it will not match.  The probabilities, of course, have to add up to 1 (one of the two events must occur).  Another way to look at this is that there are 36 possible combinations for two dice to be rolled.  In six of these combinations {1.1} , {2,2} , {3,3} , {4,4} , {5,5} , {6,6} the numbers are the same, and in 30 of these combinations, the dice are different.   These results are show graphically on the image above.  There is a 6/36 chance that both dice will be the same, represented as {A,A} , and 30/36 chance they will be different, represented as {A,B}  3 dice  This gets a little more complex, but not much.  Here there are three possible flavors of result for the three dice:  They are either all the same, they are all different, or there will be two of one number and one of another. There are 216 possible ways that three dice can be rolled (6 x 6 x 6).  We can calculate the probability of them all being the same, easily, as 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 (The second die matches the first 1 time in 6, and the third die matches, again, 1 time in 6).  Alternatively, we can imagine that, of the 216 possible ways the dice could land, there are six possible ways when they are all the same: {1,1,1} , {2,2,2} , {3,3,3} , {4,4,4} , {5,5,5} , {6,6,6} .   The probability of them all be being different can be calculated using the following logic:  The first die can be whatever it likes, then for the second die there is a 5/6 chance that it will not be the same number as the first die.  Finally, there is a 4/6 chance that the third die will be different for the first two.  So, the probability that all the dice will be different is 5/6 x 4/6 = 20/36 which can be unsimplified to 120/216 . There are 120 possible combinations of the 216 possible outcomes where all three dice are different {A,B,C} .  Because we know that total of all probabilities for the way three dice roll must add up to 1.0 we can deduce that the probability of two of the dice being the same {A,A,B} is 90/216 (Which is 1 – 6/216 – 120/216 ).  (If you want to convince yourself of this, think of it this way: There are six possible values that A could be, five possible values of what B could be, and three possible choices of which die could be B.  This is 6 x 5 x 3 = 90 combinations out of the 216).  4 dice  Things are starting to get a little more complex now.  They can be all the same, all different, three of a kind, two lots of two pairs, or a pair with two different singletons.  There are 1296 ways that four dice can be arranged (6 x 6 x 6 x 6).  The results are shown below:   We need to be extra careful here, because we don’t want to double count.  When counting the two lots of two pairs, we need to make sure that we don’t inadvertently count {5,5,5,5} as two sets of double five and place this in the {A,A,B,B} bucket, because it is really four of a kind and needs to be in the {A,A,A,A} bucket.  If we double count, the probabilities will become greater than 1.0!  Deriving the above table can be done in a variety of ways.  Those of you who studied math at university might reach for a binomial expansion for calculating the permutations.  Alternatively, like we discussed in the Risk analysis page, the number of combinations is so small (just 1296) that you might want to simply brute-force all the combinations in code and count them.  It’s actually a good mental exercise to work through derivation of these numbers to convince yourself that the numbers are correct.  For instance {A,A,A,A} is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 for the chances that the second, third and four die match the first.  (Alternative thinking, is that there are only six ways to get four of a kind = 6/1296 ).  For three of a kind {A,A,A,B} there are six possible numbers that A could be, and five possible numbers that B could be, and four locations for the dice B, which is 6 x 5 x 4 combinations = 120/1296 .  For all the dice to be different {A,B,C,D} there is a 5/6 chance that the second dice is different from the first, and a 4/6 that the third is unique, and 3/6 chance that fourth is. 5/6 x 4/6 x 3/6 = 60/216 = 360/1296 .  Interesting Note – As an aside here, when rolling four dice,  the most likely outcome is that you will get a pair, and there is a greater than 72.2% chance that you will get a least a pair ( 720 + 90 + 120 + 6 )/ 1296  5 dice  Now things are getting a little busy! There are 7776 possible combinations for five dice.  The results are shown below.  In the interests of brevity, I’m not going to derive them all here (maybe in a future blog post), and I’ll simply show the results so we can get back to the Markov Chain .   Interesting Note – The probability of rolling a FullHouse in one roll is 300/7776  cf.  Four of a kind at just 150/7776 .  According to our rules, a full house scores 25 points and (at most), the four of a kind can score 30 points (all sixes – Yahtzee bonus excluded), so the full house is an easy point pickup, being twice as easy as getting as four of a kind!  Interesting Note – With five dice, there is 7056/7776 chance that you will get a pair or better on your first roll (90.7%)  Back to Markov  To perform our Markov analysis, we need to create a Transition Matrix which defines the probability of moving between each state.  As the states, I’m going to select the number of matching dice in the set, so we have 5 states: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 (Here, "1" matching dice could also be described as a singleton).  This results in a matrix of 25 elements.      Our matrix will be upper triangular in nature (we made the assumption of a smart player thus, if there is a roll of three of a kind , we’re not going to suggest that the player re-rolls part of this in order to get to a Yahtzee!).  The Transition Matrix will show the probabilities of moving from any state to either the same state, or a higher one.  Here's the Transition Matrix.  We need to populate each location containing a ' ? ' with the probability of moving from between the state represented by the column number to the state represented by the row number.  (All other locations have zero probability).  Here we go …        The first few entries are easy to fill in.  The probability of moving from state 5 to state 5 is 1.0 Once we achieve a Yahtzee, we're going to keep it and not roll any more dice, so there is 100% certainty we'll keep in this state!  If we currently have 4 matching dice, there is a 1/6 chance that we'll roll the correct number to make it 5 , and correspondingly a 5/6 of staying in state 4 .  The stochastic nature of the transition matrix is maintained because the row of this matrix sums up to 1.0 (Something has to happen, and it will be one of these state changes).       For state 3 , there are two dice to re-roll, giving 36 possible combinations. (Recall back to the section of combinatronics above).  There is a 1/36 chance that both dice will match the current three of a kind to make a Yahtzee and this probability is placed in row 3 and column 5 .  There is a 25/36 chance that the player will still have three of a kind at the end of the next roll ( 5/6 chance of missing with the first die multiplied by 5/6 chance of missing with the second).  Finally, there is a 10/36 chance of getting one additional number to make four of a kind .  This is 1/6 x 5/6 , and this can be achieved two different ways (either the first die matches, or the second one does).        Things are getting a little trickier now, so we’ll slow down.  Going from state 2 to state 5 requires all three re-rolled dice matching the current pair .  This occurs with probability 1/216 (Which is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 ).  Similarly going from nothing matching, (state 1 ), to  state 5 , is the equivalent of rolling a Yahtzee in one go (because all the dice are re-rolled).  This is 1/1296 , calculated as ( 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 ).        We can fill in two more coefficients.  If you’re unlucky, and have nothing matching (state 1 ), and re-roll all the dice, the probability of getting nothing matching again is 120/1296 (This is 5/6 chance of the second die not matching, followed by 4/6 for the third and 3/6 of the fourth, and 2/6 for the fifth).  The chances of rolling four of a kind in a single roll are 25/1296 (Which is 150/7776 .  Remember back to the Combinatronics section?  It’s calculated by getting four dice the same: 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 , with the last die not matching 5/6 , and there are five possible ways this can be formed with the five possible locations for B in the set {A,A,A,A,B} .  If it's not clearly obvious, the probabilities on the top row (changing from nothing matching to any other state), are the probabilities for the outcome of the first roll.        The probability of getting three of a kind in one roll is 250/1296 .  This is a little more challenging to calculate, and we have to be careful.  This occurs in one of two patterns {A,A,A,B,B} and {A,A,A,B,C} .  Referencing the combinatronics section above (remember, I said it would be useful?), we can see that {A,A,A,B,B} occurs 300/7776 times (the full house )  and {A,A,A,B,C} ( three of a kind ) occurs 1200/7776 .  Adding these together (the probabilistic way of saying OR ) we get 1500/7776 , which reduces to 250/1296 .  To fill in the last element in this row (getting a pair ), again we have to be careful.  There are two sets to consider: {A,A,B,C,D} and {A,A,B,B,C} .  ( Single Pair and Two Pair ).  Since we’re going for a Yahtzee, we roll the one of the pairs along with the singleton.  The probability of getting a pair is 1800/7776 + 3600/7776 = 5400/7776 or 900/1296 ).  It’s also relieving to know that all the probabilities in this row add up to 1.0 ( 120/1296 + 900/1296 + 250/1296 + 25/1296 + 1/1296 ).        Transitioning from a pair (state 2 ) to four of a kind (state 4 ) is probability 15/216 .  There is a 1/6 chance that one of the dies will match, then another 1/6 chance that another one will, multiplied by the 5/6 chance that the final die does not match.  There are three possible ways for which of the 5/6 dice is, so the final probability = 3 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 5/6 = 15/216 .         Now the last two tricky ones.  Reading a little on the internet, this is where people appear to slip up in their calculations.  The complication arises because, when re-rolling three dice, you might want to "jump ship" about what you are aiming for.  For example, if you rolled a pair on your first roll, kept the pair and re-rolled three dice, and these three dice all came up the same (but not the same as the pair, otherwise that would be Yahtzee!), then on the next roll you would want to keep the three of a kind and re-roll the pair .  This subtlety modifies the probabilities.  Let’s work through this – We’ve kept a pair and re-rolled three dice. Recall from our three dice combinatronics that three dice turn up all the same with probability 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 = 6/216 , but in one of these cases, this number rolled will be the same as the pair (causing a Yahtzee), so we need to subtract this case.  Thus, the chance of converting from two of a kind to three of a kind is 6/216 – 1/216 = 5/216 .     To complete the coefficient of transition from a pair (state 2 ) to stay as a pair (state 2 ), we need the basic probability of this, which is simply 5/6 x 5/6 x 5/6 (all three dice miss matching the pair), and from this, we need to subtract the chance that all these three dice are the same and do not form a Yahtzee ( 5/216 ), so the final result for this element = 125/216 – 5/216 = 120/216 .  Similarly, the inverse of this trick for the transition probability from a pair state 2 to  three of a kind state 3 .  Here basic probability of moving from state 2 to state 3 is 75/216 (three dice are rolled, with 1/6 chance of a match, then two 5/6 chances of a miss, and there are three combinations of ways this can be achieved which is 3 x 1/6 x 5/6 x 5/6 ).  To this basic probability of 75/216 , we need to add the 5/216 chance from above that we got to three of a kind through this alternate route.  Thus, the final element required to complete our Transition Matrix from state 2 to state 3 is 75/216 + 5/216 = 80/216 .  It’s also a relief to calculate that the probabilities in this row total 1.0!  ( 120/216 + 80/216 + 15/216 + 1/216 ). This helps confirm our calculations are correct.  Our Transition Matrix is now complete!  Matrix Multiplication  We now input an identity column vector and multiply this by the Transition Matrix.  The resultant row vector output shows the probabilities of the distrubutution of states that the dice could be in.  We can now take this output and use it at as the input again and this time the output is the superposition of the probabilities for the dice at the end of the second roll. To get the probability of obtaining a Yahtzee on (or before) three rolls, we multiple one last time and read the result of the firth element (state 5 ) in the final output vector.  (From this point out, I'm switching to decimals/percentages to represent the probabilities because the fractions involved are too ungainly to enter and read).  Results  The probability of getting a Yahtzee is 4.6029%  Pretty Graphs  If you missed your Yahtzee roll, what happens if you rolled again? (as my kids sometimes try to do!) And again? And again? …  Below is a chart showing the percentage chance of getting a Yahtzee in n -rolls.  The x-axis is the number of rolls, and the y-axis shows the percentage chance.   The curve asymptotes to 100%, and crosses over 50% by roll #10.  To be 95% confident of rolling a Yahtzee you need 23 rolls.

What is the breakdown of the probabilities?  How likley are you to end up with Four of a kind when shooting for your Yahtzee?  This information is easy to obtain by reading the value from the output vector of the Markov Chain for state 4 .

On each turn, players are given three rolls to obtain several different objectives. After each roll, a player may decide which of the dice (if any) are to be retained and which are to be rerolled. The objectives include a variety of different kinds of combinations, many of which are taken from poker. Every different kind of combination is worth a different amount of points.         Two of the types of combinations that players must roll are called straights: a small straight and a large straight. Like poker straights, these combinations consist of sequential dice. Small straights employ four of the five dice and large straights use all five dice. Due to the randomness of the rolling of dice, probability can be used to analyze how likely it is to roll a large straight in a single roll. Assumptions We assume that the dice used are fair and independent of one another. Thus there is a uniform sample space consisting of all possible rolls of the five dice. Although Yahtzee allows three rolls, for simplicity we will only consider the case that we obtain a large straight in a single roll. Sample Space Since we are working with a uniform  sample space , the calculation of our probability becomes a calculation of a couple of counting problems. The probability of a straight is the number of ways to roll a straight, divided by the number of outcomes in the sample space.   It is very easy to count the number of outcomes in the sample space. We are rolling five dice and each of these dice can have one of six different outcomes. A basic application of the multiplication principle tells us that the sample space has 6 x 6 x 6 x 6 x 6 = 6 5 = 7776 outcomes. This number will be the denominator of all of the fractions that we use for our probabilities.         Number of Straights Next, we need to know how many ways there are to roll a large straight. This is more difficult than calculating the size of the sample space. The reason why this is harder is because there is more subtlety in how we count. A large straight is harder to roll than a small straight, but it is easier to count the number of ways of rolling a large straight than the number of ways of rolling a small straight. This type of straight consists of five sequential numbers. Since there are only six different numbers on the dice, there are only two possible large straights: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Now we determine the different number of ways to roll a particular set of dice that give us a straight. For a large straight with the dice {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} we can have the dice in any order. So the following are different ways of rolling the same straight: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 1, 3, 5, 2, 4 It would be tedious to list all of the possible ways to get a 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Since we only need to know how many ways there are to do this, we can use some basic counting techniques. We note that all that we are doing is permuting the five dice. There are 5! = 120 ways of doing this.  Since there are two combinations of dice to make a large straight and 120 ways to roll each of these, there are 2 x 120 = 240 ways to roll a large straight. Probability Now the probability of rolling a large straight is a simple division calculation. Since there are 240 ways to roll a large straight in a single roll and there are 7776 rolls of five dice possible, the probability of rolling a large straight is 240/7776, which is close to 1/32 and 3.1%. Of course, it is more likely than not that the first roll is not a straight. If this is the case, then we are allowed two more rolls making a straight much more likely. The probability of this is much more complicated to determine because of all of the possible situations that would need to be considered.                                           cite cite this article          Format  mla  apa  chicago  Your Citation   Taylor, Courtney.

We’ve been playing it a lot in the evenings. When a Yahtzee is rolled, my kids go wild.  In this blog posting I'm going to look into the probability of rolling a Yahtzee .    Yahtzee is a game played with five six-sided dice.  A player rolls the dice, examines the results and can keep as many of the dice as they like, re-rolling the remainder.  After the second roll, the process is repeated (if desired, the player can pick-up dice held on the first round).  After (up-to) three rolls, the dice are scored according to various categories.  The Yahtzee (scoring 50 points) is achieved by getting all five dice the same.    Assumptions  We’re going to assume the player is a smart player, and at each decision point makes the smartest possible re-roll and hold choices.  The probability of getting a Yahtzee in a single roll is easy to calculate.  There are five dice, so whatever the first die rolls there is a 1/6 chance that the second die is the same number.  If that occurs, there’s a 1/6 chance that the third die is the same, ditto the fourth and the fifth.  So probability of Yahztee in one roll is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/1296 .  With three rolls and holding, however, things get a little more complicated.  The number of dice we roll each turn can be changed, and there are many possible combinations to consider.   Because the state of dice at the start of each roll is independent of how the dice were rolled, this is a perfect chance to roll out one of my favorite tools, the Markov Chain (for more background on this, see my earlier postings on CandyLand , and Chutes and Ladders ).  Combinatronics     Before delving in the Markov Chain, however, it will benefit us to examine the various ways that combinations of dice can be rolled.  This exercise will greatly simplify the creation of the Transition Matrix (trust me on this).  Here we go …      2 dice  This is the trivial case.  There are only two patterns for the way that two dice can be rolled.  They either match, or they do not.  There is a 1/6 chance that the second of the two dice will match the first, and conversely, there is a 5/6 chance that it will not match.  The probabilities, of course, have to add up to 1 (one of the two events must occur).  Another way to look at this is that there are 36 possible combinations for two dice to be rolled.  In six of these combinations {1.1} , {2,2} , {3,3} , {4,4} , {5,5} , {6,6} the numbers are the same, and in 30 of these combinations, the dice are different.   These results are show graphically on the image above.  There is a 6/36 chance that both dice will be the same, represented as {A,A} , and 30/36 chance they will be different, represented as {A,B}  3 dice  This gets a little more complex, but not much.  Here there are three possible flavors of result for the three dice:  They are either all the same, they are all different, or there will be two of one number and one of another. There are 216 possible ways that three dice can be rolled (6 x 6 x 6).  We can calculate the probability of them all being the same, easily, as 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 (The second die matches the first 1 time in 6, and the third die matches, again, 1 time in 6).  Alternatively, we can imagine that, of the 216 possible ways the dice could land, there are six possible ways when they are all the same: {1,1,1} , {2,2,2} , {3,3,3} , {4,4,4} , {5,5,5} , {6,6,6} .   The probability of them all be being different can be calculated using the following logic:  The first die can be whatever it likes, then for the second die there is a 5/6 chance that it will not be the same number as the first die.  Finally, there is a 4/6 chance that the third die will be different for the first two.  So, the probability that all the dice will be different is 5/6 x 4/6 = 20/36 which can be unsimplified to 120/216 . There are 120 possible combinations of the 216 possible outcomes where all three dice are different {A,B,C} .  Because we know that total of all probabilities for the way three dice roll must add up to 1.0 we can deduce that the probability of two of the dice being the same {A,A,B} is 90/216 (Which is 1 – 6/216 – 120/216 ).  (If you want to convince yourself of this, think of it this way: There are six possible values that A could be, five possible values of what B could be, and three possible choices of which die could be B.  This is 6 x 5 x 3 = 90 combinations out of the 216).  4 dice  Things are starting to get a little more complex now.  They can be all the same, all different, three of a kind, two lots of two pairs, or a pair with two different singletons.  There are 1296 ways that four dice can be arranged (6 x 6 x 6 x 6).  The results are shown below:   We need to be extra careful here, because we don’t want to double count.  When counting the two lots of two pairs, we need to make sure that we don’t inadvertently count {5,5,5,5} as two sets of double five and place this in the {A,A,B,B} bucket, because it is really four of a kind and needs to be in the {A,A,A,A} bucket.  If we double count, the probabilities will become greater than 1.0!  Deriving the above table can be done in a variety of ways.  Those of you who studied math at university might reach for a binomial expansion for calculating the permutations.  Alternatively, like we discussed in the Risk analysis page, the number of combinations is so small (just 1296) that you might want to simply brute-force all the combinations in code and count them.  It’s actually a good mental exercise to work through derivation of these numbers to convince yourself that the numbers are correct.  For instance {A,A,A,A} is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 for the chances that the second, third and four die match the first.  (Alternative thinking, is that there are only six ways to get four of a kind = 6/1296 ).  For three of a kind {A,A,A,B} there are six possible numbers that A could be, and five possible numbers that B could be, and four locations for the dice B, which is 6 x 5 x 4 combinations = 120/1296 .  For all the dice to be different {A,B,C,D} there is a 5/6 chance that the second dice is different from the first, and a 4/6 that the third is unique, and 3/6 chance that fourth is. 5/6 x 4/6 x 3/6 = 60/216 = 360/1296 .  Interesting Note – As an aside here, when rolling four dice,  the most likely outcome is that you will get a pair, and there is a greater than 72.2% chance that you will get a least a pair ( 720 + 90 + 120 + 6 )/ 1296  5 dice  Now things are getting a little busy! There are 7776 possible combinations for five dice.  The results are shown below.  In the interests of brevity, I’m not going to derive them all here (maybe in a future blog post), and I’ll simply show the results so we can get back to the Markov Chain .   Interesting Note – The probability of rolling a FullHouse in one roll is 300/7776  cf.  Four of a kind at just 150/7776 .  According to our rules, a full house scores 25 points and (at most), the four of a kind can score 30 points (all sixes – Yahtzee bonus excluded), so the full house is an easy point pickup, being twice as easy as getting as four of a kind!  Interesting Note – With five dice, there is 7056/7776 chance that you will get a pair or better on your first roll (90.7%)  Back to Markov  To perform our Markov analysis, we need to create a Transition Matrix which defines the probability of moving between each state.  As the states, I’m going to select the number of matching dice in the set, so we have 5 states: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 (Here, "1" matching dice could also be described as a singleton).  This results in a matrix of 25 elements.      Our matrix will be upper triangular in nature (we made the assumption of a smart player thus, if there is a roll of three of a kind , we’re not going to suggest that the player re-rolls part of this in order to get to a Yahtzee!).  The Transition Matrix will show the probabilities of moving from any state to either the same state, or a higher one.  Here's the Transition Matrix.  We need to populate each location containing a ' ? ' with the probability of moving from between the state represented by the column number to the state represented by the row number.  (All other locations have zero probability).  Here we go …        The first few entries are easy to fill in.  The probability of moving from state 5 to state 5 is 1.0 Once we achieve a Yahtzee, we're going to keep it and not roll any more dice, so there is 100% certainty we'll keep in this state!  If we currently have 4 matching dice, there is a 1/6 chance that we'll roll the correct number to make it 5 , and correspondingly a 5/6 of staying in state 4 .  The stochastic nature of the transition matrix is maintained because the row of this matrix sums up to 1.0 (Something has to happen, and it will be one of these state changes).       For state 3 , there are two dice to re-roll, giving 36 possible combinations. (Recall back to the section of combinatronics above).  There is a 1/36 chance that both dice will match the current three of a kind to make a Yahtzee and this probability is placed in row 3 and column 5 .  There is a 25/36 chance that the player will still have three of a kind at the end of the next roll ( 5/6 chance of missing with the first die multiplied by 5/6 chance of missing with the second).  Finally, there is a 10/36 chance of getting one additional number to make four of a kind .  This is 1/6 x 5/6 , and this can be achieved two different ways (either the first die matches, or the second one does).        Things are getting a little trickier now, so we’ll slow down.  Going from state 2 to state 5 requires all three re-rolled dice matching the current pair .  This occurs with probability 1/216 (Which is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 ).  Similarly going from nothing matching, (state 1 ), to  state 5 , is the equivalent of rolling a Yahtzee in one go (because all the dice are re-rolled).  This is 1/1296 , calculated as ( 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 ).        We can fill in two more coefficients.  If you’re unlucky, and have nothing matching (state 1 ), and re-roll all the dice, the probability of getting nothing matching again is 120/1296 (This is 5/6 chance of the second die not matching, followed by 4/6 for the third and 3/6 of the fourth, and 2/6 for the fifth).  The chances of rolling four of a kind in a single roll are 25/1296 (Which is 150/7776 .  Remember back to the Combinatronics section?  It’s calculated by getting four dice the same: 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 , with the last die not matching 5/6 , and there are five possible ways this can be formed with the five possible locations for B in the set {A,A,A,A,B} .  If it's not clearly obvious, the probabilities on the top row (changing from nothing matching to any other state), are the probabilities for the outcome of the first roll.        The probability of getting three of a kind in one roll is 250/1296 .  This is a little more challenging to calculate, and we have to be careful.  This occurs in one of two patterns {A,A,A,B,B} and {A,A,A,B,C} .  Referencing the combinatronics section above (remember, I said it would be useful?), we can see that {A,A,A,B,B} occurs 300/7776 times (the full house )  and {A,A,A,B,C} ( three of a kind ) occurs 1200/7776 .  Adding these together (the probabilistic way of saying OR ) we get 1500/7776 , which reduces to 250/1296 .  To fill in the last element in this row (getting a pair ), again we have to be careful.  There are two sets to consider: {A,A,B,C,D} and {A,A,B,B,C} .  ( Single Pair and Two Pair ).  Since we’re going for a Yahtzee, we roll the one of the pairs along with the singleton.  The probability of getting a pair is 1800/7776 + 3600/7776 = 5400/7776 or 900/1296 ).  It’s also relieving to know that all the probabilities in this row add up to 1.0 ( 120/1296 + 900/1296 + 250/1296 + 25/1296 + 1/1296 ).        Transitioning from a pair (state 2 ) to four of a kind (state 4 ) is probability 15/216 .  There is a 1/6 chance that one of the dies will match, then another 1/6 chance that another one will, multiplied by the 5/6 chance that the final die does not match.  There are three possible ways for which of the 5/6 dice is, so the final probability = 3 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 5/6 = 15/216 .         Now the last two tricky ones.  Reading a little on the internet, this is where people appear to slip up in their calculations.  The complication arises because, when re-rolling three dice, you might want to "jump ship" about what you are aiming for.  For example, if you rolled a pair on your first roll, kept the pair and re-rolled three dice, and these three dice all came up the same (but not the same as the pair, otherwise that would be Yahtzee!), then on the next roll you would want to keep the three of a kind and re-roll the pair .  This subtlety modifies the probabilities.  Let’s work through this – We’ve kept a pair and re-rolled three dice. Recall from our three dice combinatronics that three dice turn up all the same with probability 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 = 6/216 , but in one of these cases, this number rolled will be the same as the pair (causing a Yahtzee), so we need to subtract this case.  Thus, the chance of converting from two of a kind to three of a kind is 6/216 – 1/216 = 5/216 .     To complete the coefficient of transition from a pair (state 2 ) to stay as a pair (state 2 ), we need the basic probability of this, which is simply 5/6 x 5/6 x 5/6 (all three dice miss matching the pair), and from this, we need to subtract the chance that all these three dice are the same and do not form a Yahtzee ( 5/216 ), so the final result for this element = 125/216 – 5/216 = 120/216 .  Similarly, the inverse of this trick for the transition probability from a pair state 2 to  three of a kind state 3 .  Here basic probability of moving from state 2 to state 3 is 75/216 (three dice are rolled, with 1/6 chance of a match, then two 5/6 chances of a miss, and there are three combinations of ways this can be achieved which is 3 x 1/6 x 5/6 x 5/6 ).  To this basic probability of 75/216 , we need to add the 5/216 chance from above that we got to three of a kind through this alternate route.  Thus, the final element required to complete our Transition Matrix from state 2 to state 3 is 75/216 + 5/216 = 80/216 .  It’s also a relief to calculate that the probabilities in this row total 1.0!  ( 120/216 + 80/216 + 15/216 + 1/216 ). This helps confirm our calculations are correct.  Our Transition Matrix is now complete!  Matrix Multiplication  We now input an identity column vector and multiply this by the Transition Matrix.  The resultant row vector output shows the probabilities of the distrubutution of states that the dice could be in.  We can now take this output and use it at as the input again and this time the output is the superposition of the probabilities for the dice at the end of the second roll. To get the probability of obtaining a Yahtzee on (or before) three rolls, we multiple one last time and read the result of the firth element (state 5 ) in the final output vector.  (From this point out, I'm switching to decimals/percentages to represent the probabilities because the fractions involved are too ungainly to enter and read).  Results  The probability of getting a Yahtzee is 4.6029%  Pretty Graphs  If you missed your Yahtzee roll, what happens if you rolled again? (as my kids sometimes try to do!) And again? And again? …  Below is a chart showing the percentage chance of getting a Yahtzee in n -rolls.  The x-axis is the number of rolls, and the y-axis shows the percentage chance.   The curve asymptotes to 100%, and crosses over 50% by roll #10.  To be 95% confident of rolling a Yahtzee you need 23 rolls.

What is the breakdown of the probabilities?  How likley are you to end up with Four of a kind when shooting for your Yahtzee?  This information is easy to obtain by reading the value from the output vector of the Markov Chain for state 4 .  (The chance that you'll end up with Four of a kind in three rolls is 24.476% , and Three of a kind is 45.240% ).  The table on the left shows the percentage breakdown for the the first 25 rolls.  Below is the same data presented in graphical format.  Notice that after 9 rolls, the Yahtzee becomes the most likely event, and the chance of ending up with a pair or Singleton rapdily falls to noise.             Individual Charts  Here is the same data, but each curve plotted on it's own axis.   On the first roll, it's most likely you'll get a pair , but after that the chances of end up with just a pair rapidly decreases. (You'd have to be incredibly unlucky).

On a player’s turn, he or she begins by rolling five dice. After this roll, a player may decide to reroll any number of dice. At most, there are a total of three rolls for each turn. Following these three rolls, the result of the dice is entered onto a score sheet. This score sheet contains different categories, such as a full house or large straight .         Each of the categories is satisfied with different combinations of dice. The most difficult category to fill-in is that of a Yahtzee. A Yahtzee occurs when a player rolls five of the same number. Just how unlikely is a Yahtzee? This is a problem that is much more complicated than finding probabilities for two or even three dice . The main reason for this is that there are a number of ways to obtain five matching dice during three rolls. We can calculate the probability of rolling a Yahtzee by using the combinatorics formula for combinations, and by breaking the problem into several mutually exclusive cases. One Roll The easiest case to consider is obtaining a Yahtzee immediately on the first roll. We will first look at the probability of rolling a particular Yahtzee of five twos, and then easily extend this to the probability of any Yahtzee. The probability of rolling a two is 1/6, and the outcome of each die is independent of the rest.   Thus the probability of rolling five twos is (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/7776. The probability of rolling five of a kind of any other number is also 1/7776. Since there are a total of six different numbers on a die, we multiply the above probability by 6. This means that the probability of a Yahtzee on the first roll is 6 x 1/7776 = 1/1296 = 0.08%.         Two Rolls If we roll anything other than five of a kind of the first roll, we will have to reroll some of our dice to try to get a Yahtzee. Suppose that our first roll has four of a kind, we reroll the one die that doesn’t match and then get a Yahtzee on this second roll. The probability of rolling a total of five twos in this way is found as follows: On the first roll, we have four twos. Since there is a probability 1/6 of rolling a two, and 5/6 of not rolling a two, we multiply (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (5/6) = 5/7776. Any of the five dice rolled could be the non-two. We use our combination formula for C(5, 1) = 5 to count how many ways we can roll four twos and something that is not a two. We multiply and see that the probability of rolling exactly four twos on the first roll is 25/7776. On the second roll, we need to calculate the probability of rolling one two. This is 1/6. Thus the probability of rolling a Yahtzee of twos in the above way is (25/7776) x (1/6) = 25/46656. To find the probability of rolling any Yahtzee in this way is found by multiplying the above probability by 6 because there are six different numbers on a die. This gives a probability of 6 x 25/46656 = 0.32% But this is not the only way to roll a Yahtzee with two rolls.  All of the following probabilities are found in much the same way as above: We could roll three of a kind, and then two dice that match on our second roll. The probability of this is 6 x C(5 ,3) x (25/7776) x (1/36) = 0.54%. We could roll a matching pair, and on our second roll three dice that match. The probability of this is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x (1/216) = 0.36 % We could roll five different dice, save one die from our first roll, then roll four dice that match on the second roll. The probability of this is (6!/7776) x (1/1296) = 0.01%. The above cases are mutually exclusive. This means that to calculate the probability of rolling a Yahtzee in two rolls, we add the above probabilities together and we have is approximately 1.23%. Three Rolls For the most complicated situation yet, we will now examine the case where we use all three of our rolls to obtain a Yahtzee.  We could do this in several different ways and must account for all of them. The probabilities these possibilities are calculated below: The probability of rolling four of a kind, then nothing, then matching the last die on the last roll is 6 x C(5, 4) x (5/7776) x (5/6) x (1/6) = 0.27%. The probability of rolling three of a kind, then nothing, then matching with the correct pair on the last roll is 6 x C(5, 3) x (25/7776) x (25/36) x (1/36) = 0.37%. The probability of rolling a matching pair, then nothing, then matching with the correct three of a kind on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x (125/216) x (1/216) = 0.21%. The probability of rolling a single die, then nothing matching this, then matching with the correct four of a kind on the third roll is (6!/7776) x (625/1296) x (1/1296) = 0.003% The probability of rolling three of a kind, matching an additional die on the next roll, followed by matching the fifth die on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 3) x (25/7776) x C(2, 1) x (5/36) x (1/6) = 0.89%. The probability of rolling a pair, matching an additional pair on the next roll, followed by matching the fifth die on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x C(3, 2) x (5/216) x (1/6) = 0.89%. The probability of rolling a pair, matching an additional die on the next roll, followed by matching the last two dice on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x C(3, 1) x (25/216) x (1/36) = 0.74%. The probability of rolling one of a kind, another die to match it on the second roll, and then a three of a kind on the third roll is (6!/7776) x C(4, 1) x (100/1296) x (1/216) = 0.01%.  The probability of rolling one of a kind, a three of a kind to match on the second roll, followed by a match on the third roll is (6!/7776) x C(4, 3) x (5/1296) x (1/6) = 0.02%. The probability of rolling one of a kind, a pair to match it on the second roll, and then another pair to match on the third roll is (6!/7776) x C(4, 2) x (25/1296) x (1/36) = 0.03%. We add all of the above probabilities together to determine the probability of rolling a Yahtzee in three rolls of the dice. This probability is 3.43%. Total Probability The probability of a Yahtzee in one roll is 0.08%, the probability of a Yahtzee in two rolls is 1.23% and the probability of a Yahtzee in three rolls is 3.43%. Since each of these are mutually exclusive, we add the probabilities together. This means that the probability of obtaining a Yahtzee in a given turn is approximately 4.74%. To put this into perspective, since 1/21 is approximately 4.74%, by chance alone a player should expect a Yahtzee once every 21 turns. In practice, it may take longer as an initial pair may be discarded in order to roll for something else, such as a straight.                                           cite cite this article          Format  mla  apa  chicago  Your Citation   Taylor, Courtney.

The scribes packed a lot of wisdom into those articles and bullet points, and I'll share various nuggets of knowledge in upcoming articles. 1 One of the articles talked about framing scientific information to make it relevant to different audiences, and for some odd reason I thought of my dad and Yahtzee. My dad is crazy brilliant. It's ridiculous how smart this man is. Yet every time I came home from break in college I'd have to re-explain DNA, starting from the beginning. A lot of people have this mental block with anything scientific or mathematic. But if we frame it in a way that is relevant, maybe we can convey complex (or even simple) scientific ideas in a way that will resonate and stick with the audience. Framing organizes central ideas; pares down complex issues by giving some aspects greater emphasis. My paternal grandma played the Penny Game with us bazillion grandchildren growing up to help teach us simple math (and it was a good game to play with a lot of people, and there were a lot of us around). 2 And growing up (and even now) my family played a ton of Yahtzee , which is (for those not in the know) a dice game that requires you to roll five dice each turn and check off various combinations (three of a kind, a straight, etc). 3 Perhaps I could use Yahtzee to teach Dad, a master Yahtzee player, simple statistical concepts. Take probability, for example. Anyone who has taken a stats class had heard the line, "Probability has no memory." This is key - probability is how probable or how likely an event is. To calculate probability, you divide the number of ways an event can occur by the total number of possible outcomes. Since I'm talking about Yahtzee, let's go with dice as an example. A single 6-sided die has, obviously, six sides. So, the probability of rolling a 1 on this 6-sided die is 1 (you can only roll the 1 once) divided by 6 (six total possible sides) = 1/6, or 0.167. Yet this is not additive - if I roll a 1 (my 1 in 6 chance), on the next roll probability starts all over again with a 1 in 6 chance. The probability that I roll a Yahtzee - all five dice are the same number, e.g. all five dice rolled come up as a 1 - in any particular game is about 1 in 22, or a 4.6% chance , although the real probability is likely slightly less. This is why Yahtzees are scored as 50 points, because they're more difficult to roll. 4 But what if I want to pull a Babe Ruth and call my Yahtzee beforehand? Say I roll five dice and I announce that my plan is to get a Yahtzee in ones. 5 For any one die to come up as a 1, there is a 6^1 possibility of getting a one - 6 possible outcomes, 1 outcome I want (6x1 = 6, or a 1 in 6 chance). For any two dice to come up both as 1, there are 6^2 possibilities (6x6 = 36). And so on, up to 6^5 (=7776, or a 1 in 7776 chance). So, the probability of rolling a Yahtzee with ones on my first roll is 1 in 7776. Not good. Anyway, say by some statistical anomaly that I roll four dice that come up as 1 (a 1 in 1296 chance - 6^4, or 6x6x6x6=1296). What is the probability that the fifth die comes up as a 1? Surely fate has a hand in my game, and I'm more likely to roll a 1 since my other four dice are all 1, right? Nope. It's still back to that original 1 in 6 chance. Probability doesn't give a damn that if I score a Yahtzee I can beat my siblings and earn bragging rights until the next game. Anyway, this small example shows that no matter what you roll, the dice you have on the table won't influence the dice in your hand - probability has no memory of what it just rolled. Or, take a descriptive representation of statistics. Say I happen to have a list of every Yahtzee game I've played on my phone (which I do), and I want to know my average (mean) score. I have a total of 231 games saved (n=31). My high score is 522 (not too shabby!) and my low score is a laughingstock-worthy 126. 6 I add all 231 of my scores and (sum=57,647) and divide by the number of games, so 57,647 / 231 = 249.55. A trial of 300 Yahtzee games played on a handheld device (so you can't cheat, sadly) showed the following probabilities of obtaining certain scores: Score At Least     Probability 150                     98% 200                     81% 250                     45% 300                     13% 400                     3% 500                     1% Credit: Chris Young So, the probability of getting my average 249.55 score (let's just round up to 250, shall we? I had a baaaaad run of games there) is slightly higher than 45%. This of course is just something I plucked out of the air, but it shows how you can take something with which a person is familiar - a game of Yahtzee - and use it to illustrate scientific concepts. As I said above, framing pares down complex issues by giving some aspects greater emphasis. In this case, I used Yahtzee to illustrate probability and mean. A comprehensive stats lesson? Not by any stretch. But if I want my listener/reader to understand probability, I don't need to give the full history of the development of statistics, and it's a lot easier to use familiar examples so the reader/listener can imagine the concept. ------------------------------------------------------------------ *As far as I can tell this is the first EVER mention of Yahtzee on Scientific Blogging, which is in itself a travesty. I think this means I get a prize, right, Hank? If I was allowed to pick, I'd want the secret of your fabulous hair. But, as I assume that would require changing my name to Delilah, I'll settle for kudos. ;) 1 Seriously, it's good stuff, both for aspiring writers who have yet to pick up the pen (or keyboard) and those of us who have been doing it a long time. 2 It was also a good way for us grandkids to earn some money, as we were allowed to keep our winnings. Given that we played with pennies it was a pittance but to a kid a dollar is a LOT of money! Thus Grandma instilled in us a love of gambling and swearing in German. 3 The best part of the game was when anyone got a Yahtzee - all five dice were the same number - we would all throw up our arms and yell at the top of our lungs, "YAHTZEEEEEEEEEE!" and pound our fists on the table like drums. That was awesome. Not gonna lie, I still do it. 4 My aunt Margie always said that in Yahtzee, fours are hard to come by. Statistically this is inaccurate. But it's a good catch-phrase. 5 If you really did this in Yahtzee, you'd be hit with incredulous glances on all sides, as well as "WTF are you doing?" exclamations. And for good reason. This is an asinine move. 6 The average score in a game of Yahtzee is about 250, assuming you don't get a Yahtzee. If you get a Yahtzee, the average score is anywhere from 270-320, depending on whether you get the top bonus. Note that this is simply a calculation from the games on my phone - I have scored higher than 522 in my life, and sadly lower than 126.

 Games >      Yahtzee     Yahtzee is a game played with five 6-sided dice . Players take turns rolling the dice, and trying to get certain types of rolls, each with
 an assigned point value, as summarized in the following table. Players are allowed
 a total of three rolls, with any subset of dice capable of being set aside at each
 roll. In addition to runs of a single number, other rolls include 3 of a kind (three
 of the same number), 4 of a kind (four of the same number), full house (two of one
 number and three of another), small straight (4 numbers in a row), large straight
 (5 numbers in a row), Yahtzee (five of the same number), and chance (any roll).   aces sum of 1s twos sum of 2s threes sum of 3s fours sum of 4s fives sum of 5s sixes sum
 of 6s 3 of a kind sum
 of all dice 4 of a kind sum
 of all dice full house 25 sm. straight 30 lg. straight 40 Yahtzee 50 chance sum
 of all dice   In addition to points scored by obtaining various rolls of the dice, 35 bonus points are awarded if the total score from the first six categories exceeds 62.  Woodward (2003) has solved the game completely by computing all possible
 outcomes and working out optimal playing strategies (Peterson 2003, Woodward 2003).
 T. Verhoeff and E. Scheffers have independently computed all the optimal
 strategies, and appear to arrive at the same results as Woodward.  In a variant of the game known as triple Yahtzee, players try to get each type of roll three times over the course of the game instead of just once, with point values for each roll being placed in a single, double, or triple column, whose values are multiplied by the stated weight when scores are totaled. The following tables summarizes the probability of obtaining various rolls. In this table, lower-value rolls are excluded from the results, so, for example, the probability of obtaining a three of a kind excludes rolls that are actually fours of a kind or Yahtzees. Similarly, the three of a kind probability excludes rolls that are full houses, and the two of a kind probability excludes rolls that are small straights.   type 1 2 3 overall 2

In 1956, the couple approached businessman Edwin S. Lowe, who had made a fortune selling Bingo games in the 1920s, who bought the rights and eventually changed the name of the "yacht game" to "Yahtzee." Despite attempts to advertise the game, it did not sell very well that first year. However, after Lowe started throwing Yahtzee parties, the game took off thanks to word of mouth and has been widely played ever since (Hasbro). Hasbro, the game's current manufacturer, claims that as many as 100 million people worldwide play the game regularly (Peterson 2003).     SEE ALSO:  Dice           REFERENCES:  Hasbro.

Which side of the dice one gets yahtzee with doesn't matter (e.g. it doesn't matter if it is ones or twos etc.). I also assume perfect strategy is used, that is, after each throw one saves the number it is the most of (and if equal, just pick one at random).    probability     share | cite | improve this question      edited Sep 15 '17 at 21:26       Xander Henderson   10.9k 7 25 42        asked Aug 10 '10 at 11:22       runaros   156 7              1      @runaros: Would you please explain the game, what does it mean "to get yahtzee"? – Tom Stephens  Aug 10 '10 at 12:25        1      Throwing five or six dice and trying to get various combinations of those dice.

A yahtzee is when at the aftermath of a roll, all dice (those rolled and those saved from previous rolls) show the same number. – yohay kaplan  Aug 10 '10 at 13:16            @runaros do you mean in a single round(with rerolls allowed in a round) or over the course of the entire game?

Let $f(N,X,Y)$ be the probability of getting all 1s with N dice, each with X sides, in at most Y rolls, where after each roll, 1s are retained and only non-1 dice are re-rolled.  Working 1 roll at a time, the first roll could have exactly $k=0,\dots,N$ 1s.  The probability of exactly k 1s in a single roll is ${N\choose k}\left(\frac{1}{X}\right)^k\left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right)^{N-k}$ and having k 1s in the first roll, we then need $N-k$ 1s in the remaining $Y-1$ rolls.  So, 
$$f(N,X,Y)=\sum_{k=0}^{N}{N\choose k}\left(\frac{1}{X}\right)^k\left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right)^{N-k}f(N-k,X,Y-1).$$
Also, the probability of all 1s on 0 dice is 1 (0 of the 0 dice are guaranteed to be 1), so $f(0,X,Y)=1$, and the probability of all 1s on $N\ge 0$ dice in 0 rolls is 0 (can't get any 1s without rolling some dice), so $f(N,X,0)=0$ for $N\ge 0$.  This is a complete definition of $f(N,X,Y)$, though it does not lend itself to easy computation.  (However, software like Mathematica may be able to compute from this definition.  In Mathematica: f[n_, x_, y_] := If[n == 0, 1, If[y == 0, 0, 
       Sum[
    Binomial[n, k]*(1/x)^k*(1 - 1/x)^(n - k)*f[n - k, x, y - 1], 
         {k, 0, n}]]] .)     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 10 '10 at 16:25       Isaac   29.1k 11 82 127              1      Nice answer.

For 5 normal (6-sided), dice, the exact probability of achieving a yahtzee, following the optimum strategy, given $n$ rolls is  $1+\frac{53}{13} \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{2n+1}+\frac{11 \cdot 5^n}{13 \cdot 2^{n+5} \cdot 3^{3n+1}}  -\frac{5^n}{8 \cdot 3^{2n-2}}  -\frac{7 \cdot 5^{n+1}}{ 2^{n+5} 3^{n-1}} $  For example, setting $n=3$ gives $\frac{347897}{7558272}$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 11 '10 at 14:03       I.

Now I am sorry that I haven't used Matlab ( which would be much less code ) but I implemented it in c++. The code is simply your rules implemented in my not so good c++. I used g++ 4.6.3 on Ubuntu 12.04. If you run the code, it will print the results and also write the pairs (number of dices | avg. number of throws) in out.txt. The result is plotted attached, plotted with gnuplot for number of dices $\leq$ 40.  See the results here as I dont know much about gnuplot and couldn't upload a .ps to MathSE I had to upload it there. For every number of dices, 10000 experiments have been player.
The code is probably terrible slow so everyone feel free to improve it ;)  This here does the same computation for number of dices $\leq 400$ but only 1000 experiments each.  Maybe you can use this to varify any of the formulas.  yahtzee.cpp:  #include <iostream>

Become a Redditor and subscribe to one of thousands of communities. × 6 7 8 Odds of rolling a Yahtzee  ( self.Yahtzee ) submitted 3 years ago by allangee THE ODDS OF GETTING A YAHTZEE ON THE FIRST ROLL  For this example, we'll calculate the chances of getting the five 4's mentioned above.  The probability of rolling a 4 on one die is 1/6 (one in six).  Makes sense since a die has six sides and the 4 is only on one of those sides.  The formula my math muncher used looks vaguely familiar, so it's probably something I learned in school and promptly forgot -- like cursive writing, playing the recorder, and how to play nicely with others.  But I digress.  The formula is (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/7776.  This reflects the 1 in 6 odds multiplied by the five dice.  But 1/7776 is the probability of rolling a Yahtzee with one specific number (the four's, in our example).  Since we would be happy with ANY of the six numbers showing up on all five dice, we have to multiply our first result by six.  6 x 1/7776 = 1/1296.  So...  The probability of rolling a Yahtzee on the first roll is 1 in 1296 or 0.08%  THE ODDS OF GETTING A YAHTZEE IN TWO ROLLS  Most likely, you're not going to get that cherished 5-in-a-row on the first toss.  That means you'll be rolling at least twice (assuming your goal is a Yahtzee).  Adding a second roll makes things a quinterfrabillion times more complicated!  For example, on the first roll you might get four 4's.  Then you'll re-roll the one die that doesn't match.  Let's assume you get a Yahtzee on this second roll.  Here's the math behind those particular two rolls.  One the first roll you get four 4's.  Since there was four 1/6 chances of rolling a 4, and one 5/6 chance of not rolling a 4, the formula is (1 x 6) x (1 x 6) x (1 x 6) x (1 x 6) x (5/6) = 5/7776.  But wait a minute!  ANY of the five dice could have been the non-4.  To express that, the combination formula is C(5,1) =5.  You need trust me on that... because I needed to trust my math magician on that.  So if we multiply the first odds by the second odds  --  5/7776 x 5/1 -- we get 24/7776 as the odds of rolling four 4's on the first roll.  Now... we need to calculate the chances of rolling one 4 on one die on our second roll.  That would be 1/6.  Thus (and I'm only using 'thus' to make it sound like I know what I'm talking about) the chance of rolling a Yahtzee of five 4's in two rolls, assuming the first roll gave us four 4's, is (1/6) x (25/7776) = 25/46656.  But wait!   There's more!  There are six different number on each die, so we have to multiply the above by six to reflect that.  Hence (I already used 'thus'), 6 x 25/46656 = 150/46656 (or 0.32%).  But wait again!   There's more again!  Obviously the above isn't the only way to get a Yahtzee in just two rolls.  We could get three of a kind and then match the remaining two dice on the second roll.  The chance of that are 6 x C(5,3) x (25/7776) x (1/36) = 0.54%.  Or maybe we only match two on the first roll and the remaining three on the second roll.  That gives us 6 x C(5,2) x (100/7776) x (1/216) = 0.36 %.  Finally, the first roll could give us five non-matching values, so we keep one and roll the remaining four.  Assuming that gets us a Yahtzee, the formula would be (6!/7776) x (1/1296) = 0.33%.  The '!' in the formula means the factorial for that number.  The factorial for 6 is 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1.  The above cases are mutually exclusive -- they don't rely on each other to get their possible results -- so the possibility of getting a Yahtzee in two rolls is obtained by adding them all up.  So...  The probability of rolling a Yahtzee in two rolls is 1.23%  THE ODDS OF GETTING A YAHTZEE IN THREE ROLLS  Go take a couple of aspirin or ibuprofen, and then read the next part.  Obviously, when we add a third roll there are a lot more variations that are possible.  We need to calculate the odds of all of them.  The chances of rolling four of a kind, then no match on the second roll, and matching the last die on the third roll is 6 x C(5,4) x (5/7776) x (5/6) x (1/6) = 0.27%.  The odds of rolling three of a kind, then no match, then a matching pair on the last roll is 6 x C(5,3) x (25/7776) x (25/36) x (1/36) = 0.37%.  The probability of getting a matching pair, then zip, then matching the remaining three on the third roll is 6 x C(5,2) x (100/7776) x (125/216) x (1/216) = 0.21%.  The probability of rolling a single die, then absolutely nothing matching it, then getting four of a kind on the third roll is (6!/7776) x (625/1296) x (1/1296) = 0.003%.  In other words, not great.  The probability of rolling three matching numbers, matching one more on the next roll, followed by matching the final die on the third roll is 6 x C(5,3) x (25/7776) x C(2,1) x (5/36) x (1/6) = 0.89%.  The odds of rolling a pair, matching an additional pair on the next roll, followed by matching the fifth die on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x C(3, 2) x (5/216) x (1/6) = 0.89%.  The possibility of rolling a pair, then matching one die on the second roll, followed by matching the last two dice on the last roll is 6 x C(5,2) x (100/7776) x C(3,1) x (25/216) x (1/36) = 0.74%.  The chances of you rolling one of a kind, another die like it on the next roll, and then the needed three of a kind on the final roll is (6!/7776) x C(4,1) x (100/1296) x (1/216) = 0.01%.  The probability of rolling nothing that matches, then three of a kind to match the one you chose on the first roll, followed by a final match on the third roll is (6!/7776) x C(4,3) x (5/1296) x (1/6) = 0.02%.  The odds of rolling one of a kind, then a matching pair on the second roll, and yet another matching pair to match on the last roll is (6!/7776) x C(4,2) x (25/1296) x (1/36) = 0.03%.  When you add up all of the above, it means...  The probability of rolling a Yahtzee in three rolls is 3.43%  THE TOTAL PROBABILITY OF GETTING A YAHTZEE  Now... adding it all up.  The chances of getting a Yahtzee in one roll is 0.08%.  The odds of doing it in two rolls is much better at 1.23%.  And the probability moves up to 3.43% in three rolls.  These are mutually exclusive (not dependent on each other) so we add them up to find out that...  The probability of getting a Yahtzee in any given turn is 4.74%  That means, on average, you should get a Yahtzee every 21 or 22 turns, if all you're doing is trying to get that magic 5-in-a-row.  However, in a real game of Yahtzee, you'll sacrifice some of those attempts to score in other categories, such as a full house or straight.  from http://yahtzeeonlinezone.blogspot.ca/   2 comments share save hide report all 2 comments sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion?

Welcome to Reddit, the front page of the internet. Become a Redditor and subscribe to one of thousands of communities. × 0 1 2 What are the odds of rolling the perfect Yahtzee game, and how long would it take? [Self].. mostly.  ( self.theydidthemath ) submitted 3 months ago by Money_fingers Credit to CaptainNirvana for the original reddit post on this, from which I took some text. But he forgot that you get three rolls per turn. So I have redone it. And now I feel better.  According to this interesting website , the chance of rolling a Yahtzee in a single three-roll turn is 4.6209%. Let's say each roll takes five seconds. So when you roll the first time, five seconds pass to look at the dice then collect them. For each of the progressing rolls, another five seconds is added.  So you roll the first shaker. 21 turns at 3 rolls each... all duds. But that 22nd one? Yahtzee. 21.640805 turns times 3 rolls per turn times 5 seconds per roll equals 324.612 seconds. Just shy of 5 and a half minutes to get a Yahtzee. So far so good.  Time to try for the second Yahtzee in a row. Failed. So, you start a new game. You do the 1 in 21.640805 chance again until, this time on the 21st turn, you land another Yahtzee. Time to try again for a second consecutive one. Failed.  It will take just over 21 times of this whole process to roll two Yahtzees in a row. 1/(0.046209)2 = 1 in 468.32444. For 468 turns, you either see a flop to begin with, or you get your hopes up with a Yahtzee then fail to get a second. (It will taunt you: you'll get one Yahtzee, then on the second roll, you'll get a 1-1-1-1-2, or many variations of that.). You'll land your first back-to-back Yahtzee in about 2 hours. Not awful... yet.  You keep going; I assume you're already imagining how excruciating this is going to get. You finally get 12 Yahtzees in a row (billions of years later, we'll get to that), then on the thirteenth turn you get four 2's and a--it's on its side, it's gonna tip!--a 3.  The math is uber simple: 1/(0.046209)13, which equals... a 0.000000000000000043797% chance to do it in your first 13 turns. A 1 in 228,325,589,819,893,405 (and exactly 481 other numbers after the decimal point that I no longer care about) chance.  Well how long would it take for you to achieve that? 228,325,589,819,893,40 turns x 3 rolls per turn x 5 seconds per roll equals:  3,424,883,847,298,401,075 seconds -or-  108,602,354,366 years, 141 days, 11 hours, 51 minutes, 15 seconds. Interesting note: this calculations works out to 15 seconds exactly if you kept all the decimals and fractions (which it should since you are rolling every 5 seconds).  If you were born and learned how to do nothing but sleep and play Yahtzee (and eat, while playing Yahtzee, and poop while playing Yahtzee, etc.) 16 hours a day, every single day of the year (including Sundays and holidays) minus a two week vacation, and you teach ONE kid to play Yahtzee, and they teach their kid to play Yahtzee, and so on and so forth into the unfor(Yaht)zeeable future, with an average of eighty years per span (assuming you played starting at age 5 and died at 85), it would take 2,117,513,853.83 generations before someone rolled the perfect game. According to this website last updated in 2011 (but who cares, and I'm too lazy to look up a new one) the population of the earth today is only 6.5% of the amount of people that have ever lived ( cough Cameron's old teacher cough ). This means there have been 107,692,307,692 people to have ever lived as of 2011. You would have to have roughly 2% of the number of people who have EVER lived (as of 2011) in offspring alone, all playing Yahtzee for 80 years to finally hit the perfect game; just less than a third of the total population of 2011.  So, you can find just over 2.1 billion of your closest friends, and all play together for 80 years to statistically guarantee someone will roll a perfect game -OR- you can become immortal and play for 108,602,354,366 years, 141 days, 11 hours, 51 minutes, 15 seconds to roll the perfect game. Just imagine how excited you would be during that last 15 seconds? Of course you still probably wouldn't roll it. Why? Good question:  This math didn't take into account that 6 of the Yahtzees HAVE to be specifically 1's, 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's, and 6's in order for you to score the perfect game. So 108 and a half billion years later, you finally hit 13 Yahtzees in a row only to discover that you didn't roll a Yahtzee in 2's .... which means you have to start all over again. But hey, I didn't take leap years into account, so you get an extra day off every once in a while!  PS, the dude who did this using only 1 roll per turn came up with a number of required people so astronomically large that it would take something like 3,000 times the volume of our Sun to encompass the volume of all the people who would have to be playing Yahtzee. My calculation is significantly more reasonable.   4 comments share save hide report all 4 comments sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion?

I had a computer version where you could get the Yahtzee bonus without using any other space, which means there was no maximum score.  The probability to have 13 Yahtzees in 25 rolls is much higher. We have a binomial distribution with p=0.046209 and n=25, this gives a probability of 1.3*10 -11 for k=13. If you need 5 minutes per game you get one of these games every 730,000 years. We cannot end with a Yahtzee as far as I understand, so actually we need 13 in 24 rolls, making it a bit worse (1.5 million years), but if we want to go for such an event we would stop all games that don't start with a Yahtzee, which means we only need 12 out of 23, plus about 5 minutes until we start actually playing a game (doubling the time per game), which leads to 250,000 years. If you can get a million players to work on it you are done in 3 months of pure playing time (on average).   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] Money_fingers [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 months ago *  (2 children) It's actually 13 Yahtzees in 13 tries with the formula you used, because p accounts for 3 rolls, an entire turn, thus making my probability correct. You don't get 25 shots at p=0.046209, you only get 13 and they have to be consecutive.
If you read the website that linked to, the 4.6209% chance is using all 3 rolls.
Definition of a perfect game: 1575 points. According to the rules, bonus Yahtzees in the bottom section are also wild cards, thus still giving you the LG and SM straight points. So 1 regular Yahtzee, and 12 bonus Yahtzees, filling the game.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] mfb- 12✓  1 point 2 points 3 points  3 months ago  (1 child) See my edit, my comment applies to a different interpretation of the rules.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Money_fingers [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 months ago  (0 children) Yep, got it now   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply about blog about advertise careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

( self.statistics ) submitted 1 year ago  * by savedevas My family is having a Christmas argument, are the odds of rolling a yahtzee the same as rolling a straight eith 5 dice in one roll?  my thought was no, as the first dice for a straight has a 6/6 chance to be a good number, 2nd die has 5/6 chance to work, then 4/6... all the way to 1/6 on the last dice.  The yahtzee roll always has a 1/6 chance on each die to be the correct number.  is it the same chance? Thanks  edit; I guess the first yahtzee dice for the yahtzee has 6/6 chance   2 comments share save hide report all 2 comments sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion?

You are right that the probability of the first dice to be a good number is 6/6, but what you say about the second dice is not necessarily correct. What if your first dice is a 6? Then there would only be a 4/6 that the second dice also is "good". The reason is that only {2,3,4,5} would be favourable outcomes of the second roll, as the only possible straights in yahtzee are {1,2,3,4,5} and {2,3,4,5,6}. Notice that 1 and 6 never occur in the same straight.  Look at the problem this way:  The total number of outcomes for five fair, independent dices is 6 5 = 7776.  The number of ways to get a yahtzee in one throw are only 6.  The number of ways to get a straight are on the other hand numerous. You still only have two ways to get a straight, that is {1,2,3,4,5} and {2,3,4,5,6}.  The outcomes (1,2,3,4,5), (2,3,4,1,5), (5,2,4,3,1) are three different outcomes of the throw, but all count as the same straight. The number of different outcomes that count as the same straight is 5! = 120. (# of ways to order five distinct elements).  There is 120 ways to roll each of the two straights in one throw = 240 ways to roll a straight in one throw.  Summed up:
The probability of getting a yahtzee in one throw is 6/7776. 
The probability of getting a straight in one throw is 240/7776. 
I.e. you are 40 times more likely to roll a straight than a yahtzee in one throw!:)  (Sorry for the bad formatting, all written from my phone)   permalink embed save give gold [–] astronaut_mikedexter  -3 points -2 points -1 points  1 year ago  (0 children) Roll them one at a time and count the possible correct outcomes of the next die. As you said the first die is correct 100% of the time. With the second die, you only have a 1 in 6 chance of success rolling the same number again but you have a 4 (if your first roll was 1 or 6) or 5 in 6 chance if rolling for 5 sequential values. Continue this for the remaining 3 and you'll see there a strait is far more likely.   permalink embed save give gold about blog about advertise careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

( self.theydidthemath ) submitted 3 years ago by delvis401 My friends were having a debate about optimal strategy when it comes to rolling a full house in Yahtzee and asked my opinion.  As a refresher, for those of you that aren't Yahtzee players: In Yahtzee you roll five dice and have three rolls to make a certain combo. One of the combinations is a full house (three of a kind and pair) (i.e. 5-5-5-3-3). The full house can be any 3 and 2 combo but can't be a three and two combo of the same number.  Who has better odds of converting the full house in the following scenario:  The first roll comes out 5-5-5-2-3  Player A says: Pick up either the 2 or 3 and roll your 1/6th chance twice in a row.  Player B says: Pick up one 5 and the 3 leaving 5-5-2. This way you have two rolls left: one roll with two dice to possibly hit a two giving yourself one more roll to hit a 1/3 shot on your final roll.  I know player A has two 1/6 chances (what is the % on that, by the way?) but what % chance does player B have to convert the full house?   19 comments share save hide report all 19 comments sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion? Post a comment! Create an account [–] M0T0RB04T 15✓  1 point 2 points 3 points  3 years ago *  (7 children) Okay, so far all of the answers in this thread are wrong so I took the time to explain the REAL answer. First you have to assume that the players are making the smartest choices moving after making their initial choice (like if a player rolled 2 fives, they wouldn't pick up
all 5 dice and roll for a full house like that). Also assume they won't go for a Yatzee.  For player A there are a couple of ways he/she could get a full house.  -Roll a two and get it right away (1/6)  -Miss the two on the first roll then roll a two (5/6 * 1/6)  You take (1/6) + (5/6 * 1/6) = 11/36 which is a 30.56% chance.  For player B, there are a few more possible ways he/she could get a full house.  -Roll a two+five or a five+two and get the full house right away (2/36)  -Roll a pair of two's and get the full house right away (1/36)  -Roll a five+(one, three, four, five, or six) then roll a two (9/36 * 1/6)  -Roll a two+(one, three, four, or six) then roll a two or five (8/36 * 2/6)  -Roll nothing that helps that isn't a pair (one, three, four, or six) then roll a two+five, a five+two, or a pair of two's (12/36 * 3/36)  -Roll a pair that aren't two's or five's then roll a five or the number that matches the pair (4/36 * 2/6)  You take (2/36) + (1/36) + (9/36 * 1/6) + (8/36 * 2/6) + (12/36 * 3/36) + (4/36 * 2/6) = 57/216 which is a 26.39% chance.  Player A is 15.80% more likely to get a full house than player B  TL;DR Player A has a 30.56% chance of getting a full house while player B has a 26.39% chance.  Edit: added TL;DR  Edit 2: fixed the percentage that player A is more likely to get a full house.  Edit 3: Fuck, all of this is wrong, 5 fives isn't a full house..... I'll fix this in a bit  Edit 4: nevermind, nothing was wrong with my answer  Edit 5: I forgot 1 situation for player B, I fixed it.   permalink embed save give gold [–] delvis401 [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (2 children) Thanks. Could you do me one more calculation?  Say that one the first of three rolls, the player rolled 5-5-5-2-3 and picks up both the 2 and the 3 (even though it's not optimal) and then tries to get a full house. Remember 5-5-5-5-5 is not a full house.  So on his second roll he's trying to either 1: Roll a non-5 pair on his first roll and if it fails, he will leave one of the non-5s down and roll one die.  So first roll he has 5/36 chance of completing the full house (1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 6-6) and on his second roll he has 1/6 chance of completing the full house (unless his first roll netted two 5s, at which point he has a 5/36 chance again).   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] M0T0RB04T 15✓  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (0 children) Right, so here's what that would look like:  -Roll a non-five pair and get a full house (5/36)  -Miss the pair and then on the second roll finish the non-five pair (30/36 * 1/6)  -Roll a pair of fives then roll a non-five pair (1/36 * 5/36)  Take (5/36) + (30/36 * 1/6) + (1/36 * 5/36) = 365/1,296 which is a 28.16% chance of getting a full house. Still better than player B's chances.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Socratov 3✓  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (0 children) Well, 5-5-5-5-5 may be used as a full house. Say you are rolling like a boss and have rolled yahtzee. You roll 5-5-5-5-5 and you may enter a full house of fives over fives on your score card. That said, the exclusion of 5-5-5-5-5 is not such a big deal in terms of numbers...   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] delvis401 [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (3 children) I think I found a flaw in your player B calculation. You ignored the fact that he could roll a non five pair thus giving him the opportunity to pick up the original 2 that he left and roll one die with a 1/3 chance to hit the full house.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] M0T0RB04T 15✓  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (2 children) I was assuming that player B would only use the 2 dice he/she initially picked up. If you want to include the possibility of picking up one or two of the 3 dice left down after the first roll, things can get pretty messy and result in a lot of "if they made decision V, then the probability would be W but if they made decision X then the probability would be Y." I can do that but it would take so long...   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] delvis401 [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (1 child) Honestly if using optimal strategy, the instance I outlined would be the only case that you would deviate.  First roll is set in stone at 5-5-5-2-3  Second roll is leaving 5-5-2 and rolling the 2&3.  At that point you either have to   a: hit a full house on second roll  b: roll a 5 or 2 and roll the only die left  c: roll two non-helpful dice at which point you pick up two non-five dice and roll.  or D: roll a non-5 pair at which point you'd only roll the leftover.   The pair of fives doesn't help you and the pair of twos gives you the full house. So it'd just be the odds of getting a pair of 1s, 3s, 4s or 6s and then you have one die left to roll either a 5 or X so 1/3 chance.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] M0T0RB04T 15✓  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (0 children) Okay, I edited my original post to reflect the correct answer   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] DownShiftToShine  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (4 children) Alright it's been awhile but lets see if I can work this out.  Player A: You pick up one (doesn't matter which), and have to chances to roll the other. This means that on your first or second roll you get the number. This comes out to 11/36, I can go more in depth if you would like.  Player B: Start with 5-5-2, here you have a 3/36 chance of getting a full house on your first try, and a 13/36 chance of getting a five or a two. For your next roll you have the expected 1/6 chance of getting the other. Finally if you miss the first roll and don't get either a five or a two (remaining 20/26 chance of this), then you need the 3/36 chance on your second roll to get the full house. This combines to 246/1296.  TLDR: Player A has the better chance at %30.56, Player B comes in at %18.98.   permalink embed save give gold [–] delvis401 [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (1 child) I typed in (1/6)2 into wolfram alpha and it said 33%.

Is that the wrong formula for back-to-back 1/6-odds?   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] captainmeta4  -1 points 0 points 1 point  3 years ago  (0 children) Because the second roll is only needed if the first roll fails.  Suppose you're rolling 1 dice, and you have 6 attempts to try to get a 1.

Am I missing something here?   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Uberwitz 2✓  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (0 children) The problem is that when using the 36 variations of two 6 sided dice, you're assuming that the rolls 2 - 5 and 5 - 2 are different. In that chart it lists (1,2) as a different roll than (2,1), but for your purposes it's the same roll.  I'm working on my own answer to this question as well, but I'm at work and time is sparse.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] AutoModerator 3✓ [ M ]  -1 points 0 points 1 point  3 years ago  (0 children) If you feel like someone successfully answers your request, you can reward them by replying to their comment with this   "✓" (remove the indented mark; the ">" before it which makes a text quoted)   to award them with a request point!

First roll, has a 1/6th chance, or 16.6%. Second roll, and this is assuming that you landed the 83.4% chance you missed the first, is 16.6% of 83.4% giving you 13.84%. Sum is 30.44%.  Player B has a more interesting approach.  Let's look at the first roll. Let's first look at the number of combinations that contain either a 2 or a 5. There at essentially 15 different rolls, because x - y is the same as y - x for our purposes. There are 11 rolls that contain at least one 2 or 5, of which 2 of those rolls would give the full house. So there's a 2/21 (9.5%) chance of rolling the full house immediately, 5 combinations with a 2 (23.8%), 4 combinations with a 5 (19%), and the remaining 47.7% of getting nothing helpful.  Now for the second roll, which assumes you missed your first 13.3% of getting the full house. Good news and bad news, the second roll is a dependent event, which means that chances get wonky. There's a 47.7% chance you miss the first roll, and then 9.5% of getting on this second try leaving you with 4.5% chance of this scenario. Now on the first roll we had 23.8% of getting 2, which means we need either another 2 or 5 for the full house, which is 2/6 leaving us with 7.93% of this scenario. If we rolled a 5 for the first roll, then we need only a 2, which is 1/6 giving us 3.16% of this scenario.  Now let's add it all up!  Full house on first roll + 2 on first, 5 on second + 5 on first, 2 on second + full house on second roll = 9.5 + 7.93 + 3.16 + 4.5 = 25.09%! A good deal less than player A.

If you don't then you roll again for a second 1/6 chance. How this combines is that the probability of the full house is 1/6+5/6*1/6=30.56%  Player B: This is a little more complex. There are three branches for your first roll. Branch A: 2-2, 5-2, or 2-5, which has a 3/36 chance. Branch B: roll either one 5 or one 2, which has a 17/36 chance. Branch C: Roll neither a 5 or a 2, which has a chance of 16/32. Now we need to go down the sub branches for B and C. Branch B breaks down to a 1/6 chance for success, and C has a 3/36 chance for success. Now we simply multiply and add.
3/36+17/36 1/6+16/36 3/36=43/216=19.90%
Note: this is slightly different than what I had before, must have punched a number in wrong.  *(Here I treat 5-2 as different than 2-5 to denote that it has twice the chance of occuring as 2-2.)   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] aredna  -1 points 0 points 1 point  3 years ago  (0 children) Player C has the best odds:  Pick up both the 2 and the 3.   5/36 (13.9%) chance of Full House  1/36 (2.8%) chance of Yahtzee  10/36 (27.8%) chance of 4 of a Kind, roll 1 die again  10/36 * 1/6 (4.6%) chance of improving to Yahtzee  10/36 * 5/6 (23.1%) chance of ending with 4 of a Kind   20/36 (55.6%) chance of no improvement  20/36 * 5/36 (7.7%) chance of Full House  20/36 * 1/36 (1.5%) chance of Yahtzee  20/36 * 10/36 (15.4%) chance of 4 of a Kind  20/36 * 20/36 (30.9%) chance of no improvement    Adding up all of our chances we get:

Yahtzee        Yahtzee is a dice game based on Poker. The object of the game is to roll certain combinations of numbers with five dice.  At each turn you throw dice trying to get a good combination of numbers; different combinations give different scores.  While luck plays a big role in Yahtzee, strategy makes a significant difference. The reason for this is that you score each combination just once, and the number of different combinations in which you can score is equal to the number of turns in the game. This means that you have to make wise choices about when to score in each combination and you have to be careful about what combinations you seek at each turn.  Rules and Scoring  The game takes thirteen turns. Each turn consists of up to three separate rolls of the dice.  On the first roll you roll all five of the dice.  After the first and second roll, you can hold any subset of the five dice you want (including none of the dice or all of the dice) and roll the rest trying to get a good combination.  After the three rolls (or after the first or second roll if you choose to stop) you must find a place among the thirteen boxes in the scorecard to put your score. The score you get depends on the box that you choose and the combination that you have rolled.  After a box is used, you can't use it again, so you have to choose wisely. This means that, in general, you don't have to choose the box that gives you the highest score for the combination you have rolled, since it may be advantageous to save that box for an even better roll later in the game. In fact, there are many situations it which it makes sense to put a 0 in a "bad" box instead of a low score in another "good" box because doing so would block the good box for future turns.  The Yahtzee scorecard contains two sections: the upper section and the lower section.      The Upper Section  In the upper section, there are six boxes, each corresponding to one of the six face values of the dice. For these boxes, you enter the sum of the dice with the corresponding face value (and ignore all other dice). For example, if you roll 5 3 3 5 3 you may enter a score of 9 in the third spot or a score of 10 in the fifth spot.   Bonus: At the end of the game, you get a bonus of 35 points if the total number of points you scored in the upper section is 63 or higher.  The seemingly random number 63 corresponds to having scored a combination with three dice of the corresponding face value in each of the upper section boxes (though any upper section total of 63 or greater is rewarded with the bonus).  The Lower Section  Here you can score for various combinations.   3 of a kind: Score in this box if the dice include 3 or more of the same number. The score is the total of all five dice (unlike the upper section, where only the dice of one number are summed).   4 of a kind: Score in this box if the dice include 4 or more of the same number. The score is the total of all five dice.   Full House: Score in this box if the dice show three of one number and two of another (for example, 2 6 6 2 2). The score is 25 points.   Small Straight: Score in this box if the dice show any sequence of 4 numbers (for example 3 2 4 4 5).  The score is 30 points.   Large Straight: Score in this box if the dice show any sequence of 5 numbers (for example 5 2 4 6 3).  The score is 40 points.   Chance: Score in this box with any combination. The score is the total of the five dice.   Yahtzee: Score in this box if the dice show five of the same number. The score is 50 points.   Yahtzee Bonus: If you roll a second Yahtzee and the Yahtzee box is already filled with 50 points, you get a 100 points bonus. If you roll a Yahtzee and your Yahtzee box is filled with a zero, you do not receive this bonus.  In either case, you must fill one of the other boxes on your scorecard using the "joker rules" as follows:  if possible, you must fill the upper section box corresponding to the number you rolled. If that box is already filled, you must fill in any open lower section box.  For the 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, and chance boxes, this means scoring the total of all 5 dice.  For the full house, small straight, and large straight boxes, this means scoring 25, 30, or 40 points respectively (even though you did not actually roll the corresponding combination).  If the entire lower section is filled you must enter a zero in any open box in the upper section.  Strategy  Now we are going to review a little bit of strategy for playing Yahtzee.  Basic Tips  The following are generally regarded as the basic things to keep in mind while playing Yahtzee.   You should generally aim for the 35 points bonus by filling the upper section with high scores (so as to get at least 63 points) near the beginning of the game.  If you roll a combination for which your available boxes give a low score, fill in a zero in the 1's box (or even the 2's or 3's), since high scores in the other boxes may compensate for this.  Early in the game you should use the chance box only as a fall-back for when you are trying for a high point combination and fail.  You want to keep the chance box available for a situation where your options are very limited.  If you have a bad roll of the dice near the end of the game, you may enter a zero in the Yahtzee box or one of the other difficult combinations.  If you roll a pair of 1's or 2's early in the game, go for a full house, straight, or one of the other high numbers you rolled.  Keeping the 1's or 2's to seek a 3 or 4 of a kind will not get you many points.  Plus, it is a good idea to keep the 1's and 2's boxes available for later in the game to have the possibility of putting a zero there.  As an example, if on your first turn your initial roll is 1 1 2 5 6, it turns out that keeping only the 5 is the choice that maximizes your expected score for the game.  If you roll four of a kind with 4's, 5's, or 6's, take the points in the upper section if they are available, not in the 4 of a kind box. This will help you get the 35 points bonus at the end of the game.  You should always try for a Yahtzee early in the game. If you roll a 3 or 4 of a kind on your first or second roll and you have the corresponding box in the upper section open, you should definitely go for the Yahtzee. Plus, if you saved your chance, 1's, or 2's boxes, you can score a zero there if you fail to get the Yahtzee.   Advanced Strategy  Any kind of advanced strategy for Yahtzee has to rely on calculating or estimating the expected final score you will get with respect to your current position in the game and the different possibilities you have for scoring. This is a very difficult task, since in general it involves too many calculations.  As with most board games, the best way to actually apply this principle is by playing a lot and developing some intuition as to what the best choices are. In general, you should be able to discard many possibilities just by looking at them, and then choose among the remaining ones in the best way you can.  To get a grasp of the kind of calculations you would need to do in order to determine the best move in Yahtzee, we will consider the following simplified example.  Suppose that you are playing a "1-turn Yahtzee" game (all the boxes are empty and you are tying to maximize your score for a single turn), and your second roll leaves you with 3 3 3 1 1.  Which (if any) of the dice should you keep for the last roll?  To solve this, observe first that since this is the 1-turn version of Yahtzee, all boxes are available and your only goal is to get the highest possible score in this turn. It should be clear that the only sensible choices are keeping everything (scoring 25 points for a full house) or re-rolling both 1's (trying for a Yahtzee). What is the best choice?  If you keep everything, the best score you can get is scoring the full house box, and you get 25 points. If you re-roll both 1's, three things may happen:   You get two different numbers. This will happen with probability 5/6. In this case, your best score corresponds to either the 3 or 4 of a kind box, where you add up the five numbers. In this case, the maximum score you can get is 20 (if you rolled a 5 and a 6).  You get two equal numbers, different from 3. This happens with probability (5/6) * (1/6) = 5/36.  In this case you rolled a full house, and it is the best box to score in this case, since any other possibility scores at most 3 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 21 points. Thus, you score 25 points.  You get two 3's. This will happen with probability 1/36, and you score 50 points for a Yahtzee.   With all this, we can say that the average score you get if you re-roll the 1's is less than   Thus, we see that your average score when re-rolling is less than 25, so you should keep all the dice and score a full house. As you observe, even in this very simplified situation, the calculations get impossible to carry out during a game.  Links  You can find more information on Yahtzee's rules, strategies and history on the Internet. For instance, you can try Wikipedia.   You can find an optimal Yahtzee player and proficiency test at here.     Problems   Some of the problems are very easy, but some are more involved, especially the last two. You may want to go over the review of basic probability before trying them.   If you roll a die three times, what is the probability that you will get at least one six?  Suppose that on the first roll you get 5 5 4 3 2. If you pick up one of the fives and try for a large straight, what is the probability you will succeed in the two rolls that remain?  Suppose that on the first roll you get 6 5 5 3 2. If you pick up one of the fives and try for a large straight, what is the probability you will succeed in the two rolls that remain? Is it the same as in the previous problem?  In the top six rows of the score card you want to score at least three of a given number (especially for the high numbers like 5 and 6). Suppose you roll 6, 6, 5, 2, 1 the first time, and re-roll all non 6's on the next two tries. What is the probability you will end up with at least three 6's? Exactly four 6's? A Yahtzee (five 6's)?   Suppose on the first roll you get 5, 4, 4, 3, 1. To try to get a large straight you pick up a 4 and the 1 and then roll again. If you get a 6 or 2 you keep it, and you re-roll the others. Of course if you happen to get a 2 and 1 on the second roll you stop and are happy. What is the probability you will end up with a large straight? What is the probability you will end up with a small straight?  Suppose instead you keep 5, 4, 3, 1, and re-roll 1 die. If you get a 2 you are happy. If you get a 6 you re-roll the 1. Otherwise you take a second chance at rolling the 2. What is the probability you will end up with a large straight? a small straight?  Suppose you are playing a game where you can roll a single die one or two times. Your objective is to get a high number. After the first roll you can choose whether to keep the number you got or re-roll. Then the best strategy is to keep a 4, 5, or 6, while re-rolling a 1, 2, or 3 (try to convince yourself of this). Now suppose we play the same game but with the option of rolling the single die one, two, or three times. As before, after the second roll you should keep a 4, 5, or 6, and re-roll a 1, 2, or 3. Can you come up with a strategy on what to do after the first roll such that the expected (or average) score you get in the three rolls game is better than the expected score in the two rolls game with the strategy we proposed? What is the expected score when playing with your proposed strategy?  These types of calculations are useful in the actual Yahtzee game, for example when you are trying to score well in the chance box.  It is the last roll of the game and you need a Yahtzee to win. After the first roll you keep the dice of the most common number you rolled and then re-roll twice to see if you can end up with all of that number. (We ignore the possibility that you change the number for which you are looking after the first roll, e.g., you only had one 5 after the first roll and then rolled two 4's.)  In the case of a tie on the first roll, choose one of the numbers that appears the maximal number of times and keep only the dice with that number. What is the probability you end up with a Yahtzee?  This problem is rather difficult, so don't expect to get a fast answer.  Here is a hint: first compute the probability of getting 2, 3, 4, or 5 of a kind, or all different numbers in the first roll; then try to compute the probability of passing from having i of a kind in a roll to having j on the next roll and try to use these "transition probabilities".  In reality, if you are going for a Yahtzee and you keep two 4's after you first roll but roll three 5's on your second roll, you will try for a Yahtzee in 5's on your last roll.  Repeat the previous problem, but now incorporating the fact that after your second roll you may change the number that you are seeking.  Once again, if there is a tie, choose one number to keep.  If you get all different numbers on your first roll, re-roll all of the dice.

December 2005  11:20 AM         That is something we asked ourselves the other night as we were having a game. It happens - you roll all 5 dice and get a yahtzee. So, I was wondering if there are any mathematicians out there who can tell me what the odds are of doing that. Getting the same value on all 5 dice in one roll. Surely there must be some way of calculating that possibility? I'm new to the message boards on this site, so I hope I'm in the right board. Thanks.

December 2005  11:39 AM         Five dice, all the same number: Let's assume you're throwing all of them sequentially, rather than at the same time.  The calculations are easier to explain (though it's the identical answer - just easier to conceptualize). First die - doesn't matter what you throw, because we're going to calculate what it would take to get the other four to match it.  This way, we will calculate the odds for ANY Yatsee (any of the six possible ones), not just a single one. Second die - has a 1/6 chance of matching the first one. Third die - has a 1/6 chance of matching the first one, and a 1/6 * 1/6, or 1/36 chance of matching both of the first ones. Continuing on, the chance that the fifth die will match all of the previous four dice is 1/6 * 1/6 * 1/6 * 1/6, or 1/1296. Therefore, the odds of getting a Yatsee in a single throw is 1/1296, or about 0.08%. Glad to be of service, DV! -------------------- "I'm singing and deranged!"

Probability of Rolling Certain
Scores  It seems very attractive to try and calculate the probability of
completing various target scores (such as full house) from various
starting positions, but in fact its appalling hard to do because there
are so many combinations possible. The first roll is entirely random,
but has dramatic affect on the subsequent chance of achieving a given
roll, so there's no fixed starting point for an analysis. Also, the
chances are affected by what has already been rolled. If you've used
5's and three of a kind already, a start throw of 5-5-3-6-4 is much
less likely to yield a good result than it would at the start of a game.  The chance of rolling a yahtzee in one turn been calculated* as 4.6% or
about 1 in 22 rolls but even that assumes that the player is targeting
a yatzee
and doesn't get tempted to go for a straight after the first roll, or
take a random full house after roll two. These are things that happen
in real games, so the real odds are a little less. And this is just an analysis on one roll type, not taking into account
previous scores or choices of how to select a given roll.  The attempt
to statistically assess the likelihood of acheiving a given total game
score
is imponderably difficult .  * References - Tim

turns and found about 1:22 resulted in Yahtzee which matches theory
very closely. Tim ran his for an impressive 15 million and came up with
1:27, but his algorithm didn't seem so good at playing the game,
because it got a low score of just 37 which its doubtful if a 
human player could do without deliberately aiming for a low score. Its
high score was 918. It also showed only 60% chance of scoring at least
200, compared to over 80% by human expert Chris Young. Of course its
high score is better due to the sheer number of games played.     Run

On a player’s turn, he or she begins by rolling five dice. After this roll, a player may decide to reroll any number of dice. At most, there are a total of three rolls for each turn. Following these three rolls, the result of the dice is entered onto a score sheet. This score sheet contains different categories, such as a full house or large straight .         Each of the categories is satisfied with different combinations of dice. The most difficult category to fill-in is that of a Yahtzee. A Yahtzee occurs when a player rolls five of the same number. Just how unlikely is a Yahtzee? This is a problem that is much more complicated than finding probabilities for two or even three dice . The main reason for this is that there are a number of ways to obtain five matching dice during three rolls. We can calculate the probability of rolling a Yahtzee by using the combinatorics formula for combinations, and by breaking the problem into several mutually exclusive cases. One Roll The easiest case to consider is obtaining a Yahtzee immediately on the first roll. We will first look at the probability of rolling a particular Yahtzee of five twos, and then easily extend this to the probability of any Yahtzee. The probability of rolling a two is 1/6, and the outcome of each die is independent of the rest.   Thus the probability of rolling five twos is (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/7776. The probability of rolling five of a kind of any other number is also 1/7776. Since there are a total of six different numbers on a die, we multiply the above probability by 6. This means that the probability of a Yahtzee on the first roll is 6 x 1/7776 = 1/1296 = 0.08%.         Two Rolls If we roll anything other than five of a kind of the first roll, we will have to reroll some of our dice to try to get a Yahtzee. Suppose that our first roll has four of a kind, we reroll the one die that doesn’t match and then get a Yahtzee on this second roll. The probability of rolling a total of five twos in this way is found as follows: On the first roll, we have four twos. Since there is a probability 1/6 of rolling a two, and 5/6 of not rolling a two, we multiply (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (5/6) = 5/7776. Any of the five dice rolled could be the non-two. We use our combination formula for C(5, 1) = 5 to count how many ways we can roll four twos and something that is not a two. We multiply and see that the probability of rolling exactly four twos on the first roll is 25/7776. On the second roll, we need to calculate the probability of rolling one two. This is 1/6. Thus the probability of rolling a Yahtzee of twos in the above way is (25/7776) x (1/6) = 25/46656. To find the probability of rolling any Yahtzee in this way is found by multiplying the above probability by 6 because there are six different numbers on a die. This gives a probability of 6 x 25/46656 = 0.32% But this is not the only way to roll a Yahtzee with two rolls.  All of the following probabilities are found in much the same way as above: We could roll three of a kind, and then two dice that match on our second roll. The probability of this is 6 x C(5 ,3) x (25/7776) x (1/36) = 0.54%. We could roll a matching pair, and on our second roll three dice that match. The probability of this is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x (1/216) = 0.36 % We could roll five different dice, save one die from our first roll, then roll four dice that match on the second roll. The probability of this is (6!/7776) x (1/1296) = 0.01%. The above cases are mutually exclusive. This means that to calculate the probability of rolling a Yahtzee in two rolls, we add the above probabilities together and we have is approximately 1.23%. Three Rolls For the most complicated situation yet, we will now examine the case where we use all three of our rolls to obtain a Yahtzee.  We could do this in several different ways and must account for all of them. The probabilities these possibilities are calculated below: The probability of rolling four of a kind, then nothing, then matching the last die on the last roll is 6 x C(5, 4) x (5/7776) x (5/6) x (1/6) = 0.27%. The probability of rolling three of a kind, then nothing, then matching with the correct pair on the last roll is 6 x C(5, 3) x (25/7776) x (25/36) x (1/36) = 0.37%. The probability of rolling a matching pair, then nothing, then matching with the correct three of a kind on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x (125/216) x (1/216) = 0.21%. The probability of rolling a single die, then nothing matching this, then matching with the correct four of a kind on the third roll is (6!/7776) x (625/1296) x (1/1296) = 0.003% The probability of rolling three of a kind, matching an additional die on the next roll, followed by matching the fifth die on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 3) x (25/7776) x C(2, 1) x (5/36) x (1/6) = 0.89%. The probability of rolling a pair, matching an additional pair on the next roll, followed by matching the fifth die on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x C(3, 2) x (5/216) x (1/6) = 0.89%. The probability of rolling a pair, matching an additional die on the next roll, followed by matching the last two dice on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x C(3, 1) x (25/216) x (1/36) = 0.74%. The probability of rolling one of a kind, another die to match it on the second roll, and then a three of a kind on the third roll is (6!/7776) x C(4, 1) x (100/1296) x (1/216) = 0.01%.  The probability of rolling one of a kind, a three of a kind to match on the second roll, followed by a match on the third roll is (6!/7776) x C(4, 3) x (5/1296) x (1/6) = 0.02%. The probability of rolling one of a kind, a pair to match it on the second roll, and then another pair to match on the third roll is (6!/7776) x C(4, 2) x (25/1296) x (1/36) = 0.03%. We add all of the above probabilities together to determine the probability of rolling a Yahtzee in three rolls of the dice. This probability is 3.43%. Total Probability The probability of a Yahtzee in one roll is 0.08%, the probability of a Yahtzee in two rolls is 1.23% and the probability of a Yahtzee in three rolls is 3.43%. Since each of these are mutually exclusive, we add the probabilities together. This means that the probability of obtaining a Yahtzee in a given turn is approximately 4.74%. To put this into perspective, since 1/21 is approximately 4.74%, by chance alone a player should expect a Yahtzee once every 21 turns. In practice, it may take longer as an initial pair may be discarded in order to roll for something else, such as a straight.                                           cite cite this article          Format  mla  apa  chicago  Your Citation   Taylor, Courtney.

Home > Mathematics > A Truth Universally Acknowledged        No Dice - The Probability Of Yahtzee*  By Becky Jungbauer | May 28th 2010 08:38 PM | Print | E-mail         Tweet       Becky Jungbauer       While going through old boxes of miscellaneous detritus, I came upon several sheets of paper from my health journalism grad school days. The scribes packed a lot of wisdom into those articles and bullet points, and I'll share various nuggets of knowledge in upcoming articles. 1 One of the articles talked about framing scientific information to make it relevant to different audiences, and for some odd reason I thought of my dad and Yahtzee. My dad is crazy brilliant. It's ridiculous how smart this man is. Yet every time I came home from break in college I'd have to re-explain DNA, starting from the beginning. A lot of people have this mental block with anything scientific or mathematic. But if we frame it in a way that is relevant, maybe we can convey complex (or even simple) scientific ideas in a way that will resonate and stick with the audience. Framing organizes central ideas; pares down complex issues by giving some aspects greater emphasis. My paternal grandma played the Penny Game with us bazillion grandchildren growing up to help teach us simple math (and it was a good game to play with a lot of people, and there were a lot of us around). 2 And growing up (and even now) my family played a ton of Yahtzee , which is (for those not in the know) a dice game that requires you to roll five dice each turn and check off various combinations (three of a kind, a straight, etc). 3 Perhaps I could use Yahtzee to teach Dad, a master Yahtzee player, simple statistical concepts. Take probability, for example. Anyone who has taken a stats class had heard the line, "Probability has no memory." This is key - probability is how probable or how likely an event is. To calculate probability, you divide the number of ways an event can occur by the total number of possible outcomes. Since I'm talking about Yahtzee, let's go with dice as an example. A single 6-sided die has, obviously, six sides. So, the probability of rolling a 1 on this 6-sided die is 1 (you can only roll the 1 once) divided by 6 (six total possible sides) = 1/6, or 0.167. Yet this is not additive - if I roll a 1 (my 1 in 6 chance), on the next roll probability starts all over again with a 1 in 6 chance. The probability that I roll a Yahtzee - all five dice are the same number, e.g. all five dice rolled come up as a 1 - in any particular game is about 1 in 22, or a 4.6% chance , although the real probability is likely slightly less. This is why Yahtzees are scored as 50 points, because they're more difficult to roll. 4 But what if I want to pull a Babe Ruth and call my Yahtzee beforehand? Say I roll five dice and I announce that my plan is to get a Yahtzee in ones. 5 For any one die to come up as a 1, there is a 6^1 possibility of getting a one - 6 possible outcomes, 1 outcome I want (6x1 = 6, or a 1 in 6 chance). For any two dice to come up both as 1, there are 6^2 possibilities (6x6 = 36). And so on, up to 6^5 (=7776, or a 1 in 7776 chance). So, the probability of rolling a Yahtzee with ones on my first roll is 1 in 7776. Not good. Anyway, say by some statistical anomaly that I roll four dice that come up as 1 (a 1 in 1296 chance - 6^4, or 6x6x6x6=1296). What is the probability that the fifth die comes up as a 1? Surely fate has a hand in my game, and I'm more likely to roll a 1 since my other four dice are all 1, right? Nope. It's still back to that original 1 in 6 chance. Probability doesn't give a damn that if I score a Yahtzee I can beat my siblings and earn bragging rights until the next game. Anyway, this small example shows that no matter what you roll, the dice you have on the table won't influence the dice in your hand - probability has no memory of what it just rolled. Or, take a descriptive representation of statistics. Say I happen to have a list of every Yahtzee game I've played on my phone (which I do), and I want to know my average (mean) score. I have a total of 231 games saved (n=31). My high score is 522 (not too shabby!) and my low score is a laughingstock-worthy 126. 6 I add all 231 of my scores and (sum=57,647) and divide by the number of games, so 57,647 / 231 = 249.55. A trial of 300 Yahtzee games played on a handheld device (so you can't cheat, sadly) showed the following probabilities of obtaining certain scores: Score At Least     Probability 150                     98% 200                     81% 250                     45% 300                     13% 400                     3% 500                     1% Credit: Chris Young So, the probability of getting my average 249.55 score (let's just round up to 250, shall we? I had a baaaaad run of games there) is slightly higher than 45%. This of course is just something I plucked out of the air, but it shows how you can take something with which a person is familiar - a game of Yahtzee - and use it to illustrate scientific concepts. As I said above, framing pares down complex issues by giving some aspects greater emphasis. In this case, I used Yahtzee to illustrate probability and mean. A comprehensive stats lesson? Not by any stretch. But if I want my listener/reader to understand probability, I don't need to give the full history of the development of statistics, and it's a lot easier to use familiar examples so the reader/listener can imagine the concept. ------------------------------------------------------------------ *As far as I can tell this is the first EVER mention of Yahtzee on Scientific Blogging, which is in itself a travesty. I think this means I get a prize, right, Hank? If I was allowed to pick, I'd want the secret of your fabulous hair. But, as I assume that would require changing my name to Delilah, I'll settle for kudos. ;) 1 Seriously, it's good stuff, both for aspiring writers who have yet to pick up the pen (or keyboard) and those of us who have been doing it a long time. 2 It was also a good way for us grandkids to earn some money, as we were allowed to keep our winnings. Given that we played with pennies it was a pittance but to a kid a dollar is a LOT of money! Thus Grandma instilled in us a love of gambling and swearing in German. 3 The best part of the game was when anyone got a Yahtzee - all five dice were the same number - we would all throw up our arms and yell at the top of our lungs, "YAHTZEEEEEEEEEE!" and pound our fists on the table like drums. That was awesome. Not gonna lie, I still do it. 4 My aunt Margie always said that in Yahtzee, fours are hard to come by. Statistically this is inaccurate. But it's a good catch-phrase. 5 If you really did this in Yahtzee, you'd be hit with incredulous glances on all sides, as well as "WTF are you doing?" exclamations. And for good reason. This is an asinine move. 6 The average score in a game of Yahtzee is about 250, assuming you don't get a Yahtzee. If you get a Yahtzee, the average score is anywhere from 270-320, depending on whether you get the top bonus. Note that this is simply a calculation from the games on my phone - I have scored higher than 522 in my life, and sadly lower than 126.

The object of the game is to roll certain combinations of numbers with five dice.  At each turn you throw dice trying to get a good combination of numbers; different combinations give different scores.  While luck plays a big role in Yahtzee, strategy makes a significant difference. The reason for this is that you score each combination just once, and the number of different combinations in which you can score is equal to the number of turns in the game. This means that you have to make wise choices about when to score in each combination and you have to be careful about what combinations you seek at each turn.  Rules and Scoring  The game takes thirteen turns. Each turn consists of up to three separate rolls of the dice.  On the first roll you roll all five of the dice.  After the first and second roll, you can hold any subset of the five dice you want (including none of the dice or all of the dice) and roll the rest trying to get a good combination.  After the three rolls (or after the first or second roll if you choose to stop) you must find a place among the thirteen boxes in the scorecard to put your score. The score you get depends on the box that you choose and the combination that you have rolled.  After a box is used, you can't use it again, so you have to choose wisely. This means that, in general, you don't have to choose the box that gives you the highest score for the combination you have rolled, since it may be advantageous to save that box for an even better roll later in the game. In fact, there are many situations it which it makes sense to put a 0 in a "bad" box instead of a low score in another "good" box because doing so would block the good box for future turns.  The Yahtzee scorecard contains two sections: the upper section and the lower section.      The Upper Section  In the upper section, there are six boxes, each corresponding to one of the six face values of the dice. For these boxes, you enter the sum of the dice with the corresponding face value (and ignore all other dice). For example, if you roll 5 3 3 5 3 you may enter a score of 9 in the third spot or a score of 10 in the fifth spot.   Bonus: At the end of the game, you get a bonus of 35 points if the total number of points you scored in the upper section is 63 or higher.  The seemingly random number 63 corresponds to having scored a combination with three dice of the corresponding face value in each of the upper section boxes (though any upper section total of 63 or greater is rewarded with the bonus).  The Lower Section  Here you can score for various combinations.   3 of a kind: Score in this box if the dice include 3 or more of the same number. The score is the total of all five dice (unlike the upper section, where only the dice of one number are summed).   4 of a kind: Score in this box if the dice include 4 or more of the same number. The score is the total of all five dice.   Full House: Score in this box if the dice show three of one number and two of another (for example, 2 6 6 2 2). The score is 25 points.   Small Straight: Score in this box if the dice show any sequence of 4 numbers (for example 3 2 4 4 5).  The score is 30 points.   Large Straight: Score in this box if the dice show any sequence of 5 numbers (for example 5 2 4 6 3).  The score is 40 points.   Chance: Score in this box with any combination. The score is the total of the five dice.   Yahtzee: Score in this box if the dice show five of the same number. The score is 50 points.   Yahtzee Bonus: If you roll a second Yahtzee and the Yahtzee box is already filled with 50 points, you get a 100 points bonus. If you roll a Yahtzee and your Yahtzee box is filled with a zero, you do not receive this bonus.  In either case, you must fill one of the other boxes on your scorecard using the "joker rules" as follows:  if possible, you must fill the upper section box corresponding to the number you rolled. If that box is already filled, you must fill in any open lower section box.  For the 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, and chance boxes, this means scoring the total of all 5 dice.  For the full house, small straight, and large straight boxes, this means scoring 25, 30, or 40 points respectively (even though you did not actually roll the corresponding combination).  If the entire lower section is filled you must enter a zero in any open box in the upper section.  Strategy  Now we are going to review a little bit of strategy for playing Yahtzee.  Basic Tips  The following are generally regarded as the basic things to keep in mind while playing Yahtzee.   You should generally aim for the 35 points bonus by filling the upper section with high scores (so as to get at least 63 points) near the beginning of the game.  If you roll a combination for which your available boxes give a low score, fill in a zero in the 1's box (or even the 2's or 3's), since high scores in the other boxes may compensate for this.  Early in the game you should use the chance box only as a fall-back for when you are trying for a high point combination and fail.  You want to keep the chance box available for a situation where your options are very limited.  If you have a bad roll of the dice near the end of the game, you may enter a zero in the Yahtzee box or one of the other difficult combinations.  If you roll a pair of 1's or 2's early in the game, go for a full house, straight, or one of the other high numbers you rolled.  Keeping the 1's or 2's to seek a 3 or 4 of a kind will not get you many points.  Plus, it is a good idea to keep the 1's and 2's boxes available for later in the game to have the possibility of putting a zero there.  As an example, if on your first turn your initial roll is 1 1 2 5 6, it turns out that keeping only the 5 is the choice that maximizes your expected score for the game.  If you roll four of a kind with 4's, 5's, or 6's, take the points in the upper section if they are available, not in the 4 of a kind box. This will help you get the 35 points bonus at the end of the game.  You should always try for a Yahtzee early in the game. If you roll a 3 or 4 of a kind on your first or second roll and you have the corresponding box in the upper section open, you should definitely go for the Yahtzee. Plus, if you saved your chance, 1's, or 2's boxes, you can score a zero there if you fail to get the Yahtzee.   Advanced Strategy  Any kind of advanced strategy for Yahtzee has to rely on calculating or estimating the expected final score you will get with respect to your current position in the game and the different possibilities you have for scoring. This is a very difficult task, since in general it involves too many calculations.  As with most board games, the best way to actually apply this principle is by playing a lot and developing some intuition as to what the best choices are. In general, you should be able to discard many possibilities just by looking at them, and then choose among the remaining ones in the best way you can.  To get a grasp of the kind of calculations you would need to do in order to determine the best move in Yahtzee, we will consider the following simplified example.  Suppose that you are playing a "1-turn Yahtzee" game (all the boxes are empty and you are tying to maximize your score for a single turn), and your second roll leaves you with 3 3 3 1 1.  Which (if any) of the dice should you keep for the last roll?  To solve this, observe first that since this is the 1-turn version of Yahtzee, all boxes are available and your only goal is to get the highest possible score in this turn. It should be clear that the only sensible choices are keeping everything (scoring 25 points for a full house) or re-rolling both 1's (trying for a Yahtzee). What is the best choice?  If you keep everything, the best score you can get is scoring the full house box, and you get 25 points. If you re-roll both 1's, three things may happen:   You get two different numbers. This will happen with probability 5/6. In this case, your best score corresponds to either the 3 or 4 of a kind box, where you add up the five numbers. In this case, the maximum score you can get is 20 (if you rolled a 5 and a 6).  You get two equal numbers, different from 3. This happens with probability (5/6) * (1/6) = 5/36.  In this case you rolled a full house, and it is the best box to score in this case, since any other possibility scores at most 3 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 21 points. Thus, you score 25 points.  You get two 3's. This will happen with probability 1/36, and you score 50 points for a Yahtzee.   With all this, we can say that the average score you get if you re-roll the 1's is less than   Thus, we see that your average score when re-rolling is less than 25, so you should keep all the dice and score a full house. As you observe, even in this very simplified situation, the calculations get impossible to carry out during a game.  Links  You can find more information on Yahtzee's rules, strategies and history on the Internet. For instance, you can try Wikipedia.   You can find an optimal Yahtzee player and proficiency test at here.     Problems   Some of the problems are very easy, but some are more involved, especially the last two. You may want to go over the review of basic probability before trying them.   If you roll a die three times, what is the probability that you will get at least one six?  Suppose that on the first roll you get 5 5 4 3 2. If you pick up one of the fives and try for a large straight, what is the probability you will succeed in the two rolls that remain?  Suppose that on the first roll you get 6 5 5 3 2. If you pick up one of the fives and try for a large straight, what is the probability you will succeed in the two rolls that remain? Is it the same as in the previous problem?  In the top six rows of the score card you want to score at least three of a given number (especially for the high numbers like 5 and 6). Suppose you roll 6, 6, 5, 2, 1 the first time, and re-roll all non 6's on the next two tries. What is the probability you will end up with at least three 6's? Exactly four 6's? A Yahtzee (five 6's)?   Suppose on the first roll you get 5, 4, 4, 3, 1. To try to get a large straight you pick up a 4 and the 1 and then roll again. If you get a 6 or 2 you keep it, and you re-roll the others. Of course if you happen to get a 2 and 1 on the second roll you stop and are happy. What is the probability you will end up with a large straight? What is the probability you will end up with a small straight?  Suppose instead you keep 5, 4, 3, 1, and re-roll 1 die. If you get a 2 you are happy. If you get a 6 you re-roll the 1. Otherwise you take a second chance at rolling the 2. What is the probability you will end up with a large straight? a small straight?  Suppose you are playing a game where you can roll a single die one or two times. Your objective is to get a high number. After the first roll you can choose whether to keep the number you got or re-roll. Then the best strategy is to keep a 4, 5, or 6, while re-rolling a 1, 2, or 3 (try to convince yourself of this). Now suppose we play the same game but with the option of rolling the single die one, two, or three times. As before, after the second roll you should keep a 4, 5, or 6, and re-roll a 1, 2, or 3. Can you come up with a strategy on what to do after the first roll such that the expected (or average) score you get in the three rolls game is better than the expected score in the two rolls game with the strategy we proposed? What is the expected score when playing with your proposed strategy?  These types of calculations are useful in the actual Yahtzee game, for example when you are trying to score well in the chance box.  It is the last roll of the game and you need a Yahtzee to win. After the first roll you keep the dice of the most common number you rolled and then re-roll twice to see if you can end up with all of that number. (We ignore the possibility that you change the number for which you are looking after the first roll, e.g., you only had one 5 after the first roll and then rolled two 4's.)  In the case of a tie on the first roll, choose one of the numbers that appears the maximal number of times and keep only the dice with that number. What is the probability you end up with a Yahtzee?  This problem is rather difficult, so don't expect to get a fast answer.  Here is a hint: first compute the probability of getting 2, 3, 4, or 5 of a kind, or all different numbers in the first roll; then try to compute the probability of passing from having i of a kind in a roll to having j on the next roll and try to use these "transition probabilities".  In reality, if you are going for a Yahtzee and you keep two 4's after you first roll but roll three 5's on your second roll, you will try for a Yahtzee in 5's on your last roll.  Repeat the previous problem, but now incorporating the fact that after your second roll you may change the number that you are seeking.  Once again, if there is a tie, choose one number to keep.  If you get all different numbers on your first roll, re-roll all of the dice.

We’ve been playing it a lot in the evenings. When a Yahtzee is rolled, my kids go wild.  In this blog posting I'm going to look into the probability of rolling a Yahtzee .    Yahtzee is a game played with five six-sided dice.  A player rolls the dice, examines the results and can keep as many of the dice as they like, re-rolling the remainder.  After the second roll, the process is repeated (if desired, the player can pick-up dice held on the first round).  After (up-to) three rolls, the dice are scored according to various categories.  The Yahtzee (scoring 50 points) is achieved by getting all five dice the same.    Assumptions  We’re going to assume the player is a smart player, and at each decision point makes the smartest possible re-roll and hold choices.  The probability of getting a Yahtzee in a single roll is easy to calculate.  There are five dice, so whatever the first die rolls there is a 1/6 chance that the second die is the same number.  If that occurs, there’s a 1/6 chance that the third die is the same, ditto the fourth and the fifth.  So probability of Yahztee in one roll is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/1296 .  With three rolls and holding, however, things get a little more complicated.  The number of dice we roll each turn can be changed, and there are many possible combinations to consider.   Because the state of dice at the start of each roll is independent of how the dice were rolled, this is a perfect chance to roll out one of my favorite tools, the Markov Chain (for more background on this, see my earlier postings on CandyLand , and Chutes and Ladders ).  Combinatronics     Before delving in the Markov Chain, however, it will benefit us to examine the various ways that combinations of dice can be rolled.  This exercise will greatly simplify the creation of the Transition Matrix (trust me on this).  Here we go …      2 dice  This is the trivial case.  There are only two patterns for the way that two dice can be rolled.  They either match, or they do not.  There is a 1/6 chance that the second of the two dice will match the first, and conversely, there is a 5/6 chance that it will not match.  The probabilities, of course, have to add up to 1 (one of the two events must occur).  Another way to look at this is that there are 36 possible combinations for two dice to be rolled.  In six of these combinations {1.1} , {2,2} , {3,3} , {4,4} , {5,5} , {6,6} the numbers are the same, and in 30 of these combinations, the dice are different.   These results are show graphically on the image above.  There is a 6/36 chance that both dice will be the same, represented as {A,A} , and 30/36 chance they will be different, represented as {A,B}  3 dice  This gets a little more complex, but not much.  Here there are three possible flavors of result for the three dice:  They are either all the same, they are all different, or there will be two of one number and one of another. There are 216 possible ways that three dice can be rolled (6 x 6 x 6).  We can calculate the probability of them all being the same, easily, as 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 (The second die matches the first 1 time in 6, and the third die matches, again, 1 time in 6).  Alternatively, we can imagine that, of the 216 possible ways the dice could land, there are six possible ways when they are all the same: {1,1,1} , {2,2,2} , {3,3,3} , {4,4,4} , {5,5,5} , {6,6,6} .   The probability of them all be being different can be calculated using the following logic:  The first die can be whatever it likes, then for the second die there is a 5/6 chance that it will not be the same number as the first die.  Finally, there is a 4/6 chance that the third die will be different for the first two.  So, the probability that all the dice will be different is 5/6 x 4/6 = 20/36 which can be unsimplified to 120/216 . There are 120 possible combinations of the 216 possible outcomes where all three dice are different {A,B,C} .  Because we know that total of all probabilities for the way three dice roll must add up to 1.0 we can deduce that the probability of two of the dice being the same {A,A,B} is 90/216 (Which is 1 – 6/216 – 120/216 ).  (If you want to convince yourself of this, think of it this way: There are six possible values that A could be, five possible values of what B could be, and three possible choices of which die could be B.  This is 6 x 5 x 3 = 90 combinations out of the 216).  4 dice  Things are starting to get a little more complex now.  They can be all the same, all different, three of a kind, two lots of two pairs, or a pair with two different singletons.  There are 1296 ways that four dice can be arranged (6 x 6 x 6 x 6).  The results are shown below:   We need to be extra careful here, because we don’t want to double count.  When counting the two lots of two pairs, we need to make sure that we don’t inadvertently count {5,5,5,5} as two sets of double five and place this in the {A,A,B,B} bucket, because it is really four of a kind and needs to be in the {A,A,A,A} bucket.  If we double count, the probabilities will become greater than 1.0!  Deriving the above table can be done in a variety of ways.  Those of you who studied math at university might reach for a binomial expansion for calculating the permutations.  Alternatively, like we discussed in the Risk analysis page, the number of combinations is so small (just 1296) that you might want to simply brute-force all the combinations in code and count them.  It’s actually a good mental exercise to work through derivation of these numbers to convince yourself that the numbers are correct.  For instance {A,A,A,A} is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 for the chances that the second, third and four die match the first.  (Alternative thinking, is that there are only six ways to get four of a kind = 6/1296 ).  For three of a kind {A,A,A,B} there are six possible numbers that A could be, and five possible numbers that B could be, and four locations for the dice B, which is 6 x 5 x 4 combinations = 120/1296 .  For all the dice to be different {A,B,C,D} there is a 5/6 chance that the second dice is different from the first, and a 4/6 that the third is unique, and 3/6 chance that fourth is. 5/6 x 4/6 x 3/6 = 60/216 = 360/1296 .  Interesting Note – As an aside here, when rolling four dice,  the most likely outcome is that you will get a pair, and there is a greater than 72.2% chance that you will get a least a pair ( 720 + 90 + 120 + 6 )/ 1296  5 dice  Now things are getting a little busy! There are 7776 possible combinations for five dice.  The results are shown below.  In the interests of brevity, I’m not going to derive them all here (maybe in a future blog post), and I’ll simply show the results so we can get back to the Markov Chain .   Interesting Note – The probability of rolling a FullHouse in one roll is 300/7776  cf.  Four of a kind at just 150/7776 .  According to our rules, a full house scores 25 points and (at most), the four of a kind can score 30 points (all sixes – Yahtzee bonus excluded), so the full house is an easy point pickup, being twice as easy as getting as four of a kind!  Interesting Note – With five dice, there is 7056/7776 chance that you will get a pair or better on your first roll (90.7%)  Back to Markov  To perform our Markov analysis, we need to create a Transition Matrix which defines the probability of moving between each state.  As the states, I’m going to select the number of matching dice in the set, so we have 5 states: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 (Here, "1" matching dice could also be described as a singleton).  This results in a matrix of 25 elements.      Our matrix will be upper triangular in nature (we made the assumption of a smart player thus, if there is a roll of three of a kind , we’re not going to suggest that the player re-rolls part of this in order to get to a Yahtzee!).  The Transition Matrix will show the probabilities of moving from any state to either the same state, or a higher one.  Here's the Transition Matrix.  We need to populate each location containing a ' ? ' with the probability of moving from between the state represented by the column number to the state represented by the row number.  (All other locations have zero probability).  Here we go …        The first few entries are easy to fill in.  The probability of moving from state 5 to state 5 is 1.0 Once we achieve a Yahtzee, we're going to keep it and not roll any more dice, so there is 100% certainty we'll keep in this state!  If we currently have 4 matching dice, there is a 1/6 chance that we'll roll the correct number to make it 5 , and correspondingly a 5/6 of staying in state 4 .  The stochastic nature of the transition matrix is maintained because the row of this matrix sums up to 1.0 (Something has to happen, and it will be one of these state changes).       For state 3 , there are two dice to re-roll, giving 36 possible combinations. (Recall back to the section of combinatronics above).  There is a 1/36 chance that both dice will match the current three of a kind to make a Yahtzee and this probability is placed in row 3 and column 5 .  There is a 25/36 chance that the player will still have three of a kind at the end of the next roll ( 5/6 chance of missing with the first die multiplied by 5/6 chance of missing with the second).  Finally, there is a 10/36 chance of getting one additional number to make four of a kind .  This is 1/6 x 5/6 , and this can be achieved two different ways (either the first die matches, or the second one does).        Things are getting a little trickier now, so we’ll slow down.  Going from state 2 to state 5 requires all three re-rolled dice matching the current pair .  This occurs with probability 1/216 (Which is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 ).  Similarly going from nothing matching, (state 1 ), to  state 5 , is the equivalent of rolling a Yahtzee in one go (because all the dice are re-rolled).  This is 1/1296 , calculated as ( 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 ).        We can fill in two more coefficients.  If you’re unlucky, and have nothing matching (state 1 ), and re-roll all the dice, the probability of getting nothing matching again is 120/1296 (This is 5/6 chance of the second die not matching, followed by 4/6 for the third and 3/6 of the fourth, and 2/6 for the fifth).  The chances of rolling four of a kind in a single roll are 25/1296 (Which is 150/7776 .  Remember back to the Combinatronics section?  It’s calculated by getting four dice the same: 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 , with the last die not matching 5/6 , and there are five possible ways this can be formed with the five possible locations for B in the set {A,A,A,A,B} .  If it's not clearly obvious, the probabilities on the top row (changing from nothing matching to any other state), are the probabilities for the outcome of the first roll.        The probability of getting three of a kind in one roll is 250/1296 .  This is a little more challenging to calculate, and we have to be careful.  This occurs in one of two patterns {A,A,A,B,B} and {A,A,A,B,C} .  Referencing the combinatronics section above (remember, I said it would be useful?), we can see that {A,A,A,B,B} occurs 300/7776 times (the full house )  and {A,A,A,B,C} ( three of a kind ) occurs 1200/7776 .  Adding these together (the probabilistic way of saying OR ) we get 1500/7776 , which reduces to 250/1296 .  To fill in the last element in this row (getting a pair ), again we have to be careful.  There are two sets to consider: {A,A,B,C,D} and {A,A,B,B,C} .  ( Single Pair and Two Pair ).  Since we’re going for a Yahtzee, we roll the one of the pairs along with the singleton.  The probability of getting a pair is 1800/7776 + 3600/7776 = 5400/7776 or 900/1296 ).  It’s also relieving to know that all the probabilities in this row add up to 1.0 ( 120/1296 + 900/1296 + 250/1296 + 25/1296 + 1/1296 ).        Transitioning from a pair (state 2 ) to four of a kind (state 4 ) is probability 15/216 .  There is a 1/6 chance that one of the dies will match, then another 1/6 chance that another one will, multiplied by the 5/6 chance that the final die does not match.  There are three possible ways for which of the 5/6 dice is, so the final probability = 3 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 5/6 = 15/216 .         Now the last two tricky ones.  Reading a little on the internet, this is where people appear to slip up in their calculations.  The complication arises because, when re-rolling three dice, you might want to "jump ship" about what you are aiming for.  For example, if you rolled a pair on your first roll, kept the pair and re-rolled three dice, and these three dice all came up the same (but not the same as the pair, otherwise that would be Yahtzee!), then on the next roll you would want to keep the three of a kind and re-roll the pair .  This subtlety modifies the probabilities.  Let’s work through this – We’ve kept a pair and re-rolled three dice. Recall from our three dice combinatronics that three dice turn up all the same with probability 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 = 6/216 , but in one of these cases, this number rolled will be the same as the pair (causing a Yahtzee), so we need to subtract this case.  Thus, the chance of converting from two of a kind to three of a kind is 6/216 – 1/216 = 5/216 .     To complete the coefficient of transition from a pair (state 2 ) to stay as a pair (state 2 ), we need the basic probability of this, which is simply 5/6 x 5/6 x 5/6 (all three dice miss matching the pair), and from this, we need to subtract the chance that all these three dice are the same and do not form a Yahtzee ( 5/216 ), so the final result for this element = 125/216 – 5/216 = 120/216 .  Similarly, the inverse of this trick for the transition probability from a pair state 2 to  three of a kind state 3 .  Here basic probability of moving from state 2 to state 3 is 75/216 (three dice are rolled, with 1/6 chance of a match, then two 5/6 chances of a miss, and there are three combinations of ways this can be achieved which is 3 x 1/6 x 5/6 x 5/6 ).  To this basic probability of 75/216 , we need to add the 5/216 chance from above that we got to three of a kind through this alternate route.  Thus, the final element required to complete our Transition Matrix from state 2 to state 3 is 75/216 + 5/216 = 80/216 .  It’s also a relief to calculate that the probabilities in this row total 1.0!  ( 120/216 + 80/216 + 15/216 + 1/216 ). This helps confirm our calculations are correct.  Our Transition Matrix is now complete!  Matrix Multiplication  We now input an identity column vector and multiply this by the Transition Matrix.  The resultant row vector output shows the probabilities of the distrubutution of states that the dice could be in.  We can now take this output and use it at as the input again and this time the output is the superposition of the probabilities for the dice at the end of the second roll. To get the probability of obtaining a Yahtzee on (or before) three rolls, we multiple one last time and read the result of the firth element (state 5 ) in the final output vector.  (From this point out, I'm switching to decimals/percentages to represent the probabilities because the fractions involved are too ungainly to enter and read).  Results  The probability of getting a Yahtzee is 4.6029%  Pretty Graphs  If you missed your Yahtzee roll, what happens if you rolled again? (as my kids sometimes try to do!) And again? And again? …  Below is a chart showing the percentage chance of getting a Yahtzee in n -rolls.  The x-axis is the number of rolls, and the y-axis shows the percentage chance.   The curve asymptotes to 100%, and crosses over 50% by roll #10.  To be 95% confident of rolling a Yahtzee you need 23 rolls.

What is the breakdown of the probabilities?  How likley are you to end up with Four of a kind when shooting for your Yahtzee?  This information is easy to obtain by reading the value from the output vector of the Markov Chain for state 4 .  (The chance that you'll end up with Four of a kind in three rolls is 24.476% , and Three of a kind is 45.240% ).  The table on the left shows the percentage breakdown for the the first 25 rolls.  Below is the same data presented in graphical format.  Notice that after 9 rolls, the Yahtzee becomes the most likely event, and the chance of ending up with a pair or Singleton rapdily falls to noise.             Individual Charts  Here is the same data, but each curve plotted on it's own axis.   On the first roll, it's most likely you'll get a pair , but after that the chances of end up with just a pair rapidly decreases. (You'd have to be incredibly unlucky).

On each turn, players are given three rolls to obtain several different objectives. After each roll, a player may decide which of the dice (if any) are to be retained and which are to be rerolled. The objectives include a variety of different kinds of combinations, many of which are taken from poker. Every different kind of combination is worth a different amount of points.         Two of the types of combinations that players must roll are called straights: a small straight and a large straight. Like poker straights, these combinations consist of sequential dice. Small straights employ four of the five dice and large straights use all five dice. Due to the randomness of the rolling of dice, probability can be used to analyze how likely it is to roll a large straight in a single roll. Assumptions We assume that the dice used are fair and independent of one another. Thus there is a uniform sample space consisting of all possible rolls of the five dice. Although Yahtzee allows three rolls, for simplicity we will only consider the case that we obtain a large straight in a single roll. Sample Space Since we are working with a uniform  sample space , the calculation of our probability becomes a calculation of a couple of counting problems. The probability of a straight is the number of ways to roll a straight, divided by the number of outcomes in the sample space.   It is very easy to count the number of outcomes in the sample space. We are rolling five dice and each of these dice can have one of six different outcomes. A basic application of the multiplication principle tells us that the sample space has 6 x 6 x 6 x 6 x 6 = 6 5 = 7776 outcomes. This number will be the denominator of all of the fractions that we use for our probabilities.         Number of Straights Next, we need to know how many ways there are to roll a large straight. This is more difficult than calculating the size of the sample space. The reason why this is harder is because there is more subtlety in how we count. A large straight is harder to roll than a small straight, but it is easier to count the number of ways of rolling a large straight than the number of ways of rolling a small straight. This type of straight consists of five sequential numbers. Since there are only six different numbers on the dice, there are only two possible large straights: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Now we determine the different number of ways to roll a particular set of dice that give us a straight. For a large straight with the dice {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} we can have the dice in any order. So the following are different ways of rolling the same straight: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 1, 3, 5, 2, 4 It would be tedious to list all of the possible ways to get a 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Since we only need to know how many ways there are to do this, we can use some basic counting techniques. We note that all that we are doing is permuting the five dice. There are 5! = 120 ways of doing this.  Since there are two combinations of dice to make a large straight and 120 ways to roll each of these, there are 2 x 120 = 240 ways to roll a large straight. Probability Now the probability of rolling a large straight is a simple division calculation. Since there are 240 ways to roll a large straight in a single roll and there are 7776 rolls of five dice possible, the probability of rolling a large straight is 240/7776, which is close to 1/32 and 3.1%. Of course, it is more likely than not that the first roll is not a straight. If this is the case, then we are allowed two more rolls making a straight much more likely. The probability of this is much more complicated to determine because of all of the possible situations that would need to be considered.                                           cite cite this article          Format  mla  apa  chicago  Your Citation   Taylor, Courtney.

We’ve been playing it a lot in the evenings. When a Yahtzee is rolled, my kids go wild.  In this blog posting I'm going to look into the probability of rolling a Yahtzee .    Yahtzee is a game played with five six-sided dice.  A player rolls the dice, examines the results and can keep as many of the dice as they like, re-rolling the remainder.  After the second roll, the process is repeated (if desired, the player can pick-up dice held on the first round).  After (up-to) three rolls, the dice are scored according to various categories.  The Yahtzee (scoring 50 points) is achieved by getting all five dice the same.    Assumptions  We’re going to assume the player is a smart player, and at each decision point makes the smartest possible re-roll and hold choices.  The probability of getting a Yahtzee in a single roll is easy to calculate.  There are five dice, so whatever the first die rolls there is a 1/6 chance that the second die is the same number.  If that occurs, there’s a 1/6 chance that the third die is the same, ditto the fourth and the fifth.  So probability of Yahztee in one roll is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/1296 .  With three rolls and holding, however, things get a little more complicated.  The number of dice we roll each turn can be changed, and there are many possible combinations to consider.   Because the state of dice at the start of each roll is independent of how the dice were rolled, this is a perfect chance to roll out one of my favorite tools, the Markov Chain (for more background on this, see my earlier postings on CandyLand , and Chutes and Ladders ).  Combinatronics     Before delving in the Markov Chain, however, it will benefit us to examine the various ways that combinations of dice can be rolled.  This exercise will greatly simplify the creation of the Transition Matrix (trust me on this).  Here we go …      2 dice  This is the trivial case.  There are only two patterns for the way that two dice can be rolled.  They either match, or they do not.  There is a 1/6 chance that the second of the two dice will match the first, and conversely, there is a 5/6 chance that it will not match.  The probabilities, of course, have to add up to 1 (one of the two events must occur).  Another way to look at this is that there are 36 possible combinations for two dice to be rolled.  In six of these combinations {1.1} , {2,2} , {3,3} , {4,4} , {5,5} , {6,6} the numbers are the same, and in 30 of these combinations, the dice are different.   These results are show graphically on the image above.  There is a 6/36 chance that both dice will be the same, represented as {A,A} , and 30/36 chance they will be different, represented as {A,B}  3 dice  This gets a little more complex, but not much.  Here there are three possible flavors of result for the three dice:  They are either all the same, they are all different, or there will be two of one number and one of another. There are 216 possible ways that three dice can be rolled (6 x 6 x 6).  We can calculate the probability of them all being the same, easily, as 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 (The second die matches the first 1 time in 6, and the third die matches, again, 1 time in 6).  Alternatively, we can imagine that, of the 216 possible ways the dice could land, there are six possible ways when they are all the same: {1,1,1} , {2,2,2} , {3,3,3} , {4,4,4} , {5,5,5} , {6,6,6} .   The probability of them all be being different can be calculated using the following logic:  The first die can be whatever it likes, then for the second die there is a 5/6 chance that it will not be the same number as the first die.  Finally, there is a 4/6 chance that the third die will be different for the first two.  So, the probability that all the dice will be different is 5/6 x 4/6 = 20/36 which can be unsimplified to 120/216 . There are 120 possible combinations of the 216 possible outcomes where all three dice are different {A,B,C} .  Because we know that total of all probabilities for the way three dice roll must add up to 1.0 we can deduce that the probability of two of the dice being the same {A,A,B} is 90/216 (Which is 1 – 6/216 – 120/216 ).  (If you want to convince yourself of this, think of it this way: There are six possible values that A could be, five possible values of what B could be, and three possible choices of which die could be B.  This is 6 x 5 x 3 = 90 combinations out of the 216).  4 dice  Things are starting to get a little more complex now.  They can be all the same, all different, three of a kind, two lots of two pairs, or a pair with two different singletons.  There are 1296 ways that four dice can be arranged (6 x 6 x 6 x 6).  The results are shown below:   We need to be extra careful here, because we don’t want to double count.  When counting the two lots of two pairs, we need to make sure that we don’t inadvertently count {5,5,5,5} as two sets of double five and place this in the {A,A,B,B} bucket, because it is really four of a kind and needs to be in the {A,A,A,A} bucket.  If we double count, the probabilities will become greater than 1.0!  Deriving the above table can be done in a variety of ways.  Those of you who studied math at university might reach for a binomial expansion for calculating the permutations.  Alternatively, like we discussed in the Risk analysis page, the number of combinations is so small (just 1296) that you might want to simply brute-force all the combinations in code and count them.  It’s actually a good mental exercise to work through derivation of these numbers to convince yourself that the numbers are correct.  For instance {A,A,A,A} is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 for the chances that the second, third and four die match the first.  (Alternative thinking, is that there are only six ways to get four of a kind = 6/1296 ).  For three of a kind {A,A,A,B} there are six possible numbers that A could be, and five possible numbers that B could be, and four locations for the dice B, which is 6 x 5 x 4 combinations = 120/1296 .  For all the dice to be different {A,B,C,D} there is a 5/6 chance that the second dice is different from the first, and a 4/6 that the third is unique, and 3/6 chance that fourth is. 5/6 x 4/6 x 3/6 = 60/216 = 360/1296 .  Interesting Note – As an aside here, when rolling four dice,  the most likely outcome is that you will get a pair, and there is a greater than 72.2% chance that you will get a least a pair ( 720 + 90 + 120 + 6 )/ 1296  5 dice  Now things are getting a little busy! There are 7776 possible combinations for five dice.  The results are shown below.  In the interests of brevity, I’m not going to derive them all here (maybe in a future blog post), and I’ll simply show the results so we can get back to the Markov Chain .   Interesting Note – The probability of rolling a FullHouse in one roll is 300/7776  cf.  Four of a kind at just 150/7776 .  According to our rules, a full house scores 25 points and (at most), the four of a kind can score 30 points (all sixes – Yahtzee bonus excluded), so the full house is an easy point pickup, being twice as easy as getting as four of a kind!  Interesting Note – With five dice, there is 7056/7776 chance that you will get a pair or better on your first roll (90.7%)  Back to Markov  To perform our Markov analysis, we need to create a Transition Matrix which defines the probability of moving between each state.  As the states, I’m going to select the number of matching dice in the set, so we have 5 states: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 (Here, "1" matching dice could also be described as a singleton).  This results in a matrix of 25 elements.      Our matrix will be upper triangular in nature (we made the assumption of a smart player thus, if there is a roll of three of a kind , we’re not going to suggest that the player re-rolls part of this in order to get to a Yahtzee!).  The Transition Matrix will show the probabilities of moving from any state to either the same state, or a higher one.  Here's the Transition Matrix.  We need to populate each location containing a ' ? ' with the probability of moving from between the state represented by the column number to the state represented by the row number.  (All other locations have zero probability).  Here we go …        The first few entries are easy to fill in.  The probability of moving from state 5 to state 5 is 1.0 Once we achieve a Yahtzee, we're going to keep it and not roll any more dice, so there is 100% certainty we'll keep in this state!  If we currently have 4 matching dice, there is a 1/6 chance that we'll roll the correct number to make it 5 , and correspondingly a 5/6 of staying in state 4 .  The stochastic nature of the transition matrix is maintained because the row of this matrix sums up to 1.0 (Something has to happen, and it will be one of these state changes).       For state 3 , there are two dice to re-roll, giving 36 possible combinations. (Recall back to the section of combinatronics above).  There is a 1/36 chance that both dice will match the current three of a kind to make a Yahtzee and this probability is placed in row 3 and column 5 .  There is a 25/36 chance that the player will still have three of a kind at the end of the next roll ( 5/6 chance of missing with the first die multiplied by 5/6 chance of missing with the second).  Finally, there is a 10/36 chance of getting one additional number to make four of a kind .  This is 1/6 x 5/6 , and this can be achieved two different ways (either the first die matches, or the second one does).        Things are getting a little trickier now, so we’ll slow down.  Going from state 2 to state 5 requires all three re-rolled dice matching the current pair .  This occurs with probability 1/216 (Which is 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 ).  Similarly going from nothing matching, (state 1 ), to  state 5 , is the equivalent of rolling a Yahtzee in one go (because all the dice are re-rolled).  This is 1/1296 , calculated as ( 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 ).        We can fill in two more coefficients.  If you’re unlucky, and have nothing matching (state 1 ), and re-roll all the dice, the probability of getting nothing matching again is 120/1296 (This is 5/6 chance of the second die not matching, followed by 4/6 for the third and 3/6 of the fourth, and 2/6 for the fifth).  The chances of rolling four of a kind in a single roll are 25/1296 (Which is 150/7776 .  Remember back to the Combinatronics section?  It’s calculated by getting four dice the same: 1/6 x 1/6 x 1/6 , with the last die not matching 5/6 , and there are five possible ways this can be formed with the five possible locations for B in the set {A,A,A,A,B} .  If it's not clearly obvious, the probabilities on the top row (changing from nothing matching to any other state), are the probabilities for the outcome of the first roll.        The probability of getting three of a kind in one roll is 250/1296 .  This is a little more challenging to calculate, and we have to be careful.  This occurs in one of two patterns {A,A,A,B,B} and {A,A,A,B,C} .  Referencing the combinatronics section above (remember, I said it would be useful?), we can see that {A,A,A,B,B} occurs 300/7776 times (the full house )  and {A,A,A,B,C} ( three of a kind ) occurs 1200/7776 .  Adding these together (the probabilistic way of saying OR ) we get 1500/7776 , which reduces to 250/1296 .  To fill in the last element in this row (getting a pair ), again we have to be careful.  There are two sets to consider: {A,A,B,C,D} and {A,A,B,B,C} .  ( Single Pair and Two Pair ).  Since we’re going for a Yahtzee, we roll the one of the pairs along with the singleton.  The probability of getting a pair is 1800/7776 + 3600/7776 = 5400/7776 or 900/1296 ).  It’s also relieving to know that all the probabilities in this row add up to 1.0 ( 120/1296 + 900/1296 + 250/1296 + 25/1296 + 1/1296 ).        Transitioning from a pair (state 2 ) to four of a kind (state 4 ) is probability 15/216 .  There is a 1/6 chance that one of the dies will match, then another 1/6 chance that another one will, multiplied by the 5/6 chance that the final die does not match.  There are three possible ways for which of the 5/6 dice is, so the final probability = 3 x 1/6 x 1/6 x 5/6 = 15/216 .         Now the last two tricky ones.  Reading a little on the internet, this is where people appear to slip up in their calculations.  The complication arises because, when re-rolling three dice, you might want to "jump ship" about what you are aiming for.  For example, if you rolled a pair on your first roll, kept the pair and re-rolled three dice, and these three dice all came up the same (but not the same as the pair, otherwise that would be Yahtzee!), then on the next roll you would want to keep the three of a kind and re-roll the pair .  This subtlety modifies the probabilities.  Let’s work through this – We’ve kept a pair and re-rolled three dice. Recall from our three dice combinatronics that three dice turn up all the same with probability 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36 = 6/216 , but in one of these cases, this number rolled will be the same as the pair (causing a Yahtzee), so we need to subtract this case.  Thus, the chance of converting from two of a kind to three of a kind is 6/216 – 1/216 = 5/216 .     To complete the coefficient of transition from a pair (state 2 ) to stay as a pair (state 2 ), we need the basic probability of this, which is simply 5/6 x 5/6 x 5/6 (all three dice miss matching the pair), and from this, we need to subtract the chance that all these three dice are the same and do not form a Yahtzee ( 5/216 ), so the final result for this element = 125/216 – 5/216 = 120/216 .  Similarly, the inverse of this trick for the transition probability from a pair state 2 to  three of a kind state 3 .  Here basic probability of moving from state 2 to state 3 is 75/216 (three dice are rolled, with 1/6 chance of a match, then two 5/6 chances of a miss, and there are three combinations of ways this can be achieved which is 3 x 1/6 x 5/6 x 5/6 ).  To this basic probability of 75/216 , we need to add the 5/216 chance from above that we got to three of a kind through this alternate route.  Thus, the final element required to complete our Transition Matrix from state 2 to state 3 is 75/216 + 5/216 = 80/216 .  It’s also a relief to calculate that the probabilities in this row total 1.0!  ( 120/216 + 80/216 + 15/216 + 1/216 ). This helps confirm our calculations are correct.  Our Transition Matrix is now complete!  Matrix Multiplication  We now input an identity column vector and multiply this by the Transition Matrix.  The resultant row vector output shows the probabilities of the distrubutution of states that the dice could be in.  We can now take this output and use it at as the input again and this time the output is the superposition of the probabilities for the dice at the end of the second roll. To get the probability of obtaining a Yahtzee on (or before) three rolls, we multiple one last time and read the result of the firth element (state 5 ) in the final output vector.  (From this point out, I'm switching to decimals/percentages to represent the probabilities because the fractions involved are too ungainly to enter and read).  Results  The probability of getting a Yahtzee is 4.6029%  Pretty Graphs  If you missed your Yahtzee roll, what happens if you rolled again? (as my kids sometimes try to do!) And again? And again? …  Below is a chart showing the percentage chance of getting a Yahtzee in n -rolls.  The x-axis is the number of rolls, and the y-axis shows the percentage chance.   The curve asymptotes to 100%, and crosses over 50% by roll #10.  To be 95% confident of rolling a Yahtzee you need 23 rolls.

What is the breakdown of the probabilities?  How likley are you to end up with Four of a kind when shooting for your Yahtzee?  This information is easy to obtain by reading the value from the output vector of the Markov Chain for state 4 .  (The chance that you'll end up with Four of a kind in three rolls is 24.476% , and Three of a kind is 45.240% ).  The table on the left shows the percentage breakdown for the the first 25 rolls.  Below is the same data presented in graphical format.  Notice that after 9 rolls, the Yahtzee becomes the most likely event, and the chance of ending up with a pair or Singleton rapdily falls to noise.             Individual Charts  Here is the same data, but each curve plotted on it's own axis.   On the first roll, it's most likely you'll get a pair , but after that the chances of end up with just a pair rapidly decreases. (You'd have to be incredibly unlucky).

On a player’s turn, he or she begins by rolling five dice. After this roll, a player may decide to reroll any number of dice. At most, there are a total of three rolls for each turn. Following these three rolls, the result of the dice is entered onto a score sheet. This score sheet contains different categories, such as a full house or large straight .         Each of the categories is satisfied with different combinations of dice. The most difficult category to fill-in is that of a Yahtzee. A Yahtzee occurs when a player rolls five of the same number. Just how unlikely is a Yahtzee? This is a problem that is much more complicated than finding probabilities for two or even three dice . The main reason for this is that there are a number of ways to obtain five matching dice during three rolls. We can calculate the probability of rolling a Yahtzee by using the combinatorics formula for combinations, and by breaking the problem into several mutually exclusive cases. One Roll The easiest case to consider is obtaining a Yahtzee immediately on the first roll. We will first look at the probability of rolling a particular Yahtzee of five twos, and then easily extend this to the probability of any Yahtzee. The probability of rolling a two is 1/6, and the outcome of each die is independent of the rest.   Thus the probability of rolling five twos is (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/7776. The probability of rolling five of a kind of any other number is also 1/7776. Since there are a total of six different numbers on a die, we multiply the above probability by 6. This means that the probability of a Yahtzee on the first roll is 6 x 1/7776 = 1/1296 = 0.08%.         Two Rolls If we roll anything other than five of a kind of the first roll, we will have to reroll some of our dice to try to get a Yahtzee. Suppose that our first roll has four of a kind, we reroll the one die that doesn’t match and then get a Yahtzee on this second roll. The probability of rolling a total of five twos in this way is found as follows: On the first roll, we have four twos. Since there is a probability 1/6 of rolling a two, and 5/6 of not rolling a two, we multiply (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (5/6) = 5/7776. Any of the five dice rolled could be the non-two. We use our combination formula for C(5, 1) = 5 to count how many ways we can roll four twos and something that is not a two. We multiply and see that the probability of rolling exactly four twos on the first roll is 25/7776. On the second roll, we need to calculate the probability of rolling one two. This is 1/6. Thus the probability of rolling a Yahtzee of twos in the above way is (25/7776) x (1/6) = 25/46656. To find the probability of rolling any Yahtzee in this way is found by multiplying the above probability by 6 because there are six different numbers on a die. This gives a probability of 6 x 25/46656 = 0.32% But this is not the only way to roll a Yahtzee with two rolls.  All of the following probabilities are found in much the same way as above: We could roll three of a kind, and then two dice that match on our second roll. The probability of this is 6 x C(5 ,3) x (25/7776) x (1/36) = 0.54%. We could roll a matching pair, and on our second roll three dice that match. The probability of this is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x (1/216) = 0.36 % We could roll five different dice, save one die from our first roll, then roll four dice that match on the second roll. The probability of this is (6!/7776) x (1/1296) = 0.01%. The above cases are mutually exclusive. This means that to calculate the probability of rolling a Yahtzee in two rolls, we add the above probabilities together and we have is approximately 1.23%. Three Rolls For the most complicated situation yet, we will now examine the case where we use all three of our rolls to obtain a Yahtzee.  We could do this in several different ways and must account for all of them. The probabilities these possibilities are calculated below: The probability of rolling four of a kind, then nothing, then matching the last die on the last roll is 6 x C(5, 4) x (5/7776) x (5/6) x (1/6) = 0.27%. The probability of rolling three of a kind, then nothing, then matching with the correct pair on the last roll is 6 x C(5, 3) x (25/7776) x (25/36) x (1/36) = 0.37%. The probability of rolling a matching pair, then nothing, then matching with the correct three of a kind on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x (125/216) x (1/216) = 0.21%. The probability of rolling a single die, then nothing matching this, then matching with the correct four of a kind on the third roll is (6!/7776) x (625/1296) x (1/1296) = 0.003% The probability of rolling three of a kind, matching an additional die on the next roll, followed by matching the fifth die on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 3) x (25/7776) x C(2, 1) x (5/36) x (1/6) = 0.89%. The probability of rolling a pair, matching an additional pair on the next roll, followed by matching the fifth die on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x C(3, 2) x (5/216) x (1/6) = 0.89%. The probability of rolling a pair, matching an additional die on the next roll, followed by matching the last two dice on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x C(3, 1) x (25/216) x (1/36) = 0.74%. The probability of rolling one of a kind, another die to match it on the second roll, and then a three of a kind on the third roll is (6!/7776) x C(4, 1) x (100/1296) x (1/216) = 0.01%.  The probability of rolling one of a kind, a three of a kind to match on the second roll, followed by a match on the third roll is (6!/7776) x C(4, 3) x (5/1296) x (1/6) = 0.02%. The probability of rolling one of a kind, a pair to match it on the second roll, and then another pair to match on the third roll is (6!/7776) x C(4, 2) x (25/1296) x (1/36) = 0.03%. We add all of the above probabilities together to determine the probability of rolling a Yahtzee in three rolls of the dice. This probability is 3.43%. Total Probability The probability of a Yahtzee in one roll is 0.08%, the probability of a Yahtzee in two rolls is 1.23% and the probability of a Yahtzee in three rolls is 3.43%. Since each of these are mutually exclusive, we add the probabilities together. This means that the probability of obtaining a Yahtzee in a given turn is approximately 4.74%. To put this into perspective, since 1/21 is approximately 4.74%, by chance alone a player should expect a Yahtzee once every 21 turns. In practice, it may take longer as an initial pair may be discarded in order to roll for something else, such as a straight.                                           cite cite this article          Format  mla  apa  chicago  Your Citation   Taylor, Courtney.

The scribes packed a lot of wisdom into those articles and bullet points, and I'll share various nuggets of knowledge in upcoming articles. 1 One of the articles talked about framing scientific information to make it relevant to different audiences, and for some odd reason I thought of my dad and Yahtzee. My dad is crazy brilliant. It's ridiculous how smart this man is. Yet every time I came home from break in college I'd have to re-explain DNA, starting from the beginning. A lot of people have this mental block with anything scientific or mathematic. But if we frame it in a way that is relevant, maybe we can convey complex (or even simple) scientific ideas in a way that will resonate and stick with the audience. Framing organizes central ideas; pares down complex issues by giving some aspects greater emphasis. My paternal grandma played the Penny Game with us bazillion grandchildren growing up to help teach us simple math (and it was a good game to play with a lot of people, and there were a lot of us around). 2 And growing up (and even now) my family played a ton of Yahtzee , which is (for those not in the know) a dice game that requires you to roll five dice each turn and check off various combinations (three of a kind, a straight, etc). 3 Perhaps I could use Yahtzee to teach Dad, a master Yahtzee player, simple statistical concepts. Take probability, for example. Anyone who has taken a stats class had heard the line, "Probability has no memory." This is key - probability is how probable or how likely an event is. To calculate probability, you divide the number of ways an event can occur by the total number of possible outcomes. Since I'm talking about Yahtzee, let's go with dice as an example. A single 6-sided die has, obviously, six sides. So, the probability of rolling a 1 on this 6-sided die is 1 (you can only roll the 1 once) divided by 6 (six total possible sides) = 1/6, or 0.167. Yet this is not additive - if I roll a 1 (my 1 in 6 chance), on the next roll probability starts all over again with a 1 in 6 chance. The probability that I roll a Yahtzee - all five dice are the same number, e.g. all five dice rolled come up as a 1 - in any particular game is about 1 in 22, or a 4.6% chance , although the real probability is likely slightly less. This is why Yahtzees are scored as 50 points, because they're more difficult to roll. 4 But what if I want to pull a Babe Ruth and call my Yahtzee beforehand? Say I roll five dice and I announce that my plan is to get a Yahtzee in ones. 5 For any one die to come up as a 1, there is a 6^1 possibility of getting a one - 6 possible outcomes, 1 outcome I want (6x1 = 6, or a 1 in 6 chance). For any two dice to come up both as 1, there are 6^2 possibilities (6x6 = 36). And so on, up to 6^5 (=7776, or a 1 in 7776 chance). So, the probability of rolling a Yahtzee with ones on my first roll is 1 in 7776. Not good. Anyway, say by some statistical anomaly that I roll four dice that come up as 1 (a 1 in 1296 chance - 6^4, or 6x6x6x6=1296). What is the probability that the fifth die comes up as a 1? Surely fate has a hand in my game, and I'm more likely to roll a 1 since my other four dice are all 1, right? Nope. It's still back to that original 1 in 6 chance. Probability doesn't give a damn that if I score a Yahtzee I can beat my siblings and earn bragging rights until the next game. Anyway, this small example shows that no matter what you roll, the dice you have on the table won't influence the dice in your hand - probability has no memory of what it just rolled. Or, take a descriptive representation of statistics. Say I happen to have a list of every Yahtzee game I've played on my phone (which I do), and I want to know my average (mean) score. I have a total of 231 games saved (n=31). My high score is 522 (not too shabby!) and my low score is a laughingstock-worthy 126. 6 I add all 231 of my scores and (sum=57,647) and divide by the number of games, so 57,647 / 231 = 249.55. A trial of 300 Yahtzee games played on a handheld device (so you can't cheat, sadly) showed the following probabilities of obtaining certain scores: Score At Least     Probability 150                     98% 200                     81% 250                     45% 300                     13% 400                     3% 500                     1% Credit: Chris Young So, the probability of getting my average 249.55 score (let's just round up to 250, shall we? I had a baaaaad run of games there) is slightly higher than 45%. This of course is just something I plucked out of the air, but it shows how you can take something with which a person is familiar - a game of Yahtzee - and use it to illustrate scientific concepts. As I said above, framing pares down complex issues by giving some aspects greater emphasis. In this case, I used Yahtzee to illustrate probability and mean. A comprehensive stats lesson? Not by any stretch. But if I want my listener/reader to understand probability, I don't need to give the full history of the development of statistics, and it's a lot easier to use familiar examples so the reader/listener can imagine the concept. ------------------------------------------------------------------ *As far as I can tell this is the first EVER mention of Yahtzee on Scientific Blogging, which is in itself a travesty. I think this means I get a prize, right, Hank? If I was allowed to pick, I'd want the secret of your fabulous hair. But, as I assume that would require changing my name to Delilah, I'll settle for kudos. ;) 1 Seriously, it's good stuff, both for aspiring writers who have yet to pick up the pen (or keyboard) and those of us who have been doing it a long time. 2 It was also a good way for us grandkids to earn some money, as we were allowed to keep our winnings. Given that we played with pennies it was a pittance but to a kid a dollar is a LOT of money! Thus Grandma instilled in us a love of gambling and swearing in German. 3 The best part of the game was when anyone got a Yahtzee - all five dice were the same number - we would all throw up our arms and yell at the top of our lungs, "YAHTZEEEEEEEEEE!" and pound our fists on the table like drums. That was awesome. Not gonna lie, I still do it. 4 My aunt Margie always said that in Yahtzee, fours are hard to come by. Statistically this is inaccurate. But it's a good catch-phrase. 5 If you really did this in Yahtzee, you'd be hit with incredulous glances on all sides, as well as "WTF are you doing?" exclamations. And for good reason. This is an asinine move. 6 The average score in a game of Yahtzee is about 250, assuming you don't get a Yahtzee. If you get a Yahtzee, the average score is anywhere from 270-320, depending on whether you get the top bonus. Note that this is simply a calculation from the games on my phone - I have scored higher than 522 in my life, and sadly lower than 126.

 Games >      Yahtzee     Yahtzee is a game played with five 6-sided dice . Players take turns rolling the dice, and trying to get certain types of rolls, each with
 an assigned point value, as summarized in the following table. Players are allowed
 a total of three rolls, with any subset of dice capable of being set aside at each
 roll. In addition to runs of a single number, other rolls include 3 of a kind (three
 of the same number), 4 of a kind (four of the same number), full house (two of one
 number and three of another), small straight (4 numbers in a row), large straight
 (5 numbers in a row), Yahtzee (five of the same number), and chance (any roll).   aces sum of 1s twos sum of 2s threes sum of 3s fours sum of 4s fives sum of 5s sixes sum
 of 6s 3 of a kind sum
 of all dice 4 of a kind sum
 of all dice full house 25 sm. straight 30 lg. straight 40 Yahtzee 50 chance sum
 of all dice   In addition to points scored by obtaining various rolls of the dice, 35 bonus points are awarded if the total score from the first six categories exceeds 62.  Woodward (2003) has solved the game completely by computing all possible
 outcomes and working out optimal playing strategies (Peterson 2003, Woodward 2003).
 T. Verhoeff and E. Scheffers have independently computed all the optimal
 strategies, and appear to arrive at the same results as Woodward.  In a variant of the game known as triple Yahtzee, players try to get each type of roll three times over the course of the game instead of just once, with point values for each roll being placed in a single, double, or triple column, whose values are multiplied by the stated weight when scores are totaled. The following tables summarizes the probability of obtaining various rolls. In this table, lower-value rolls are excluded from the results, so, for example, the probability of obtaining a three of a kind excludes rolls that are actually fours of a kind or Yahtzees. Similarly, the three of a kind probability excludes rolls that are full houses, and the two of a kind probability excludes rolls that are small straights.   type 1 2 3 overall 2

In 1956, the couple approached businessman Edwin S. Lowe, who had made a fortune selling Bingo games in the 1920s, who bought the rights and eventually changed the name of the "yacht game" to "Yahtzee." Despite attempts to advertise the game, it did not sell very well that first year. However, after Lowe started throwing Yahtzee parties, the game took off thanks to word of mouth and has been widely played ever since (Hasbro). Hasbro, the game's current manufacturer, claims that as many as 100 million people worldwide play the game regularly (Peterson 2003).     SEE ALSO:  Dice           REFERENCES:  Hasbro.

Which side of the dice one gets yahtzee with doesn't matter (e.g. it doesn't matter if it is ones or twos etc.). I also assume perfect strategy is used, that is, after each throw one saves the number it is the most of (and if equal, just pick one at random).    probability     share | cite | improve this question      edited Sep 15 '17 at 21:26       Xander Henderson   10.9k 7 25 42        asked Aug 10 '10 at 11:22       runaros   156 7              1      @runaros: Would you please explain the game, what does it mean "to get yahtzee"? – Tom Stephens  Aug 10 '10 at 12:25        1      Throwing five or six dice and trying to get various combinations of those dice.

A yahtzee is when at the aftermath of a roll, all dice (those rolled and those saved from previous rolls) show the same number. – yohay kaplan  Aug 10 '10 at 13:16            @runaros do you mean in a single round(with rerolls allowed in a round) or over the course of the entire game?

Let $f(N,X,Y)$ be the probability of getting all 1s with N dice, each with X sides, in at most Y rolls, where after each roll, 1s are retained and only non-1 dice are re-rolled.  Working 1 roll at a time, the first roll could have exactly $k=0,\dots,N$ 1s.  The probability of exactly k 1s in a single roll is ${N\choose k}\left(\frac{1}{X}\right)^k\left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right)^{N-k}$ and having k 1s in the first roll, we then need $N-k$ 1s in the remaining $Y-1$ rolls.  So, 
$$f(N,X,Y)=\sum_{k=0}^{N}{N\choose k}\left(\frac{1}{X}\right)^k\left(\frac{x-1}{x}\right)^{N-k}f(N-k,X,Y-1).$$
Also, the probability of all 1s on 0 dice is 1 (0 of the 0 dice are guaranteed to be 1), so $f(0,X,Y)=1$, and the probability of all 1s on $N\ge 0$ dice in 0 rolls is 0 (can't get any 1s without rolling some dice), so $f(N,X,0)=0$ for $N\ge 0$.  This is a complete definition of $f(N,X,Y)$, though it does not lend itself to easy computation.  (However, software like Mathematica may be able to compute from this definition.  In Mathematica: f[n_, x_, y_] := If[n == 0, 1, If[y == 0, 0, 
       Sum[
    Binomial[n, k]*(1/x)^k*(1 - 1/x)^(n - k)*f[n - k, x, y - 1], 
         {k, 0, n}]]] .)     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Aug 10 '10 at 16:25       Isaac   29.1k 11 82 127              1      Nice answer.

For 5 normal (6-sided), dice, the exact probability of achieving a yahtzee, following the optimum strategy, given $n$ rolls is  $1+\frac{53}{13} \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{2n+1}+\frac{11 \cdot 5^n}{13 \cdot 2^{n+5} \cdot 3^{3n+1}}  -\frac{5^n}{8 \cdot 3^{2n-2}}  -\frac{7 \cdot 5^{n+1}}{ 2^{n+5} 3^{n-1}} $  For example, setting $n=3$ gives $\frac{347897}{7558272}$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 11 '10 at 14:03       I.

Now I am sorry that I haven't used Matlab ( which would be much less code ) but I implemented it in c++. The code is simply your rules implemented in my not so good c++. I used g++ 4.6.3 on Ubuntu 12.04. If you run the code, it will print the results and also write the pairs (number of dices | avg. number of throws) in out.txt. The result is plotted attached, plotted with gnuplot for number of dices $\leq$ 40.  See the results here as I dont know much about gnuplot and couldn't upload a .ps to MathSE I had to upload it there. For every number of dices, 10000 experiments have been player.
The code is probably terrible slow so everyone feel free to improve it ;)  This here does the same computation for number of dices $\leq 400$ but only 1000 experiments each.  Maybe you can use this to varify any of the formulas.  yahtzee.cpp:  #include <iostream>

The probability of rolling a 4 on one die is 1/6 (one in six).  Makes sense since a die has six sides and the 4 is only on one of those sides.  The formula my math muncher used looks vaguely familiar, so it's probably something I learned in school and promptly forgot -- like cursive writing, playing the recorder, and how to play nicely with others.  But I digress.  The formula is (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/7776.  This reflects the 1 in 6 odds multiplied by the five dice.  But 1/7776 is the probability of rolling a Yahtzee with one specific number (the four's, in our example).  Since we would be happy with ANY of the six numbers showing up on all five dice, we have to multiply our first result by six.  6 x 1/7776 = 1/1296.  So...  The probability of rolling a Yahtzee on the first roll is 1 in 1296 or 0.08%  THE ODDS OF GETTING A YAHTZEE IN TWO ROLLS  Most likely, you're not going to get that cherished 5-in-a-row on the first toss.  That means you'll be rolling at least twice (assuming your goal is a Yahtzee).  Adding a second roll makes things a quinterfrabillion times more complicated!  For example, on the first roll you might get four 4's.  Then you'll re-roll the one die that doesn't match.  Let's assume you get a Yahtzee on this second roll.  Here's the math behind those particular two rolls.  One the first roll you get four 4's.  Since there was four 1/6 chances of rolling a 4, and one 5/6 chance of not rolling a 4, the formula is (1 x 6) x (1 x 6) x (1 x 6) x (1 x 6) x (5/6) = 5/7776.  But wait a minute!  ANY of the five dice could have been the non-4.  To express that, the combination formula is C(5,1) =5.  You need trust me on that... because I needed to trust my math magician on that.  So if we multiply the first odds by the second odds  --  5/7776 x 5/1 -- we get 24/7776 as the odds of rolling four 4's on the first roll.  Now... we need to calculate the chances of rolling one 4 on one die on our second roll.  That would be 1/6.  Thus (and I'm only using 'thus' to make it sound like I know what I'm talking about) the chance of rolling a Yahtzee of five 4's in two rolls, assuming the first roll gave us four 4's, is (1/6) x (25/7776) = 25/46656.  But wait!   There's more!  There are six different number on each die, so we have to multiply the above by six to reflect that.  Hence (I already used 'thus'), 6 x 25/46656 = 150/46656 (or 0.32%).  But wait again!   There's more again!  Obviously the above isn't the only way to get a Yahtzee in just two rolls.  We could get three of a kind and then match the remaining two dice on the second roll.  The chance of that are 6 x C(5,3) x (25/7776) x (1/36) = 0.54%.  Or maybe we only match two on the first roll and the remaining three on the second roll.  That gives us 6 x C(5,2) x (100/7776) x (1/216) = 0.36 %.  Finally, the first roll could give us five non-matching values, so we keep one and roll the remaining four.  Assuming that gets us a Yahtzee, the formula would be (6!/7776) x (1/1296) = 0.33%.  The '!' in the formula means the factorial for that number.  The factorial for 6 is 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1.  The above cases are mutually exclusive -- they don't rely on each other to get their possible results -- so the possibility of getting a Yahtzee in two rolls is obtained by adding them all up.  So...  The probability of rolling a Yahtzee in two rolls is 1.23%  THE ODDS OF GETTING A YAHTZEE IN THREE ROLLS  Go take a couple of aspirin or ibuprofen, and then read the next part.  Obviously, when we add a third roll there are a lot more variations that are possible.  We need to calculate the odds of all of them.  The chances of rolling four of a kind, then no match on the second roll, and matching the last die on the third roll is 6 x C(5,4) x (5/7776) x (5/6) x (1/6) = 0.27%.  The odds of rolling three of a kind, then no match, then a matching pair on the last roll is 6 x C(5,3) x (25/7776) x (25/36) x (1/36) = 0.37%.  The probability of getting a matching pair, then zip, then matching the remaining three on the third roll is 6 x C(5,2) x (100/7776) x (125/216) x (1/216) = 0.21%.  The probability of rolling a single die, then absolutely nothing matching it, then getting four of a kind on the third roll is (6!/7776) x (625/1296) x (1/1296) = 0.003%.  In other words, not great.  The probability of rolling three matching numbers, matching one more on the next roll, followed by matching the final die on the third roll is 6 x C(5,3) x (25/7776) x C(2,1) x (5/36) x (1/6) = 0.89%.  The odds of rolling a pair, matching an additional pair on the next roll, followed by matching the fifth die on the third roll is 6 x C(5, 2) x (100/7776) x C(3, 2) x (5/216) x (1/6) = 0.89%.  The possibility of rolling a pair, then matching one die on the second roll, followed by matching the last two dice on the last roll is 6 x C(5,2) x (100/7776) x C(3,1) x (25/216) x (1/36) = 0.74%.  The chances of you rolling one of a kind, another die like it on the next roll, and then the needed three of a kind on the final roll is (6!/7776) x C(4,1) x (100/1296) x (1/216) = 0.01%.  The probability of rolling nothing that matches, then three of a kind to match the one you chose on the first roll, followed by a final match on the third roll is (6!/7776) x C(4,3) x (5/1296) x (1/6) = 0.02%.  The odds of rolling one of a kind, then a matching pair on the second roll, and yet another matching pair to match on the last roll is (6!/7776) x C(4,2) x (25/1296) x (1/36) = 0.03%.  When you add up all of the above, it means...  The probability of rolling a Yahtzee in three rolls is 3.43%  THE TOTAL PROBABILITY OF GETTING A YAHTZEE  Now... adding it all up.  The chances of getting a Yahtzee in one roll is 0.08%.  The odds of doing it in two rolls is much better at 1.23%.  And the probability moves up to 3.43% in three rolls.  These are mutually exclusive (not dependent on each other) so we add them up to find out that...  The probability of getting a Yahtzee in any given turn is 4.74%  That means, on average, you should get a Yahtzee every 21 or 22 turns, if all you're doing is trying to get that magic 5-in-a-row.  However, in a real game of Yahtzee, you'll sacrifice some of those attempts to score in other categories, such as a full house or straight.  from http://yahtzeeonlinezone.blogspot.ca/   2 comments share save hide report all 2 comments sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion?

( self.theydidthemath ) submitted 3 months ago by Money_fingers Credit to CaptainNirvana for the original reddit post on this, from which I took some text. But he forgot that you get three rolls per turn. So I have redone it. And now I feel better.  According to this interesting website , the chance of rolling a Yahtzee in a single three-roll turn is 4.6209%. Let's say each roll takes five seconds. So when you roll the first time, five seconds pass to look at the dice then collect them. For each of the progressing rolls, another five seconds is added.  So you roll the first shaker. 21 turns at 3 rolls each... all duds. But that 22nd one? Yahtzee. 21.640805 turns times 3 rolls per turn times 5 seconds per roll equals 324.612 seconds. Just shy of 5 and a half minutes to get a Yahtzee. So far so good.  Time to try for the second Yahtzee in a row. Failed. So, you start a new game. You do the 1 in 21.640805 chance again until, this time on the 21st turn, you land another Yahtzee. Time to try again for a second consecutive one. Failed.  It will take just over 21 times of this whole process to roll two Yahtzees in a row. 1/(0.046209)2 = 1 in 468.32444. For 468 turns, you either see a flop to begin with, or you get your hopes up with a Yahtzee then fail to get a second. (It will taunt you: you'll get one Yahtzee, then on the second roll, you'll get a 1-1-1-1-2, or many variations of that.). You'll land your first back-to-back Yahtzee in about 2 hours. Not awful... yet.  You keep going; I assume you're already imagining how excruciating this is going to get. You finally get 12 Yahtzees in a row (billions of years later, we'll get to that), then on the thirteenth turn you get four 2's and a--it's on its side, it's gonna tip!--a 3.  The math is uber simple: 1/(0.046209)13, which equals... a 0.000000000000000043797% chance to do it in your first 13 turns. A 1 in 228,325,589,819,893,405 (and exactly 481 other numbers after the decimal point that I no longer care about) chance.  Well how long would it take for you to achieve that? 228,325,589,819,893,40 turns x 3 rolls per turn x 5 seconds per roll equals:  3,424,883,847,298,401,075 seconds -or-  108,602,354,366 years, 141 days, 11 hours, 51 minutes, 15 seconds. Interesting note: this calculations works out to 15 seconds exactly if you kept all the decimals and fractions (which it should since you are rolling every 5 seconds).  If you were born and learned how to do nothing but sleep and play Yahtzee (and eat, while playing Yahtzee, and poop while playing Yahtzee, etc.) 16 hours a day, every single day of the year (including Sundays and holidays) minus a two week vacation, and you teach ONE kid to play Yahtzee, and they teach their kid to play Yahtzee, and so on and so forth into the unfor(Yaht)zeeable future, with an average of eighty years per span (assuming you played starting at age 5 and died at 85), it would take 2,117,513,853.83 generations before someone rolled the perfect game. According to this website last updated in 2011 (but who cares, and I'm too lazy to look up a new one) the population of the earth today is only 6.5% of the amount of people that have ever lived ( cough Cameron's old teacher cough ). This means there have been 107,692,307,692 people to have ever lived as of 2011. You would have to have roughly 2% of the number of people who have EVER lived (as of 2011) in offspring alone, all playing Yahtzee for 80 years to finally hit the perfect game; just less than a third of the total population of 2011.  So, you can find just over 2.1 billion of your closest friends, and all play together for 80 years to statistically guarantee someone will roll a perfect game -OR- you can become immortal and play for 108,602,354,366 years, 141 days, 11 hours, 51 minutes, 15 seconds to roll the perfect game. Just imagine how excited you would be during that last 15 seconds? Of course you still probably wouldn't roll it. Why? Good question:  This math didn't take into account that 6 of the Yahtzees HAVE to be specifically 1's, 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's, and 6's in order for you to score the perfect game. So 108 and a half billion years later, you finally hit 13 Yahtzees in a row only to discover that you didn't roll a Yahtzee in 2's .... which means you have to start all over again. But hey, I didn't take leap years into account, so you get an extra day off every once in a while!  PS, the dude who did this using only 1 roll per turn came up with a number of required people so astronomically large that it would take something like 3,000 times the volume of our Sun to encompass the volume of all the people who would have to be playing Yahtzee. My calculation is significantly more reasonable.   4 comments share save hide report all 4 comments sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion?

I had a computer version where you could get the Yahtzee bonus without using any other space, which means there was no maximum score.  The probability to have 13 Yahtzees in 25 rolls is much higher. We have a binomial distribution with p=0.046209 and n=25, this gives a probability of 1.3*10 -11 for k=13. If you need 5 minutes per game you get one of these games every 730,000 years. We cannot end with a Yahtzee as far as I understand, so actually we need 13 in 24 rolls, making it a bit worse (1.5 million years), but if we want to go for such an event we would stop all games that don't start with a Yahtzee, which means we only need 12 out of 23, plus about 5 minutes until we start actually playing a game (doubling the time per game), which leads to 250,000 years. If you can get a million players to work on it you are done in 3 months of pure playing time (on average).   permalink embed save report give gold reply [–] Money_fingers [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 months ago *  (2 children) It's actually 13 Yahtzees in 13 tries with the formula you used, because p accounts for 3 rolls, an entire turn, thus making my probability correct. You don't get 25 shots at p=0.046209, you only get 13 and they have to be consecutive.
If you read the website that linked to, the 4.6209% chance is using all 3 rolls.
Definition of a perfect game: 1575 points. According to the rules, bonus Yahtzees in the bottom section are also wild cards, thus still giving you the LG and SM straight points. So 1 regular Yahtzee, and 12 bonus Yahtzees, filling the game.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] mfb- 12✓  1 point 2 points 3 points  3 months ago  (1 child) See my edit, my comment applies to a different interpretation of the rules.   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply [–] Money_fingers [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 months ago  (0 children) Yep, got it now   permalink embed save parent report give gold reply about blog about advertise careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

Yahtzee        Yahtzee is a dice game based on Poker. The object of the game is to roll certain combinations of numbers with five dice.  At each turn you throw dice trying to get a good combination of numbers; different combinations give different scores.  While luck plays a big role in Yahtzee, strategy makes a significant difference. The reason for this is that you score each combination just once, and the number of different combinations in which you can score is equal to the number of turns in the game. This means that you have to make wise choices about when to score in each combination and you have to be careful about what combinations you seek at each turn.  Rules and Scoring  The game takes thirteen turns. Each turn consists of up to three separate rolls of the dice.  On the first roll you roll all five of the dice.  After the first and second roll, you can hold any subset of the five dice you want (including none of the dice or all of the dice) and roll the rest trying to get a good combination.  After the three rolls (or after the first or second roll if you choose to stop) you must find a place among the thirteen boxes in the scorecard to put your score. The score you get depends on the box that you choose and the combination that you have rolled.  After a box is used, you can't use it again, so you have to choose wisely. This means that, in general, you don't have to choose the box that gives you the highest score for the combination you have rolled, since it may be advantageous to save that box for an even better roll later in the game. In fact, there are many situations it which it makes sense to put a 0 in a "bad" box instead of a low score in another "good" box because doing so would block the good box for future turns.  The Yahtzee scorecard contains two sections: the upper section and the lower section.      The Upper Section  In the upper section, there are six boxes, each corresponding to one of the six face values of the dice. For these boxes, you enter the sum of the dice with the corresponding face value (and ignore all other dice). For example, if you roll 5 3 3 5 3 you may enter a score of 9 in the third spot or a score of 10 in the fifth spot.   Bonus: At the end of the game, you get a bonus of 35 points if the total number of points you scored in the upper section is 63 or higher.  The seemingly random number 63 corresponds to having scored a combination with three dice of the corresponding face value in each of the upper section boxes (though any upper section total of 63 or greater is rewarded with the bonus).  The Lower Section  Here you can score for various combinations.   3 of a kind: Score in this box if the dice include 3 or more of the same number. The score is the total of all five dice (unlike the upper section, where only the dice of one number are summed).   4 of a kind: Score in this box if the dice include 4 or more of the same number. The score is the total of all five dice.   Full House: Score in this box if the dice show three of one number and two of another (for example, 2 6 6 2 2). The score is 25 points.   Small Straight: Score in this box if the dice show any sequence of 4 numbers (for example 3 2 4 4 5).  The score is 30 points.   Large Straight: Score in this box if the dice show any sequence of 5 numbers (for example 5 2 4 6 3).  The score is 40 points.   Chance: Score in this box with any combination. The score is the total of the five dice.   Yahtzee: Score in this box if the dice show five of the same number. The score is 50 points.   Yahtzee Bonus: If you roll a second Yahtzee and the Yahtzee box is already filled with 50 points, you get a 100 points bonus. If you roll a Yahtzee and your Yahtzee box is filled with a zero, you do not receive this bonus.  In either case, you must fill one of the other boxes on your scorecard using the "joker rules" as follows:  if possible, you must fill the upper section box corresponding to the number you rolled. If that box is already filled, you must fill in any open lower section box.  For the 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, and chance boxes, this means scoring the total of all 5 dice.  For the full house, small straight, and large straight boxes, this means scoring 25, 30, or 40 points respectively (even though you did not actually roll the corresponding combination).  If the entire lower section is filled you must enter a zero in any open box in the upper section.  Strategy  Now we are going to review a little bit of strategy for playing Yahtzee.  Basic Tips  The following are generally regarded as the basic things to keep in mind while playing Yahtzee.   You should generally aim for the 35 points bonus by filling the upper section with high scores (so as to get at least 63 points) near the beginning of the game.  If you roll a combination for which your available boxes give a low score, fill in a zero in the 1's box (or even the 2's or 3's), since high scores in the other boxes may compensate for this.  Early in the game you should use the chance box only as a fall-back for when you are trying for a high point combination and fail.  You want to keep the chance box available for a situation where your options are very limited.  If you have a bad roll of the dice near the end of the game, you may enter a zero in the Yahtzee box or one of the other difficult combinations.  If you roll a pair of 1's or 2's early in the game, go for a full house, straight, or one of the other high numbers you rolled.  Keeping the 1's or 2's to seek a 3 or 4 of a kind will not get you many points.  Plus, it is a good idea to keep the 1's and 2's boxes available for later in the game to have the possibility of putting a zero there.  As an example, if on your first turn your initial roll is 1 1 2 5 6, it turns out that keeping only the 5 is the choice that maximizes your expected score for the game.  If you roll four of a kind with 4's, 5's, or 6's, take the points in the upper section if they are available, not in the 4 of a kind box. This will help you get the 35 points bonus at the end of the game.  You should always try for a Yahtzee early in the game. If you roll a 3 or 4 of a kind on your first or second roll and you have the corresponding box in the upper section open, you should definitely go for the Yahtzee. Plus, if you saved your chance, 1's, or 2's boxes, you can score a zero there if you fail to get the Yahtzee.   Advanced Strategy  Any kind of advanced strategy for Yahtzee has to rely on calculating or estimating the expected final score you will get with respect to your current position in the game and the different possibilities you have for scoring. This is a very difficult task, since in general it involves too many calculations.  As with most board games, the best way to actually apply this principle is by playing a lot and developing some intuition as to what the best choices are. In general, you should be able to discard many possibilities just by looking at them, and then choose among the remaining ones in the best way you can.  To get a grasp of the kind of calculations you would need to do in order to determine the best move in Yahtzee, we will consider the following simplified example.  Suppose that you are playing a "1-turn Yahtzee" game (all the boxes are empty and you are tying to maximize your score for a single turn), and your second roll leaves you with 3 3 3 1 1.  Which (if any) of the dice should you keep for the last roll?  To solve this, observe first that since this is the 1-turn version of Yahtzee, all boxes are available and your only goal is to get the highest possible score in this turn. It should be clear that the only sensible choices are keeping everything (scoring 25 points for a full house) or re-rolling both 1's (trying for a Yahtzee). What is the best choice?  If you keep everything, the best score you can get is scoring the full house box, and you get 25 points. If you re-roll both 1's, three things may happen:   You get two different numbers. This will happen with probability 5/6. In this case, your best score corresponds to either the 3 or 4 of a kind box, where you add up the five numbers. In this case, the maximum score you can get is 20 (if you rolled a 5 and a 6).  You get two equal numbers, different from 3. This happens with probability (5/6) * (1/6) = 5/36.  In this case you rolled a full house, and it is the best box to score in this case, since any other possibility scores at most 3 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 21 points. Thus, you score 25 points.  You get two 3's. This will happen with probability 1/36, and you score 50 points for a Yahtzee.   With all this, we can say that the average score you get if you re-roll the 1's is less than   Thus, we see that your average score when re-rolling is less than 25, so you should keep all the dice and score a full house. As you observe, even in this very simplified situation, the calculations get impossible to carry out during a game.  Links  You can find more information on Yahtzee's rules, strategies and history on the Internet. For instance, you can try Wikipedia.   You can find an optimal Yahtzee player and proficiency test at here.     Problems   Some of the problems are very easy, but some are more involved, especially the last two. You may want to go over the review of basic probability before trying them.   If you roll a die three times, what is the probability that you will get at least one six?  Suppose that on the first roll you get 5 5 4 3 2. If you pick up one of the fives and try for a large straight, what is the probability you will succeed in the two rolls that remain?  Suppose that on the first roll you get 6 5 5 3 2. If you pick up one of the fives and try for a large straight, what is the probability you will succeed in the two rolls that remain? Is it the same as in the previous problem?  In the top six rows of the score card you want to score at least three of a given number (especially for the high numbers like 5 and 6). Suppose you roll 6, 6, 5, 2, 1 the first time, and re-roll all non 6's on the next two tries. What is the probability you will end up with at least three 6's? Exactly four 6's? A Yahtzee (five 6's)?   Suppose on the first roll you get 5, 4, 4, 3, 1. To try to get a large straight you pick up a 4 and the 1 and then roll again. If you get a 6 or 2 you keep it, and you re-roll the others. Of course if you happen to get a 2 and 1 on the second roll you stop and are happy. What is the probability you will end up with a large straight? What is the probability you will end up with a small straight?  Suppose instead you keep 5, 4, 3, 1, and re-roll 1 die. If you get a 2 you are happy. If you get a 6 you re-roll the 1. Otherwise you take a second chance at rolling the 2. What is the probability you will end up with a large straight? a small straight?  Suppose you are playing a game where you can roll a single die one or two times. Your objective is to get a high number. After the first roll you can choose whether to keep the number you got or re-roll. Then the best strategy is to keep a 4, 5, or 6, while re-rolling a 1, 2, or 3 (try to convince yourself of this). Now suppose we play the same game but with the option of rolling the single die one, two, or three times. As before, after the second roll you should keep a 4, 5, or 6, and re-roll a 1, 2, or 3. Can you come up with a strategy on what to do after the first roll such that the expected (or average) score you get in the three rolls game is better than the expected score in the two rolls game with the strategy we proposed? What is the expected score when playing with your proposed strategy?  These types of calculations are useful in the actual Yahtzee game, for example when you are trying to score well in the chance box.  It is the last roll of the game and you need a Yahtzee to win. After the first roll you keep the dice of the most common number you rolled and then re-roll twice to see if you can end up with all of that number. (We ignore the possibility that you change the number for which you are looking after the first roll, e.g., you only had one 5 after the first roll and then rolled two 4's.)  In the case of a tie on the first roll, choose one of the numbers that appears the maximal number of times and keep only the dice with that number. What is the probability you end up with a Yahtzee?  This problem is rather difficult, so don't expect to get a fast answer.  Here is a hint: first compute the probability of getting 2, 3, 4, or 5 of a kind, or all different numbers in the first roll; then try to compute the probability of passing from having i of a kind in a roll to having j on the next roll and try to use these "transition probabilities".  In reality, if you are going for a Yahtzee and you keep two 4's after you first roll but roll three 5's on your second roll, you will try for a Yahtzee in 5's on your last roll.  Repeat the previous problem, but now incorporating the fact that after your second roll you may change the number that you are seeking.  Once again, if there is a tie, choose one number to keep.  If you get all different numbers on your first roll, re-roll all of the dice.

December 2005  11:20 AM         That is something we asked ourselves the other night as we were having a game. It happens - you roll all 5 dice and get a yahtzee. So, I was wondering if there are any mathematicians out there who can tell me what the odds are of doing that. Getting the same value on all 5 dice in one roll. Surely there must be some way of calculating that possibility? I'm new to the message boards on this site, so I hope I'm in the right board. Thanks.

December 2005  11:39 AM         Five dice, all the same number: Let's assume you're throwing all of them sequentially, rather than at the same time.  The calculations are easier to explain (though it's the identical answer - just easier to conceptualize). First die - doesn't matter what you throw, because we're going to calculate what it would take to get the other four to match it.  This way, we will calculate the odds for ANY Yatsee (any of the six possible ones), not just a single one. Second die - has a 1/6 chance of matching the first one. Third die - has a 1/6 chance of matching the first one, and a 1/6 * 1/6, or 1/36 chance of matching both of the first ones. Continuing on, the chance that the fifth die will match all of the previous four dice is 1/6 * 1/6 * 1/6 * 1/6, or 1/1296. Therefore, the odds of getting a Yatsee in a single throw is 1/1296, or about 0.08%. Glad to be of service, DV! -------------------- "I'm singing and deranged!"

You *might* roll all five dice the same on your first roll:   The initial subtotal is: (1/6) ^ 4 If not, then you have to start breaking down individual cases. Case 1:  you rolled four of a kind.  Unfortunately, there are five different ways to do this, so the odds are 5 * (1/6) ^ 3.  (Call this X4.)  You might match it up with your next roll, so add X4 * 1/6 to the running subtotal.  However, you might miss, and then catch it on your second try.  So add X4 * 5/6 * 1/6 to the subtotal. etc. etc. Lotta cases.

Probability of Rolling Certain
Scores  It seems very attractive to try and calculate the probability of
completing various target scores (such as full house) from various
starting positions, but in fact its appalling hard to do because there
are so many combinations possible. The first roll is entirely random,
but has dramatic affect on the subsequent chance of achieving a given
roll, so there's no fixed starting point for an analysis. Also, the
chances are affected by what has already been rolled. If you've used
5's and three of a kind already, a start throw of 5-5-3-6-4 is much
less likely to yield a good result than it would at the start of a game.  The chance of rolling a yahtzee in one turn been calculated* as 4.6% or
about 1 in 22 rolls but even that assumes that the player is targeting
a yatzee
and doesn't get tempted to go for a straight after the first roll, or
take a random full house after roll two. These are things that happen
in real games, so the real odds are a little less. And this is just an analysis on one roll type, not taking into account
previous scores or choices of how to select a given roll.  The attempt
to statistically assess the likelihood of acheiving a given total game
score
is imponderably difficult .  * References - Tim

alogrithms to simulate Yahtzee games. Oliver ran his script for 300,000
turns and found about 1:22 resulted in Yahtzee which matches theory
very closely. Tim ran his for an impressive 15 million and came up with
1:27, but his algorithm didn't seem so good at playing the game,
because it got a low score of just 37 which its doubtful if a 
human player could do without deliberately aiming for a low score. Its
high score was 918. It also showed only 60% chance of scoring at least
200, compared to over 80% by human expert Chris Young. Of course its
high score is better due to the sheer number of games played.     Run
