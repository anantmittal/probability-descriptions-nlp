Category Cancer A-Z          Cancer Basics             Lifetime Risk of Developing or Dying From Cancer      The lifetime risk of developing or dying from cancer refers to the chance a person has, over the course of his or her lifetime (from birth to death), of being diagnosed with or dying from cancer. These risk estimates, like annual incidence and mortality data, provide another measure of how widespread cancer is in the United States.  The following tables list lifetime risks of developing and dying from certain cancers for men and women. The information is from the US National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Database, and is based on incidence and mortality data for the United States from 2012 through 2014, the most current years for which data are available.  The risk is expressed both in terms of a percentage and as odds.   For example, the risk that a man will develop bladder cancer during his lifetime is 3.76%. This means he has about 1 chance in 27 of developing bladder cancer (100/3.76 = 26.6).  Put another way, 1 out of every 27 men in the United States will develop bladder cancer during his lifetime.   These numbers are average risks for the overall US population. Your risk may be higher or lower than these numbers, depending on your particular risk factors.

The number of deaths was 166.1 per 100,000 men and women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2010-2014 cases and deaths.  Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer : Approximately 38.5 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer of any site at some point during their lifetime, based on 2012-2014 data.  Prevalence of This Cancer : In 2014, there were an estimated 14,738,719 people living with cancer of any site in the United States.   Survival Statistics   How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Cancer of Any Site?  Relative survival statistics compare the survival of patients diagnosed with cancer with the survival of people in the general population who are the same age, race, and sex and who have not been diagnosed with cancer. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.          Percent Surviving 5 Years  67.0%      Based on data from SEER 18 2007-2013. Gray figures represent those who have died from cancer of any site. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.

The number of deaths was 166.1 per 100,000 men and women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2010-2014 cases and deaths.  Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer : Approximately 38.5 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer of any site at some point during their lifetime, based on 2012-2014 data.  Prevalence of This Cancer : In 2014, there were an estimated 14,738,719 people living with cancer of any site in the United States.   Survival Statistics   How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Cancer of Any Site?  Relative survival statistics compare the survival of patients diagnosed with cancer with the survival of people in the general population who are the same age, race, and sex and who have not been diagnosed with cancer. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.          Percent Surviving 5 Years  67.0%      Based on data from SEER 18 2007-2013. Gray figures represent those who have died from cancer of any site. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.

By Mayo Clinic Staff    When first diagnosed with cancer, many people ask about their prognosis. You might want to know whether your cancer is relatively easy or more difficult to cure. Your doctor can't predict the future, but can make an estimate based on other people's experiences with the same cancer.   What is a cancer survival rate?    Cancer survival rates or survival statistics tell you the percentage of people who survive a certain type of cancer for a specific amount of time. Cancer statistics often use an overall five-year survival rate.  Survival rates are usually given in percentages. For instance, the overall five-year survival rate for bladder cancer is 78 percent. That means that of all people who have bladder cancer, 78 of every 100 are living five years after diagnosis. Conversely, 22 out of every 100 are dead within five years of a bladder cancer diagnosis.  Cancer survival rates are based on research from information gathered on hundreds or thousands of people with a specific cancer. An overall survival rate includes people of all ages and health conditions who have been diagnosed with your cancer, including those diagnosed very early and those diagnosed very late.  Your doctor may be able to give you more specific statistics based on your stage of cancer. For instance, 56 percent, or a little more than half, of people diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer live for at least five years after diagnosis. The five-year survival rate for people diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer that has spread (metastasized) to other areas of the body is 5 percent.  Overall survival rates don't specify whether cancer survivors are still undergoing treatment at five years or if they've become cancer-free (achieved remission). Other types of survival rates that give more specific information include:   Disease-free survival rate. This is the number of people who have no evidence of cancer after treatment.  Progression-free survival rate. This is the number of people who have been treated for cancer and either have no signs of cancer recurrence or who have cancer that has remained stable without growing.   Cancer survival rates often use a five-year survival rate. That doesn't mean cancer can't recur beyond five years. Certain cancers can recur many years after first being found and treated. For some cancers, if it has not recurred by five years after initial diagnosis, the chance of a later recurrence is very small. Discuss your risk of a cancer recurrence with your doctor.   How are cancer survival rates used?    You and your doctor might use survival statistics to:   Understand your prognosis. The experience of other people in your same situation can give you and your doctor an idea of your prognosis — the chance your cancer will be cured. Other factors include age and general health. Your doctor uses these factors to help you understand the seriousness of your condition.   Develop a treatment plan. Statistics can also show how people with your same cancer type and stage respond to treatment. You can use this information, along with your goals for treatment, to weigh the pros and cons of each treatment option.  For instance, if two treatments give you similar chances for remission, but one has more side effects, you might choose the option with fewer side effects.  In another example, a treatment may offer a chance for a cure, but only for 1 or 2 people out of every 100. For some, these chances are promising enough to put up with side effects. For others, the chance for a cure isn't worth the treatment's side effects.  Your doctor can help you understand the benefits and risks of each treatment.

Females have the highest lifetime risk of breast, lung and bowel cancers.  Males have the highest lifetime risk of prostate, lung and bowel cancers.  See more in-depth statistics on lifetime risk of being diagnosed with cancer        Preventable cancers     A person’s risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including age, genetics, and exposure to risk factors.  Around 4 in 10 UK cancer cases every year could be prevented, that’s more than 135,000 every year.  Nearly 112,000 England cases, around 13,000 Scotland cancer cases, around 7,200 Wales cancer cases, and around 3,500 Northern Ireland cancer cases every year could be prevented.  Lung cancer, bowel cancer, melanoma skin cancer, and breast cancer together account for almost two-thirds of all preventable cancer cases in the UK.  For 10 cancer types, including two of the five most common cancer types in the UK (lung cancer and melanoma skin cancer), more than 70% of UK cancer cases were attributable to known risk factors.  Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, exposure to certain substances at work, exposure to certain infections, drinking alcohol, and eating too little fibre each cause 3-4% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to ionising radiation and eating processed meat each cause 1-2% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to outdoor air pollution and doing too little physical activity each cause 1% or less of cancer cases in the UK.  See more in-depth statistics on preventable cancer cases        Tobacco statistics     Smoking is the largest cause of cancer in the UK.  Around 1 in 5 UK adults currently smoke cigarettes, around 9.4 million people.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults in the UK decreases with age.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults has decreased since the late 1940s.  In recent years the difference between men and women in cigarette smoking prevalence has narrowed.  Cigarette smoking in England is more common in people living in the most deprived areas.  Cigarette smoking prevalence varies by ethnic group but patterns are difficult to interpret.  Worldwide, 1 billion adults currently smoke cigarettes.  Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in the world, and around a third of tobacco-caused deaths are due to cancer (2015 projected).  Around 11,000 deaths per year in the UK are caused by second-hand smoke, four-fifths occurring at home and the rest from the workplace.  More than half of smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are successful.  Almost 4 in 10 smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in Scotland are successful.  See more in-depth statistics on tobacco        Childhood smoking statistics     Smoking prevalence is higher in children whose parents, siblings and/or peers smoke.  Almost 5 in 100 children under 16 in the UK smoke regularly.  Almost a fifth of children have tried smoking, and girls are much more likely than boys to smoke.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England increases with age.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England has decreased since the 1990s.  Around 40% of regular smokers in Great Britain began smoking before age 16.  Around 7 million smokers in 2012 in the UK started smoking before the age of 18.  An average of 136,500 children aged 11-15 started smoking each year between 2012 and 2014 in the UK but the number of new childhood smokers each year is falling.  See more in-depth statistics on childhood smoking        Alcohol statistics     Drinking too much alcohol causes 3% of cancer cases in the UK.  Nearly 6 in 10 adults in Great Britain drank alcohol at least once in the past week.  Under 1 in 10 children aged 11-15 in England drank alcohol at least once in the past week. Alcohol drinking prevalence in children increases with age, and rates have decreased since 2003.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain peaks in middle-age.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain has decreased since 2005, this is mainly due to declining prevalence among younger adults.  Around half of adults in Great Britain who drank alcohol at least once in the past week exceeded the recommended daily alcohol limit on their heaviest drinking day.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain is higher in employed people compared with unemployed or economically inactive people.  Alcohol drinking prevalence adults in Great Britain is more common in white people than non-white people.  Alcohol drinking causes an estimated 6% of deaths worldwide, around 1 in 8 of which are due to cancer (2012). Alcohol drinking prevalence is highest in Europe and America.  See more in-depth statistics on alcohol        Adult overweight and obesity statistics     Overweight and obesity causes more than 1 in 20 cancer cases in the UK.  More than 6 in 10 UK adults are overweight or obese (body mass index 25 or more).  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in the UK increases until late middle-age and then decreases in older adults. However, prevalence of overweight and obesity increases in Scotland in older females and in Northern Ireland.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England has increased since the early 1990s.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England is higher in lower-income households compared with higher-income households.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity varies by ethnic group in England.  Overweight and obesity prevalence is increasing particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Overweight and obesity are leading causes of death worldwide.  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for adults        Childhood overweight and obesity statistics     People who are overweight or obese in early life may remain obese in adulthood.  Around 3 in 10 children in the UK’s constituent countries are overweight or obese.  Childhood overweight and obesity prevalence in England has increased since the mid-1990s, though this includes an increase to the mid-2000s followed by a decrease.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity among children in England is higher in those from lower-income households compared with higher income households  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for children        Cancer risk publications            Preventable cancers poster (simple version) (August 2014)  Preventable cancers poster (in-depth version)  (August 2014)  Preventable cancers PowerPoint slides (September 2014)  Want to create your own lifetime risk calculations?

Skip to Main Content   Know Your Chances      Home About Big Picture Charts Create Custom Charts Your Chances Special Cancer Tables     Interactive Risk Charts to Put Cancer in Context  It's difficult to read a newspaper or magazine, watch television, or surf the Internet without hearing about cancer. Unfortunately, these messages are often missing basic facts needed for people to understand their chance of cancer: the magnitude of the chance and how it compares with the chance of other diseases.  Risk charts present these basic facts by showing the chance of dying from a variety of cancer and other diseases over specific time frames. Because age, sex and race are so important in determining your chances, the charts let you account for these factors. While other factors make an important difference (like smoking or having a serious disease run in your family), the numbers from the charts will get you into the right ballpark.  Get Started  Choose from one of the four risk charts offered below.         Big Picture Charts  Ready made charts with the 10-year chance of dying from major causes.  View The Charts   Create Custom Charts  Select the causes of death and time frame for the chart.  Design A Chart   Your Chances  Display the chances of dying from the most common causes based on age, race and sex.  View Your Chances   Special Cancer Tables  Compare the risk of diagnosis and death for specific cancers.  View Comparisons         DISCLAIMER: The charts do not account for some individual characteristics that affect the chance of death, most importantly smoking. Smoking substantially increases the chance of dying from heart attacks, stroke, lung cancer, chronic lung disease, and all-causes combined. If you smoke, your chances of dying from these causes are higher than those shown in the charts - and if you never smoked, your chances of dying are lower.

Cancer Statistics   Cancer Disparities                      Cancer Statistics              Cancer has a major impact on society in the United States and across the world. Cancer statistics describe what happens in large groups of people and provide a picture in time of the burden of cancer on society. Statistics tell us things such as how many people are diagnosed with and die from cancer each year, the number of people who are currently living after a cancer diagnosis, the average age at diagnosis, and the numbers of people who are still alive at a given time after diagnosis. They also tell us about differences among groups defined by age, sex, racial/ethnic group, geographic location, and other categories.  If you are looking for information about chances of surviving cancer and prognosis, see the Understanding Cancer Prognosis page.      View this video on YouTube.     Information on cancer statistics, how cancer statistics are calculated, and where the data come from.   Although statistical trends are usually not directly applicable to individual patients, they are essential for governments, policy makers, health professionals, and researchers to understand the impact of cancer on the population and to develop strategies to address the challenges that cancer poses to the society at large. Statistical trends are also important for measuring the success of efforts to control and manage cancer.  Statistics at a Glance: The Burden of Cancer in the United States   In 2016, an estimated 1,685,210 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States and 595,690 people will die from the disease.  The most common cancers in 2016 are projected to be breast cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, prostate cancer, colon and rectum cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma of the skin, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, thyroid cancer, kidney and renal pelvis cancer, leukemia, endometrial cancer, and pancreatic cancer.  The number of new cases of cancer (cancer incidence ) is 454.8 per 100,000 men and women per year (based on 2008-2012 cases).  The number of cancer deaths (cancer mortality ) is 171.2 per 100,000 men and women per year (based on 2008-2012 deaths).  Cancer mortality is higher among men than women (207.9 per 100,000 men and 145.4 per 100,000 women). It is highest in African American men (261.5 per 100,000) and lowest in Asian/Pacific Islander women (91.2 per 100,000). (Based on 2008-2012 deaths.)  The number of people living beyond a cancer diagnosis reached nearly 14.5 million in 2014 and is expected to rise to almost 19 million by 2024.  Approximately 39.6% of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetimes (based on 2010-2012 data).  In 2014, an estimated 15,780 children and adolescents ages 0 to 19 were diagnosed with cancer and 1,960 died of the disease.  National expenditures for cancer care in the United States totaled nearly $125 billion in 2010 and could reach $156 billion in 2020.    Statistics at a Glance: The Burden of Cancer Worldwide        Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. In 2012, there were 14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths worldwide.  The number of new cancer cases will rise to 22 million within the next two decades.  More than 60% of the world’s new cancer cases occur in Africa, Asia, and Central and South America; 70% of the world’s cancer deaths also occur in these regions.   The World Health Organization’s website has more information about cancer statistics across the world.   U.S. Cancer Mortality Trends  The best indicator of progress against cancer is a change in age-adjusted mortality (death) rates, although other measures, such as quality of life, are also important. Incidence is also important, but it is not always straightforward to interpret changes in incidence. For example, if a new screening test detects many cancer cases that would never have caused a problem during someone’s life (called overdiagnosis), the incidence of that cancer would appear to increase even though the death rates do not change. But a rise in incidence can also reflect a real increase in disease, as is the case when an increase in exposure to a risk factor causes more cases of cancer. In this scenario the increased incidence would likely lead to a rise in mortality from the cancer.        In the United States, the overall cancer death rate has declined since the early 1990s. The most recent SEER Cancer Statistics Review , updated in September 2016, shows that cancer death rates decreased by:   1.8% per year among men from 2004 to 2013  1.4% per year among women from 2004 to 2013  1.4% per year among children ages 0–19 from 2009 to 2013   Although death rates for many individual cancer types have also declined, rates for a few cancers have stabilized or even increased.  As the overall cancer death rate has declined, the number of cancer survivors has increased. These trends show that progress is being made against the disease, but much work remains. Although rates of smoking, a major cause of cancer, have declined, the U.S. population is aging, and cancer rates increase with age. Obesity, another risk factor for cancer, is also increasing.  The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program  NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program collects and publishes cancer incidence and survival data from population-based cancer registries that cover approximately 28% of the U.S. population. The SEER program website has more detailed cancer statistics, including population statistics for common types of cancer, customizable graphs and tables, and interactive tools.  The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer provides an annual update of cancer incidence, mortality, and trends in the United States. This report is jointly authored by experts from NCI, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Cancer Society, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.   Editor's Note : This story was first published in 2005 and has been updated with the most recent data. Live Science will continue to update the odds of dying as new numbers are released.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.   Editor's Note : This story was first published in 2005 and has been updated with the most recent data. Live Science will continue to update the odds of dying as new numbers are released.

With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic.

Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.

Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.       A 3D look at the HIV virus.  Credit: Sebastian Kaulitzki/Shutterstock    On other fronts, modern medicine is helping people manage their maladies. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8.

Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.       A 3D look at the HIV virus.  Credit: Sebastian Kaulitzki/Shutterstock    On other fronts, modern medicine is helping people manage their maladies. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

Posted on May 7, 2010  by  Maggie Mahar     Summary- Not long ago, a New York Times editorial repeated a statistic that you may have heard before: "one in four Americans are projected to die of cancer."  Fortunately, this is a complete fabrication. For most Americans–including the vast majority of Times' readers– the risk is far lower.    A recent New York Times editorial announced that the war on cancer is reaching "a state of crisis."   Citing the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the Times called for boosting funds that support cancer trials while also raising the academic rewards to encourage researchers to run clinical trials. Appealing to readers' pre-dawn terrors, the editorial concludes by declaring that " Nearly one in four Americans are projected to die from cancer. It is vitally important to find the best treatments for them."   It's a strong "kicker "(journalese for an ending). The only catch: it's not true .  One in four Americans are not expected to die of cancer. Current projections say that one in four American men born in 1985 will die of cancer. For a woman, the odds drop to one in five . And for most Americans, the risk is much lower .  Consider that at least 30% of cancer deaths are caused by smoking . If you don't smoke, it is far less likely that you will end your life battling cancer.  Why the Risk is Lower for Most Americans  Dartmouth's Steven Woloshin, Lisa M. Schwartz and H. Gilbert Welch broke out the possibility of dying of cancer by age, sex, and smoking status in an article published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 2008.   It turns out that if you are a 50-year-old man who never smoked, the chances that, over the next 10 years, you will die of one of the cancers that are most likely to kill men ( prostate cancer, lung cancer, or colon cancer) are just 4 out of 1,000.  That is  a 0.4% chance. (The odds are higher, 5 out of 1,000,  that you will die in an accident). If  he is a smoker,  the odds for  a 50-year-old man more than quadruple, to 21 out of 1,000.  For a 50-year-old woman who doesn't smoke, the chances of dying of lung, breast,ovarian or cervical cancer over the next 10 years stand at  7 out of 1,000; if you smoke the odds rise to 20 out of 1,000. The authors of the study define a  "non-smoker" as someone who has smoked less than 100 cigarettes in her life.  A "smoker" is someone who has inhaled more than 100 cigarettes and smokes now  (any amount.) If you quit smoking, your odds of dying of cancer are cut in half ten years later.  Moreover, it's worth noting that the likelihood of dying of cancer are one in four for all 25-year old men (smokers and non-smokers lumped together) born in 1985. Back in 1975, projections suggested that a man born that year had only a 18% chance of dying of cancer, while a woman had a 16% chance. By 1985, the odds for a man had risen to 25%, and for a woman to 20%.  This is because we are living longer. In the past, a person was more  likely to be killed by heart disease or an infection before cancer caught up with him or her.  (Typically cancer tumors are diagnosed at age 67.)  Another way of putting this is to say that the longer you live, the more likely it is that cancer will cause your death. If a man lives to 70, the odds are 28 out of 1,000 that this much dreaded disease will kill him over the next ten years, even if he never smoked.  On the other hand, at that age the odds that  he will die of something over the next decade are nearly 300 out of 1,000.  By contrast, the likelihood that cancer will do him in is pretty slim.  A 70-year-old women who never smoked faces the same odds: 28 out of 1,000- that , sometime over the next ten years, "cancer" will be listed as the cause of her death.. But the chances that she something will kill her over the same span are 207 out of 1,000.  For smokers who make it to 70, the risk of death by cancer is far higher: 132 out of 1,000 for men, 80 out of 1,000 for women.  Finally, low-income Americans face a much greater risk . For example, poor women are about twice as likely to die of breast cancer as wealthier women. This is because they receive less medical care, and less sophisticated care. "Where patient care is equal, treatment and outcome are equal," explains Otis Brawley, MD, associate director of the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University. Article published in the American Cancer Society's News Center .  Brawley begins with data on African-American women which shows that they are about twice as likely to die of breast cancer as white women. But this is a relatively new phenomenon.  Until about 1980, their survival rates were equal.   And genes "didn't change around 1980," Brawley observes. In other words, there is little reason to suspect that African-American women suddenly became more susceptible to breast cancer than white women.  What changed since 1980?  Treatment for breast cancer has advanced over the past 30 years. "Improved breast surgery techniques became more common, new chemotherapy drugs improved survival times and tamoxifen began reducing recurrence rates,"  says Brawley. ut "women too poor to have insurance or adequate income to pay for those advances didn't benefit from them.  " Because there is a larger portion of low-income earners among African Americans, it can seem that race is the reason for worse cancer rates, when it mainly is poverty, " he adds.  I should add that studies do suggest that skin color can add to disparities in how much care patients receive. The vast majority of doctors are white, and research suggests that African American patients and white doctors may view each other with some suspicion. At the very least, cultural differences can  make communication difficult.  But Brawley points out that among U.S. military personnel-who all have access to the same quality of care-survival rates among African American breast cancer patients and white breast cancer patients have remained the same since 1980.  Why is the New York Times Trying to  Scare Its Readers?  Just how many of the NYTs' readers are low-income, African-American men who smoke? Not many.  How many  are 30 to 55 year old middle-class or upper-middle-class women who don't smoke?  Many more. Those women face a chance of dying of cancer in the next 10 years that ranges from less than 1 out of 1000 to 13 out of 1000, depending on their age. The longer they live, the greater the risk. We all will die of something. So if a person beats heart disease, it becomes more likely that he will face cancer. But  a 75-year-old woman should not lie awake worrying about this terrible disease. There is a 1 in 3 chance that she will die before she turns turns 85. The odds that cancer will be the cause of her death are just are 33 out of 1,000.  The bottom line: New York Times readers who don't smoke do not face a one in four chance of dying of cancer at any age. I don't know why the Times would throw that  number out there. But I would guess that the person who wrote the editorial believes the statistic. Perhaps he read it in another newspaper.  Finally, let me suggest that rather than pouring more  money into chasing an elusive cure for cancer, we should be putting those dollars into two things that we KNOW will greatly reduce death by cancer: a major campaign to help Americans stop smoking — complete with free drugs and nicotine patches –and an all-out effort  to ensure that all Americans, poor as well as rich, receive the cancer treatments that we know are most effective. (Giving more Americans health insurance is one thing —making sure that everyone receives the same level of care, regardless of income or skin color, is something else.

I think citing the IOM and calling for boosting funds that support cancer trials and raising the academic rewards to encourage researchers to run clinical trials could give you an answer. Tens of thousands of scientists pushing a goal of finding the tiniest improvements in treatment rather than genuine breakthroughs, that fosters redundant problems and rewards academic achievement and publication above all else. We have produced an entire generation of investigators in clinical oncology who believe that the only valid form of clinical research is to perform well-designed, prospective, randomized trials in which patients are randomized to receive one empiric drug combination versus another empiric drug combination. Proof of efficacy of a cancer treatment such as chemotherapy requires a randomized trial in which it has been shown that the group treated with chemotherapy experienced significantly increased survival when compared to that of an untreated group. This has never been done. Most claims for the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic agent comes from trials showing shrinkage of tumors or from comparison of survival rates of unmatched groups over time. Unless tumor shrinkage is accompanied by evidence of increased survival, the treatment cannot be claimed to be effective. Additionally, in clinical trials, many patients are excluded because they could not complete the rather arduous treatment. So randomized comparisons are of healthier treated patients against all the controls, rendering a lot a trials flawed. Until the controlled, randomized clinical trial approach has delivered curative results with a high success rate, the choice of physicians to intergrate promising insights and methods remains an essential component quality cancer care.           Word on May 7, 2010 at 8:38 pm  said:    Maggie- I am fairly new to your site, and have enjoyed a number of your articles, but I find this one a bit tendentious.  A couple of points: First, regarding the headline that the 1 in 4 claim is wrong:  Ok, so it’s 1 in 5 for women instead of 1 in 4.  If we figure that about half of Americans are men and half are women, the overall number is probably somewhere around 1 in 4.5. Is that really so different?  Is funding for cancer research not worth it if the average American born in ’85 only has a 22.5% chance of dying of it instead of a 25% chance? And what about the cancer patients who are lucky enough to survive their ordeal?  Some cancers are highly treatable, even curable, but many of the therapies are toxic, disfiguring, or associated with significant side-effects.  Research into new therapies can reduce these burdens.  It seems to me, for example, that the research showing lumpectomy with radiation is (usually) just as good as radical mastectomy represents an important advance, even if it doesn’t increase the cure rate. Second, regarding your hypothetical 50 year olds:  Obviously the likelihood of a 50 year old man dying within 10 years of 3 pre-selected cancers is not directly comparable to the proportion of men or women who will, when they ultimately die, die of cancer.  So regardless of what the numbers are, there just isn’t a way for this kind of analysis to refute the claim you are supposedly refuting. But I use the word tendentious because the study you cite uses several factors that will artificially lower the mortality rate.  They selected lung cancer as 1 of the  3 cancers that they track for both men and women, but then stipulate that these are non-smokers.  Lung cancer is not a common cancer in non-smokers.  Thanks to Pap smears, cervical cancer is also not a common cancer in America anymore (it’s the 8th most common cause of cancer death in American women according to wikipedia.)  Prostate cancer is slow growing and not usually diagnosed before age 50.  So the number of men who die of prostate cancer before age 60 is very different from the number who will ultimately die of it.  In fact, that’s true of most cancers.  As you note in the article, most people who die of cancer are older than 60.  So why follow 50 year olds and only count deaths that occur within 10 years?  Maybe it’s to intentionally underestimate the cancer death rate.           Jenga on May 7, 2010 at 8:55 pm  said:    Nice article.  Fear sells in the media and in the hospital.           Maggie Mahar on May 7, 2010 at 9:40 pm  said:    Jenga & Word Jenga — Thanks much.. Word–Welcome to HealthBeat. The big difference regarding risk of cancer is not between men and women. The big difference is between smokers and non-smokers. I would have thought that smoking mainly increased your chances of dying of lung cancer. But when I looked at the research, I discovered that wasn’t true. Your chances of dying of breast cancer, abdominal cancer, kidney cancer–etc., etc., are higher if you smoke. Woloshin, Schwartz and Welch focused on the cancers that cause the most deaths for men and women because other cancers account for a very small percentage of cancer deaths. And, they were trying to make the book & charts readable for a lay audience. They are also highly respected reasearchers–I’ve never seen anyone questioning their numbers in peer-reviewed medical literature. And they don’t focus on people who are 50 or under–their charts go up to people age 75– and look at what happens to them between 75 and 85. (A very small percentage of the population lives past 85). I quoted what happens to 50 -year -olds–as well as 70-year-olds–becuase the vast majority of the Times’ readers (and my readers) are well under 70. So I assumed they would be most interested in what happens to people in their peer group. Click on the link that leads you to the charts. (end of post) I suspect you will be surprised (as I was when I first saw them) to see how low my risk, or your risk, is of dying of cancer at any age (I’m assuming you don’t smoke.)           Maggie Mahar on May 7, 2010 at 9:53 pm  said:    Greg– I’m afraid that, to a large degree, you are right. Though, since I have worked at the Times, I would also say that Times’ editors are pretty concerned about their health — heart disease, cancer, etc. They are not as  susceptible to these diseases as some other poorer, more obese Americans, but they do worry.           Word on May 8, 2010 at 2:29 pm  said:    Thanks for the warm welcome. You caught me- I hadn’t really looked at the charts closely and having now done so, I agree.  My risk is surprisingly low.  What I found even more surprising is that even a 75 year old smoker has a less than 50% chance of dying within 10 years from any cause, not just cancer, or heart disease. But, I still don’t think it’s fair to say that the 1 in 4 claim made by NYT is “a complete fabrication”.  It seems that it’s an accurate number for men and nearly accurate for women.  Just because the average NYT reader has a below average risk doesn’t mean they can’t cite the overall average.           Maggie Mahar on May 8, 2010 at 4:09 pm  said:    Word– point taken. But since the risk of dying of some type of cancer are so much greater if you smoke, lumping smokers and non-smokers together is very misleading. Also, most of the adults in this country who still smoke are poor. The poor are sicker than the rest of us and at greater risk–something we tend to ignore. Most people don’t realize that the poor die six years earlier than affluent Americans. A six-years difference in expected life-span within one society is extraordinay (you don’t see this in other developed countries.) We should be putting much more money into public health and public schools. But fear of cancer has spawned a very lucrative industry: equipment makers like GE, drugmakers, hospitals and some doctors make a fortune. The American Cancer Society takes money from the medical industrial complex that profits (and profiteers)  from our fear of cancer. This is why they put out numbers like 1 in 4. And no one at the NYT scratches his head and says : “Wait a minute–can that be true? When I think of older friends and relatives who have died, one out of four didn’t die of cancer . . .” Meanwhile, the worried well tend to be middle-class and upper-middle class Americans who really don’t need to be so worried. Their risks are  lower. They will live longer.  If they took some of that energy and worried about the poor . . . That’s why I think that publicatons like the NYT (our paper of record) should getting the truth out there by analyzing the numbers rather than just throwing out a scary number that virtually everyone will think applies to them.           Too Tall Bob on May 8, 2010 at 4:19 pm  said:    Just have to comment on health disparities–according to studies reviewed by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD), people with major mental illnesses die 20-25 years before the average.  While director of mental health and addictions for the State of Oregon, I commissioned a study that showed that people who had both a major mental illness and an addictions problems died at the average age of 44.  Smoking, poverty, poor access to health care, some interactions with medications, and other factors contribute…is there a larger health disparity in the US?           Barry Carol on May 8, 2010 at 7:12 pm  said:    Approximately 2.4 million people die in the U.S. each year of which slightly less than 550,000 or 23% die from cancer.  It’s our second largest killer after heart disease. I don’t know what the average age is among the people who die from cancer, how many of them smoked or what their socio-economic status was.  As heart disease becomes better managed, fewer are dying from that cause. The bottom line is that close to 25% of deaths in the U.S. in any given year are from cancer.           Maggie Mahar on May 9, 2010 at 1:20 pm  said:    Barry– The bottom-line is that 30% of those deaths are related to smoking. And virtually all of the adults in the U.S. who stil smoke are poor. IF we cared, we would launch an anti-smoking campaign, giving out the nicotine patches and new drugs that now make it fairly easily for most people to quite smoking. This would cost far, far less than all of the money we spend on tests that don’t save lives or extend lives, terribly expensive drugs that give people only a few extra months of life . . . And we would have eliminated nearly 1/3 of the deaths by cancer. We also need an anti-smoking campaign in the shcools (complete with nicotine patches)–kids have begun smoking again. Finally, today’s cancer reasearch is not well co-ordinated (as the Times makes clear). Rather than pouring more money in it, we need to re-think and re-structure the research, with the NIH taking charge and making it collaborative, not competitive. (All researchers should be sharing their reserach). An article just came out in the Archives of Internal Medicine points out that if you are diagnosed with cancer, chances are 1 out of 2 that the cancer, or complications related to the cancer would kill youo. Yet, the article points out, most newspaper and magazine articles focus on cures, “sugar-coating” the truth– many cancers are incurable and many very aggressive treatments don’t work. We haven’t gotten as far in cancer research as many people think. Cliff Leaf wrote an outstanding piece for Fortune magazine 3 or 4 years ago about the state of cancer reserach. . . You probably can find it by Googling. He took a very honest look at what was happening.           Margalit Gur-Arie on May 9, 2010 at 2:06 pm  said:    Maggie, I don’t know about that 1/3 reduction in deaths if people didn’t smoke. Maybe people who are more likely to die from cancer are also more likely to smoke and not the other way around (I’m not talking about lung cancer). As you point out poverty has a lot to do with both smoking and dying, but i’m not clear on which is the cause and which the effect. As to research, it must remain competitive at least to a certain degree. Competitiveness is one of the major drivers in science discovery. People actually dream about beating the other teams and getting the Nobel Prize. Not too much came out of the USSR collaborative system in spite of having top notch scientists. If something is responsible for one quarter of deaths, I say we step up the effort to find a solution, and I don’t mean palliative acceptance of defeat. Anti smoking campaigns are a very good thing too. Maybe we should start by withdrawing tobacco farmers subsidies and obliterate this death industry. Maybe we can pay them to switch to other crops like they do for poppies in other parts of the world.           Maggie Mahar on May 9, 2010 at 3:39 pm  said:    Margalit– Yes, people who are more likley to die of cancer are also more likely to smoke because poor people are more likely to die of cancer (even when insured they get subpar care) and poor people are also more likely to smoke. The heart of the problem is poverty, the stress that poverty causes, and the way we discriminate against the poor when providing health care. What we need is a new war on poverty. (The U.S. tobacco farming industry is shrinking on its own –only 2% of tobacco dollars now spent on U.S. tobacco, and most cigarettes smoked here use imported tobacco.)

Now it’s MRSA or flesh-eating bacteria…both a problem, but uncommon. If we take our limited resources and apply them to the most common and highest risk–for which we have strategies that work–more people stay healthy and live longer. And we don’t Scare Ourselves To Death.

By Mayo Clinic Staff    You might wonder about your chances of developing cancer. News reports can make it sound as if every day something is found to dramatically raise your risk. Sorting through all the information and figuring out what's valid can be tricky.   What is risk?    When scientists talk about risk, they're referring to a probability — the chance that something may occur, but not a guarantee that it will. For example, if you flip a coin, there is one chance in two, or a 50 percent chance, that the coin will land heads up.  Risk estimates for cancer and other diseases are determined by studying large groups of people. Researchers focus on the probability that any person or category of people will develop the disease over a certain period of time. They also look to see what characteristics or behaviors are associated with increased or decreased risk.   How is risk expressed?      Absolute risk        Relative risk    Risk is generally divided into two categories: absolute risk and relative risk.  Absolute risk  Absolute risk refers to the actual numeric chance or probability of developing cancer during a specified time period — for example, within the year, within the next five years, by age 50, by age 70, or during the course of a lifetime.  One type of absolute risk is lifetime risk, which is the probability that an individual will develop cancer during the course of a lifetime. For instance, an American man's absolute risk of developing prostate cancer in his lifetime is about 12 percent. Put another way, about 12 out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer at some time in their lives. This also means that 88 out of every 100 men won't develop prostate cancer.  Lifetime risk isn't the risk that a person will develop cancer in the next year or the next five years. An individual's cancer risk has a lot to do with other factors, such as age. For instance, a woman's lifetime risk of developing colon and rectal cancer is just over 4 percent, or about 42 out of every 1,000 women. But her risk of developing colon and rectal cancer before the age of 50 is 0.3 percent, or about 3 out of every 1,000 women.  Relative risk  Relative risk gives you a comparison or ratio rather than an absolute value. It shows the strength of the relationship between a risk factor and a particular type of cancer by comparing the number of cancers in a group of people who have a particular trait with the number of cancers in a group of people who don't have that trait.  For instance, compare the relative lung cancer risk for people who smoke with the relative lung cancer risk in a similar group of people who don't smoke. You might hear relative risk being expressed like this: The risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25 times higher than the risk for people who don't smoke. So the relative risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25.  Relative risk is also given as a percentage. For example, the risk of lung cancer for smokers is 2,500 percent higher than it is for people who don't smoke.  When you hear about relative risk, there's no upper limit to the percentage increase in risk. Most people think 100 percent is the highest possible risk, but that isn't true in this case.  A relative risk of 100 percent means your risk is twice as high as that of someone without that risk factor. A 200 percent relative risk means that you are three times as likely to develop that condition.  Risk seems greater when put in these terms. A 100 percent increase in risk may seem enormous, but if the risk began as 1 in 100 people, a 100 percent increase in risk means that 2 out of 100 will be affected.

Category Cancer A-Z          Cancer Basics             Lifetime Risk of Developing or Dying From Cancer      The lifetime risk of developing or dying from cancer refers to the chance a person has, over the course of his or her lifetime (from birth to death), of being diagnosed with or dying from cancer. These risk estimates, like annual incidence and mortality data, provide another measure of how widespread cancer is in the United States.  The following tables list lifetime risks of developing and dying from certain cancers for men and women. The information is from the US National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Database, and is based on incidence and mortality data for the United States from 2012 through 2014, the most current years for which data are available.  The risk is expressed both in terms of a percentage and as odds.   For example, the risk that a man will develop bladder cancer during his lifetime is 3.76%. This means he has about 1 chance in 27 of developing bladder cancer (100/3.76 = 26.6).  Put another way, 1 out of every 27 men in the United States will develop bladder cancer during his lifetime.   These numbers are average risks for the overall US population. Your risk may be higher or lower than these numbers, depending on your particular risk factors.

The number of deaths was 166.1 per 100,000 men and women per year. These rates are age-adjusted and based on 2010-2014 cases and deaths.  Lifetime Risk of Developing Cancer : Approximately 38.5 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer of any site at some point during their lifetime, based on 2012-2014 data.  Prevalence of This Cancer : In 2014, there were an estimated 14,738,719 people living with cancer of any site in the United States.   Survival Statistics   How Many People Survive 5 Years Or More after Being Diagnosed with Cancer of Any Site?  Relative survival statistics compare the survival of patients diagnosed with cancer with the survival of people in the general population who are the same age, race, and sex and who have not been diagnosed with cancer. Because survival statistics are based on large groups of people, they cannot be used to predict exactly what will happen to an individual patient. No two patients are entirely alike, and treatment and responses to treatment can vary greatly.          Percent Surviving 5 Years  67.0%      Based on data from SEER 18 2007-2013. Gray figures represent those who have died from cancer of any site. Green figures represent those who have survived 5 years or more.

By Mayo Clinic Staff    When first diagnosed with cancer, many people ask about their prognosis. You might want to know whether your cancer is relatively easy or more difficult to cure. Your doctor can't predict the future, but can make an estimate based on other people's experiences with the same cancer.   What is a cancer survival rate?    Cancer survival rates or survival statistics tell you the percentage of people who survive a certain type of cancer for a specific amount of time. Cancer statistics often use an overall five-year survival rate.  Survival rates are usually given in percentages. For instance, the overall five-year survival rate for bladder cancer is 78 percent. That means that of all people who have bladder cancer, 78 of every 100 are living five years after diagnosis. Conversely, 22 out of every 100 are dead within five years of a bladder cancer diagnosis.  Cancer survival rates are based on research from information gathered on hundreds or thousands of people with a specific cancer. An overall survival rate includes people of all ages and health conditions who have been diagnosed with your cancer, including those diagnosed very early and those diagnosed very late.  Your doctor may be able to give you more specific statistics based on your stage of cancer. For instance, 56 percent, or a little more than half, of people diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer live for at least five years after diagnosis. The five-year survival rate for people diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer that has spread (metastasized) to other areas of the body is 5 percent.  Overall survival rates don't specify whether cancer survivors are still undergoing treatment at five years or if they've become cancer-free (achieved remission). Other types of survival rates that give more specific information include:   Disease-free survival rate. This is the number of people who have no evidence of cancer after treatment.  Progression-free survival rate. This is the number of people who have been treated for cancer and either have no signs of cancer recurrence or who have cancer that has remained stable without growing.   Cancer survival rates often use a five-year survival rate. That doesn't mean cancer can't recur beyond five years. Certain cancers can recur many years after first being found and treated. For some cancers, if it has not recurred by five years after initial diagnosis, the chance of a later recurrence is very small. Discuss your risk of a cancer recurrence with your doctor.   How are cancer survival rates used?    You and your doctor might use survival statistics to:   Understand your prognosis. The experience of other people in your same situation can give you and your doctor an idea of your prognosis — the chance your cancer will be cured. Other factors include age and general health. Your doctor uses these factors to help you understand the seriousness of your condition.   Develop a treatment plan. Statistics can also show how people with your same cancer type and stage respond to treatment. You can use this information, along with your goals for treatment, to weigh the pros and cons of each treatment option.  For instance, if two treatments give you similar chances for remission, but one has more side effects, you might choose the option with fewer side effects.  In another example, a treatment may offer a chance for a cure, but only for 1 or 2 people out of every 100. For some, these chances are promising enough to put up with side effects. For others, the chance for a cure isn't worth the treatment's side effects.  Your doctor can help you understand the benefits and risks of each treatment.

Females have the highest lifetime risk of breast, lung and bowel cancers.  Males have the highest lifetime risk of prostate, lung and bowel cancers.  See more in-depth statistics on lifetime risk of being diagnosed with cancer        Preventable cancers     A person’s risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including age, genetics, and exposure to risk factors.  Around 4 in 10 UK cancer cases every year could be prevented, that’s more than 135,000 every year.  Nearly 112,000 England cases, around 13,000 Scotland cancer cases, around 7,200 Wales cancer cases, and around 3,500 Northern Ireland cancer cases every year could be prevented.  Lung cancer, bowel cancer, melanoma skin cancer, and breast cancer together account for almost two-thirds of all preventable cancer cases in the UK.  For 10 cancer types, including two of the five most common cancer types in the UK (lung cancer and melanoma skin cancer), more than 70% of UK cancer cases were attributable to known risk factors.  Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, exposure to certain substances at work, exposure to certain infections, drinking alcohol, and eating too little fibre each cause 3-4% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to ionising radiation and eating processed meat each cause 1-2% of cancer cases in the UK.  Exposure to outdoor air pollution and doing too little physical activity each cause 1% or less of cancer cases in the UK.  See more in-depth statistics on preventable cancer cases        Tobacco statistics     Smoking is the largest cause of cancer in the UK.  Around 1 in 5 UK adults currently smoke cigarettes, around 9.4 million people.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults in the UK decreases with age.  Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults has decreased since the late 1940s.  In recent years the difference between men and women in cigarette smoking prevalence has narrowed.  Cigarette smoking in England is more common in people living in the most deprived areas.  Cigarette smoking prevalence varies by ethnic group but patterns are difficult to interpret.  Worldwide, 1 billion adults currently smoke cigarettes.  Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in the world, and around a third of tobacco-caused deaths are due to cancer (2015 projected).  Around 11,000 deaths per year in the UK are caused by second-hand smoke, four-fifths occurring at home and the rest from the workplace.  More than half of smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are successful.  Almost 4 in 10 smokers who quit with NHS stop smoking services in Scotland are successful.  See more in-depth statistics on tobacco        Childhood smoking statistics     Smoking prevalence is higher in children whose parents, siblings and/or peers smoke.  Almost 5 in 100 children under 16 in the UK smoke regularly.  Almost a fifth of children have tried smoking, and girls are much more likely than boys to smoke.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England increases with age.  Regular cigarette smoking prevalence among children in England has decreased since the 1990s.  Around 40% of regular smokers in Great Britain began smoking before age 16.  Around 7 million smokers in 2012 in the UK started smoking before the age of 18.  An average of 136,500 children aged 11-15 started smoking each year between 2012 and 2014 in the UK but the number of new childhood smokers each year is falling.  See more in-depth statistics on childhood smoking        Alcohol statistics     Drinking too much alcohol causes 3% of cancer cases in the UK.  Nearly 6 in 10 adults in Great Britain drank alcohol at least once in the past week.  Under 1 in 10 children aged 11-15 in England drank alcohol at least once in the past week. Alcohol drinking prevalence in children increases with age, and rates have decreased since 2003.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain peaks in middle-age.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain has decreased since 2005, this is mainly due to declining prevalence among younger adults.  Around half of adults in Great Britain who drank alcohol at least once in the past week exceeded the recommended daily alcohol limit on their heaviest drinking day.  Alcohol drinking prevalence among adults in Great Britain is higher in employed people compared with unemployed or economically inactive people.  Alcohol drinking prevalence adults in Great Britain is more common in white people than non-white people.  Alcohol drinking causes an estimated 6% of deaths worldwide, around 1 in 8 of which are due to cancer (2012). Alcohol drinking prevalence is highest in Europe and America.  See more in-depth statistics on alcohol        Adult overweight and obesity statistics     Overweight and obesity causes more than 1 in 20 cancer cases in the UK.  More than 6 in 10 UK adults are overweight or obese (body mass index 25 or more).  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in the UK increases until late middle-age and then decreases in older adults. However, prevalence of overweight and obesity increases in Scotland in older females and in Northern Ireland.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England has increased since the early 1990s.  Overweight and obesity prevalence among adults in England is higher in lower-income households compared with higher-income households.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity varies by ethnic group in England.  Overweight and obesity prevalence is increasing particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Overweight and obesity are leading causes of death worldwide.  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for adults        Childhood overweight and obesity statistics     People who are overweight or obese in early life may remain obese in adulthood.  Around 3 in 10 children in the UK’s constituent countries are overweight or obese.  Childhood overweight and obesity prevalence in England has increased since the mid-1990s, though this includes an increase to the mid-2000s followed by a decrease.  Prevalence of overweight and obesity among children in England is higher in those from lower-income households compared with higher income households  See more in-depth overweight and obesity statistics for children        Cancer risk publications            Preventable cancers poster (simple version) (August 2014)  Preventable cancers poster (in-depth version)  (August 2014)  Preventable cancers PowerPoint slides (September 2014)  Want to create your own lifetime risk calculations?

Skip to Main Content   Know Your Chances      Home About Big Picture Charts Create Custom Charts Your Chances Special Cancer Tables     Interactive Risk Charts to Put Cancer in Context  It's difficult to read a newspaper or magazine, watch television, or surf the Internet without hearing about cancer. Unfortunately, these messages are often missing basic facts needed for people to understand their chance of cancer: the magnitude of the chance and how it compares with the chance of other diseases.  Risk charts present these basic facts by showing the chance of dying from a variety of cancer and other diseases over specific time frames. Because age, sex and race are so important in determining your chances, the charts let you account for these factors. While other factors make an important difference (like smoking or having a serious disease run in your family), the numbers from the charts will get you into the right ballpark.  Get Started  Choose from one of the four risk charts offered below.         Big Picture Charts  Ready made charts with the 10-year chance of dying from major causes.  View The Charts   Create Custom Charts  Select the causes of death and time frame for the chart.  Design A Chart   Your Chances  Display the chances of dying from the most common causes based on age, race and sex.  View Your Chances   Special Cancer Tables  Compare the risk of diagnosis and death for specific cancers.  View Comparisons         DISCLAIMER: The charts do not account for some individual characteristics that affect the chance of death, most importantly smoking. Smoking substantially increases the chance of dying from heart attacks, stroke, lung cancer, chronic lung disease, and all-causes combined. If you smoke, your chances of dying from these causes are higher than those shown in the charts - and if you never smoked, your chances of dying are lower.

Cancer Statistics   Cancer Disparities                      Cancer Statistics              Cancer has a major impact on society in the United States and across the world. Cancer statistics describe what happens in large groups of people and provide a picture in time of the burden of cancer on society. Statistics tell us things such as how many people are diagnosed with and die from cancer each year, the number of people who are currently living after a cancer diagnosis, the average age at diagnosis, and the numbers of people who are still alive at a given time after diagnosis. They also tell us about differences among groups defined by age, sex, racial/ethnic group, geographic location, and other categories.  If you are looking for information about chances of surviving cancer and prognosis, see the Understanding Cancer Prognosis page.      View this video on YouTube.     Information on cancer statistics, how cancer statistics are calculated, and where the data come from.   Although statistical trends are usually not directly applicable to individual patients, they are essential for governments, policy makers, health professionals, and researchers to understand the impact of cancer on the population and to develop strategies to address the challenges that cancer poses to the society at large. Statistical trends are also important for measuring the success of efforts to control and manage cancer.  Statistics at a Glance: The Burden of Cancer in the United States   In 2016, an estimated 1,685,210 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States and 595,690 people will die from the disease.  The most common cancers in 2016 are projected to be breast cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, prostate cancer, colon and rectum cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma of the skin, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, thyroid cancer, kidney and renal pelvis cancer, leukemia, endometrial cancer, and pancreatic cancer.  The number of new cases of cancer (cancer incidence ) is 454.8 per 100,000 men and women per year (based on 2008-2012 cases).  The number of cancer deaths (cancer mortality ) is 171.2 per 100,000 men and women per year (based on 2008-2012 deaths).  Cancer mortality is higher among men than women (207.9 per 100,000 men and 145.4 per 100,000 women). It is highest in African American men (261.5 per 100,000) and lowest in Asian/Pacific Islander women (91.2 per 100,000). (Based on 2008-2012 deaths.)  The number of people living beyond a cancer diagnosis reached nearly 14.5 million in 2014 and is expected to rise to almost 19 million by 2024.  Approximately 39.6% of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetimes (based on 2010-2012 data).  In 2014, an estimated 15,780 children and adolescents ages 0 to 19 were diagnosed with cancer and 1,960 died of the disease.  National expenditures for cancer care in the United States totaled nearly $125 billion in 2010 and could reach $156 billion in 2020.    Statistics at a Glance: The Burden of Cancer Worldwide        Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. In 2012, there were 14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths worldwide.  The number of new cancer cases will rise to 22 million within the next two decades.  More than 60% of the world’s new cancer cases occur in Africa, Asia, and Central and South America; 70% of the world’s cancer deaths also occur in these regions.   The World Health Organization’s website has more information about cancer statistics across the world.   U.S. Cancer Mortality Trends  The best indicator of progress against cancer is a change in age-adjusted mortality (death) rates, although other measures, such as quality of life, are also important. Incidence is also important, but it is not always straightforward to interpret changes in incidence. For example, if a new screening test detects many cancer cases that would never have caused a problem during someone’s life (called overdiagnosis), the incidence of that cancer would appear to increase even though the death rates do not change. But a rise in incidence can also reflect a real increase in disease, as is the case when an increase in exposure to a risk factor causes more cases of cancer. In this scenario the increased incidence would likely lead to a rise in mortality from the cancer.        In the United States, the overall cancer death rate has declined since the early 1990s. The most recent SEER Cancer Statistics Review , updated in September 2016, shows that cancer death rates decreased by:   1.8% per year among men from 2004 to 2013  1.4% per year among women from 2004 to 2013  1.4% per year among children ages 0–19 from 2009 to 2013   Although death rates for many individual cancer types have also declined, rates for a few cancers have stabilized or even increased.  As the overall cancer death rate has declined, the number of cancer survivors has increased. These trends show that progress is being made against the disease, but much work remains. Although rates of smoking, a major cause of cancer, have declined, the U.S. population is aging, and cancer rates increase with age. Obesity, another risk factor for cancer, is also increasing.  The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program  NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program collects and publishes cancer incidence and survival data from population-based cancer registries that cover approximately 28% of the U.S. population. The SEER program website has more detailed cancer statistics, including population statistics for common types of cancer, customizable graphs and tables, and interactive tools.  The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer provides an annual update of cancer incidence, mortality, and trends in the United States. This report is jointly authored by experts from NCI, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Cancer Society, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.       A 3D look at the HIV virus.  Credit: Sebastian Kaulitzki/Shutterstock    On other fronts, modern medicine is helping people manage their maladies. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.       A 3D look at the HIV virus.  Credit: Sebastian Kaulitzki/Shutterstock    On other fronts, modern medicine is helping people manage their maladies. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.   Editor's Note : This story was first published in 2005 and has been updated with the most recent data. Live Science will continue to update the odds of dying as new numbers are released.

With many infections now conquered, people's lifestyle choices — including whether they smoke, how they eat and how much they exercise — are catching up with them, and causing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol , Fares told Live Science.  So, it may come as no surprise that the top two killers — heart disease and cancer — account for roughly half of all deaths in the United States. About 193 per 100,000 people died from cardiovascular problems, such as heart attacks, in the United States in 2014. Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.  People's risk of heart disease rises with smoking, sedentary lifestyles and poor sleep . To lower your risk of dying of heart disease, you can exercise, eat colorful fruits and vegetables (and fiber), and drink less alcohol.       Chart of the top causes of death in the U.S. for 2014.  Credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics artist    Cancer placed second, with about 186 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States. Some cancers took more lives than others. The top killers, lung and bronchial cancers, killed about 155,000 people in 2014, or about 49 deaths per 100,000 people. Colon and rectal cancers claimed about 16 lives per 100,000 people, and breast cancer took about 13 lives per 100,000 people. Pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer followed, with about 12.7 and 9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. [ 7 Cancers You Can Ward Off with Exercise ]  "We still don't know what causes cancer, but we do realize that each cancer is different, and the risk factors associated with each is very different," said Dr. Rupal O'Quinn, a cardio-oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. People with cancer are living longer and sometimes even beating their diagnosis, largely thanks to cancer screenings, organ transplants and targeted therapies (newer drugs that aim to specifically kill cancer cells, rather than the broader approach of chemotherapy drugs), O'Quinn said.  There were 3 million cancer survivors in the country in 1971, and more than 12 million in 2012, according to a study in the International Journal of Medical Sciences . But there is still much to be learned about cancer, she said. Screening cannot look for every type of cancer, such as ovarian cancer, which may explain why some cancers claim more lives than others, O'Quinn said.  A person's cancer risk may also vary according to region. For instance, esophageal cancer kills about 4 per 100,000 people a year in the United States, but about 140 per 100,000 people in Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, according to a 2004 study in the journal Annals of Oncology .  The reason? Researchers suspect that the higher rates of esophageal cancer in Central Asia are linked to the use of chewing tobacco — a habit common in Pakistan — as well as the "drinking of very hot beverages such as tea and Kawa [or kahwa ], which are again, extremely common in Pakistan," the researchers wrote in the study. (Drinking scalding-hot beverages is linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a 2009 study in northern Iran found.)  People's risk of cancer generally rises the longer they live, but also with smoking, using tanning beds and sitting too much . To lower your risk of dying of cancer, you can get recommended screenings, exercise and eat a healthy diet.      Top Killers  The first eight diseases listed in the table below were the top eight killers in the United States in 2014, whereas the rest are shown for comparison purposes.      Cause of death  Number of U.S. deaths  Rate of deaths     1. Cardiovascular disease   614,348   193 per 100,000     2. Cancer   591,699   186 per 100,000     3. Chronic lower respiratory disease   147,101   46 per 100,000     4. Accidents   136,053   43 per 100,000     5. Strokes   133,103   42 per 100,000     6. Alzheimer's disease   93,541   29 per 100,000     7. Diabetes   76,488   24 per 100,000     8. Influenza and pneumonia   55,227   17 per 100,000    Drug overdoses  47,055  15 per 100,000    Kidney disease  48,146  15 per 100,000    Intentional self-harm  42,773  13 per 100,000    Septicemia  38,940  12 per 100,000    Liver disease  38,170  12 per 100,000    Transportation accidents  37,195  12 per 100,000    Parkinson's disease  26,150  8 per 100,000    Firearm assault  10,945  3 per 100,000    HIV  6,721  2 per 100,000    Pedestrian deaths  6,258  2 per 100,000         Respiratory Diseases & Accidents  In the U.S., after cancer, the next two largest killers are respiratory diseases and accidents. Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

Credit: Solarseven | Shutterstock.com     Everyone dies of something, but after slogging through the daily news, you'd think most people die from terrorism, shark attacks and gas explosions. But are these tragedies — not to mention deaths from lightning strikes, plane crashes and tsunamis — actually top killers in the United States?  Not really.  Even combined, these incidents killed far fewer people than the most deadly illness — heart disease, which took the lives of more than 614,000 people in the United States in 2014, accounting for about 23 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  To separate the deaths that make headlines from those that are far more common, Live Science investigated the odds of dying from various causes. We used the CDC's Wonder database for 2014 data and other sources, and found that you're more likely to die of Alzheimer's disease (about 29 deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S.) than you are from contact with a venomous snake or lizard (there were just five such deaths in 2014).  In total, about 2.6 million people died in the United States in 2014, according to the CDC. To put this number into perspective, that means about 824 people died for every 100,000 people in the country. (Keep this statistic in mind, as we'll be giving death rates per 100,000 people throughout this article.) Worldwide, an estimated 56 million people died in 2012, the most recent year for which numbers on worldwide deaths are available from the World Health Organization (WHO).  Although Hollywood advised us (in no fewer than five of its blockbusters) to "Die Hard," there are a ton of ways to die. Here's a look at how many people die from common, unexpected and even theoretical events, and the science behind those numbers. [ 9 Healthy Habits You Can Do in 1 Minute (Or Less) ]   Ways to Die    Top 2 Deadly Diseases   Top Killers   Respiratory Diseases & Accidents   More Diseases   Drug Overdoses   Animal Attacks   Transportation   Terrorism & Homicides   Other Scary Ways to Die   Natural Disasters       Top 2 Deadly Diseases    In decades past, infectious diseases were the No. 1 killer, "but with the advent of antibiotics and treatment of infectious diseases, people started to live longer," said Dr. Maan Fares, a staff cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic.

Worldwide, cardiovascular diseases killed 17.5 million people, accounting for 3 of every 10 deaths in 2012, the WHO reported.

Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema and asthma killed about 46 per 100,000 people in 2014, the CDC found. People may lower their respiratory risk by kicking their cigarettes to the curb. Moreover, some evidence suggests that asthma may be prevented in young children if they live with a dog or are exposed to allergens early in life .  Avoiding accidents is a whole other ball game. Accidents include a whole range of unintentional injuries and accounted for about 43 deaths per 100,000 people, or about 5 percent of all deaths in the United States in 2014, the CDC reported. A word to the wise: Remember to take off your headphones if you're walking around town (it can distract you from cars), and don't speed while driving.  The fifth top killer in 2014 was cerebrovascular disease (strokes), which claimed about 42 lives per 100,000 people in the United States.      More Diseases  Other health conditions also took a toll. Influenza and pneumonia (the two conditions are lumped together in CDC statistics) killed about 17 per 100,000 people in the United States, or about 55,000 people in total. Of those, about 23,700 were people age 85 or older, and 186 were infants younger than 1 year old. But many cases of flu can be prevented through vaccination. The 2014 flu shot decreased people's chances of getting the flu by only 19 percent, but the vaccines developed between 2012 and 2013 decreased their chances by 56 percent , Live Science found.  Suicide took the lives of about 42,700 individuals in 2014, meaning that there were about 13 suicides per 100,000 people in the United States that year. It was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, topping death by assault, which took about 13,000 lives that same year. The number for the suicide hotline is (800) 273-8255.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease killed about 6,700 people in the United States in 2014, or about 2 per 100,000 people. That's substantially fewer deaths than the virus caused in 1999 (the first year listed in CDC Wonder), when HIV took the lives of about 14,800 people, or about 5 per 100,000 people. [ Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100 ]  Worldwide, about 1.2 million people, including 150,000 children younger than age 15, died of HIV-related causes in 2014, WHO reported . That's about a 57 percent decrease from 1999, when about 2.8 million people worldwide died of the disease, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS . The drop is largely due to increased access to a drug regimen called antiretroviral therapy (ART), which keeps the virus at low levels within the body, and fewer people contracting the disease, the WHO said .  Other diseases that plague the world are very uncommon in the United States. For instance, malaria killed eight people in the U.S. in 2014 but caused 584,000 deaths worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa, according to the WHO . Moreover, tuberculosis killed 493 people in the United States, or 0.2 per 100,000 people in 2014. Worldwide, the respiratory disease killed 1.5 million people, the WHO found .      Drug Overdoses  A total of 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in the United States in 2014, or 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. The number is alarming, as it represents an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year, the CDC said.  "More persons died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014 than during any previous year on record," the CDC wrote in a Jan. 1 report . "In 2014, there were approximately one and a half times more drug overdose deaths in the United States than deaths from motor vehicle crashes." Deaths from opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) came in at 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014 — a 14 percent increase from 2013. In fact, 61 percent of drug overdose deaths included some type of opioid, the CDC said.      Animal Attacks       Beware the mosquito.  Credit: James Gathany. Provided by CDC  Paul I. Howell, MPH; Prof. Frank Hadley Collins    Many people automatically think of sharks when they imagine deadly animals, but they're far from a leading cause of death. CDC Wonder doesn't always mention the exact animal, but it noted that nobody in the U.S. died from " contact with a marine animal " such as a whale or a shark in 2014 (although three people died in this category in 2013).  However, in 2014, six people died after being bitten or stung by a nonvenomous insect, 36 people died after being bitten or mauled by a dog and 83 died after being struck by a mammal (not including dogs), such as a cow or a horse. But rest assured — no one in the U.S. reportedly died from rat bites or crocodile or alligator attacks in 2014. Furthermore, there were no deaths from "contact with plant thorns and spines and sharp leaves," though it's good to know that's a category the CDC can use just in case. [ In Photos: The 10 Deadliest Animals ]  Worldwide, the deadliest animal (after the mosquito, which kills people with the illness-causing pathogens it carries) is perhaps the snake. Snakebites kill 20,000 people globally each year, according to a 2008 study published in the journal PLOS Medicine .      Transportation  In the United States, people are much more likely to die while walking on a roadway than from tuberculosis or getting mauled by an animal, the odds show. In the United States, there were about 37,000 deaths from "transport accidents" (including car, train, motorcycle and boat accidents). This number includes 6,200 pedestrians who died in transportation collisions — such as crashes with cars, trucks, bikes and trains — meaning that 2 pedestrians died per 100,000 people.  In fact, more pedestrians died in the United States than motorcyclists (about 4,100 deaths) and bicyclists (about 900 deaths) combined, according to CDC Wonder. But death rates from vehicle accidents are still the highest: More than 7,800 people died in a car, pickup truck, van, heavy transport vehicle (such as a semitruck) or bus accident in 2014. That's 2.5 per 100,000 people, according to CDC Wonder.  Of the deaths due to traffic accidents in the U.S., 31 percent were due to alcohol, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Of the motor-vehicle-related deaths, speeding accounted for 28 percent, distracted driving for 10 percent and drowsy drivers for almost 3 percent, the NHTSA said.      Terrorism & Homicides  In 2014, there were more than 32,700 deaths related to terrorism worldwide, according to the U.S. Department of State . (The department has yet to post data from 2015, and undoubtedly, these numbers have increased due to the conflicts in Syria and elsewhere.)  More than 6,200 of the 32,700 people (19 percent) killed were perpetrators. These people died after committing suicide, by accident or from security forces or victims responding to the attacks, the department reported. The terrorist attacks happened in 95 countries, but 78 percent of all terrorism fatalities took place in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria, the department said.  Large attacks increased from 2013 to 2014. In 2013, there were two attacks that killed more than 100 people, but in 2014, there were 20 attacks of this size. Moreover, the death count increased by 81 percent in 2014 compared to in 2013, largely because of terrorist activities in Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the department reported.  Of course, it's hard to define terrorism, but the department makes an attempt. Terrorism is a violent act "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal" that seeks to "coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience," according to the report. Terrorism also breaks international humanitarian law by targeting "noncombatants," or innocent people.  In the United States, about another 10,900 people died from an assault by a handgun, rifle, shotgun, larger firearm or unspecified firearm discharge in 2014, accounting for 3.4 deaths per 100,00 people, the CDC reported. (In this case, " firearm assaults " do not include suicides, unintentional shootings, shootings of undetermined intent, justifiable shootings, war or terrorism.)      Other Scary Ways to Die  For comparison, the table below lists the deaths caused by some of the more sensationalized means, also in 2014. These figures tend to vary significantly from year to year, and in the case of some — like deaths from venomous spiders — can be just a handful, or zero. They tend to be so low that when the rate of deaths per 100,000 people is calculated, the result is insignificantly tiny.      Cause of Death  Number of U.S. deaths in 2014 (total deaths = 2.6 million)    Dengue fever  2    Venomous snakes or lizards  5    Nonvenomous insects  6    Venomous spiders  7    Malaria  8    Nonpowered aircraft (Ex: hot air balloons, hang gliders)  13    Lightning  25    Struck or bitten by dog  36    Salmonella infection  45    Cataclysmic storm  61    Mauled by a mammal (not including dogs)  83    Avalanche, landslide or other Earth movement  85    Contact with venomous plants or animals (Ex: bees, scorpions)  91    Explosions (including gas)  116         Natural Disasters  Preparedness can make a world of difference when natural disasters strike. Take tsunamis, for instance. Since 2000 B.C., there have been about 2,400 tsunamis that have killed at least 500,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But the 2004 Sumatra and 2011 Tohoku (Fukushima) tsunamis were the deadliest waves in recent history. [ Fukushima Radiation Leak: 5 Things You Should Know ]  About 300,000 people were in danger during each of these disasters. But about 230,000 people died in the Sumatra tsunami, whereas an estimated 16,000 died in Japan , according to Vasily Titov, an oceanographer at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research in Seattle. The difference came down to tsunami education programs and warning systems in Japan, Titov said. "About the same amount of people were exposed for both events, but 10 percent of them died in Japan and about 90 percent were killed in Sumatra ," Titov told Live Science.  Fewer people died in Japan because "everyone is very much in tune with the tsunami hazard," and hundreds of thousands of people evacuated to shelters during and after the catastrophe, he said.       The 2011 tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, killed about 16,000 people and wiped out entire communities. With more people living in coastal regions every year, the risk of tsunami deaths only goes up.  Credit: Dylan McCord. U.S. Navy    Tsunami readiness may help save lives in the future. Nowadays, people who live on the coastlines of large bodies of water, especially the Pacific and Indian oceans, are at risk, and these populations are only growing. In 2000, about 625.2 million people worldwide lived in low-elevation coastal zones, according to a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS ONE . The researchers estimated that between 879 million and 949 million people will live in these low-elevation areas by 2030, making tsunami education and warning systems paramount.  But preparedness appears to be paying off. In 2010, an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile triggered a tsunami, and together, the earthquake and tsunami killed about 500 people. The tsunami was responsible for fewer than 200 of the deaths, Titov said. In 2015, an 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile also triggered a tsunami, but the country immediately evacuated about 1 million people away from the coastline, and only five people died in the catastrophe, Titov said.  To survive a tsunami, create a safety kit and plan, so you and your family know where to meet and how to evacuate to higher ground, Ready.gov advises. Also — needless to say — stay away from the beach.  Unlike for tsunamis, there is no warning system for earthquakes. But few large tremblors have struck populated areas of the United States in recent years. A total of eight people died from earthquakes from 1999 to 2014 in the United States, the CDC reported. Worldwide, earthquakes have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 629 people died from earthquakes in 2012; about 22,000 in 2011; and 320,120 in 2010, largely from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, according to the U.S. Geological Survey .  Avalanches and landslides also caused havoc. A total of 549 people died in these natural disasters from 1999 to 2014 in the United States. The deadliest year was 2014, with 85 deaths, including 43 from the catastrophic landslide in Oso , Washington.  Earth could also experience extraterrestrial threats from asteroids. After all, an asteroid is thought to have wiped out 75 percent of all species (including the dinosaurs) about 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period . But no human death ever recorded was due to an asteroid, so it's hard to give the odds of dying from one of these space rocks, said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer. (A meteorite was thought to have killed a man in southern India on Feb. 6, 2016, but NASA has since reported the event was more consistent with a land-based explosion than a space rock.) [ When Space Attacks: The 6 Craziest Meteor Impacts ]  "It is so rare, there has never been a scientifically confirmed report of someone being killed by a meteorite impact in recorded history," NASA's Planetary Defense Officer Lindley Johnson told Live Science in February. "There have been reports of injuries, but even those were extremely rare before the Chelyabinsk event three years ago."  Lightning is far more deadly, with 25 people getting zapped by a bolt in the United States in 2014. Cataclysmic storms (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, dust storms and tidal waves — which are shallow water waves) are even worse, killing 61 people in the country in 2014.  So take precautions, caring for your health and your safety, lest you become a statistic. But don't stress about the freak events — odds are, you'll die of something much more mundane.

Posted on May 7, 2010  by  Maggie Mahar     Summary- Not long ago, a New York Times editorial repeated a statistic that you may have heard before: "one in four Americans are projected to die of cancer."  Fortunately, this is a complete fabrication. For most Americans–including the vast majority of Times' readers– the risk is far lower.    A recent New York Times editorial announced that the war on cancer is reaching "a state of crisis."   Citing the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the Times called for boosting funds that support cancer trials while also raising the academic rewards to encourage researchers to run clinical trials. Appealing to readers' pre-dawn terrors, the editorial concludes by declaring that " Nearly one in four Americans are projected to die from cancer. It is vitally important to find the best treatments for them."   It's a strong "kicker "(journalese for an ending). The only catch: it's not true .  One in four Americans are not expected to die of cancer. Current projections say that one in four American men born in 1985 will die of cancer. For a woman, the odds drop to one in five . And for most Americans, the risk is much lower .  Consider that at least 30% of cancer deaths are caused by smoking . If you don't smoke, it is far less likely that you will end your life battling cancer.  Why the Risk is Lower for Most Americans  Dartmouth's Steven Woloshin, Lisa M. Schwartz and H. Gilbert Welch broke out the possibility of dying of cancer by age, sex, and smoking status in an article published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 2008.   It turns out that if you are a 50-year-old man who never smoked, the chances that, over the next 10 years, you will die of one of the cancers that are most likely to kill men ( prostate cancer, lung cancer, or colon cancer) are just 4 out of 1,000.  That is  a 0.4% chance. (The odds are higher, 5 out of 1,000,  that you will die in an accident). If  he is a smoker,  the odds for  a 50-year-old man more than quadruple, to 21 out of 1,000.  For a 50-year-old woman who doesn't smoke, the chances of dying of lung, breast,ovarian or cervical cancer over the next 10 years stand at  7 out of 1,000; if you smoke the odds rise to 20 out of 1,000. The authors of the study define a  "non-smoker" as someone who has smoked less than 100 cigarettes in her life.  A "smoker" is someone who has inhaled more than 100 cigarettes and smokes now  (any amount.) If you quit smoking, your odds of dying of cancer are cut in half ten years later.  Moreover, it's worth noting that the likelihood of dying of cancer are one in four for all 25-year old men (smokers and non-smokers lumped together) born in 1985. Back in 1975, projections suggested that a man born that year had only a 18% chance of dying of cancer, while a woman had a 16% chance. By 1985, the odds for a man had risen to 25%, and for a woman to 20%.  This is because we are living longer. In the past, a person was more  likely to be killed by heart disease or an infection before cancer caught up with him or her.  (Typically cancer tumors are diagnosed at age 67.)  Another way of putting this is to say that the longer you live, the more likely it is that cancer will cause your death. If a man lives to 70, the odds are 28 out of 1,000 that this much dreaded disease will kill him over the next ten years, even if he never smoked.  On the other hand, at that age the odds that  he will die of something over the next decade are nearly 300 out of 1,000.  By contrast, the likelihood that cancer will do him in is pretty slim.  A 70-year-old women who never smoked faces the same odds: 28 out of 1,000- that , sometime over the next ten years, "cancer" will be listed as the cause of her death.. But the chances that she something will kill her over the same span are 207 out of 1,000.  For smokers who make it to 70, the risk of death by cancer is far higher: 132 out of 1,000 for men, 80 out of 1,000 for women.  Finally, low-income Americans face a much greater risk . For example, poor women are about twice as likely to die of breast cancer as wealthier women. This is because they receive less medical care, and less sophisticated care. "Where patient care is equal, treatment and outcome are equal," explains Otis Brawley, MD, associate director of the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University. Article published in the American Cancer Society's News Center .  Brawley begins with data on African-American women which shows that they are about twice as likely to die of breast cancer as white women. But this is a relatively new phenomenon.  Until about 1980, their survival rates were equal.   And genes "didn't change around 1980," Brawley observes. In other words, there is little reason to suspect that African-American women suddenly became more susceptible to breast cancer than white women.  What changed since 1980?  Treatment for breast cancer has advanced over the past 30 years. "Improved breast surgery techniques became more common, new chemotherapy drugs improved survival times and tamoxifen began reducing recurrence rates,"  says Brawley. ut "women too poor to have insurance or adequate income to pay for those advances didn't benefit from them.  " Because there is a larger portion of low-income earners among African Americans, it can seem that race is the reason for worse cancer rates, when it mainly is poverty, " he adds.  I should add that studies do suggest that skin color can add to disparities in how much care patients receive. The vast majority of doctors are white, and research suggests that African American patients and white doctors may view each other with some suspicion. At the very least, cultural differences can  make communication difficult.  But Brawley points out that among U.S. military personnel-who all have access to the same quality of care-survival rates among African American breast cancer patients and white breast cancer patients have remained the same since 1980.  Why is the New York Times Trying to  Scare Its Readers?  Just how many of the NYTs' readers are low-income, African-American men who smoke? Not many.  How many  are 30 to 55 year old middle-class or upper-middle-class women who don't smoke?  Many more. Those women face a chance of dying of cancer in the next 10 years that ranges from less than 1 out of 1000 to 13 out of 1000, depending on their age. The longer they live, the greater the risk. We all will die of something. So if a person beats heart disease, it becomes more likely that he will face cancer. But  a 75-year-old woman should not lie awake worrying about this terrible disease. There is a 1 in 3 chance that she will die before she turns turns 85. The odds that cancer will be the cause of her death are just are 33 out of 1,000.  The bottom line: New York Times readers who don't smoke do not face a one in four chance of dying of cancer at any age. I don't know why the Times would throw that  number out there. But I would guess that the person who wrote the editorial believes the statistic. Perhaps he read it in another newspaper.  Finally, let me suggest that rather than pouring more  money into chasing an elusive cure for cancer, we should be putting those dollars into two things that we KNOW will greatly reduce death by cancer: a major campaign to help Americans stop smoking — complete with free drugs and nicotine patches –and an all-out effort  to ensure that all Americans, poor as well as rich, receive the cancer treatments that we know are most effective. (Giving more Americans health insurance is one thing —making sure that everyone receives the same level of care, regardless of income or skin color, is something else.

I think citing the IOM and calling for boosting funds that support cancer trials and raising the academic rewards to encourage researchers to run clinical trials could give you an answer. Tens of thousands of scientists pushing a goal of finding the tiniest improvements in treatment rather than genuine breakthroughs, that fosters redundant problems and rewards academic achievement and publication above all else. We have produced an entire generation of investigators in clinical oncology who believe that the only valid form of clinical research is to perform well-designed, prospective, randomized trials in which patients are randomized to receive one empiric drug combination versus another empiric drug combination. Proof of efficacy of a cancer treatment such as chemotherapy requires a randomized trial in which it has been shown that the group treated with chemotherapy experienced significantly increased survival when compared to that of an untreated group. This has never been done. Most claims for the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic agent comes from trials showing shrinkage of tumors or from comparison of survival rates of unmatched groups over time. Unless tumor shrinkage is accompanied by evidence of increased survival, the treatment cannot be claimed to be effective. Additionally, in clinical trials, many patients are excluded because they could not complete the rather arduous treatment. So randomized comparisons are of healthier treated patients against all the controls, rendering a lot a trials flawed. Until the controlled, randomized clinical trial approach has delivered curative results with a high success rate, the choice of physicians to intergrate promising insights and methods remains an essential component quality cancer care.           Word on May 7, 2010 at 8:38 pm  said:    Maggie- I am fairly new to your site, and have enjoyed a number of your articles, but I find this one a bit tendentious.  A couple of points: First, regarding the headline that the 1 in 4 claim is wrong:  Ok, so it’s 1 in 5 for women instead of 1 in 4.  If we figure that about half of Americans are men and half are women, the overall number is probably somewhere around 1 in 4.5. Is that really so different?  Is funding for cancer research not worth it if the average American born in ’85 only has a 22.5% chance of dying of it instead of a 25% chance? And what about the cancer patients who are lucky enough to survive their ordeal?  Some cancers are highly treatable, even curable, but many of the therapies are toxic, disfiguring, or associated with significant side-effects.  Research into new therapies can reduce these burdens.  It seems to me, for example, that the research showing lumpectomy with radiation is (usually) just as good as radical mastectomy represents an important advance, even if it doesn’t increase the cure rate. Second, regarding your hypothetical 50 year olds:  Obviously the likelihood of a 50 year old man dying within 10 years of 3 pre-selected cancers is not directly comparable to the proportion of men or women who will, when they ultimately die, die of cancer.  So regardless of what the numbers are, there just isn’t a way for this kind of analysis to refute the claim you are supposedly refuting. But I use the word tendentious because the study you cite uses several factors that will artificially lower the mortality rate.  They selected lung cancer as 1 of the  3 cancers that they track for both men and women, but then stipulate that these are non-smokers.  Lung cancer is not a common cancer in non-smokers.  Thanks to Pap smears, cervical cancer is also not a common cancer in America anymore (it’s the 8th most common cause of cancer death in American women according to wikipedia.)  Prostate cancer is slow growing and not usually diagnosed before age 50.  So the number of men who die of prostate cancer before age 60 is very different from the number who will ultimately die of it.  In fact, that’s true of most cancers.  As you note in the article, most people who die of cancer are older than 60.  So why follow 50 year olds and only count deaths that occur within 10 years?  Maybe it’s to intentionally underestimate the cancer death rate.           Jenga on May 7, 2010 at 8:55 pm  said:    Nice article.  Fear sells in the media and in the hospital.           Maggie Mahar on May 7, 2010 at 9:40 pm  said:    Jenga & Word Jenga — Thanks much.. Word–Welcome to HealthBeat. The big difference regarding risk of cancer is not between men and women. The big difference is between smokers and non-smokers. I would have thought that smoking mainly increased your chances of dying of lung cancer. But when I looked at the research, I discovered that wasn’t true. Your chances of dying of breast cancer, abdominal cancer, kidney cancer–etc., etc., are higher if you smoke. Woloshin, Schwartz and Welch focused on the cancers that cause the most deaths for men and women because other cancers account for a very small percentage of cancer deaths. And, they were trying to make the book & charts readable for a lay audience. They are also highly respected reasearchers–I’ve never seen anyone questioning their numbers in peer-reviewed medical literature. And they don’t focus on people who are 50 or under–their charts go up to people age 75– and look at what happens to them between 75 and 85. (A very small percentage of the population lives past 85). I quoted what happens to 50 -year -olds–as well as 70-year-olds–becuase the vast majority of the Times’ readers (and my readers) are well under 70. So I assumed they would be most interested in what happens to people in their peer group. Click on the link that leads you to the charts. (end of post) I suspect you will be surprised (as I was when I first saw them) to see how low my risk, or your risk, is of dying of cancer at any age (I’m assuming you don’t smoke.)           Maggie Mahar on May 7, 2010 at 9:53 pm  said:    Greg– I’m afraid that, to a large degree, you are right. Though, since I have worked at the Times, I would also say that Times’ editors are pretty concerned about their health — heart disease, cancer, etc. They are not as  susceptible to these diseases as some other poorer, more obese Americans, but they do worry.           Word on May 8, 2010 at 2:29 pm  said:    Thanks for the warm welcome. You caught me- I hadn’t really looked at the charts closely and having now done so, I agree.  My risk is surprisingly low.  What I found even more surprising is that even a 75 year old smoker has a less than 50% chance of dying within 10 years from any cause, not just cancer, or heart disease. But, I still don’t think it’s fair to say that the 1 in 4 claim made by NYT is “a complete fabrication”.  It seems that it’s an accurate number for men and nearly accurate for women.  Just because the average NYT reader has a below average risk doesn’t mean they can’t cite the overall average.           Maggie Mahar on May 8, 2010 at 4:09 pm  said:    Word– point taken. But since the risk of dying of some type of cancer are so much greater if you smoke, lumping smokers and non-smokers together is very misleading. Also, most of the adults in this country who still smoke are poor. The poor are sicker than the rest of us and at greater risk–something we tend to ignore. Most people don’t realize that the poor die six years earlier than affluent Americans. A six-years difference in expected life-span within one society is extraordinay (you don’t see this in other developed countries.) We should be putting much more money into public health and public schools. But fear of cancer has spawned a very lucrative industry: equipment makers like GE, drugmakers, hospitals and some doctors make a fortune. The American Cancer Society takes money from the medical industrial complex that profits (and profiteers)  from our fear of cancer. This is why they put out numbers like 1 in 4. And no one at the NYT scratches his head and says : “Wait a minute–can that be true? When I think of older friends and relatives who have died, one out of four didn’t die of cancer . . .” Meanwhile, the worried well tend to be middle-class and upper-middle class Americans who really don’t need to be so worried. Their risks are  lower. They will live longer.  If they took some of that energy and worried about the poor . . . That’s why I think that publicatons like the NYT (our paper of record) should getting the truth out there by analyzing the numbers rather than just throwing out a scary number that virtually everyone will think applies to them.           Too Tall Bob on May 8, 2010 at 4:19 pm  said:    Just have to comment on health disparities–according to studies reviewed by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD), people with major mental illnesses die 20-25 years before the average.  While director of mental health and addictions for the State of Oregon, I commissioned a study that showed that people who had both a major mental illness and an addictions problems died at the average age of 44.  Smoking, poverty, poor access to health care, some interactions with medications, and other factors contribute…is there a larger health disparity in the US?           Barry Carol on May 8, 2010 at 7:12 pm  said:    Approximately 2.4 million people die in the U.S. each year of which slightly less than 550,000 or 23% die from cancer.  It’s our second largest killer after heart disease. I don’t know what the average age is among the people who die from cancer, how many of them smoked or what their socio-economic status was.  As heart disease becomes better managed, fewer are dying from that cause. The bottom line is that close to 25% of deaths in the U.S. in any given year are from cancer.           Maggie Mahar on May 9, 2010 at 1:20 pm  said:    Barry– The bottom-line is that 30% of those deaths are related to smoking. And virtually all of the adults in the U.S. who stil smoke are poor. IF we cared, we would launch an anti-smoking campaign, giving out the nicotine patches and new drugs that now make it fairly easily for most people to quite smoking. This would cost far, far less than all of the money we spend on tests that don’t save lives or extend lives, terribly expensive drugs that give people only a few extra months of life . . . And we would have eliminated nearly 1/3 of the deaths by cancer. We also need an anti-smoking campaign in the shcools (complete with nicotine patches)–kids have begun smoking again. Finally, today’s cancer reasearch is not well co-ordinated (as the Times makes clear). Rather than pouring more money in it, we need to re-think and re-structure the research, with the NIH taking charge and making it collaborative, not competitive. (All researchers should be sharing their reserach). An article just came out in the Archives of Internal Medicine points out that if you are diagnosed with cancer, chances are 1 out of 2 that the cancer, or complications related to the cancer would kill youo. Yet, the article points out, most newspaper and magazine articles focus on cures, “sugar-coating” the truth– many cancers are incurable and many very aggressive treatments don’t work. We haven’t gotten as far in cancer research as many people think. Cliff Leaf wrote an outstanding piece for Fortune magazine 3 or 4 years ago about the state of cancer reserach. . . You probably can find it by Googling. He took a very honest look at what was happening.           Margalit Gur-Arie on May 9, 2010 at 2:06 pm  said:    Maggie, I don’t know about that 1/3 reduction in deaths if people didn’t smoke. Maybe people who are more likely to die from cancer are also more likely to smoke and not the other way around (I’m not talking about lung cancer). As you point out poverty has a lot to do with both smoking and dying, but i’m not clear on which is the cause and which the effect. As to research, it must remain competitive at least to a certain degree. Competitiveness is one of the major drivers in science discovery. People actually dream about beating the other teams and getting the Nobel Prize. Not too much came out of the USSR collaborative system in spite of having top notch scientists. If something is responsible for one quarter of deaths, I say we step up the effort to find a solution, and I don’t mean palliative acceptance of defeat. Anti smoking campaigns are a very good thing too. Maybe we should start by withdrawing tobacco farmers subsidies and obliterate this death industry. Maybe we can pay them to switch to other crops like they do for poppies in other parts of the world.           Maggie Mahar on May 9, 2010 at 3:39 pm  said:    Margalit– Yes, people who are more likley to die of cancer are also more likely to smoke because poor people are more likely to die of cancer (even when insured they get subpar care) and poor people are also more likely to smoke. The heart of the problem is poverty, the stress that poverty causes, and the way we discriminate against the poor when providing health care. What we need is a new war on poverty. (The U.S. tobacco farming industry is shrinking on its own –only 2% of tobacco dollars now spent on U.S. tobacco, and most cigarettes smoked here use imported tobacco.)

Now it’s MRSA or flesh-eating bacteria…both a problem, but uncommon. If we take our limited resources and apply them to the most common and highest risk–for which we have strategies that work–more people stay healthy and live longer. And we don’t Scare Ourselves To Death.

By Mayo Clinic Staff    You might wonder about your chances of developing cancer. News reports can make it sound as if every day something is found to dramatically raise your risk. Sorting through all the information and figuring out what's valid can be tricky.   What is risk?    When scientists talk about risk, they're referring to a probability — the chance that something may occur, but not a guarantee that it will. For example, if you flip a coin, there is one chance in two, or a 50 percent chance, that the coin will land heads up.  Risk estimates for cancer and other diseases are determined by studying large groups of people. Researchers focus on the probability that any person or category of people will develop the disease over a certain period of time. They also look to see what characteristics or behaviors are associated with increased or decreased risk.   How is risk expressed?      Absolute risk        Relative risk    Risk is generally divided into two categories: absolute risk and relative risk.  Absolute risk  Absolute risk refers to the actual numeric chance or probability of developing cancer during a specified time period — for example, within the year, within the next five years, by age 50, by age 70, or during the course of a lifetime.  One type of absolute risk is lifetime risk, which is the probability that an individual will develop cancer during the course of a lifetime. For instance, an American man's absolute risk of developing prostate cancer in his lifetime is about 12 percent. Put another way, about 12 out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer at some time in their lives. This also means that 88 out of every 100 men won't develop prostate cancer.  Lifetime risk isn't the risk that a person will develop cancer in the next year or the next five years. An individual's cancer risk has a lot to do with other factors, such as age. For instance, a woman's lifetime risk of developing colon and rectal cancer is just over 4 percent, or about 42 out of every 1,000 women. But her risk of developing colon and rectal cancer before the age of 50 is 0.3 percent, or about 3 out of every 1,000 women.  Relative risk  Relative risk gives you a comparison or ratio rather than an absolute value. It shows the strength of the relationship between a risk factor and a particular type of cancer by comparing the number of cancers in a group of people who have a particular trait with the number of cancers in a group of people who don't have that trait.  For instance, compare the relative lung cancer risk for people who smoke with the relative lung cancer risk in a similar group of people who don't smoke. You might hear relative risk being expressed like this: The risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25 times higher than the risk for people who don't smoke. So the relative risk of lung cancer for smokers is 25.  Relative risk is also given as a percentage. For example, the risk of lung cancer for smokers is 2,500 percent higher than it is for people who don't smoke.  When you hear about relative risk, there's no upper limit to the percentage increase in risk. Most people think 100 percent is the highest possible risk, but that isn't true in this case.  A relative risk of 100 percent means your risk is twice as high as that of someone without that risk factor. A 200 percent relative risk means that you are three times as likely to develop that condition.  Risk seems greater when put in these terms. A 100 percent increase in risk may seem enormous, but if the risk began as 1 in 100 people, a 100 percent increase in risk means that 2 out of 100 will be affected.
