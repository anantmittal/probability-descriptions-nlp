                  Game Theory (Part 9)  John Baez  Last time we talked about independence of a pair of outcomes, but we can easily go on and talk about independence of a longer sequence of outcomes.  For example, suppose we have three coins.   Suppose:   the 1st coin has probability \( p_H\) of landing heads up and \( p_T\) of landing tails up;  the 2nd coin has probability \( q_H\) of landing heads up and \( q_T\) of landing tails up;  the 3rd coin has probability \( r_H\) of landing heads up and \( r_T\) of landing tails up.   Suppose we flip all of these coins: the 1st, then the 2nd, then the 3rd.  What's the probability that we get this sequence of results: \( (H, T, T)\) If the coin flips are independent , the probability is just this product: \( p_H \, q_T \, r_T \) See the pattern?  We just multiply the probabilities.  And there's nothing special about coins here, or the number three . We could flip a coin, roll a die, pick a card, and see if it's raining outside. For example, what's the probability that we get heads with our coin, the number 6 on our die, an ace of spades with our cards, and it's raining? If these outcomes are independent , we just calculate: the probability that we get heads, times
the probability that we roll a 6, times
the probability that we get an ace of spades, times
the probability that it's raining outside. Let's solve some puzzles using this idea! Three flips of a fair coin Example 1. Suppose you have a fair coin: this means it has a 50% chance of landing heads up and a 50% chance of landing tails up.  Suppose you flip it three times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up, then tails up, then heads up? We're asking about the probability of this outcome: \( (H, T, H)\) Since the flips are independent this is \( p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H \, p_T \, p_H \) Since the coin is fair we have \( \displaystyle{ p_H = p_T = \frac{1}{2} } \) so \(  \displaystyle{ p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} } \) So the answer is 1/8, or 12.5%. Example 2. In the same situation, what's the probability that the coin lands heads up exactly twice? There are 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 outcomes that can happen: \( (H,H,H) \)
\( (H,H,T), \; (H,T,H), \; (T,H,H) \)
\( (H,T,T), \; (T,H,T), \; (T,T,H) \)
\( (T,T,T) \) We can work out the probability of each of these outcomes.  For example, we've already seen that \( (H,T,H)\) is \( \displaystyle{ p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{8} }\) since the coin is fair and the flips are independent.  In fact, all 8 probabilities work out the same way.  We always get 1/8.  In other words, each of the 8 outcomes is equally likely! But we're interested in the probability that we get exactly two heads.  That's the probability of this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) Using the rule we saw in Part 7 , this probability is \( \displaystyle{ p(S) = p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} = 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) So the answer is 3/8, or 37.5%. I could have done this a lot faster.  I could say "there are 8 outcomes that can happen, each equally likely, and three that give us two heads, so the probability is 3/8."   But I wanted to show you how we're just following rules we've already seen! Three flips of a very unfair coin Example 3. Now suppose we have an unfair coin with a 90% chance of landing heads up and 10% chance of landing tails up!  What's the probability that if we flip it three times, it lands heads up exactly twice?  Again let's assume the coin flips are independent. Most of the calculation works exactly the same way, but now our coin has \( \displaystyle{ p_H = 0.9, \quad p_T = 0.1 } \) We're interested in the outcomes where the coin comes up heads twice, so we look at this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) The probability of this subset is \( \begin{array}{ccl} p(S) &=& p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} \\  &=& p_T \, p_H  \, p_H + p_H \, p_T \, p_H + p_H \, p_H \, p_T \\ &=& 3 p_T p_H^2 \\ &=& 3 \times 0.1 \times 0.9^2 \\ &=& 0.3 \times 0.81 \\ &=& 0.243 \end{array}\) So now the probability is just 24.3%. Six flips of a fair coin Example 4. Suppose you have a fair coin.  Suppose you flip it six times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up exactly twice? We did a similar problem already, where we flipped the coin three times.  Go back and look at that if you forget!  The answer to that problem was \( \displaystyle{ 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) Why?  Here's why: there were 3 ways to get two heads when you flipped 3 coins, and each of these outcomes had probability \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} }\) We can do our new problem the same way.  Count the number of ways to get two heads when we flip six coins.  Then multiply this by \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} }\) The hard part is to count how many ways we can get two heads when we flip six coins.  To get good at probabilities, we have to get good at counting.  It's boring to list all the outcomes we're trying to count: (H,H,T,T,T,T), (H,T,H,T,T,T), (H,T,T,H,T,T), ... So let's try to come up with a better idea. We have to pick 2 out of our 6 flips to be H's.  How many ways are there to do this? There are 6 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, and then 5 ways left over to pick another and draw a blue H on it... letting the rest be T's.  For example: (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, we've got 6 × 5 = 30 choices.  But we don't really care which H is red and which H is blue—that's just a trick to help us solve the problem.  For example, we don't want to count (T, H , T, T, H , T) as different from (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, there aren't really 30 ways to get two heads.  There are only half as many!  There are 15 ways. So, the probability of getting two heads when we flip the coin six times is \( \displaystyle{ 15 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{15}{64} \approx .234 } \) where the squiggle means 'approximately'.  So: about 23.4%. Binomial coefficients Now for some jargon, which will help when we do harder problems like this.  We say there are 6 choose 2 ways to choose 2 out of 6 things, and we write this as \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2} } \) This sort of number is called a binomial coefficient . We've just shown that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2}  = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 }\) Why write it like this funky fraction: \( \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1}\)?  Because it'll help us see the pattern for doing harder problems like this! Nine flips of a fair coin If we flip a fair coin 9 times, and the flips are independent, what's the probability that we get heads exactly 6 times? This works just like the last problem, only the numbers are bigger.  So, I'll do it faster! When we flip the coin 9 times there are \( 2^9\) possible outcomes that can happen.   Each of these is equally likely if it's a fair coin and the flips are independent.  So each has probability \( \displaystyle{  \frac{1}{2^9} } \) To get the answer, we need to multiply this by the number of ways we can get heads exactly 6 times.  This number is called '9 choose 6' or \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6}  }\) for short.  It's the number of ways we can choose 6 things out of a collection of 9. So we just need to know: what's 9 choose 6?  We can work this out as before.  There are 9 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, then 8 ways left to pick another and draw a blue H on it, and 7 ways left to pick a third and draw a orange H on it.  That sounds like 9 × 8 × 7. But we've overcounted!   After all, we don't care about the colors.  We don't care about the difference between this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) and this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) In fact we've counted each possibility 6 times!  Why six?   The first H could be red, green or blue — that's 3 choices.  But then the second H could be either of the two remaining 2 colors... and for the third, we just have 1 choice.  So there are 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways to permute the colors. So, the actual number of ways to get 6 heads out of 9 coin flips is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) In other words: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) To get the answer to our actual problem, remember we need to multiply \( 1/2^9\) by this.  So the answer is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6} }\) If you're a pure mathematician, you can say you're done now.  But normal people won't understand this answer, so let's calculate it out.  I hope you know the first ten powers of two: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.  So: \( \displaystyle{ 2^9 = 512 }\) I hope you can also do basic arithmetic like this: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84} \) So, the probability of getting 6 heads when you do 9 independent flips of a fair coin is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6}  = \frac{84}{512} = 0.164025 } \) or 16.4025%. I broke down and used a calculator at the last step.   We're becoming serious nerds here. Okay, that's enough for now.  We've been counting how many ways we can get a certain number of heads from a certain number of coin flips.  What we're realy doing is taking a set of coin flips, say \( n\) of them, and choosing a subset of \( k\) of them to be heads.  So, we say Definition. The binomial coefficient  \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} } \) called \( n\) choose \( k,\) is the number of ways of choosing a subset of \( k\) things from a set of \( n\) things. We have seen in some examples that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots 1} } \) Here there's a product of \( k\) consecutive numbers on top, and \( k\) on bottom too.  We didn't prove this is true in general, but it's not hard to see, using the tricks we've used already.

Sunday, March 29, 2009  Have you ever flipped a coin as a way of deciding something with another person? The answer is probably yes. And you probably did so assuming you were getting a fair deal, because, as everybody knows, a coin is equally likely to show heads or tails after a single flip—unless it's been shaved or weighted or has a week-old smear of coffee on its underbelly.   So when your friend places a coin on his thumb and says "call it in the air", you realize that it doesn't really matter whether you pick heads or tails. Every person has a preference, of course—heads or tails might feel "luckier" to you—but logically the chances are equal.  Or are they?   Granted, everybody knows that newly-minted coins are born with tiny imperfections, minute deviations introduced by the fabrication process. Everybody knows that, over time, a coin will wear and tear, picking up scratches, dings, dents, bacteria, and finger-grease. And everybody knows that these imperfections can affect the physics of the coin flip, biasing the results by some infinitesimal amount which in practice we ignore.  But let's assume that's not the case.  Let's assume the coin is fabricated perfectly, down to the last vigintillionth of a yoctometer . And, since it's possible to train one's thumb to flip a coin such that it comes up heads or tails a huge percentage of the time, let's assume the person flipping the coin isn't a magician or a prestidigitator. In other words, let's assume both a perfect coin and an honest toss, such as the kind you might make with a friend to decide who pays for lunch.  In that case there's an absolute right and wrong answer to the age-old question...  Heads or tails?  ...because the two outcomes of a typical coin flip are not equally likely.  The 50-50 proposition is actually more of a 51-49 proposition, if not worse. The sacred coin flip exhibits (at minimum) a whopping 1% bias , and possibly much more. 1% may not sound like a lot, but it's more than the typical casino edge in a game of blackjack or slots. What's more, you can take advantage of this little-known fact to give yourself an edge in all future coin-flip battles.  The Physics of Coin Flipping  In the 31-page Dynamical Bias in the Coin Toss , Persi Diaconis, Susan Holmes, and Richard Montgomery lay out the theory and practice of coin-flipping to a degree that's just, well, downright intimidating.   Suffice to say their approach involved a lot of physics, a lot of math, motion-capture cameras, random experimentation, and an automated "coin-flipper" device capable of flipping a coin and producing Heads 100% of the time.   Here are the broad strokes of their research:   If the coin is tossed and caught , it has about a 51% chance of landing on the same face it was launched. (If it starts out as heads, there's a 51% chance it will end as heads).  If the coin is spun, rather than tossed , it can have a much-larger-than-50% chance of ending with the heavier side down. Spun coins can exhibit "huge bias" (some spun coins will fall tails-up 80% of the time).  If the coin is tossed and allowed to clatter to the floor , this probably adds randomness.  If the coin is tossed and allowed to clatter to the floor where it spins , as will sometimes happen, the above spinning bias probably comes into play.  A coin will land on its edge around 1 in 6000 throws , creating a flipistic singularity .  The same initial coin-flipping conditions produce the same coin flip result . That is, there's a certain amount of determinism to the coin flip.  A more robust coin toss (more revolutions) decreases the bias .   The 51% figure in Premise 1 is a bit curious and, when I first saw it, I assumed it was a minor bias introduced by the fact that the "heads" side of the coin has more decoration than the "tails" side, making it heavier. But it turns out that this sort of imbalance has virtually no effect unless you spin the coin on its edge, in which case you'll see a huge bias. The reason a typical coin toss is 51-49 and not 50-50 has nothing to do with the asymmetry of the coin and everything to do with the aggregate amount of time the coin spends in each state, as it flips through space.  A good way of thinking about this is by looking at the ratio of odd numbers to even numbers when you start counting from 1.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17  No matter how long you count, you'll find that at any given point, one of two things will be true:   You've touched more odd numbers than even numbers  You've touched an equal amount of odd numbers and even numbers   What will never happen, is this:   You've touched more even numbers than odd numbers.   Similarly, consider a coin, launched in the "heads" position, flipping heads over tails through the ether:  H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H  At any given point in time, either the coin will have spent equal time in the Heads and Tails states, or it will have spent more time in the Heads state. In the aggregate, it's slightly more likely that the coin shows Heads at a given point in time—including whatever time the coin is caught. And vice-versa if you start the coin-flip from the Tails position.  The Strategy of Coin Flipping  Unlike the article on the edge in a game of blackjack mentioned previously, I've never seen a description of "coin flipping strategy" which takes the above science into count. When it's a true 50-50 toss, there is no strategy. But if we take it as granted, or at least possible, that a coin flip does indeed exhibit a 1% or more bias, then the following rules of thumb might apply.   Always be the chooser, if possible . This allows you to leverage Premise 1 or Premise 2 for those extra percentage points.  Always be the tosser , if you can. This protects you from virtuoso coin-flippers who are able to leverage Premise 6 to produce a desired outcome. It also protects you against the added randomness (read: fairness) introduced by flippers who will occasionally, without rhyme or reason, invert the coin in their palm before revealing. Tricksy Hobbitses.  Don't allow the same person to both toss and choose . Unless, of course, that person is you.  If the coin is being tossed, and you're the chooser, always choose the side that's initially face down . According to Premise 1, you'd always choose the side that's initially face up, but most people, upon flipping a coin, will invert it into their other palm before revealing. Hence, you choose the opposite side, but you get the same 1% advantage. Of course, if you happen to know that a particular flipper doesn't do this, use your better judgment.  If you are the tosser but not the chooser, sometimes invert the coin into your other palm after catching, and sometimes don't . This protects you against people who follow Rule 4 blindly by assuming you'll either invert the coin or you won't.  If the coin is being spun rather than tossed , always choose whichever side is lightest . On a typical coin, the "Heads" side of the coin will have more "stuff" engraved on it, causing Tails to show up more frequently than it should. Choosing Tails in this situation is usually the power play.  Never under any circumstances agree to a coin spin if you're not the chooser . This opens you up to a devastating attack if your opponent is aware of Premise 2.   I hope I've made it clear that none of this is really to be taken seriously. The point is that adding even 1% of wobble to a situation of pure chance can create a lot of additional complexity, and that in turn, can create strategy where none existed before.  Tags: probability , coin flipping    54 comment(s)   Great little article. I very much enjoyed this.  I would add to your "coin flip strategy" that if you suspect you're facing a "virtuoso tosser" and he won't let you do the toss, make him toss it on the ground.  Cheers.   Heads I Win Tails You Lose on Sunday, March 29, 2009   Lol. Interesting.  I may be mistaken here, but I believe your term "one vigintillionth of a yoctometer" is below the Plank length, making it so small as to be meaningless. Been a while since I looked at this stuff (college in fact) but...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length   Anonymous Coward on Sunday, March 29, 2009   that's the point.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, October 17, 2011   Awesome article. Really enjoyed reading it and having a break from the indepth computer science. Thanks.   Poker Forums on Monday, March 30, 2009   One vigintillionth of a yoctometer? Major phail! If we're throwing away practical concerns, we should atleast adhere to realm of the theoretically possible.  Jokes aside, nice article. For a moment, I was thinking that, even given your explanation of the inherent bias, it doesn't make sense since the coin would never land in the position it started at without flipping, as that would really be an invalid flip. But then, I guess all you do is move the minimum number of flips ahead to 2 or 3, and the state of the coin there is your new "initial" state, and you can set up the same argument. Nice.  However, I wonder what the case would be if one started the coin at a half-flip, on its edge? You might say that the initial face would correspond to the next face to show up after it performs a half-flip. But instead of a half-flip, what if you had just behind a half-flip? What about a quarter flip? I don't know a good line of reasoning to take care of these cases, it almost seems arbitrary.  And of course, it's totally pointless too. But who cares, interesting nonetheless!   ehsanul on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   [i]>One vigintillionth of a yoctometer? Major phail! If we're throwing away practical concerns, we should at least adhere to realm of the theoretically possible.[/i]  Yes, major fail. Guilty! But more memorable than "down to the last molecule/nanometer/etc". I got the idea for the phrase from Neal Stephenson's book in which the villain has a knife with an edge "one molecule wide".  If you managed to flip the coin from the edge position (let E represent the edge state):  E H E T E H E T E H E T E H E T E H E T E H  I still think the sequence exhibits the clumping shown above, because the coin spends only a tiny fraction of its time in those E states (it's really only in E when it's perfectly vertical). Because the aggregate time in E is so small, the probabilities would still favor whatever state immediately followed the initial E state (in this case, heads). At least, it seems you could make the argument.   Coding the Wheel on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Another strategy. If not obvious:   If you are the tosser, and not the chooser, flip the coin into your palm after the toss only if they pick the face up side.    James R on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   You missed an important strategy.  I used to earn lunch money in high school thusly:
I could flip a coin to come out "heads" about 90% of the time (with practice, same as knife throwing, control # of flips through the air during a certain time between flip and catch).  Anyhow, I flip, you call while in the air.
I catch and you most always lose because after you call it in the air, I choose to catch, or catch and invert (your #5. above). You assume it was fair because you called it in the air. No one ever figured out what I was doing (or I would have been beaten up!).   Comfortable on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Persi Diaconis is also the guy who did the (often-misquoted) research into how many times you should shuffle a deck of cards.   bmm6o on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   So, to paraphrase Vizzini:  "But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you: are you the sort of man who would put the coin into his own hand or his enemy's? Now, a clever man would put the coin into his own hand, because he would know that only a great fool would request to make the call. I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the side facing up. But you must have known I was not a great fool, you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the side facing down."  But we all know how Vizzini ended up. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha...   Anonymous Coward on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Just found your blog and have read quite a few of your posts - excellent job.  I think you're explanation of why it's 51% is suspect however.  In fact the paper does show that a coin flipped without precession does have a 50/50 chance (even though your H T H T H T H argument would still apply).  But with precession the coin will spend a greater frequency of it's time in the starting position (in fact with enough precession it will appear to flip but be 100% in the up position - alas I can not seem to master that).  If you take a coin and manually flip it end over end while precessing it at the same time you can kind of visualize this.  In the case without precession it's irrelevant that it starts as heads or tails.  What's relevant is that after flipping the coin spends equal amounts of time in the air in both states.  Again with precession this is not true.  Apparently their experiments showed that a typical coin flip done by hand precesses enough to give the 1% bias.   Anonymous Coward on Saturday, April 04, 2009   How did you get the 1 in 6000 figure for ending up on it's edge?  Seems low to my thinking. BTW, happened to me, a long time ago over who buys the next pitcher of beer.  I never met anyone else who has seen a coin land on its edge.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, April 06, 2009   [i]>I think you're explanation of why it's 51% is suspect however. In fact the paper does show that[/i]  You're right. The entire argument is an oversimplification.  [i]>How did you get the 1 in 6000 figure for ending up on it's edge?[/i]  That figure was for a nickel and I think it would be less for other coins. It was buried on page 10 of [url=http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~susan/papers/headswithJ.pdf]Dynamical Bias in the Coin Toss[/url] which references [url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993PhRvE..48.2547M]the original research[/url]. There's also some other [url=http://www.google.com/search?q=coin+landing+on+edge]research[/url] on this.   Coding the Wheel on Monday, April 06, 2009   A couple days ago I flipped a coin (nickel) and it landed, rolled, and stayed on edge. It was a new nickel and a flat (glass) table but it happened.  One of the more interesting "light reading" posts I've come across in weeks.   jzx on Wednesday, April 08, 2009   I'm neither a mathematician nor a physicist, having found my way here via the link from Freakonomics (I suppose I should say I'm not an economist either), but I think the HTHT analysis would lead to a conclusion opposite to the one given here.  If we assume that the coin is in fact flipped, and not simply "moved from Point A to Point B by a process that may or may not involve flipping," then isn't it correct to deem the initial state of a flipped coin as being 180 degrees revolved from its state in the flipper's hand? If so (and that seems right to me), the HTHT analysis leads to the conclusion that the side of the coin more likely to be up at the end of the flip is the side that was down in the flipper's hands.   DBH on Thursday, April 16, 2009   I would appreciate a strategy for Two-up
Two-up is a traditional Australian gambling game, involving a designated 'Spinner' throwing two coins into the air. Traditionally, these coins are pennies. Incidentally, their weight size and surface design make them ideal for the game. Weight and size make them stable on the 'kip' and easy to spin in the air. Decimal coins are generally considered to be too small and light and they don't 'fly' so well. The design of pennies that date pre 1939 had the soveriegns head on the obverse(front) and the reverse was totally covered in writing making the result very easy and quick to see. Pennies can often be obseved being used at games on Anzac Day, they are and brought out specifically for the purpose each year.  Players gamble on whether the coins will fall with both (obverse) heads up, both (reverse) tails up, or with one coin a head, and one a tail (known as 'Odds'). It is traditionally played on ANZAC Day in pubs and clubs throughout Australia, in part to mark a shared experience with Diggers through the ages.   Pablo Uribe on Monday, April 27, 2009   "Let's assume the coin is fabricated perfectly, down to the last vigintillionth of a yoctometer."  Its not. The research is highly biased based on the perfect flip and the coin not being a perfect coin.  On top of this, the coin may be flipped 500 million times showing a 51-49, but you could flip it 1 trillion times resulting in 50-50.  If I gave Sally half my meal, am I left with 49% or 50%? Yeah...  If anything, its more likely the coin has a 49.99999999....-49.9999999 probability, giving room for the randomness of variables like the blatant bias in this research.   Anonymous Coward on Friday, July 31, 2009   Impresive reasearch man...   John on Monday, August 03, 2009   The aggregate time hypothesis doesn't work. If you just shift the frame to the, say, third flip in the air - since it's highly unlikely that the coin will land before it's third flip - you'll get the same argument reversed. I.e., if I start with heads, let it flip 3 times with tails up, and then start counting aggregate time, I'll get a THTHTHTHT... pattern and tails will now win 51% of the time.   Nyet on Monday, August 24, 2009   I used to work with a guy who was sure that coins had memory.  To him if you had a fair coin and you flipped it 100 times and got heads the odds would be better that you would get a tail on the next flip.  No matter how I explained it to him he would not believe that it was still 50/50.  I asked him how the coin "remembered what it's last 100 flips were?"

"A weaker man might be moved to re-examine his faith, if in nothing else at least in the law of probability."  Fascinating piece, by the way.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, August 24, 2009   I'm afraid that the HTHTH... argument appears to me to be completely bogus.  The only reason that there might be one more heads is that you decided to start counting on heads. Why did you start counting on heads? Because that was what was showing in the beginning, when it was resting on the thumb.  But you could equally argue that that is the very worst place to start counting. A coin flip isn't a coin flip if it doesn't leave the thumb. Indeed, it has to have at least one flip. Therefore, it is completely impossible that the first H would ever be counted.  So you could make an equally good argument saying  [quote]Similarly, consider a coin, launched in the "heads" position, flipping heads over tails through the ether. After the first flip, naturally, it will be on Tails:  T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T  At any given point in time, either the coin will have spent equal time in the Heads and Tails states, or it will have spent more time in the Tails state.[/quote]  This argument sounds just as reasonable as the first one, if not more so, which implies to me that the whole argument doesn't work.  Note that if this [b]did[/b] make sense, then the coin would show a bias of much, much more than 51%, because the coin would have to flip at least 100 times before the effect of that "first side" bias, were it true, was as low as 1%. Since most coin flips are under 100 flips, the "first side" bias by your argument would be much higher (in your example, 52% of the options are Heads).   SamSam on Monday, August 24, 2009   [i]>Not a single Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead reference? For shame![/i]  I thought long and hard about it. Seriously. Great movie.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjOqaD5tWB0#t=0m50  [i]>Since most coin flips are under 100 flips, the "first side" bias by your argument would be much higher (in your example, 52% of the options are Heads).
[/i]  Yes. Excellent points. The thing is, the "HTHTH" argument was a simplification (mentioned briefly in the post & comments above) ie a way of thinking about how the coin is spending its time in the aggregate, not necessarily meant to be an accurate portrayal of the physics. For example, if you flip the coin for say 1.5 revolutions it's obviously not approximating 51-49. This was a device, but an innocent one.   Coding the Wheel on Monday, August 24, 2009   [i]>The thing is, the "HTHTH" argument was a simplification (mentioned briefly in the post & comments above) ie a way of thinking about how the coin is spending its time in the aggregate[/i]  Yes, but you do specifically say that the reason (according to you) that the coin spends more of its time on "Heads" is that there are more H's then T's in your sequence, and that this is because you started with "H."  Simplification or not, this is fundamentally a wrong way to look at it, as several people have said. The problem with your approach is that it all depends on where you start counting, and you can pick wherever you want depending on what you want to prove, which is not good physics. The article doesn't suggest your explanation.  Although the article doesn't appear to suggest any explanation, a better explanation of the idea that the coin spends more time on one face than the other "in aggregate" would be one where this really is displayed where ever you start counting from. For example, the following argument, though not necessarily true, displays this property:  [quote]"Due to the asymmetry of flipping, the coin spends more time in the 360 degree flipped position than the 180 degree flipped position. If we write out the sequence showing what face is showing at time T, with the dT between values being 0.01 s, it would look like  ....2211111122211111222111111222...  as you can see, it spends more time on the first face ("1") than the second, so is more likely to be caught when displaying the first face."[/quote]  This argument, while probably incorrect and not supported by the article, at least is an explanation that doesn't depend on whether you start counting when the coin being on your thumb or after the first flip.   SamSam on Monday, August 24, 2009   I'm surprised no one mentioned (or at least I didn't notice) the fair coin flip where it doesn't matter whether the coin is biased or not. It can be done in the following way:  Flip coin two times. If it ends up HT or TH, the result is the first one of the sequence. If it ends up HH or TT, continue flipping it again two times until you get HT or TH.  p(1-p) = (1-p)p   Stephen on Tuesday, August 25, 2009   Agree with Stephen. Good idea!  Disagree with SamSam: the research clearly states the coin is biased based on where it starts.  Disagree with the author: it has nothing to do with aggregate time. The precession/wobbling of the coin around it's horizontal center of gravity is what creates the bias. At least that's my reading of the research.  You're all wrong.   Anonymous Coward on Tuesday, August 25, 2009   Very nice written, very clear and contains useful link to original research...only one problem with the above that seemed to me immediately clear:  there's no  empirical data supporting it's main conclusion of a 1% bias. Not even "my friend Jim and other graduate  students tossed a coin drawn from circulation ..." With a Ph.D in probability theory from Oxford I persisted and skimmed the origianl research (I have been developing my skimming skills by working on the redacted parts of the CIA's Inspector General's report - I have become most adept at getting through the large black blanks.) Low and behold I find in the original article on page 10 the staement that no empirical data has been found to support the hypothesis.  The coins studied have been gussied up like kids  going to a party... faces painted, ribbons attached etc. Without real experiments on mature coins (those drawn from circulation), the conclusions here seems highly questionable.

Starting on H and assuming a constant spin rate & time on one side = t, the ratio of time on each side would be H t, H t:T t, H 2t:T t, H 2t:T 2t, H 3t:T*2t,...  (that's 1:0, 1:1, 2:1, 1:1, 3:2, 1:1, 4:3, 1:1, 5:4, 1:1, 6:5, 1:1, 7:6,...)  (H yoctoflips t):(T yoctoflips t) = 1:1 (50/50),  ((H yoctoflips+1) t:(T yoctoflips t) = (pretty-darned-close-to-1):1 (~50/50)  So the fewer flips, the greater the likelyhood of the coin landing with its initial face in the same state. Greater only means greater = not less than or equal to.  While I think it was fair to say the odds increased. Quantifying the increase involved voodoo & was clearly used for illustrative purposes only.  Great article! A+  and Bruce sent me, too :-)   DoNoEvil on Thursday, October 15, 2009   Great article. Although I have to say that almost every person I have ever known to do a coin-toss uses the palm invert trick to add that element of "manual randomness"  . Which ...even if every coin in a coin toss IS geared slightly biased and lands on heads more of the time, by flipping it you're now making it biased for the other side of the coin.   TribalSeth on Sunday, October 25, 2009   A trick I always use is to vigorously rub on one side for 30 seconds before using it.

But - have you done any similar analysis on dice - eg is there any bias on the die, assuming it is not intentionally biased?  As a first step, try throwing it a few tens of thousands of times (get a few friends to assist to save some time) and see if the frequency of each number (1 to 6) is the same (within the expected limits forecast from statistical theory).

G   George on Tuesday, April 20, 2010   Coin tossing is very familiar among people of commonwealth countries, especially India, Pakistan and Australia. In these cricket crazy nations (especially India where “cricket is our religion and Sachin is our god”) cricket is very popular and coin tossing is a very decisive factor in winning. I still remember waiting anxiously for Ravi Shastri to say “Saurav Ganguly has won the toss and India will bat first”. Anyways, a very interesting article.  It is one of those articles that give us information, which produces an Aha!   Rapid Prototyping on Sunday, April 25, 2010   I'm not sure if I understand this correctly, but you say that the reason (or at least the main one) for the 1% offset in percentages when a coin is flipped and caught is because of the whole HTHTHTHTH... sequence thing? Well, in that case the probability of it ending up in a the state it started in would be  51% only if there were about 100 flips in the air. However, I'm sure the actual number of flips when you flip a coin is more than that? Has anyone measured this? In that case, the offset is probably a lot less than 1%.

You need to get a "feel" for them to be a smart and successful person.  The toss of a coin, throwing  dice and  lottery draws are all examples of  random events.  Sometimes an event can affect the next event.   Example: taking colored marbles from a bag: as you take each marble there are less marbles left in the bag, so the probabilities change.   We call those Dependent Events , because what happens depends on what happened before (learn more about this at Conditional probability ).  But otherwise they are Independent Events ...  Independent Events   Independent Events are not affected by previous events.  This is an important idea!  A coin does not "know"  it came up heads before.  And each toss of a coin is a perfect isolated thing.   Example: You toss a coin and it comes up "Heads" three times ... what is the chance that the next toss will also be a "Head"?  The chance is simply ½ (or 0.5) just like ANY toss of the coin.  What it did in the past will not affect the current toss!   Some people think "it is overdue for a Tail", but really truly the next toss of the coin is totally independent of any previous tosses.  Saying "a Tail is due", or "just one more go, my luck is due"			is called The Gambler's Fallacy   Of course your luck may change, because each toss of the coin has an equal chance.  Probability of Independent Events  "Probability" (or  "Chance") is how likely something is to happen.  So how do we calculate probability?   Probability of an event happening =  Number of ways it can happen  Total number of outcomes         Example: what is the probability of getting a "Head" when tossing a coin?  Number of ways it can happen: 1 (Head)  Total number of outcomes: 2 (Head and Tail)  So the probability =  1  2  = 0.5     Example: what is the probability of getting a "4" or "6" when rolling a die?  Number of ways it can happen: 2 ("4" and  "6")  Total number of outcomes: 6 ("1",  "2", "3",  "4", "5" and  "6")  So the probability =  2  6  =  1  3  = 0.333...   Ways of Showing Probability  Probability goes from 0 (imposssible) to 1 (certain):   It is often shown as a decimal or fraction .   Example: the probability of getting a "Head" when tossing a coin:   As a decimal: 0.5  As a fraction: 1/2  As a percentage: 50%  Or sometimes like this: 1-in-2    Two or More Events  We can calculate the chances of two or more independent events by multiplying the chances.   Example: Probability of 3 Heads in a Row  For each toss of a coin a "Head" has a probability of 0.5:   And so the chance of getting 3 Heads in a row is 0.125   So each toss of a coin  has a ½ chance of being Heads, but lots of Heads in a row is unlikely.   Example: Why is it  unlikely to get, say, 7 heads in a row, when each toss of a coin  has a ½ chance of being Heads?  Because we are asking two different questions:  Question 1:  What is the probability of 7 heads in a row?  Answer: ½×½×½×½×½×½×½ = 0.0078125 (less than 1%).  Question 2:  Given that we have just got 6 heads in a row, what is the probability   that the next toss is also a head?  Answer: ½ , as the previous tosses don't affect the next toss.   You can have a play with the Quincunx to see how lots of independent effects can still have a pattern.  Notation  We use "P" to mean "Probability Of",  So, for Independent Events:  P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)  Probability of A and B equals the probability of A times the probability of B   Example: your boss (to be fair) randomly assigns everyone an extra 2 hours work on  weekend evenings between 4 and midnight.  What are the chances you get  Saturday between 6 and 8?   Day: there are two days on the weekend, so P(Saturday) = 0.5  Time: you want the 2 hours of 6-to-8, out of the 8 hours of 4-to-midnight):  P(Your Time) = 2/8 = 0.25  And:    P(Saturday and Your Time)  = P(Saturday) × P(Your Time)      = 0.5 × 0.25      = 0.125    Or a 12.5% Chance  (Note: we could ALSO have worked out that you wanted 2 hours out of a total possible  16 hours, which is 2/16 = 0.125. Both methods work here.)   Another Example  Imagine there are two groups:   A member of each group gets randomly chosen for the winners circle,  then one of those gets randomly chosen to get the big money prize:    What is your chance of winnning the big prize?   there is a 1/5 chance of going to the winners circle  and a 1/2 chance of winning the big prize   So you have a 1/5 chance followed by a 1/2 chance ... which makes a 1/10 chance overall:  1 5 × 1 2 = 1 5 × 2 = 1 10  Or we can  calculate using decimals (1/5 is 0.2, and 1/2 is 0.5):  0.2 x 0.5 = 0.1  So your chance of winning the big money is 0.1 (which is the same as 1/10).  Coincidence!  Many "Coincidences" are, in fact,  likely.   Example:  you are in a room with 30 people, and find that Zach and Anna  celebrate their birthday on the same day.  Do you say:   "Wow, how strange !", or  "That seems reasonable, with so many people here"   In fact there is a 70% chance that would happen ... so it is likely .   Why is the chance so high?  Because you are comparing everyone to everyone else (not just one to many).  And with 30 people that is 435 comparisons    (Read Shared Birthdays to find out more.)     Example:  Snap!  Did you ever say something at exactly the same time as someone else ?  Wow, how amazing!  But you were probably sharing an experience (movie, journey, whatever) and so your thoughts were similar.  And there are only so many ways of saying something ...  ... so it is like the card game "Snap!" (also called Slaps or Slapjack) ...  ... if you speak enough words together, they will eventually match up.  So, maybe not so amazing, just simple chance at work.   Can you think of other cases where a "coincidence" was simply a likely thing?  Conclusion    Probability is: (Number of ways it can happen) / (Total number of outcomes)  Dependent Events (such as removing marbles from a bag) are affected by previous events  Independent events (such as a coin toss) are not affected by previous events  We can calculate the probability of 2 or more Independent events by multiplying  Not all coincidences are really unlikely (when you think about them).

Tossed coin    Coin flipping , coin tossing , or heads or tails is the practice of throwing a coin in the air and checking which side is showing when it lands to choose between two alternatives, sometimes to resolve a dispute between two parties. It is a form of sortition which inherently has only two possible and equally likely outcomes .

Coin flipping was known to the Romans as navia aut caput ("ship or head"), as some coins had a ship on one side and the head of the emperor on the other. [1] In England, this was referred to as cross and pile . [1] [2] The expression Heads or Tails results from heads and tails being considered complementary body parts.  Process [ edit ]  During a coin toss, the coin is thrown into the air such that it rotates edge-over-edge several times. Either beforehand or when the coin is in the air, an interested party calls "heads" or "tails", indicating which side of the coin that party is choosing. The other party is assigned the opposite side. Depending on custom, the coin may be caught; caught and inverted; or allowed to land on the ground. When the coin comes to rest, the toss is complete and the party who called correctly or was assigned the upper side is declared the winner.  It is possible for a coin to land on its edge, usually by landing up against an object (such as a shoe) or by getting stuck in the ground. However, even on a flat surface it is possible for a coin to land on its edge, with a chance of about 1 in 6000 for an American nickel. [3]  Angular momentum typically prevents most coins from landing on their edges unsupported if flipped. Such cases in which a coin does land on its edge are exceptionally rare and in most cases the coin is simply re-flipped. [4]  The coin may be any type as long as it has two distinct sides; it need not be a circulating coin as such. Larger coins tend to be more popular than smaller ones. Some high-profile coin tosses, such as the Cricket World Cup and the Super Bowl, use custom-made ceremonial medallions. [5] [6]  Three-way [ edit ]  Three-way coin flips are also possible, by a different process – this can be done either to choose two out of three, or to choose one out of three. To choose two out of three, three coins are flipped, and if two coins come up the same and one different, the different one loses (is out), leaving two players. To choose one out of three, either reverse this (the odd coin out is the winner ), or add a regular two-way coin flip between the remaining players as a second step. Note that the three-way flip is 87.5% likely to work each time it is tried (if all coins are heads or all are tails, which occurs 1/8 of the time due to the chances being 0.5 by 0.5 by 0.5, the flip is repeated until the results differ), and does not require that "heads" or "tails" be called. A famous example of such a three-way coin flip (choose two out of three) is dramatized in Friday Night Lights (originally a book , subsequently film and TV series ), where three high school football teams with identical records use a three-way coin flip – at a truck stop – to determine which two will advance to the playoffs. [7] [8] A legacy of this coin flip was to reduce the use of coin flips to break ties in Texas sports, instead using point-systems to reduce the frequency of ties.  Use in dispute resolution [ edit ]     The coin toss at the start of Super Bowl XLIII    Coin tossing is a simple and unbiased way of settling a dispute or deciding between two or more arbitrary options. In a game theoretic analysis it provides even odds to both sides involved, requiring little effort and preventing the dispute from escalating into a struggle. It is used widely in sports and other games to decide arbitrary factors such as which side of the field a team will play from, or which side will attack or defend initially; these decisions may tend to favor one side, or may be neutral. Factors such as wind direction, the position of the sun, and other conditions may affect the decision. In team sports it is often the captain who makes the call, while the umpire or referee usually oversees such proceedings. A competitive method may be used instead of a toss in some situations, for example in basketball the jump ball is employed, while the face-off plays a similar role in ice hockey.     Navy-Notre Dame coin toss    Coin flipping is used to decide which end of the field the teams will play to and/or which team gets first use of the ball, or similar questions in football matches, American football games, Australian rules football , volleyball , and other sports requiring such decisions. In the U.S. a specially minted coin is flipped in National Football League games; the coin is then sent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame , and other coins of the special series minted at the same time are sold to collectors. The XFL , a short-lived American football league, attempted to avoid coin tosses by implementing a face-off style "opening scramble," in which one player from each team tried to recover a loose football; the team whose player recovered the ball got first choice. Because of the high rate of injury in these events, it has not achieved mainstream popularity in any football league (a modified version was adopted by X-League Indoor Football , in which each player pursued his own ball), and coin tossing remains the method of choice in American football.  In an association football match, the team winning the coin toss chooses which goal to attack in the first half; the opposing team kicks off for the first half. For the second half, the teams switch ends, and the team that won the coin toss kicks off. Coin tosses are also used to decide which team has the pick of going first or second in a penalty shoot-out . Before the early-1970s introduction of the penalty shootout , coin tosses were occasionally needed to decide the outcome of tied matches. The most famous instance of this was the semifinal game of the 1968 European Championship in Italy between Italy and the Soviet Union , which finished 0-0 after extra time. Italy won, and went on to become European champions. [9]     Tossing a coin is common in many sports, such as cricket , where it is used to decide which team gets the choice of bowling or batting first. Shown are Don Bradman and Gubby Allen  tossing for innings .    In cricket the toss is often significant, as the decision whether to bat or bowl first can influence the outcome of the game. Similarly, in tennis a coin toss is used in professional matches to determine which player serves first. The player who wins the toss decides whether to serve first or return, while the loser of the toss decides which end of the court each player plays on first.  In duels a coin toss was sometimes used to determine which combatant had the sun at his back. [10] In some other sports, the result of the toss is less crucial and merely a way to fairly choose between two more or less equal options.  The National Football League also has a coin toss for tie-breaking among teams for playoff berths and seeding, but the rules make the need for coin toss, which is random rather than competitive, very unlikely. A similar procedure breaks ties for the purposes of seeding in the NFL Draft ; these coin tosses are more common, since the tie-breaking procedure for the draft is much less elaborate than the one used for playoff seeding.  Major League Baseball once conducted a series of coin flips as a contingency on the last month of its regular season to determine home teams for any potential one-game playoff games that might need to be added to the regular season. Most of these cases did not occur. From the 2009 season , the method to determine home-field advantage was changed. [11]  Fédération Internationale d'Escrime rules use a coin toss to determine the winner of a fencing match that remains tied at the end of a " sudden death " extra minute of competition. Although in most international matches this is now done electronically by the scoring apparatus. [ citation needed ]  In the United States  Asa Lovejoy and Francis W. Pettygrove , who each owned the claim to the land that would later become Portland, Oregon , wanted to name the new town after their respective hometowns of Boston, Massachusetts and Portland, Maine ; Pettygrove won the coin flip . [12]  Scientists sometimes use coin flipping to determine the order in which they appear on the list of authors of scholarly papers . [13]  Politics [ edit ]  Australia [ edit ]  In December 2006, Australian television networks Seven and Ten , which shared the broadcasting of the 2007 AFL Season , decided who would broadcast the Grand Final with the toss of a coin. Network Ten won. [ citation needed ]  Canada [ edit ]  In some jurisdictions, a coin is flipped to decide between two candidates who poll equal number of votes in an election , or two companies tendering equal prices for a project. For example, a coin toss decided a City of Toronto tender in 2003 for painting lines on 1,605 km of city streets: the bids were $161,110.00 ($100.3800623 per km), $146,584.65 ($91.33 per km, exactly), and two equal bids of $111,242.55 ($69.31 per km, exactly).  Philippines [ edit ]  " Drawing of lots " is one of the methods to break ties to determine a winner in an election; the coin flip is considered an acceptable variant. Each candidate will be given five chances to flip a coin; the candidate with the most number of "heads" wins. The 2013 mayoral election in San Teodoro, Oriental Mindoro was decided on a coin flip, with a winner being proclaimed after the second round when both candidates remained tied in the first round. [14]  United Kingdom [ edit ]  In the United Kingdom, if a local or national election has resulted in a tie where candidates receive exactly the same number of votes, then the winner can be decided either by drawing straws/lots, coin flip, or drawing a high card in pack of cards. [15] [16]  United States [ edit ]  In the United States , a coin toss determines the class of the senators of a state being added to the Union, with the new state's senators due to be entering the US Senate . [17] A number of states provide for "drawing lots" in the event an election ends in a tie - this is usually resolved by a coin toss or picking names from a hat. [18] A 2017 election to the 94th District of the Virginia House of Delegates resulted in both Republican incumbent David Yancey and Democratic challenger Shelly Simmonds tied with exactly 11,608 votes. Under state law, the election was to be decided by drawing a name from a bowl, although a coin toss would also have been an acceptable option. The chair of the Board of Elections drew the film canister with Yancey's name, and he was declared the winner. [19] Additionally, the outcome of the draw determined control of the entire House, as Republicans won 50 of the other 99 seats and Democrats 49. A Yancey win extended the Republican advantage to 51-49, whereas a Simmonds win would have resulted in a 50-50 tie. As there is no provision for breaking ties in the House as a whole, this would have forced a power sharing agreement between the two parties. [20]  Physics [ edit ]  The outcome of coin flipping has been studied by Persi Diaconis and his collaborators. They have demonstrated that a mechanical coin flipper which imparts the same initial conditions for every toss has a highly predictable outcome – the phase space is fairly regular. Further, in actual flipping, people exhibit slight bias – "coin tossing is fair to two decimals but not to three. That is, typical flips show biases such as .495 or .503." [21]  In studying coin flipping, to observe the rotation speed of coin flips, Diaconis first used a strobe light and a coin with one side painted black, the other white, so that when the speed of the strobe flash equaled the rotation rate of the coin, it would appear to always show the same side. This proved difficult to use, and rotation rate was more accurately computed by attaching floss to a coin, such that it would wind around the coin – after a flip, one could count rotations by unwinding the floss, and then compute rotation rate as flips over air time. [21]  Moreover, their theoretical analysis of the physics of coin tosses predicts a slight bias for a caught coin to be caught the same way up as it was thrown, with a probability of around 0.51, [22] though a subsequent attempt to verify this experimentally gave ambiguous results. [23] Stage magicians and gamblers, with practice, are able to greatly increase this bias, whilst still making throws which are visually indistinguishable from normal throws. [21]  Since the images on the two sides of actual coins are made of raised metal, the toss is likely to slightly favor one face or the other if the coin is allowed to roll on one edge upon landing. Coin spinning is much more likely to be biased than flipping, and conjurers trim the edges of coins so that when spun they usually land on a particular face.  Counterintuitive properties [ edit ]  Human intuition about conditional probability is often very poor and can give rise to some seemingly surprising observations. For example, if the successive tosses of a coin are recorded as a string of "H" and "T", then for any trial of tosses, it is twice as likely that the triplet TTH will occur before THT than after it. It is three times as likely that THH will precede HHT, than that THH will follow HHT. [24] (See Penney's game )  Mathematics [ edit ]  The mathematical abstraction of the statistics of coin flipping is described by means of the Bernoulli process ; a single flip of a coin is a Bernoulli trial . In the study of statistics, coin-flipping plays the role of being an introductory example of the complexities of statistics. A commonly treated textbook topic is that of checking if a coin is fair .  Telecommunications [ edit ]  Further information: Commitment scheme  There is no reliable way to use a true coin flip to settle a dispute between two parties if they cannot both see the coin—for example, over the phone. The flipping party could easily lie about the outcome of the toss. In telecommunications and cryptography , the following algorithm can be used:   Alice and Bob each choose a random string, "ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd" and "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd" respectively.  Alice chooses an outcome for an imaginary coin flip, such as "tail"  Bob sends Alice his random string "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd"  Alice immediately computes a cryptographic hash of the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd gfdgdfjkherfsfsd", which is 59dea408d43183a3937957e71a4bcacc616d9cbc and sends it to Bob  Alice asks Bob: "heads or tails"?  Bob says, for instance, "heads".  Alice tells him she's just won, and proves it by showing the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd gfdgdfjkherfsfsd".  Bob can check that Alice didn't lie by computing the SHA-1 of the string himself  Furthermore, Bob by providing his own randomly generated string guarantees that Alice wasn't able to precompute an image pair of "tail/random string" or "head/random string".   Lotteries [ edit ]  The New Zealand  lottery game Big Wednesday uses a coin toss. If a player matches all 6 of their numbers, the coin toss will decide whether they win a cash jackpot (minimum of NZ$25,000) or a bigger jackpot with luxury prizes (minimum of NZ$2 million cash, plus value of luxury prizes.) The coin toss is also used in determining the Second Chance winner's prize.  Clarifying feelings [ edit ]  A technique attributed to Sigmund Freud to help in making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I want you to do is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to make up your mind and come to the right decision." [25]  Danish poet Piet Hein 's book Grooks includes a poem on a similar theme:   A Psychological Tip  Whenever you're called on to make up your mind, And you're hampered by not having any, The best way to solve the dilemma, you'll find, Is simply by spinning a penny. No—not so that chance shall decide the affair While you're passively standing there moping; But the moment the penny is up in the air, You suddenly know what you're hoping.

Prerequisites  Distributions , Basic Probability , Variability  Learning Objectives  Define binomial outcomes  Compute the probability of getting X successes in N trials  Compute cumulative binomial probabilities  Find the mean and standard deviation of a binomial distribution    When you flip a coin, there are two possible outcomes: 
                heads and tails. Each outcome has a fixed probability, the same 
                from trial to trial. In the case of coins, heads and tails each 
                have the same probability of 1/2. More generally, there are situations 
                in which the coin is biased, so that heads and tails have different 
                probabilities. In the present section, we consider probability 
                distributions for which there are just two possible outcomes with 
                fixed probabilities summing to one. These distributions are called binomial 
                distributions .  A Simple Example  The four possible outcomes that could occur if you 
                flipped a coin twice are listed below in Table 1. Note that the 
                four outcomes are equally likely: each has probability 1/4. To 
                see this, note that the tosses of the coin are independent (neither 
                affects the other). Hence, the probability of a head on Flip 1 
                and a head on Flip 2 is the product of P(H) and P(H), which is 
                1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4. The same calculation applies to the probability 
                of a head on Flip 1 and a tail on Flip 2. Each is 1/2 x 1/2 
                = 1/4.    Table 1. Four Possible Outcomes.    Outcome  First Flip  Second Flip    1  Heads  Heads    2  Heads  Tails    3  Tails  Heads    4  Tails  Tails     The four possible outcomes can be classified
                in  terms of the number of heads that come up. The number could
                be  two (Outcome 1), one (Outcomes 2 and 3) or 0 (Outcome 4).
                The  probabilities of these possibilities are shown in Table
                2 and  in Figure 1. Since two of the outcomes represent the case
                in which  just one head appears in the two tosses, the probability
                of this  event is equal to 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Table 2 summarizes
                the situation.     Table 2. Probabilities of Getting 0, 1, or 2 Heads.    Number of Heads  Probability    0  1/4    1  1/2    2  1/4        Figure 1. Probabilities of 0, 1, and 2 
                      heads.   Figure 1 is a discrete probability distribution: 
                It shows the probability for each of the values on the X-axis. 
                Defining a head as a "success," Figure 1 shows the probability 
                of 0, 1, and 2 successes for two trials (flips) for an event that 
                has a probability of 0.5 of being a success on each trial. This 
                makes Figure 1 an example of a binomial distribution .  The Formula for Binomial Probabilities  The binomial distribution consists of the probabilities
                 of each of the possible numbers of successes on N trials for
                independent  events that each have a probability of π 
                (the Greek letter pi) of occurring. For the coin flip example,
                 N = 2 and π = 0.5. The formula for 
                the binomial distribution is shown below:   where P(x) is the probability of x successes out 
                of N trials, N is the number of trials, and π 
                is the probability of success on a given trial. Applying this 
                to the coin flip example,    If you flip a coin twice, what is the probability 
                of getting one or more heads? Since the probability of getting 
                exactly one head is 0.50 and the probability of getting exactly 
                two heads is 0.25, the probability of getting one or more heads 
                is 0.50 + 0.25 = 0.75.  Now suppose that the coin is biased. The probability 
                of heads is only 0.4. What is the probability of getting heads 
                at least once in two tosses? Substituting into the general formula 
                above, you should obtain the answer .64.  Cumulative Probabilities  We toss a coin 12 times. What is the probability 
                that we get from 0 to 3 heads? The answer is found by computing 
                the probability of exactly 0 heads, exactly 1 head, exactly 2 
                heads, and exactly 3 heads. The probability of getting from 0 
                to 3 heads is then the sum of these probabilities. The probabilities 
                are: 0.0002, 0.0029, 0.0161, and 0.0537. The sum of the probabilities 
                is 0.073. The calculation of cumulative binomial probabilities 
                can be quite tedious. Therefore we have provided a binomial calculator 
                to make it easy to calculate these probabilities.  Binomial
              Calculator  Mean and Standard Deviation of Binomial Distributions  Consider a coin-tossing experiment in which you 
                tossed a coin 12 times and recorded the number of heads. If you 
                performed this experiment over and over again, what would the 
                mean number of heads be? On average, you would expect half the 
                coin tosses to come up heads. Therefore the mean number of heads 
                would be 6. In general, the mean of a binomial distribution with 
                parameters N (the number of trials) and π 
                (the probability of success on each trial) is:  μ = Nπ  where μ is the mean 
                of the binomial distribution. The variance of the binomial distribution 
                is:  σ 2 = Nπ(1-π)  where σ 2 is the variance of the binomial distribution.  Let's return to the coin-tossing experiment. The 
                coin was tossed 12 times, so N = 12. A coin has a probability of 
                0.5 of coming up heads. Therefore, π 
                = 0.5. The mean and variance can therefore be computed 
                as follows:  μ = Nπ = (12)(0.5) = 6 σ 2 = Nπ(1-π) = 
                (12)(0.5)(1.0 - 0.5) = 3.0.  Naturally, the standard deviation (σ) 
              is the square root of the variance (σ 2 ).

Game Theory (Part 9)  John Baez  Last time we talked about independence of a pair of outcomes, but we can easily go on and talk about independence of a longer sequence of outcomes.  For example, suppose we have three coins.   Suppose:   the 1st coin has probability \( p_H\) of landing heads up and \( p_T\) of landing tails up;  the 2nd coin has probability \( q_H\) of landing heads up and \( q_T\) of landing tails up;  the 3rd coin has probability \( r_H\) of landing heads up and \( r_T\) of landing tails up.   Suppose we flip all of these coins: the 1st, then the 2nd, then the 3rd.  What's the probability that we get this sequence of results: \( (H, T, T)\) If the coin flips are independent , the probability is just this product: \( p_H \, q_T \, r_T \) See the pattern?  We just multiply the probabilities.  And there's nothing special about coins here, or the number three . We could flip a coin, roll a die, pick a card, and see if it's raining outside. For example, what's the probability that we get heads with our coin, the number 6 on our die, an ace of spades with our cards, and it's raining? If these outcomes are independent , we just calculate: the probability that we get heads, times
the probability that we roll a 6, times
the probability that we get an ace of spades, times
the probability that it's raining outside. Let's solve some puzzles using this idea! Three flips of a fair coin Example 1. Suppose you have a fair coin: this means it has a 50% chance of landing heads up and a 50% chance of landing tails up.  Suppose you flip it three times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up, then tails up, then heads up? We're asking about the probability of this outcome: \( (H, T, H)\) Since the flips are independent this is \( p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H \, p_T \, p_H \) Since the coin is fair we have \( \displaystyle{ p_H = p_T = \frac{1}{2} } \) so \(  \displaystyle{ p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} } \) So the answer is 1/8, or 12.5%. Example 2. In the same situation, what's the probability that the coin lands heads up exactly twice? There are 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 outcomes that can happen: \( (H,H,H) \)
\( (H,H,T), \; (H,T,H), \; (T,H,H) \)
\( (H,T,T), \; (T,H,T), \; (T,T,H) \)
\( (T,T,T) \) We can work out the probability of each of these outcomes.  For example, we've already seen that \( (H,T,H)\) is \( \displaystyle{ p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{8} }\) since the coin is fair and the flips are independent.  In fact, all 8 probabilities work out the same way.  We always get 1/8.  In other words, each of the 8 outcomes is equally likely! But we're interested in the probability that we get exactly two heads.  That's the probability of this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) Using the rule we saw in Part 7 , this probability is \( \displaystyle{ p(S) = p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} = 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) So the answer is 3/8, or 37.5%. I could have done this a lot faster.  I could say "there are 8 outcomes that can happen, each equally likely, and three that give us two heads, so the probability is 3/8."   But I wanted to show you how we're just following rules we've already seen! Three flips of a very unfair coin Example 3. Now suppose we have an unfair coin with a 90% chance of landing heads up and 10% chance of landing tails up!  What's the probability that if we flip it three times, it lands heads up exactly twice?  Again let's assume the coin flips are independent. Most of the calculation works exactly the same way, but now our coin has \( \displaystyle{ p_H = 0.9, \quad p_T = 0.1 } \) We're interested in the outcomes where the coin comes up heads twice, so we look at this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) The probability of this subset is \( \begin{array}{ccl} p(S) &=& p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} \\  &=& p_T \, p_H  \, p_H + p_H \, p_T \, p_H + p_H \, p_H \, p_T \\ &=& 3 p_T p_H^2 \\ &=& 3 \times 0.1 \times 0.9^2 \\ &=& 0.3 \times 0.81 \\ &=& 0.243 \end{array}\) So now the probability is just 24.3%. Six flips of a fair coin Example 4. Suppose you have a fair coin.  Suppose you flip it six times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up exactly twice? We did a similar problem already, where we flipped the coin three times.  Go back and look at that if you forget!  The answer to that problem was \( \displaystyle{ 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) Why?  Here's why: there were 3 ways to get two heads when you flipped 3 coins, and each of these outcomes had probability \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} }\) We can do our new problem the same way.  Count the number of ways to get two heads when we flip six coins.  Then multiply this by \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} }\) The hard part is to count how many ways we can get two heads when we flip six coins.  To get good at probabilities, we have to get good at counting.  It's boring to list all the outcomes we're trying to count: (H,H,T,T,T,T), (H,T,H,T,T,T), (H,T,T,H,T,T), ... So let's try to come up with a better idea. We have to pick 2 out of our 6 flips to be H's.  How many ways are there to do this? There are 6 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, and then 5 ways left over to pick another and draw a blue H on it... letting the rest be T's.  For example: (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, we've got 6 × 5 = 30 choices.  But we don't really care which H is red and which H is blue—that's just a trick to help us solve the problem.  For example, we don't want to count (T, H , T, T, H , T) as different from (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, there aren't really 30 ways to get two heads.  There are only half as many!  There are 15 ways. So, the probability of getting two heads when we flip the coin six times is \( \displaystyle{ 15 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{15}{64} \approx .234 } \) where the squiggle means 'approximately'.  So: about 23.4%. Binomial coefficients Now for some jargon, which will help when we do harder problems like this.  We say there are 6 choose 2 ways to choose 2 out of 6 things, and we write this as \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2} } \) This sort of number is called a binomial coefficient . We've just shown that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2}  = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 }\) Why write it like this funky fraction: \( \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1}\)?  Because it'll help us see the pattern for doing harder problems like this! Nine flips of a fair coin If we flip a fair coin 9 times, and the flips are independent, what's the probability that we get heads exactly 6 times? This works just like the last problem, only the numbers are bigger.  So, I'll do it faster! When we flip the coin 9 times there are \( 2^9\) possible outcomes that can happen.   Each of these is equally likely if it's a fair coin and the flips are independent.  So each has probability \( \displaystyle{  \frac{1}{2^9} } \) To get the answer, we need to multiply this by the number of ways we can get heads exactly 6 times.  This number is called '9 choose 6' or \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6}  }\) for short.  It's the number of ways we can choose 6 things out of a collection of 9. So we just need to know: what's 9 choose 6?  We can work this out as before.  There are 9 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, then 8 ways left to pick another and draw a blue H on it, and 7 ways left to pick a third and draw a orange H on it.  That sounds like 9 × 8 × 7. But we've overcounted!   After all, we don't care about the colors.  We don't care about the difference between this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) and this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) In fact we've counted each possibility 6 times!  Why six?   The first H could be red, green or blue — that's 3 choices.  But then the second H could be either of the two remaining 2 colors... and for the third, we just have 1 choice.  So there are 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways to permute the colors. So, the actual number of ways to get 6 heads out of 9 coin flips is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) In other words: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) To get the answer to our actual problem, remember we need to multiply \( 1/2^9\) by this.  So the answer is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6} }\) If you're a pure mathematician, you can say you're done now.  But normal people won't understand this answer, so let's calculate it out.  I hope you know the first ten powers of two: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.  So: \( \displaystyle{ 2^9 = 512 }\) I hope you can also do basic arithmetic like this: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84} \) So, the probability of getting 6 heads when you do 9 independent flips of a fair coin is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6}  = \frac{84}{512} = 0.164025 } \) or 16.4025%. I broke down and used a calculator at the last step.   We're becoming serious nerds here. Okay, that's enough for now.  We've been counting how many ways we can get a certain number of heads from a certain number of coin flips.  What we're realy doing is taking a set of coin flips, say \( n\) of them, and choosing a subset of \( k\) of them to be heads.  So, we say Definition. The binomial coefficient  \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} } \) called \( n\) choose \( k,\) is the number of ways of choosing a subset of \( k\) things from a set of \( n\) things. We have seen in some examples that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots 1} } \) Here there's a product of \( k\) consecutive numbers on top, and \( k\) on bottom too.  We didn't prove this is true in general, but it's not hard to see, using the tricks we've used already.

Sunday, March 29, 2009  Have you ever flipped a coin as a way of deciding something with another person? The answer is probably yes. And you probably did so assuming you were getting a fair deal, because, as everybody knows, a coin is equally likely to show heads or tails after a single flip—unless it's been shaved or weighted or has a week-old smear of coffee on its underbelly.   So when your friend places a coin on his thumb and says "call it in the air", you realize that it doesn't really matter whether you pick heads or tails. Every person has a preference, of course—heads or tails might feel "luckier" to you—but logically the chances are equal.  Or are they?   Granted, everybody knows that newly-minted coins are born with tiny imperfections, minute deviations introduced by the fabrication process. Everybody knows that, over time, a coin will wear and tear, picking up scratches, dings, dents, bacteria, and finger-grease. And everybody knows that these imperfections can affect the physics of the coin flip, biasing the results by some infinitesimal amount which in practice we ignore.  But let's assume that's not the case.  Let's assume the coin is fabricated perfectly, down to the last vigintillionth of a yoctometer . And, since it's possible to train one's thumb to flip a coin such that it comes up heads or tails a huge percentage of the time, let's assume the person flipping the coin isn't a magician or a prestidigitator. In other words, let's assume both a perfect coin and an honest toss, such as the kind you might make with a friend to decide who pays for lunch.  In that case there's an absolute right and wrong answer to the age-old question...  Heads or tails?  ...because the two outcomes of a typical coin flip are not equally likely.  The 50-50 proposition is actually more of a 51-49 proposition, if not worse. The sacred coin flip exhibits (at minimum) a whopping 1% bias , and possibly much more. 1% may not sound like a lot, but it's more than the typical casino edge in a game of blackjack or slots. What's more, you can take advantage of this little-known fact to give yourself an edge in all future coin-flip battles.  The Physics of Coin Flipping  In the 31-page Dynamical Bias in the Coin Toss , Persi Diaconis, Susan Holmes, and Richard Montgomery lay out the theory and practice of coin-flipping to a degree that's just, well, downright intimidating.   Suffice to say their approach involved a lot of physics, a lot of math, motion-capture cameras, random experimentation, and an automated "coin-flipper" device capable of flipping a coin and producing Heads 100% of the time.   Here are the broad strokes of their research:   If the coin is tossed and caught , it has about a 51% chance of landing on the same face it was launched. (If it starts out as heads, there's a 51% chance it will end as heads).  If the coin is spun, rather than tossed , it can have a much-larger-than-50% chance of ending with the heavier side down. Spun coins can exhibit "huge bias" (some spun coins will fall tails-up 80% of the time).  If the coin is tossed and allowed to clatter to the floor , this probably adds randomness.  If the coin is tossed and allowed to clatter to the floor where it spins , as will sometimes happen, the above spinning bias probably comes into play.  A coin will land on its edge around 1 in 6000 throws , creating a flipistic singularity .  The same initial coin-flipping conditions produce the same coin flip result . That is, there's a certain amount of determinism to the coin flip.  A more robust coin toss (more revolutions) decreases the bias .   The 51% figure in Premise 1 is a bit curious and, when I first saw it, I assumed it was a minor bias introduced by the fact that the "heads" side of the coin has more decoration than the "tails" side, making it heavier. But it turns out that this sort of imbalance has virtually no effect unless you spin the coin on its edge, in which case you'll see a huge bias. The reason a typical coin toss is 51-49 and not 50-50 has nothing to do with the asymmetry of the coin and everything to do with the aggregate amount of time the coin spends in each state, as it flips through space.  A good way of thinking about this is by looking at the ratio of odd numbers to even numbers when you start counting from 1.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17  No matter how long you count, you'll find that at any given point, one of two things will be true:   You've touched more odd numbers than even numbers  You've touched an equal amount of odd numbers and even numbers   What will never happen, is this:   You've touched more even numbers than odd numbers.   Similarly, consider a coin, launched in the "heads" position, flipping heads over tails through the ether:  H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H  At any given point in time, either the coin will have spent equal time in the Heads and Tails states, or it will have spent more time in the Heads state. In the aggregate, it's slightly more likely that the coin shows Heads at a given point in time—including whatever time the coin is caught. And vice-versa if you start the coin-flip from the Tails position.  The Strategy of Coin Flipping  Unlike the article on the edge in a game of blackjack mentioned previously, I've never seen a description of "coin flipping strategy" which takes the above science into count. When it's a true 50-50 toss, there is no strategy. But if we take it as granted, or at least possible, that a coin flip does indeed exhibit a 1% or more bias, then the following rules of thumb might apply.   Always be the chooser, if possible . This allows you to leverage Premise 1 or Premise 2 for those extra percentage points.  Always be the tosser , if you can. This protects you from virtuoso coin-flippers who are able to leverage Premise 6 to produce a desired outcome. It also protects you against the added randomness (read: fairness) introduced by flippers who will occasionally, without rhyme or reason, invert the coin in their palm before revealing. Tricksy Hobbitses.  Don't allow the same person to both toss and choose . Unless, of course, that person is you.  If the coin is being tossed, and you're the chooser, always choose the side that's initially face down . According to Premise 1, you'd always choose the side that's initially face up, but most people, upon flipping a coin, will invert it into their other palm before revealing. Hence, you choose the opposite side, but you get the same 1% advantage. Of course, if you happen to know that a particular flipper doesn't do this, use your better judgment.  If you are the tosser but not the chooser, sometimes invert the coin into your other palm after catching, and sometimes don't . This protects you against people who follow Rule 4 blindly by assuming you'll either invert the coin or you won't.  If the coin is being spun rather than tossed , always choose whichever side is lightest . On a typical coin, the "Heads" side of the coin will have more "stuff" engraved on it, causing Tails to show up more frequently than it should. Choosing Tails in this situation is usually the power play.  Never under any circumstances agree to a coin spin if you're not the chooser . This opens you up to a devastating attack if your opponent is aware of Premise 2.   I hope I've made it clear that none of this is really to be taken seriously. The point is that adding even 1% of wobble to a situation of pure chance can create a lot of additional complexity, and that in turn, can create strategy where none existed before.  Tags: probability , coin flipping    54 comment(s)   Great little article. I very much enjoyed this.  I would add to your "coin flip strategy" that if you suspect you're facing a "virtuoso tosser" and he won't let you do the toss, make him toss it on the ground.  Cheers.   Heads I Win Tails You Lose on Sunday, March 29, 2009   Lol. Interesting.  I may be mistaken here, but I believe your term "one vigintillionth of a yoctometer" is below the Plank length, making it so small as to be meaningless. Been a while since I looked at this stuff (college in fact) but...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length   Anonymous Coward on Sunday, March 29, 2009   that's the point.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, October 17, 2011   Awesome article. Really enjoyed reading it and having a break from the indepth computer science. Thanks.   Poker Forums on Monday, March 30, 2009   One vigintillionth of a yoctometer? Major phail! If we're throwing away practical concerns, we should atleast adhere to realm of the theoretically possible.  Jokes aside, nice article. For a moment, I was thinking that, even given your explanation of the inherent bias, it doesn't make sense since the coin would never land in the position it started at without flipping, as that would really be an invalid flip. But then, I guess all you do is move the minimum number of flips ahead to 2 or 3, and the state of the coin there is your new "initial" state, and you can set up the same argument. Nice.  However, I wonder what the case would be if one started the coin at a half-flip, on its edge? You might say that the initial face would correspond to the next face to show up after it performs a half-flip. But instead of a half-flip, what if you had just behind a half-flip? What about a quarter flip? I don't know a good line of reasoning to take care of these cases, it almost seems arbitrary.  And of course, it's totally pointless too. But who cares, interesting nonetheless!   ehsanul on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   [i]>One vigintillionth of a yoctometer? Major phail! If we're throwing away practical concerns, we should at least adhere to realm of the theoretically possible.[/i]  Yes, major fail. Guilty! But more memorable than "down to the last molecule/nanometer/etc". I got the idea for the phrase from Neal Stephenson's book in which the villain has a knife with an edge "one molecule wide".  If you managed to flip the coin from the edge position (let E represent the edge state):  E H E T E H E T E H E T E H E T E H E T E H  I still think the sequence exhibits the clumping shown above, because the coin spends only a tiny fraction of its time in those E states (it's really only in E when it's perfectly vertical). Because the aggregate time in E is so small, the probabilities would still favor whatever state immediately followed the initial E state (in this case, heads). At least, it seems you could make the argument.   Coding the Wheel on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Another strategy. If not obvious:   If you are the tosser, and not the chooser, flip the coin into your palm after the toss only if they pick the face up side.    James R on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   You missed an important strategy.  I used to earn lunch money in high school thusly:
I could flip a coin to come out "heads" about 90% of the time (with practice, same as knife throwing, control # of flips through the air during a certain time between flip and catch).  Anyhow, I flip, you call while in the air.
I catch and you most always lose because after you call it in the air, I choose to catch, or catch and invert (your #5. above). You assume it was fair because you called it in the air. No one ever figured out what I was doing (or I would have been beaten up!).   Comfortable on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Persi Diaconis is also the guy who did the (often-misquoted) research into how many times you should shuffle a deck of cards.   bmm6o on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   So, to paraphrase Vizzini:  "But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you: are you the sort of man who would put the coin into his own hand or his enemy's? Now, a clever man would put the coin into his own hand, because he would know that only a great fool would request to make the call. I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the side facing up. But you must have known I was not a great fool, you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the side facing down."  But we all know how Vizzini ended up. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha...   Anonymous Coward on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Just found your blog and have read quite a few of your posts - excellent job.  I think you're explanation of why it's 51% is suspect however.  In fact the paper does show that a coin flipped without precession does have a 50/50 chance (even though your H T H T H T H argument would still apply).  But with precession the coin will spend a greater frequency of it's time in the starting position (in fact with enough precession it will appear to flip but be 100% in the up position - alas I can not seem to master that).  If you take a coin and manually flip it end over end while precessing it at the same time you can kind of visualize this.  In the case without precession it's irrelevant that it starts as heads or tails.  What's relevant is that after flipping the coin spends equal amounts of time in the air in both states.  Again with precession this is not true.  Apparently their experiments showed that a typical coin flip done by hand precesses enough to give the 1% bias.   Anonymous Coward on Saturday, April 04, 2009   How did you get the 1 in 6000 figure for ending up on it's edge?  Seems low to my thinking. BTW, happened to me, a long time ago over who buys the next pitcher of beer.  I never met anyone else who has seen a coin land on its edge.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, April 06, 2009   [i]>I think you're explanation of why it's 51% is suspect however. In fact the paper does show that[/i]  You're right. The entire argument is an oversimplification.  [i]>How did you get the 1 in 6000 figure for ending up on it's edge?[/i]  That figure was for a nickel and I think it would be less for other coins. It was buried on page 10 of [url=http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~susan/papers/headswithJ.pdf]Dynamical Bias in the Coin Toss[/url] which references [url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993PhRvE..48.2547M]the original research[/url]. There's also some other [url=http://www.google.com/search?q=coin+landing+on+edge]research[/url] on this.   Coding the Wheel on Monday, April 06, 2009   A couple days ago I flipped a coin (nickel) and it landed, rolled, and stayed on edge. It was a new nickel and a flat (glass) table but it happened.  One of the more interesting "light reading" posts I've come across in weeks.   jzx on Wednesday, April 08, 2009   I'm neither a mathematician nor a physicist, having found my way here via the link from Freakonomics (I suppose I should say I'm not an economist either), but I think the HTHT analysis would lead to a conclusion opposite to the one given here.  If we assume that the coin is in fact flipped, and not simply "moved from Point A to Point B by a process that may or may not involve flipping," then isn't it correct to deem the initial state of a flipped coin as being 180 degrees revolved from its state in the flipper's hand? If so (and that seems right to me), the HTHT analysis leads to the conclusion that the side of the coin more likely to be up at the end of the flip is the side that was down in the flipper's hands.   DBH on Thursday, April 16, 2009   I would appreciate a strategy for Two-up
Two-up is a traditional Australian gambling game, involving a designated 'Spinner' throwing two coins into the air. Traditionally, these coins are pennies. Incidentally, their weight size and surface design make them ideal for the game. Weight and size make them stable on the 'kip' and easy to spin in the air. Decimal coins are generally considered to be too small and light and they don't 'fly' so well. The design of pennies that date pre 1939 had the soveriegns head on the obverse(front) and the reverse was totally covered in writing making the result very easy and quick to see. Pennies can often be obseved being used at games on Anzac Day, they are and brought out specifically for the purpose each year.  Players gamble on whether the coins will fall with both (obverse) heads up, both (reverse) tails up, or with one coin a head, and one a tail (known as 'Odds'). It is traditionally played on ANZAC Day in pubs and clubs throughout Australia, in part to mark a shared experience with Diggers through the ages.   Pablo Uribe on Monday, April 27, 2009   "Let's assume the coin is fabricated perfectly, down to the last vigintillionth of a yoctometer."  Its not. The research is highly biased based on the perfect flip and the coin not being a perfect coin.  On top of this, the coin may be flipped 500 million times showing a 51-49, but you could flip it 1 trillion times resulting in 50-50.  If I gave Sally half my meal, am I left with 49% or 50%? Yeah...  If anything, its more likely the coin has a 49.99999999....-49.9999999 probability, giving room for the randomness of variables like the blatant bias in this research.   Anonymous Coward on Friday, July 31, 2009   Impresive reasearch man...   John on Monday, August 03, 2009   The aggregate time hypothesis doesn't work. If you just shift the frame to the, say, third flip in the air - since it's highly unlikely that the coin will land before it's third flip - you'll get the same argument reversed. I.e., if I start with heads, let it flip 3 times with tails up, and then start counting aggregate time, I'll get a THTHTHTHT... pattern and tails will now win 51% of the time.   Nyet on Monday, August 24, 2009   I used to work with a guy who was sure that coins had memory.  To him if you had a fair coin and you flipped it 100 times and got heads the odds would be better that you would get a tail on the next flip.  No matter how I explained it to him he would not believe that it was still 50/50.  I asked him how the coin "remembered what it's last 100 flips were?"

"A weaker man might be moved to re-examine his faith, if in nothing else at least in the law of probability."  Fascinating piece, by the way.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, August 24, 2009   I'm afraid that the HTHTH... argument appears to me to be completely bogus.  The only reason that there might be one more heads is that you decided to start counting on heads. Why did you start counting on heads? Because that was what was showing in the beginning, when it was resting on the thumb.  But you could equally argue that that is the very worst place to start counting. A coin flip isn't a coin flip if it doesn't leave the thumb. Indeed, it has to have at least one flip. Therefore, it is completely impossible that the first H would ever be counted.  So you could make an equally good argument saying  [quote]Similarly, consider a coin, launched in the "heads" position, flipping heads over tails through the ether. After the first flip, naturally, it will be on Tails:  T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T  At any given point in time, either the coin will have spent equal time in the Heads and Tails states, or it will have spent more time in the Tails state.[/quote]  This argument sounds just as reasonable as the first one, if not more so, which implies to me that the whole argument doesn't work.  Note that if this [b]did[/b] make sense, then the coin would show a bias of much, much more than 51%, because the coin would have to flip at least 100 times before the effect of that "first side" bias, were it true, was as low as 1%. Since most coin flips are under 100 flips, the "first side" bias by your argument would be much higher (in your example, 52% of the options are Heads).   SamSam on Monday, August 24, 2009   [i]>Not a single Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead reference? For shame![/i]  I thought long and hard about it. Seriously. Great movie.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjOqaD5tWB0#t=0m50  [i]>Since most coin flips are under 100 flips, the "first side" bias by your argument would be much higher (in your example, 52% of the options are Heads).
[/i]  Yes. Excellent points. The thing is, the "HTHTH" argument was a simplification (mentioned briefly in the post & comments above) ie a way of thinking about how the coin is spending its time in the aggregate, not necessarily meant to be an accurate portrayal of the physics. For example, if you flip the coin for say 1.5 revolutions it's obviously not approximating 51-49. This was a device, but an innocent one.   Coding the Wheel on Monday, August 24, 2009   [i]>The thing is, the "HTHTH" argument was a simplification (mentioned briefly in the post & comments above) ie a way of thinking about how the coin is spending its time in the aggregate[/i]  Yes, but you do specifically say that the reason (according to you) that the coin spends more of its time on "Heads" is that there are more H's then T's in your sequence, and that this is because you started with "H."  Simplification or not, this is fundamentally a wrong way to look at it, as several people have said. The problem with your approach is that it all depends on where you start counting, and you can pick wherever you want depending on what you want to prove, which is not good physics. The article doesn't suggest your explanation.  Although the article doesn't appear to suggest any explanation, a better explanation of the idea that the coin spends more time on one face than the other "in aggregate" would be one where this really is displayed where ever you start counting from. For example, the following argument, though not necessarily true, displays this property:  [quote]"Due to the asymmetry of flipping, the coin spends more time in the 360 degree flipped position than the 180 degree flipped position. If we write out the sequence showing what face is showing at time T, with the dT between values being 0.01 s, it would look like  ....2211111122211111222111111222...  as you can see, it spends more time on the first face ("1") than the second, so is more likely to be caught when displaying the first face."[/quote]  This argument, while probably incorrect and not supported by the article, at least is an explanation that doesn't depend on whether you start counting when the coin being on your thumb or after the first flip.   SamSam on Monday, August 24, 2009   I'm surprised no one mentioned (or at least I didn't notice) the fair coin flip where it doesn't matter whether the coin is biased or not. It can be done in the following way:  Flip coin two times. If it ends up HT or TH, the result is the first one of the sequence. If it ends up HH or TT, continue flipping it again two times until you get HT or TH.  p(1-p) = (1-p)p   Stephen on Tuesday, August 25, 2009   Agree with Stephen. Good idea!  Disagree with SamSam: the research clearly states the coin is biased based on where it starts.  Disagree with the author: it has nothing to do with aggregate time. The precession/wobbling of the coin around it's horizontal center of gravity is what creates the bias. At least that's my reading of the research.  You're all wrong.   Anonymous Coward on Tuesday, August 25, 2009   Very nice written, very clear and contains useful link to original research...only one problem with the above that seemed to me immediately clear:  there's no  empirical data supporting it's main conclusion of a 1% bias. Not even "my friend Jim and other graduate  students tossed a coin drawn from circulation ..." With a Ph.D in probability theory from Oxford I persisted and skimmed the origianl research (I have been developing my skimming skills by working on the redacted parts of the CIA's Inspector General's report - I have become most adept at getting through the large black blanks.) Low and behold I find in the original article on page 10 the staement that no empirical data has been found to support the hypothesis.  The coins studied have been gussied up like kids  going to a party... faces painted, ribbons attached etc. Without real experiments on mature coins (those drawn from circulation), the conclusions here seems highly questionable.

Starting on H and assuming a constant spin rate & time on one side = t, the ratio of time on each side would be H t, H t:T t, H 2t:T t, H 2t:T 2t, H 3t:T*2t,...  (that's 1:0, 1:1, 2:1, 1:1, 3:2, 1:1, 4:3, 1:1, 5:4, 1:1, 6:5, 1:1, 7:6,...)

Greater only means greater = not less than or equal to.  While I think it was fair to say the odds increased. Quantifying the increase involved voodoo & was clearly used for illustrative purposes only.  Great article! A+  and Bruce sent me, too :-)   DoNoEvil on Thursday, October 15, 2009   Great article.

Well, in that case the probability of it ending up in a the state it started in would be  51% only if there were about 100 flips in the air. However, I'm sure the actual number of flips when you flip a coin is more than that? Has anyone measured this? In that case, the offset is probably a lot less than 1%.

If the coin is flipped two times what is the probability of getting a head in either of those attempts?  I think both the coin flips are mutually exclusive events, so the probability would be getting head in attempt 1 or attempt 2 which is :  P(attempt1) + P(attempt2) =  1/2 + 1/2 = 1  100% probability sounds wrong? What am I doing wrong. If i apply the same logic then probability of getting at least 1 head in 3 attempt will be 1/2+1/2+1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5 which I know for sure is wrong.

"Mutually exclusive" simply means that the two events cannot happen together.  If A happens then B does not and if B happens A does not.  "Independent" simply means that the occurrence of one event is not conditional on the occurrence of the other.  The probability of A happening does not depend on whether B happens or not, and vice versa.   Let $H_n$ be the indexed event of getting a head on the $n^{th}$ flip.  Given an unbiased coin, $P(H_1)=P(H_2)=\frac 1 2$  These events are independent so $P(H_1 \cap H_2) = P(H_1)\times P(H_2)$.  The outcome of one coin toss does not influence the outcome of the other.  However they are not  mutually exclusive , so $P(H_1 \cup H_2) = P(H_1)+P(H_2) - P(H_1 \cap H_2)$.  Both coins can turn up heads.  Putting it together: $$\therefore P(H_1 \cup H_2) = \frac 12 + \frac 1 2 - \frac 12 \times \frac 12 = \frac 3 4$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jan 22 at 14:08       Alex Johnson   32 7        answered Mar 28 '14 at 9:56       Graham Kemp   73.6k 4 30 66              1      So if I flip a coin 2 times, there is a 75% chance that I will get heads on at least one of the 2 flips? – Juan Velez  Aug 25 '15 at 16:47        3      @JuanVelez Yes, if there is no bias (ie: fair coins). $\boxed{\begin{array}{c|cc} ~& H & T \\ \hline H & HH & HT \\ T & TH & TT\end{array}}$ Four equally probable results, three of which are the favoured outcome. – Graham Kemp  Aug 25 '15 at 22:52         1      Would it follow, that in 3 tries you'd have an 87.5% chance of success? – Lonnie Best  Dec 20 '15 at 23:15        2      @LonnieBest Yes, it does indeed follow that the change of at least one success in three flips is $1-0.5^3$. – Graham Kemp  Dec 21 '15 at 0:29        add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      Let $A$ be the event of getting a tail in both tosses, then $A'$ be the event of getting a head in either tosses.

If the coin is flipped $6$ times, what is the probability that there are exactly $3$ heads?   The answer is $\frac5{16}$. I wonder why it isn't $\frac12$. Since a fair coin flip results in equally likely outcomes, any sequence is equally likely…  I know why it is $\frac5{16}$. We divide the number of possible outcomes with exactly 3 heads by the total possible outcomes.  What bothers me is how I should think about it so I won't make a mistake anymore.

From here it's a matter of understanding how to calculate these two things.  The total number of outcomes is simply $2^6 = 64$ since we're tossing a coin 6 times and each toss has only two possible outcomes.  The number of outcomes with exactly 3 heads is given by ${6 \choose 3}$ because we essentially want to know how many different ways we can take exactly 3 things from a total of 6 things.  The value of this is 20.  So the answer is $20/64 = 5/16$.  The error you made is thinking that "number of outcomes with exactly 3 heads" is equal to "half of the total number of outcomes of 6 tosses."  If this were the case then logically, "exactly 3 tails" must also be exactly half of the total outcomes.  This means that "exactly 3 heads or exactly 3 tails" must describe all possible outcomes (because each scenario joined by the "or" would have probability $1/2$) but this is clearly not the case since we can have, e.g., 1 heads and 5 tails, etc.  To put it another way... You said any sequence is equally likely.  That is correct.  But sequences containing exactly 3 heads do not make up half of the total number of sequences.  Therefore it does not follow that the probability is $1/2$.  The easiest way to see this clearly is to list every possible outcome.  But for 64 outcomes it can be tedious, so let's do it with a simpler and similar problem.  Say we want to know the probability of getting exactly 2 heads if we flip a coin 4 times.  Unless I'm misunderstanding your misunderstanding, your earlier thinking would lead you to believe the answer is $1/2$.   But if we list all possible outcomes:  HHHH
HHHT
HHTH
HHTT
HTHH
HTHT
HTTH
HTTT
THHH
THHT
THTH
THTT
TTHH
TTHT
TTTH
TTTT  We see that only 6 of them have exactly 2 heads.  $6/16 = 3/8$.  And if we do this problem the way I answered the original one, then the total number of outcomes is $2^4 = 16$ and the total number of outcomes with exactly 2 heads is ${4 \choose 2} = 6$. So we again get $6/16 = 3/8$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 29 '16 at 4:53       tilper   12.7k 1 10 45              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      "exactly three heads" is not half of the outcomes.

It is true that each sequence of heads and tails is equally likely to occur – with probability $\frac1{64}$, in this case. However, the number of those sequences having exactly three heads is not 32, but $\binom63=20$, which leads to the correct answer of $\frac5{16}$. They are two completely different things.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 29 '16 at 4:47       Parcly Taxel   30.3k 11 62 82              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote       Since a fair coin flip results in equally likely outcomes, any sequence is equally likely…   ... then we need to know how many of these equally-probable outcomes are possible and how many of which have "exactly three heads".

You do $n = 10$ trials. The probability of one successful trial is $p = \frac{1}{2}$. You want $k = 3$ successes and $n - k = 7$ failures. The probability is:  $$
\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = \binom{10}{3} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{3} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{7} = \dfrac{15}{128}
$$  One way to understand this formula: You want $k$ successes (probability: $p^k$) and $n-k$ failures (probability: $(1-p)^{n-k}$). The successes can occur anywhere in the trials, and there are $\binom{n}{k}$ to arrange $k$ successes in $n$ trials.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 30 '12 at 22:51             answered May 30 '12 at 22:45       Ayman Hourieh   29.9k 4 58 107                  I am bit confused about this.

Since the positive outcomes are equally likely, it's simply adding them all up. – user190080  Nov 14 '17 at 15:02        add a comment |             up vote  22  down vote      We build a mathematical model of the experiment.  Write H for head and T for tail.  Record the results of the tosses as a string of length $10$, made up of the letters H and/or T.  So for example the string HHHTTHHTHT means that we got a head, then a head, then a head, then a tail, and so on.  There are $2^{10}$ such strings of length $10$.  This is because we have $2$ choices for the first letter, and for every such choice we have $2$ choices for the second letter, and for every choice of the first two letters, we have $2$ choices for the third letter, and so on.  Because we assume that the coin is fair, and that the result we get on say the first $6$ tosses does not affect the probability of getting a head on the $7$-th toss, each of these $2^{10}$ ($1024$) strings is equally likely . Since the probabilities must add up to $1$, each string has probability $\frac{1}{2^{10}}$.
So for example the outcome HHHHHHHHHH is just as likely as the outcome HTTHHTHTHT. This may have an intuitively implausible feel, but it fits in very well with experiments.  Now let us assume that we will be happy only if we get exactly $3$ heads.  To find the probability we will be happy, we count the number of strings that will make us happy. Suppose there are $k$ such strings. Then the probability we will be happy is $\frac{k}{2^{10}}$.  Now we need to find $k$. So we need to count the number of strings that have exactly $3$ H's.  To do this, we find the number of ways to choose  where the H's will occur. So we must choose $3$ places (from the $10$ available) for the H's to be.  We can choose $3$ objects from $10$ in $\binom{10}{3}$ ways. This number is called also by various other names, such as $C_3^{10}$, or ${}_{10}C_3$, or $C(10,3)$, and there are other names too. It is called a binomial coefficient , because it is the coefficient of $x^3$ when the expression $(1+x)^{10}$ is expanded.  There is a useful formula for the binomial coefficients. In general
$$\binom{n}{r}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}.$$  In particular, $\binom{10}{3}=\frac{10!}{3!7!}$. This turns out to be $120$. So the probability of exactly $3$ heads in $10$ tosses is
$\frac{120}{1024}$.  Remark: The idea can be substantially generalized. If we toss a coin $n$ times, and the probability of a head on any toss is $p$ (which need not be equal to $1/2$, the coin could be unfair), then the probability of exactly $k$ heads is
$$\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}.$$
This probability model is called the Binomial distribution . It is of great practical importance, since it underlies all simple yes/no polling.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 31 '12 at 0:18             answered May 30 '12 at 23:01       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779              add a comment |             up vote  16  down vote      You are looking for  $$\frac{\text{Number of Relevant Outcomes}}{\text{Number ofTotal Outcomes}}.$$  The number of total outcomes is $2^{10}$. The number of relevant outcomes is the number of ways you can get exactly three heads in a string of 10 coin flips, or ${10}\choose{3}$.

Then you have to arrange 3 heads and 7 tails within 10 open slots.
We can name our Heads: $H(A)$, $H(B)$, and $H(C)$. Now, you can arrange the heads in such ways that $H(A)$ will essentially have 10 open slots, $H(B)$ will have 9 open slots and $H(C)$ will have 8 open slots. In other words there are: $$10 \times 9 \times 8 = 720$$ ways to arrange these heads. However, this accounts for the fact that all heads are different. Therefore the number of positions in which $H(x)$ can be arranged in is $$3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6,$$ and so there are: $$\frac{720}{6} = 120 $$
scenarios of which 3 heads and 7 tails are given. Therefore
$$P(\text{getting 3 heads and 7 tails}) = \frac{120}{1024} = \frac{15}{128} \approx 11.7\%.$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 14 '17 at 14:51       Xander Henderson   10.9k 7 25 42        answered Nov 14 '17 at 14:23       Emil Eriksson   1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Put differently, note that the probability that no heads appears is 1 out of four or $\frac 14$. So the probability of at least one head is $1$ minus the probability of getting NO heads, which is $1$ minus the probability of getting all tails: is $1 - \frac 14 = 1 - \frac{1}{2^2} = 1 - \frac 12 \cdot \frac 12$  In the above demonstration, it is quite easy to list out the "probability space": which is essentially, all possible outcomes.  The " at least one head" qualifier is handy, because it allows you to simplify the determination of probability for any arbitrarily large numbers of flips.  If you flip a coin $n$ times, and want to know the probability of getting at least one head, note the outcome of getting all tails is the "complement" of the set of outcomes in which you get at least one head. The probability of getting all/only tails, when flipping a coin $n$ times is equal to $$\underbrace{\dfrac 12 \cdot \frac 12 \cdot \cdots \cdot \frac 12}_{\large n\; \text{times}} = \left(\frac 1{2}\right)^n$$  So...$$\begin{align} \text{probability of getting at least one head}\; & = 1 -\text{probability of not getting any heads}\; \\ \\ & =  1 - \;\text{probability of getting all tails}\;\\ \\& = 1 - \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^n\end{align}$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 24 '13 at 18:32             answered Jun 24 '13 at 18:19       amWhy   187k 25 215 427              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      in problems like this one it's usually much easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event, so in this case - what is the probability of flipping a coin $n$ times without any heads? answer - it's $2^{-n}$ because each time you flip you need to get tails therefore the probability you seek is $1 - 2^{-n}$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 24 '13 at 18:10       mm-aops   3,210 8 24              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      You probably know that if $p$ is the probability of an event (say, flipping heads at least once) happening, then $1-p$ is the probability of that event not happening. Now let's apply this to your problem.  If you do not flip heads at least once in $n$ trials, then all $n$ trials must be tails. The probability of getting tails in one trial is $\frac12$, and since the trials are independent (what you get on flip 1 does not affect what you get on flip 2 does not affect what you get on flip k, etc.) the probability of getting tails in $n$ trials is $(\frac12)^n$. This is your $1-p$, so your $p=1-(\frac12)^n$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 24 '13 at 18:12       Zen   919 6 10              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      I think it's helpful to generalize this question to a multi-sided coin (a coin with $m$ sides, which can be thought of as a die, if you will).

Probability of getting side A on the first toss:  $\frac 1m$  Probability of not getting "side A" on the first toss, but getting it on the second toss=  $ p(not side A) \cdot p(side A) = (1-\frac 1m) \cdot \frac 1m$  Total probability of getting side A in two tosses is the sum of the two events:  $\frac 1m + (1-\frac 1m) \cdot \frac 1m$  If we continue with more tosses ($n$ total), the probability grows.

Prerequisites  Distributions , Basic Probability , Variability  Learning Objectives  Define binomial outcomes  Compute the probability of getting X successes in N trials  Compute cumulative binomial probabilities  Find the mean and standard deviation of a binomial distribution    When you flip a coin, there are two possible outcomes: 
                heads and tails. Each outcome has a fixed probability, the same 
                from trial to trial. In the case of coins, heads and tails each 
                have the same probability of 1/2. More generally, there are situations 
                in which the coin is biased, so that heads and tails have different 
                probabilities. In the present section, we consider probability 
                distributions for which there are just two possible outcomes with 
                fixed probabilities summing to one. These distributions are called binomial 
                distributions .  A Simple Example  The four possible outcomes that could occur if you 
                flipped a coin twice are listed below in Table 1. Note that the 
                four outcomes are equally likely: each has probability 1/4. To 
                see this, note that the tosses of the coin are independent (neither 
                affects the other). Hence, the probability of a head on Flip 1 
                and a head on Flip 2 is the product of P(H) and P(H), which is 
                1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4. The same calculation applies to the probability 
                of a head on Flip 1 and a tail on Flip 2. Each is 1/2 x 1/2 
                = 1/4.    Table 1. Four Possible Outcomes.    Outcome  First Flip  Second Flip    1  Heads  Heads    2  Heads  Tails    3  Tails  Heads    4  Tails  Tails     The four possible outcomes can be classified
                in  terms of the number of heads that come up. The number could
                be  two (Outcome 1), one (Outcomes 2 and 3) or 0 (Outcome 4).
                The  probabilities of these possibilities are shown in Table
                2 and  in Figure 1. Since two of the outcomes represent the case
                in which  just one head appears in the two tosses, the probability
                of this  event is equal to 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Table 2 summarizes
                the situation.     Table 2. Probabilities of Getting 0, 1, or 2 Heads.    Number of Heads  Probability    0  1/4    1  1/2    2  1/4        Figure 1. Probabilities of 0, 1, and 2 
                      heads.   Figure 1 is a discrete probability distribution: 
                It shows the probability for each of the values on the X-axis. 
                Defining a head as a "success," Figure 1 shows the probability 
                of 0, 1, and 2 successes for two trials (flips) for an event that 
                has a probability of 0.5 of being a success on each trial. This 
                makes Figure 1 an example of a binomial distribution .  The Formula for Binomial Probabilities  The binomial distribution consists of the probabilities
                 of each of the possible numbers of successes on N trials for
                independent  events that each have a probability of π 
                (the Greek letter pi) of occurring. For the coin flip example,
                 N = 2 and π = 0.5. The formula for 
                the binomial distribution is shown below:   where P(x) is the probability of x successes out 
                of N trials, N is the number of trials, and π 
                is the probability of success on a given trial. Applying this 
                to the coin flip example,    If you flip a coin twice, what is the probability 
                of getting one or more heads? Since the probability of getting 
                exactly one head is 0.50 and the probability of getting exactly 
                two heads is 0.25, the probability of getting one or more heads 
                is 0.50 + 0.25 = 0.75.  Now suppose that the coin is biased. The probability 
                of heads is only 0.4. What is the probability of getting heads 
                at least once in two tosses? Substituting into the general formula 
                above, you should obtain the answer .64.  Cumulative Probabilities  We toss a coin 12 times. What is the probability 
                that we get from 0 to 3 heads? The answer is found by computing 
                the probability of exactly 0 heads, exactly 1 head, exactly 2 
                heads, and exactly 3 heads. The probability of getting from 0 
                to 3 heads is then the sum of these probabilities. The probabilities 
                are: 0.0002, 0.0029, 0.0161, and 0.0537. The sum of the probabilities 
                is 0.073. The calculation of cumulative binomial probabilities 
                can be quite tedious. Therefore we have provided a binomial calculator 
                to make it easy to calculate these probabilities.  Binomial
              Calculator  Mean and Standard Deviation of Binomial Distributions  Consider a coin-tossing experiment in which you 
                tossed a coin 12 times and recorded the number of heads. If you 
                performed this experiment over and over again, what would the 
                mean number of heads be? On average, you would expect half the 
                coin tosses to come up heads. Therefore the mean number of heads 
                would be 6. In general, the mean of a binomial distribution with 
                parameters N (the number of trials) and π 
                (the probability of success on each trial) is:  μ = Nπ  where μ is the mean 
                of the binomial distribution. The variance of the binomial distribution 
                is:  σ 2 = Nπ(1-π)  where σ 2 is the variance of the binomial distribution.  Let's return to the coin-tossing experiment. The 
                coin was tossed 12 times, so N = 12. A coin has a probability of 
                0.5 of coming up heads. Therefore, π 
                = 0.5. The mean and variance can therefore be computed 
                as follows:  μ = Nπ = (12)(0.5) = 6 σ 2 = Nπ(1-π) = 
                (12)(0.5)(1.0 - 0.5) = 3.0.  Naturally, the standard deviation (σ) 
              is the square root of the variance (σ 2 ).

The probability of getting a heads at least once = 1 - probability of getting tails all 4 times. Ans                = 1 - (1/2)(1/2)(1/2)(1/2) = 1 - (1/16) = 15/16                        mehtakaustubh      Manager        B     Joined: 11 Jul 2009   Posts: 142   WE: Design (Computer Software)                       Re: John flips a coin 4 times.

Aren't you glad we have the 1-x trick? Thank you all for the answer and explanation, but I'm a bit confused as I've looked up few sources on the Internet (not relating to GMAT), and they all indicated the chance of getting 1 head in 4 flips of a coin is 4/16 = 1/4  , I'm quoting here from a site linked to University page: Quote: If we assume that each individual coin is equally likely to come up heads or tails, then each of the above 16 outcomes to 4 flips is equally likely. Each occurs a fraction one out of 16 times, or each has a probability of 1/16. Alternatively, we could argue that the 1st coin has probability 1/2 to come up heads or tails, the 2nd coin has probability 1/2 to come up heads or tails, and so on for the 3rd and 4th coins, so that the probability for any one particular sequence of heads and tails is just (1/2)x(1/2)x(1/2)x(1/2)=(1/16). Now lets ask: what is the probability that in 4 flips, one gets N heads, where N=0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. We can get this just by counting the number of outcomes above which have the desired number of heads, and dividing by the total number of possible outcomes, 16.   N     # outcomes with N heads     probability to get N heads 0                1                                       1/16 = 0.0625 1                4                                       4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25 2                6                                      6/16 = 3/8 = 0.375 3                4                                      4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25 4                1                                      1/16 = 0.0625 What is the difference here? is it the "at least" phrase?

The probability of getting a heads at least once = 1 - probability of getting tails all 4 times. Ans                = 1 - (1/2)(1/2)(1/2)(1/2) = 1 - (1/16) = 15/16                        mehtakaustubh      Manager        B     Joined: 11 Jul 2009   Posts: 142   WE: Design (Computer Software)                       Re: John flips a coin 4 times.

Aren't you glad we have the 1-x trick? Thank you all for the answer and explanation, but I'm a bit confused as I've looked up few sources on the Internet (not relating to GMAT), and they all indicated the chance of getting 1 head in 4 flips of a coin is 4/16 = 1/4  , I'm quoting here from a site linked to University page: Quote: If we assume that each individual coin is equally likely to come up heads or tails, then each of the above 16 outcomes to 4 flips is equally likely. Each occurs a fraction one out of 16 times, or each has a probability of 1/16. Alternatively, we could argue that the 1st coin has probability 1/2 to come up heads or tails, the 2nd coin has probability 1/2 to come up heads or tails, and so on for the 3rd and 4th coins, so that the probability for any one particular sequence of heads and tails is just (1/2)x(1/2)x(1/2)x(1/2)=(1/16). Now lets ask: what is the probability that in 4 flips, one gets N heads, where N=0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. We can get this just by counting the number of outcomes above which have the desired number of heads, and dividing by the total number of possible outcomes, 16.   N     # outcomes with N heads     probability to get N heads 0                1                                       1/16 = 0.0625 1                4                                       4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25 2                6                                      6/16 = 3/8 = 0.375 3                4                                      4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25 4                1                                      1/16 = 0.0625 What is the difference here? is it the "at least" phrase?

nature.  A subject repeatedly attempts a task with a known probability
of success due to chance, then the number of actual successes is compared
to the chance expectation.  If a subject scores consistently higher or
lower than the chance expectation after a large number of attempts,
one can calculate the probability of such a score due purely to
chance, and then argue, if the chance probability is sufficiently
small, that the results are evidence for the existence of some
mechanism (precognition, telepathy, psychokinesis, cheating, etc.)
which allowed the subject to perform better than chance would seem to
permit.  Suppose you ask a subject to guess, before it is flipped, whether a
coin will land with heads or tails up.  Assuming the coin is fair (has
the same probability of heads and tails), the chance of guessing
correctly is 50%, so you'd expect half the guesses to be correct and
half to be wrong.  So, if we ask the subject to guess heads or tails
for each of 100 coin flips, we'd expect about 50 of the guesses to be
correct.  Suppose a new subject walks into the lab and manages to
guess heads or tails correctly for 60 out of 100 tosses.  Evidence of
precognition, or perhaps the subject's possessing a telekinetic power
which causes the coin to land with the guessed face up?  Well,…no.
In all likelihood, we've observed nothing more than good luck.  The
probability of 60 correct guesses out of 100 is about 2.8%, which
means that if we do a large number of experiments flipping 100 coins,
about every 35 experiments we can expect a score of 60 or better,
purely due to chance.  But suppose this subject continues to guess about 60 right
out of a hundred, so that after ten runs of 100 tosses—1000
tosses in all, the subject has made 600 correct guesses.
The probability of that happening purely by chance is less
than one in seven billion, so it's time to start thinking
about explanations other than luck.  Still, improbable things
happen all the time: if you hit a golf ball, the odds it
will land on a given blade of grass are millions to one, yet
(unless it ends up in the lake or a sand trap) it is
certain to land on some blades of grass.  Finally, suppose this “dream subject” continues to guess 60%
of the flips correctly, observed by multiple video cameras,
under conditions prescribed by skeptics and debunkers, using
a coin provided and flipped by The Amazing Randi himself, with
a final tally of 1200 correct guesses in 2000 flips.  You'd
have to try the 2000 flips more than 5×10 18 times before you'd expect that result to occur by chance.
If it takes a day to do 2000 guesses and coin flips, it
would take more than 1.3×10 16 years of
2000 flips per day before you'd expect to see 1200 correct
guesses due to chance.  That's more than a million times
the age of the universe, so you'd better get started soon!  Claims of evidence for the paranormal are usually based upon
statistics which diverge so far from the expectation due to chance
that some other mechanism seems necessary to explain the experimental
results.  To interpret the results of our RetroPsychoKinesis
experiments, we'll be using the mathematics of probability and
statistics, so it's worth spending some time explaining how we go
about quantifying the consequences of chance.     Note to mathematicians: The following discussion of probability
is deliberately simplified to consider only binomial and normal distributions
with a probability of 0.5, the presumed probability of success in
the experiments in question.  I decided that
presenting and discussing the equations for arbitrary probability
would only decrease the probability that readers would persevere
and arrive at an understanding of the fundamentals of probability
theory.    Twelve and a half cents: one bit!  In slang harking back to the days of gold doubloons and pieces of
eight, the United States quarter-dollar coin is nicknamed “two bits”.
The Fourmilab radioactive random
number generator produces a stream of binary ones and zeroes, or bits .  Since we expect the generator to produce ones and
zeroes with equal probability, each bit from the generator is
equivalent to a coin flip: heads for one and tails for zero.  When we run
experiments with the generator, in effect, we're flipping a binary coin , one bit —twelve and a
half cents!     Two Bits    One Bit            Heads  Tails    Heads  Tails     (We could, of course, have called zero heads and one tails; since both
occur with equal probability, the choice is arbitrary.) Each bit
produced by the random number generator is a flip of our one-bit coin.
Now the key thing to keep in mind about a genuine random number
generator or flip of a fair coin is that it has no memory or,
as mathematicians say, each bit from the generator or flip is independent .  Even if, by chance, the coin has come up heads
ten times in a row, the probability of getting heads or tails on the
next flip is precisely equal.  Gamblers who've seen a coin come up
heads ten times in a row may believe “tails is way overdue”, but the
coin doesn't know and couldn't care less about the last ten flips; the
next flip is just as likely to be the eleventh head in a row as the
tail that breaks the streak.  Even though there is no way whatsoever to predict the outcome of the
next flip, if we flip a coin a number of times, the laws of
probability allow us to predict, with greater accuracy as the number
of flips increases, the probability of obtaining various results.  In
the discussion that follows, we'll ignore the order of the flips and
only count how many times the coin came up heads.  Since heads is one
and tails is zero, we can just add up the results from the flips, or
the bits from the random generator.  Four Flips  Suppose we flip a coin four times.  Since each flip can come up heads
or tails, there are 16 possible outcomes, tabulated below, grouped by
the number of heads in the four flips.     Number of Heads  Results of Flips  Number of Ways    0       1    1                       4    2                                 6    3                       4    4       1      Number of Ways summarises how many different ways the results
of the four flips could end up with a given number of heads.  Since
the only way to get zero heads is for all four flips to be tails,
there's only one way that can occur.  One head out of four flips can
happen four different ways since each of the four flips could have
been the head.  Two heads out of four flips can happen six different
ways, as tabulated.  And since what's true of heads applies equally to
tails, there are four ways to get three heads and one way to get four.  Mathematically, the number of ways to get x heads (or tails) in n flips is spoken of as
the “number of combinations of n things taken x at a time”, which is written as:     This, it turns out, can be calculated for any positive integers n and x whatsoever, as follows.     For example, if we plug in 4 for n and 2 for x ,
we get  4! / (2! (4 − 2)!) = 4! / (2! 2!) = 24 / (2 2) = 24 / 4 = 6  as expected.
Plotting the number of ways we can get different numbers of
heads yields the following graph.     Probability  Since the coin is fair, each flip has an equal chance of coming up
heads or tails, so all 16 possible outcomes tabulated above are
equally probable.  But since there are 6 ways to get 2 heads, in four
flips the probability of two heads is greater than that of
any other result.  We express probability as a number between 0 and 1.
A probability of zero is a result which cannot ever occur: the
probability of getting five heads in four flips is zero.  A
probability of one represents certainty: if you flip a coin, the
probability you'll get heads or tails is one (assuming it
can't land on the rim,  fall into a black hole, or some such).  The probability of getting a given number of heads from
four flips is, then, simply the number of ways that
number of heads can occur, divided by the number of total
results of four flips, 16.  We can then tabulate the
probabilities as follows.     Number of Heads  Number of Ways  Probability    0  1  1/16 = 0.0625    1  4  4/16 = 0.25    2  6  6/16 = 0.375    3  4  4/16 = 0.25    4  1  1/16 = 0.0625     Since we are absolutely certain the number of heads we get in four
flips is going to be between zero and four, the probabilities of the
different numbers of heads should add up to 1.  Summing the
probabilities in the table confirms this.  Further, we can calculate
the probability of any collection of results by adding the individual
probabilities of each.  Suppose we'd like to know the probability of
getting fewer than three heads from four flips.  There are three ways
this can happen: zero, one, or two heads.  The probability of fewer
than three, then, is the sum of the probabilities of these results,
1/16 + 4/16 + 6/16 = 11/16 = 0.6875, or a little more than two out of
three.  So to calculate the probability of one outcome or another, sum the probabilities.  To get probability of one result and another from two
separate experiments, multiply the individual
probabilities.  The probability of getting one head in four flips is
4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25.  What's the probability of getting one head in each
of two successive sets of four flips?  Well, it's just 1/4 × 1/4 =
1/16 = 0.0625.  The probability for any number of heads x in
any number of flips n is thus:     the number of ways in which x heads can occur
in n flips, divided by the number of different possible
results of the series of flips, measured by number of heads.
But there's no need to sum the combinations in the denominator,
since the number of possible results is simply two raised
to the power of the number of flips.  So, we can simplify
the expression for the probability to:     More Flips  Let's see how the probability behaves as we make more and more flips.
Since we have a general formula for calculating the probability for
any number of heads in any number of flips, we can graph of the
probability for various numbers of flips.   8 Flips  16 Flips  32 Flips  64 Flips  128 Flips   In every case, the peak probability is at half the number of flips and
declines on both sides, more steeply as the number of flips increases.
This is the simple consequence of there being many more possible ways
for results close to half heads and tails to occur than ways that
result in a substantial majority of heads or tails.
The RPKP experiments involve a sequence of 1024
random bits, in which the most probable results form a narrow
curve centred at 512.  A document giving
probabilities for results of 1024 bit experiments with
chance expectations greater than one in 100 thousand million
runs is available , as is a much
larger table listing probabilities for
all possible results .  (The latter document is more than 150K bytes
and will take a while to download, and contains a very large
table which some Web browsers, particularly on machines with
limited memory, may not display properly.)  Perfectly Normal  As we make more and more flips, the graph of the probability of a
given number of heads becomes smoother and approaches the
“bell curve”, or normal distribution , as a limit.  The
normal distribution gives the probability for x heads
in n flips as:     where μ= n /2 and
σ is the standard deviation , a measure of the breadth of the
curve which, for equal probability coin flipping, is:     We keep the standard deviation separate, as opposed to merging it into
the normal distribution probability equation, because it will play an
important rôle in interpreting the results of our experiments.  To
show how closely the probability chart approaches the normal
distribution even for a relatively small number of flips, here's the
normal distribution plotted in red, with the actual probabilities for
number of heads in 128 flips shown as blue bars.     The probability the outcome of an experiment with
a sufficiently large number of trials is due to
chance can be calculated directly from the result, and
the mean and standard deviation for the number of trials
in the experiment.  For additional details, including an
interactive probability calculator, please visit
the z Score
Probability Calculator .  Calculation and Reality  This is all very persuasive, you might say, and the formulas are
suitably intimidating, but does the real world actually behave this
way?  Well, as a matter of fact, it does, as we can see from a simple
experiment.  Get a coin, flip it 32 times, and write down the number
of times heads came up.  Now repeat the experiment fifty thousand
times.  When you're done, make a graph of the number of 32-flip sets
which resulted in a given number of heads.  Hmmmm…32 times
50,000 is 1.6 million, so if you flip the coin once a second,
twenty-four hours per day, it'll take eighteen and a half days to
complete the experiment….  Instead of marathon coin-flipping, let's use the same HotBits hardware random number generator our
experiments employ.  It's a simple matter of programming to withdraw
1.6 million bits from the generator, divide them up into 50,000 sets
of 32 bits each, then compute a histogram of the number of sets
containing each possible number of one bits (heads).  The results from
this experiment are presented in the following graph.     The red curve is the number of runs expected to result in each value
of heads, which is simply the probability of that number of heads
multiplied by the total number of experimental runs, 50,000.  The blue
diamonds are the actual number of 32 bit sets observed to contain each
number of one bits.  It is evident that the experimental results
closely match the expectation from probability.  Just as the
probability curve approaches the normal distribution for large numbers
of runs, experimental results from a truly random source will
inexorably converge on the predictions of probability as the number of
runs increases.   If
your Web browser supports Java applets, our Probability Pipe
Organ lets you run interactive experiments which demonstrate how
the results from random data approach the normal
curve expectation as the number of experiments grows large.   Experiments and Expectations  Performing an experiment amounts to asking the Universe a
question.  For the answer, the experimental results, to be
of any use, you have to be absolutely sure you've phrased the
question correctly.  When searching for elusive effects
among a sea of random events by statistical means, whether
in particle physics or parapsychology, one must take care
to apply statistics properly to the events being studied.
Misinterpreting genuine experimental results yields errors
just as serious as those due to faults in the design of the
experiment.  Evidence for the existence of a phenomenon must be significant , persistent , and consistent .
Statistical analysis can never entirely rule out the
possibility that the results of an experiment were entirely due to
chance—it can only calculate the probability of occurrence by
chance.  Only as more and more experiments are performed, which
reproduce the supposed effect and, by doing so, further decrease the
probability of chance, does the evidence for the effect become
persuasive.  To show how essential it is to ask the right question, consider an
experiment in which the subject attempts to influence a device which
generates random digits from 0 to 9 so that more nines are generated
than expected by chance.  Each experiment involves generation of one
thousand random digits.  We run the first experiment and get the
following result:   51866599999944246273322297520235159670265786865762

(we'll see how to calculate this numerically before long).
There was an excess of nines over the chance expectation, 100,
but greater excesses occurred for the digits 3 , 5 , 6 , and 7 .  But take a look at the first line of
the results!  518665 999999 44246273322297520235159670265786865762
                            .
                            .
                            .  These digits were supposed to be random , yet in the first
thousand, the first dozen for that matter, we found a pattern as
striking as “999999”.  What's the probability of that happening?  Just
the number of possible numbers of d digits which contain one
or more sequences of p or more consecutive nines:     Plugging in 1000 for d and 6 for p yields:     So the probability of finding “999999” in a set of 1000 random digits
is less than one in a thousand!  So then, are the digits not random,
after all?  Might our subject, while failing to influence the outcome
of the experiment in the way we've requested, have somehow marked the
results with a signature of a thousand-to-one probability of appearing
by chance?  Or have we simply asked the wrong question and gotten a
perfectly accurate answer that doesn't mean what we think it does at
first glance?  The latter turns out to be the case.  The data are right before our
eyes, and the probability we calculated is correct, but we asked
the wrong question , and in doing so fell into a trap littered
with the bones of many a naïve researcher.  Note the order in which we
did things.  We ran the experiment, examined the data, found something
seemingly odd in it, then calculated the probability of that
particular oddity appearing by chance.  We asked the question,
“ What is the probability of ‘999999’ appearing in a 1000 digit
random sequence? ” and got the answer “less than one in a
thousand”, a result most people would consider significant.  But since
we calculated the probability after seeing the data, in fact we were
asking the question “ What is the chance that ‘999999’ appears in a
1000 digit random sequence which contains one occurrence of
‘999999’?” .  The answer to that question is, of course,
“certainty”.  In the original examination of the data, we were really asking
“ What is the probability we'll find some striking sequence
of six digits in a random 1000 digit number? ”.  We can't
precisely quantify that without defining what “striking” means to the
observer, but it is clearly quite high.  Consider that I could have
made the case just as strongly for “000000”, “777777” or any other
six-digit repeat.  That alone reduces the probability of occurrence by
chance to one in ten.  Or, perhaps I might have pointed out a run of
digits like “123456”, “012345”, “987654”, and so on; or the first five
or six digits of a mathematical constant such as Pi, e, or the square
root of two; regular patterns like “101010”, “123321”, or a multitude
of others; or maybe my telephone or license plate number, or the
subject's!  It is, in fact, very likely you'll find some pattern you consider striking in a random 1000-digit number.  But, of course, if you don't examine the data from an experiment, how
are you going to notice if there's something odd about it?  Now we'll
see how a hypothesis is framed, tested by a series of experiments, and
confirmed or rejected by statistical analysis of the results.  So,
let's pursue this a bit further, exploring how we frame a hypothesis
based on an observation, run experiments to test it, and then analyse the
results to determine whether they confirm or
deny the hypothesis, and to what degree of certainty.  Our observation, based on examining the first thousand random digits,
is that “999999” appears once, while the probability of “999999”
appearing in a randomly chosen 1000 digit number is less than one in a
thousand.  Based on this observation we then suggest:    Hypothesis:  The sequence “999999” appears more frequently
in 1000-digit sequences with the subject attempting to influence
the generator than would be expected by chance.    We can now proceed to test this experimentally.  If the sequence
“999999” has a probability of occurring in a 1000 digit sequence of
0.000995, then for a thousand consecutive 1000 digit sequences (a
million digits in all), the probability of “999999” appearing will
be 0.995, almost unity. (To be correct, it's important
to test each 1000 digit sequence separately, then sum the results for
1000 consecutive sequences.  If we were to scan all million digits as
one sequence, we would count cases where the sequence “999999” begins
in one 1000 digit sequence and ends in the next.  The probability
(which you can calculate from the equation above) of finding “999999”
in a million digit sequence is 0.999995, somewhat higher than the
0.995 with the million digits are treated as separate 1000 digit
experiments.)   We will perform, then, the following experiment.  With our
ever-patient subject continuing to attempt to influence the output of the
generator, we will produce a million more sequences
of 1000 digits and, in each, count occurrences of “999999”.  Every
1000 sequences, we'll record the number of occurrences,
repeating the process until we've generated a thousand
runs of a million digits—10 9 digits in all.
With that data in hand, we'll see whether the “999999 effect”
is genuine or a fluke attributable to chance.  Here is a plot of the number of occurrences of the sequence “999999”
per block of 1000 digits over the thousand repetitions of the thousand
sequence experiment.  The number of occurrences expected by chance,
0.995, is marked by the green line.     At the outset, the results diverged substantially from chance, as is
frequently the case for small sample sizes.  But as the number of
experiments increased, the results converged toward the chance
expectation, ending up in a decreasing magnitude random walk around
it.  This is precisely what is expected from probability theory, and
hence we conclude no “999999 effect” exists.  Ensembles of Experiments: the X ² (Chi-Square) Test  So far, we've seen how the laws of probability predict the outcome of
large numbers of experiments involving random data, how to calculate
the probability of a given experimental result being due to chance,
and how one goes about framing a hypothesis, then designing and
running a series of experiments to test it.  Now it's time to examine
how to analyse the results from the experiments to determine whether
they provide evidence for the hypothesis and, if so, how much.  Since its introduction in 1900 by Karl Peterson, the chi-square
( X ²) test has become the most widely used measure of the
significance to which experimental results support or refute a
hypothesis.  Applicable to any experiment where discrete results can
be measured, it is used in almost every field of science.  The
chi-square test is the final step in a process which usually proceeds
as follows.   Based either on theory or examination of empirical
        data, a phenomenon is suggested to exist.  A hypothesis is framed incorporating the supposed
        phenomenon.  An experiment is designed to test the hypothesis.
        The experiment must produce results which differ
        based on the validity of the hypothesis.  The
        results of the experiment for the hypothesis-false
        ( null hypothesis ) case are calculated and,
        if appropriate, verified by a control experiment
        in which the hypothesised effect is excluded.  A series of experiments are conducted, and the
        results tabulated.  The chi-square test is applied to determine the
        significance of the discrepancy between the
        calculated null hypothesis case and the
        experimental results, and the probability that
        the discrepancy is the result of chance.  If
        that probability is very low, the experiment
        provides evidence for the hypothesis.   No experiment or series of experiments can ever prove a
hypothesis; one can only rule out other hypotheses and provide
evidence that assuming the truth of the hypothesis better explains the
experimental results than discarding it.  In many fields of science,
the task of estimating the null-hypothesis results can be formidable,
and can lead to prolonged and intricate arguments about the
assumptions involved.  Experiments must be carefully designed to
exclude selection effects which might bias the data.  Fortunately, retropsychokinesis experiments have an easily stated and
readily calculated null hypothesis: “The results will obey the
statistics for a sequence of random bits.” The fact that the data are
prerecorded guarantees (assuming the experiment software is properly
implemented and the results are presented without selection or
modification) that run selection or other forms of cheating cannot
occur.  (Anybody can score better than chance at coin flipping if
they're allowed to throw away experiments that come out poorly!)
Finally, the availability of all the programs in source code form and
the ability of others to repeat the experiments on their own premises
will allow independent confirmation of the results obtained here.  So, as the final step in analysing the results of a collection of n experiments, each with k possible outcomes, we
apply the chi-square test to compare the actual results with the
results expected by chance, which are just, for each outcome, its
probability times the number of experiments n .  Mathematically,
the chi-square statistic for an experiment with k possible outcomes, performed n times, in which Y 1 , Y 2 ,… Y k are the number of
experiments which resulted in each possible outcome, where the
probabilities of each outcome are p 1 ,
p 2 ,… p k is:     It's evident from examining this equation that the closer the
measured values are to those expected, the
lower the chi-square sum will be.  Further, from a chi-square
sum, the probability Q that the X ² sum for an experiment with d degrees of freedom (where d = k −1, one less
the number of possible outcomes) is consistent with the
null hypothesis can be calculated as:     Where Γ is the generalisation of the factorial
function to real and complex arguments:     Unfortunately, there is no closed form solution for Q , so it
must be evaluated numerically.  If your Web browser supports
JavaScript, you can use the Chi-Square
Calculator to calculate the probability from a chi-square value
and number of possible outcomes, or calculate the chi-square from the
probability and the number of possible outcomes.  In applying the chi-square test, it's essential to understand that only
very small probabilities of the null hypothesis are significant.
If the probability that the null hypothesis can explain the experimental
results is above 1%, an experiment is generally not considered evidence
of a different hypothesis.  The chi-square test takes
into account neither the number of experiments performed nor the
probability distribution of the expected outcomes; it is valid
only as the number of experiments becomes large, resulting in
substantial numbers for the most probable results.  If a hypothesis
is valid, the chi-square probability should converge on a
small value as more and more experiments are run.  Now let's examine an example of how the chi-square test identifies
experimental results which support or refute a hypothesis.  Our
simulated experiment consists of 50,000 runs of 32 random bits each.
The subject attempts to influence the random number generator to emit
an excess of one or zero bits compared to the chance expectation of
equal numbers of zeroes and ones.  The following table gives the
result of a control run using the random number generator without the
subject's attempting to influence it.  Even if the probability of
various outcomes is easily calculated, it's important to run control
experiments to make sure there are no errors in the experimental
protocol or apparatus which might bias the results away from those
expected.  The table below gives, for each possible number of one

expected.  Next, we invite our subject to attempt to influence the random output

fingo. Let's just presume that by some means: telekinesis,
voodoo, tampering with the apparatus when we weren't
looking—whatever, our subject is able to bias the generator so
that out of every 200 bits there's an average of 101 one bits and 99
zeroes.  This seemingly subtle bias would result in an experiment like
the following.

terribly obvious divergence from the expectation, yet the chi-square
test unambiguously fingers the bias.  A X ² sum of 89.6775 in
an experiment with 33 possible outcomes (32 degrees of freedom)
has a probability of occurring by chance of 0.00000022—about
two in ten million—a highly significant result, worthy of
follow-up experiments and investigation of possible mechanisms which
might explain the deviation from chance.

Flipping a coin isn't as fair as it seems. (Courtesy of flickr user MagnuMicah )    By Dan Lewis    smithsonian.com   November 30, 2012         Posted from Dan Lewis' fantastic Now I Know newsletter. Subscribe here or follow him on Twitter .    Imagine you’re at a bar and another patron offers you the following wager. He’s going to flip a coin — a standard U.S. penny like the ones seen above — a dozen or so times. If it comes up heads more often than tails, he’ll pay you $20. If it comes up tails more than heads, you pay him the same. There are no hidden tricks. It’s a fair bet — safe to take, if you’re looking for a 50/50 chance.  Now, imagine the same offer, except that instead of flipping the coin, the other patron tells you he’s going to spin it. In fact, he’ll even let you provide the penny, just to guarantee there is no funny business. Twenty-five spins and if it comes up heads more often than tails, he’ll give you $20 again. But if tails comes up more often, you owe him $20.  Fair bet? Not if Persi Diaconis is right.  Diaconis is a professor of mathematics and statistics at Stanford University and, formerly, a professional magician. While his claim to fame is determining how many times a deck of cards must be shuffled in order to give a mathematically random result (it’s either five or seven, depending on your criteria), he’s also dabbled in the world of coin games. What he and his fellow researchers discovered ( here’s a PDF of their paper ) is that most games of chance involving coins aren’t as even as you’d think. For example, even the 50/50 coin toss really isn’t 50/50 — it’s closer to 51/49, biased toward whatever side was up when the coin was thrown into the air.  But more incredibly, as reported by Science News , spinning a penny, in this case one with the Lincoln Memorial on the back, gives even more pronounced odds — the penny will land tails side up roughly 80 percent of the time. The reason: the side with Lincoln’s head on it is a bit heavier than the flip side, causing the coin’s center of mass to lie slightly toward heads. The spinning coin tends to fall toward the heavier side more often, leading to a pronounced number of extra “tails” results when it finally comes to rest.  Because the coins typically pick up dirt and oils over time, trying the experiment at home may not yield such a large percentage of “tails” over “heads” — but a relatively new coin should still give you noticeable results.

For example, suppose we have three coins.   Suppose:   the 1st coin has probability \( p_H\) of landing heads up and \( p_T\) of landing tails up;  the 2nd coin has probability \( q_H\) of landing heads up and \( q_T\) of landing tails up;  the 3rd coin has probability \( r_H\) of landing heads up and \( r_T\) of landing tails up.   Suppose we flip all of these coins: the 1st, then the 2nd, then the 3rd.  What's the probability that we get this sequence of results: \( (H, T, T)\) If the coin flips are independent , the probability is just this product: \( p_H \, q_T \, r_T \) See the pattern?  We just multiply the probabilities.  And there's nothing special about coins here, or the number three . We could flip a coin, roll a die, pick a card, and see if it's raining outside. For example, what's the probability that we get heads with our coin, the number 6 on our die, an ace of spades with our cards, and it's raining? If these outcomes are independent , we just calculate: the probability that we get heads, times
the probability that we roll a 6, times
the probability that we get an ace of spades, times
the probability that it's raining outside. Let's solve some puzzles using this idea! Three flips of a fair coin Example 1. Suppose you have a fair coin: this means it has a 50% chance of landing heads up and a 50% chance of landing tails up.  Suppose you flip it three times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up, then tails up, then heads up? We're asking about the probability of this outcome: \( (H, T, H)\) Since the flips are independent this is \( p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H \, p_T \, p_H \) Since the coin is fair we have \( \displaystyle{ p_H = p_T = \frac{1}{2} } \) so \(  \displaystyle{ p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} } \) So the answer is 1/8, or 12.5%. Example 2. In the same situation, what's the probability that the coin lands heads up exactly twice? There are 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 outcomes that can happen: \( (H,H,H) \)
\( (H,H,T), \; (H,T,H), \; (T,H,H) \)
\( (H,T,T), \; (T,H,T), \; (T,T,H) \)
\( (T,T,T) \) We can work out the probability of each of these outcomes.  For example, we've already seen that \( (H,T,H)\) is \( \displaystyle{ p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{8} }\) since the coin is fair and the flips are independent.  In fact, all 8 probabilities work out the same way.  We always get 1/8.  In other words, each of the 8 outcomes is equally likely! But we're interested in the probability that we get exactly two heads.  That's the probability of this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) Using the rule we saw in Part 7 , this probability is \( \displaystyle{ p(S) = p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} = 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) So the answer is 3/8, or 37.5%. I could have done this a lot faster.  I could say "there are 8 outcomes that can happen, each equally likely, and three that give us two heads, so the probability is 3/8."   But I wanted to show you how we're just following rules we've already seen! Three flips of a very unfair coin Example 3. Now suppose we have an unfair coin with a 90% chance of landing heads up and 10% chance of landing tails up!  What's the probability that if we flip it three times, it lands heads up exactly twice?  Again let's assume the coin flips are independent. Most of the calculation works exactly the same way, but now our coin has \( \displaystyle{ p_H = 0.9, \quad p_T = 0.1 } \) We're interested in the outcomes where the coin comes up heads twice, so we look at this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) The probability of this subset is \( \begin{array}{ccl} p(S) &=& p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} \\  &=& p_T \, p_H  \, p_H + p_H \, p_T \, p_H + p_H \, p_H \, p_T \\ &=& 3 p_T p_H^2 \\ &=& 3 \times 0.1 \times 0.9^2 \\ &=& 0.3 \times 0.81 \\ &=& 0.243 \end{array}\) So now the probability is just 24.3%. Six flips of a fair coin Example 4. Suppose you have a fair coin.  Suppose you flip it six times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up exactly twice? We did a similar problem already, where we flipped the coin three times.  Go back and look at that if you forget!  The answer to that problem was \( \displaystyle{ 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) Why?  Here's why: there were 3 ways to get two heads when you flipped 3 coins, and each of these outcomes had probability \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} }\) We can do our new problem the same way.  Count the number of ways to get two heads when we flip six coins.  Then multiply this by \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} }\) The hard part is to count how many ways we can get two heads when we flip six coins.  To get good at probabilities, we have to get good at counting.  It's boring to list all the outcomes we're trying to count: (H,H,T,T,T,T), (H,T,H,T,T,T), (H,T,T,H,T,T), ... So let's try to come up with a better idea. We have to pick 2 out of our 6 flips to be H's.  How many ways are there to do this? There are 6 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, and then 5 ways left over to pick another and draw a blue H on it... letting the rest be T's.  For example: (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, we've got 6 × 5 = 30 choices.  But we don't really care which H is red and which H is blue—that's just a trick to help us solve the problem.  For example, we don't want to count (T, H , T, T, H , T) as different from (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, there aren't really 30 ways to get two heads.  There are only half as many!  There are 15 ways. So, the probability of getting two heads when we flip the coin six times is \( \displaystyle{ 15 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{15}{64} \approx .234 } \) where the squiggle means 'approximately'.  So: about 23.4%. Binomial coefficients Now for some jargon, which will help when we do harder problems like this.  We say there are 6 choose 2 ways to choose 2 out of 6 things, and we write this as \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2} } \) This sort of number is called a binomial coefficient . We've just shown that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2}  = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 }\) Why write it like this funky fraction: \( \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1}\)?  Because it'll help us see the pattern for doing harder problems like this! Nine flips of a fair coin If we flip a fair coin 9 times, and the flips are independent, what's the probability that we get heads exactly 6 times? This works just like the last problem, only the numbers are bigger.  So, I'll do it faster! When we flip the coin 9 times there are \( 2^9\) possible outcomes that can happen.   Each of these is equally likely if it's a fair coin and the flips are independent.  So each has probability \( \displaystyle{  \frac{1}{2^9} } \) To get the answer, we need to multiply this by the number of ways we can get heads exactly 6 times.  This number is called '9 choose 6' or \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6}  }\) for short.  It's the number of ways we can choose 6 things out of a collection of 9. So we just need to know: what's 9 choose 6?  We can work this out as before.  There are 9 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, then 8 ways left to pick another and draw a blue H on it, and 7 ways left to pick a third and draw a orange H on it.  That sounds like 9 × 8 × 7. But we've overcounted!   After all, we don't care about the colors.  We don't care about the difference between this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) and this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) In fact we've counted each possibility 6 times!  Why six?   The first H could be red, green or blue — that's 3 choices.  But then the second H could be either of the two remaining 2 colors... and for the third, we just have 1 choice.  So there are 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways to permute the colors. So, the actual number of ways to get 6 heads out of 9 coin flips is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) In other words: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) To get the answer to our actual problem, remember we need to multiply \( 1/2^9\) by this.  So the answer is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6} }\) If you're a pure mathematician, you can say you're done now.  But normal people won't understand this answer, so let's calculate it out.  I hope you know the first ten powers of two: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.  So: \( \displaystyle{ 2^9 = 512 }\) I hope you can also do basic arithmetic like this: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84} \) So, the probability of getting 6 heads when you do 9 independent flips of a fair coin is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6}  = \frac{84}{512} = 0.164025 } \) or 16.4025%. I broke down and used a calculator at the last step.   We're becoming serious nerds here. Okay, that's enough for now.  We've been counting how many ways we can get a certain number of heads from a certain number of coin flips.  What we're realy doing is taking a set of coin flips, say \( n\) of them, and choosing a subset of \( k\) of them to be heads.  So, we say Definition. The binomial coefficient  \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} } \) called \( n\) choose \( k,\) is the number of ways of choosing a subset of \( k\) things from a set of \( n\) things. We have seen in some examples that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots 1} } \) Here there's a product of \( k\) consecutive numbers on top, and \( k\) on bottom too.  We didn't prove this is true in general, but it's not hard to see, using the tricks we've used already.

Sunday, March 29, 2009  Have you ever flipped a coin as a way of deciding something with another person? The answer is probably yes. And you probably did so assuming you were getting a fair deal, because, as everybody knows, a coin is equally likely to show heads or tails after a single flip—unless it's been shaved or weighted or has a week-old smear of coffee on its underbelly.   So when your friend places a coin on his thumb and says "call it in the air", you realize that it doesn't really matter whether you pick heads or tails. Every person has a preference, of course—heads or tails might feel "luckier" to you—but logically the chances are equal.  Or are they?   Granted, everybody knows that newly-minted coins are born with tiny imperfections, minute deviations introduced by the fabrication process. Everybody knows that, over time, a coin will wear and tear, picking up scratches, dings, dents, bacteria, and finger-grease. And everybody knows that these imperfections can affect the physics of the coin flip, biasing the results by some infinitesimal amount which in practice we ignore.  But let's assume that's not the case.  Let's assume the coin is fabricated perfectly, down to the last vigintillionth of a yoctometer . And, since it's possible to train one's thumb to flip a coin such that it comes up heads or tails a huge percentage of the time, let's assume the person flipping the coin isn't a magician or a prestidigitator. In other words, let's assume both a perfect coin and an honest toss, such as the kind you might make with a friend to decide who pays for lunch.  In that case there's an absolute right and wrong answer to the age-old question...  Heads or tails?  ...because the two outcomes of a typical coin flip are not equally likely.  The 50-50 proposition is actually more of a 51-49 proposition, if not worse. The sacred coin flip exhibits (at minimum) a whopping 1% bias , and possibly much more. 1% may not sound like a lot, but it's more than the typical casino edge in a game of blackjack or slots. What's more, you can take advantage of this little-known fact to give yourself an edge in all future coin-flip battles.  The Physics of Coin Flipping  In the 31-page Dynamical Bias in the Coin Toss , Persi Diaconis, Susan Holmes, and Richard Montgomery lay out the theory and practice of coin-flipping to a degree that's just, well, downright intimidating.   Suffice to say their approach involved a lot of physics, a lot of math, motion-capture cameras, random experimentation, and an automated "coin-flipper" device capable of flipping a coin and producing Heads 100% of the time.   Here are the broad strokes of their research:   If the coin is tossed and caught , it has about a 51% chance of landing on the same face it was launched. (If it starts out as heads, there's a 51% chance it will end as heads).  If the coin is spun, rather than tossed , it can have a much-larger-than-50% chance of ending with the heavier side down. Spun coins can exhibit "huge bias" (some spun coins will fall tails-up 80% of the time).  If the coin is tossed and allowed to clatter to the floor , this probably adds randomness.  If the coin is tossed and allowed to clatter to the floor where it spins , as will sometimes happen, the above spinning bias probably comes into play.  A coin will land on its edge around 1 in 6000 throws , creating a flipistic singularity .  The same initial coin-flipping conditions produce the same coin flip result . That is, there's a certain amount of determinism to the coin flip.  A more robust coin toss (more revolutions) decreases the bias .   The 51% figure in Premise 1 is a bit curious and, when I first saw it, I assumed it was a minor bias introduced by the fact that the "heads" side of the coin has more decoration than the "tails" side, making it heavier. But it turns out that this sort of imbalance has virtually no effect unless you spin the coin on its edge, in which case you'll see a huge bias. The reason a typical coin toss is 51-49 and not 50-50 has nothing to do with the asymmetry of the coin and everything to do with the aggregate amount of time the coin spends in each state, as it flips through space.  A good way of thinking about this is by looking at the ratio of odd numbers to even numbers when you start counting from 1.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17  No matter how long you count, you'll find that at any given point, one of two things will be true:   You've touched more odd numbers than even numbers  You've touched an equal amount of odd numbers and even numbers   What will never happen, is this:   You've touched more even numbers than odd numbers.   Similarly, consider a coin, launched in the "heads" position, flipping heads over tails through the ether:  H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H  At any given point in time, either the coin will have spent equal time in the Heads and Tails states, or it will have spent more time in the Heads state. In the aggregate, it's slightly more likely that the coin shows Heads at a given point in time—including whatever time the coin is caught. And vice-versa if you start the coin-flip from the Tails position.  The Strategy of Coin Flipping  Unlike the article on the edge in a game of blackjack mentioned previously, I've never seen a description of "coin flipping strategy" which takes the above science into count. When it's a true 50-50 toss, there is no strategy. But if we take it as granted, or at least possible, that a coin flip does indeed exhibit a 1% or more bias, then the following rules of thumb might apply.   Always be the chooser, if possible . This allows you to leverage Premise 1 or Premise 2 for those extra percentage points.  Always be the tosser , if you can. This protects you from virtuoso coin-flippers who are able to leverage Premise 6 to produce a desired outcome. It also protects you against the added randomness (read: fairness) introduced by flippers who will occasionally, without rhyme or reason, invert the coin in their palm before revealing. Tricksy Hobbitses.  Don't allow the same person to both toss and choose . Unless, of course, that person is you.  If the coin is being tossed, and you're the chooser, always choose the side that's initially face down . According to Premise 1, you'd always choose the side that's initially face up, but most people, upon flipping a coin, will invert it into their other palm before revealing. Hence, you choose the opposite side, but you get the same 1% advantage. Of course, if you happen to know that a particular flipper doesn't do this, use your better judgment.  If you are the tosser but not the chooser, sometimes invert the coin into your other palm after catching, and sometimes don't . This protects you against people who follow Rule 4 blindly by assuming you'll either invert the coin or you won't.  If the coin is being spun rather than tossed , always choose whichever side is lightest . On a typical coin, the "Heads" side of the coin will have more "stuff" engraved on it, causing Tails to show up more frequently than it should. Choosing Tails in this situation is usually the power play.  Never under any circumstances agree to a coin spin if you're not the chooser . This opens you up to a devastating attack if your opponent is aware of Premise 2.   I hope I've made it clear that none of this is really to be taken seriously. The point is that adding even 1% of wobble to a situation of pure chance can create a lot of additional complexity, and that in turn, can create strategy where none existed before.  Tags: probability , coin flipping    54 comment(s)   Great little article. I very much enjoyed this.  I would add to your "coin flip strategy" that if you suspect you're facing a "virtuoso tosser" and he won't let you do the toss, make him toss it on the ground.  Cheers.   Heads I Win Tails You Lose on Sunday, March 29, 2009   Lol. Interesting.  I may be mistaken here, but I believe your term "one vigintillionth of a yoctometer" is below the Plank length, making it so small as to be meaningless. Been a while since I looked at this stuff (college in fact) but...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length   Anonymous Coward on Sunday, March 29, 2009   that's the point.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, October 17, 2011   Awesome article. Really enjoyed reading it and having a break from the indepth computer science. Thanks.   Poker Forums on Monday, March 30, 2009   One vigintillionth of a yoctometer? Major phail! If we're throwing away practical concerns, we should atleast adhere to realm of the theoretically possible.  Jokes aside, nice article. For a moment, I was thinking that, even given your explanation of the inherent bias, it doesn't make sense since the coin would never land in the position it started at without flipping, as that would really be an invalid flip. But then, I guess all you do is move the minimum number of flips ahead to 2 or 3, and the state of the coin there is your new "initial" state, and you can set up the same argument. Nice.  However, I wonder what the case would be if one started the coin at a half-flip, on its edge? You might say that the initial face would correspond to the next face to show up after it performs a half-flip. But instead of a half-flip, what if you had just behind a half-flip? What about a quarter flip? I don't know a good line of reasoning to take care of these cases, it almost seems arbitrary.  And of course, it's totally pointless too. But who cares, interesting nonetheless!   ehsanul on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   [i]>One vigintillionth of a yoctometer? Major phail! If we're throwing away practical concerns, we should at least adhere to realm of the theoretically possible.[/i]  Yes, major fail. Guilty! But more memorable than "down to the last molecule/nanometer/etc". I got the idea for the phrase from Neal Stephenson's book in which the villain has a knife with an edge "one molecule wide".  If you managed to flip the coin from the edge position (let E represent the edge state):  E H E T E H E T E H E T E H E T E H E T E H  I still think the sequence exhibits the clumping shown above, because the coin spends only a tiny fraction of its time in those E states (it's really only in E when it's perfectly vertical). Because the aggregate time in E is so small, the probabilities would still favor whatever state immediately followed the initial E state (in this case, heads). At least, it seems you could make the argument.   Coding the Wheel on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Another strategy. If not obvious:   If you are the tosser, and not the chooser, flip the coin into your palm after the toss only if they pick the face up side.    James R on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   You missed an important strategy.  I used to earn lunch money in high school thusly:
I could flip a coin to come out "heads" about 90% of the time (with practice, same as knife throwing, control # of flips through the air during a certain time between flip and catch).  Anyhow, I flip, you call while in the air.
I catch and you most always lose because after you call it in the air, I choose to catch, or catch and invert (your #5. above). You assume it was fair because you called it in the air. No one ever figured out what I was doing (or I would have been beaten up!).   Comfortable on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Persi Diaconis is also the guy who did the (often-misquoted) research into how many times you should shuffle a deck of cards.   bmm6o on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   So, to paraphrase Vizzini:  "But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you: are you the sort of man who would put the coin into his own hand or his enemy's? Now, a clever man would put the coin into his own hand, because he would know that only a great fool would request to make the call. I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the side facing up. But you must have known I was not a great fool, you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the side facing down."  But we all know how Vizzini ended up. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha...   Anonymous Coward on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Just found your blog and have read quite a few of your posts - excellent job.  I think you're explanation of why it's 51% is suspect however.  In fact the paper does show that a coin flipped without precession does have a 50/50 chance (even though your H T H T H T H argument would still apply).  But with precession the coin will spend a greater frequency of it's time in the starting position (in fact with enough precession it will appear to flip but be 100% in the up position - alas I can not seem to master that).  If you take a coin and manually flip it end over end while precessing it at the same time you can kind of visualize this.  In the case without precession it's irrelevant that it starts as heads or tails.  What's relevant is that after flipping the coin spends equal amounts of time in the air in both states.  Again with precession this is not true.  Apparently their experiments showed that a typical coin flip done by hand precesses enough to give the 1% bias.   Anonymous Coward on Saturday, April 04, 2009   How did you get the 1 in 6000 figure for ending up on it's edge?  Seems low to my thinking. BTW, happened to me, a long time ago over who buys the next pitcher of beer.  I never met anyone else who has seen a coin land on its edge.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, April 06, 2009   [i]>I think you're explanation of why it's 51% is suspect however. In fact the paper does show that[/i]  You're right. The entire argument is an oversimplification.  [i]>How did you get the 1 in 6000 figure for ending up on it's edge?[/i]  That figure was for a nickel and I think it would be less for other coins. It was buried on page 10 of [url=http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~susan/papers/headswithJ.pdf]Dynamical Bias in the Coin Toss[/url] which references [url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993PhRvE..48.2547M]the original research[/url]. There's also some other [url=http://www.google.com/search?q=coin+landing+on+edge]research[/url] on this.   Coding the Wheel on Monday, April 06, 2009   A couple days ago I flipped a coin (nickel) and it landed, rolled, and stayed on edge. It was a new nickel and a flat (glass) table but it happened.  One of the more interesting "light reading" posts I've come across in weeks.   jzx on Wednesday, April 08, 2009   I'm neither a mathematician nor a physicist, having found my way here via the link from Freakonomics (I suppose I should say I'm not an economist either), but I think the HTHT analysis would lead to a conclusion opposite to the one given here.  If we assume that the coin is in fact flipped, and not simply "moved from Point A to Point B by a process that may or may not involve flipping," then isn't it correct to deem the initial state of a flipped coin as being 180 degrees revolved from its state in the flipper's hand? If so (and that seems right to me), the HTHT analysis leads to the conclusion that the side of the coin more likely to be up at the end of the flip is the side that was down in the flipper's hands.   DBH on Thursday, April 16, 2009   I would appreciate a strategy for Two-up
Two-up is a traditional Australian gambling game, involving a designated 'Spinner' throwing two coins into the air. Traditionally, these coins are pennies. Incidentally, their weight size and surface design make them ideal for the game. Weight and size make them stable on the 'kip' and easy to spin in the air. Decimal coins are generally considered to be too small and light and they don't 'fly' so well. The design of pennies that date pre 1939 had the soveriegns head on the obverse(front) and the reverse was totally covered in writing making the result very easy and quick to see. Pennies can often be obseved being used at games on Anzac Day, they are and brought out specifically for the purpose each year.  Players gamble on whether the coins will fall with both (obverse) heads up, both (reverse) tails up, or with one coin a head, and one a tail (known as 'Odds'). It is traditionally played on ANZAC Day in pubs and clubs throughout Australia, in part to mark a shared experience with Diggers through the ages.   Pablo Uribe on Monday, April 27, 2009   "Let's assume the coin is fabricated perfectly, down to the last vigintillionth of a yoctometer."  Its not. The research is highly biased based on the perfect flip and the coin not being a perfect coin.  On top of this, the coin may be flipped 500 million times showing a 51-49, but you could flip it 1 trillion times resulting in 50-50.  If I gave Sally half my meal, am I left with 49% or 50%? Yeah...  If anything, its more likely the coin has a 49.99999999....-49.9999999 probability, giving room for the randomness of variables like the blatant bias in this research.   Anonymous Coward on Friday, July 31, 2009   Impresive reasearch man...   John on Monday, August 03, 2009   The aggregate time hypothesis doesn't work. If you just shift the frame to the, say, third flip in the air - since it's highly unlikely that the coin will land before it's third flip - you'll get the same argument reversed. I.e., if I start with heads, let it flip 3 times with tails up, and then start counting aggregate time, I'll get a THTHTHTHT... pattern and tails will now win 51% of the time.   Nyet on Monday, August 24, 2009   I used to work with a guy who was sure that coins had memory.  To him if you had a fair coin and you flipped it 100 times and got heads the odds would be better that you would get a tail on the next flip.  No matter how I explained it to him he would not believe that it was still 50/50.  I asked him how the coin "remembered what it's last 100 flips were?"   Sitelinker on Monday, August 24, 2009   Not a single Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead reference? For shame!  "A weaker man might be moved to re-examine his faith, if in nothing else at least in the law of probability."  Fascinating piece, by the way.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, August 24, 2009   I'm afraid that the HTHTH... argument appears to me to be completely bogus.  The only reason that there might be one more heads is that you decided to start counting on heads. Why did you start counting on heads? Because that was what was showing in the beginning, when it was resting on the thumb.  But you could equally argue that that is the very worst place to start counting. A coin flip isn't a coin flip if it doesn't leave the thumb. Indeed, it has to have at least one flip. Therefore, it is completely impossible that the first H would ever be counted.  So you could make an equally good argument saying  [quote]Similarly, consider a coin, launched in the "heads" position, flipping heads over tails through the ether. After the first flip, naturally, it will be on Tails:  T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T  At any given point in time, either the coin will have spent equal time in the Heads and Tails states, or it will have spent more time in the Tails state.[/quote]  This argument sounds just as reasonable as the first one, if not more so, which implies to me that the whole argument doesn't work.  Note that if this [b]did[/b] make sense, then the coin would show a bias of much, much more than 51%, because the coin would have to flip at least 100 times before the effect of that "first side" bias, were it true, was as low as 1%. Since most coin flips are under 100 flips, the "first side" bias by your argument would be much higher (in your example, 52% of the options are Heads).   SamSam on Monday, August 24, 2009   [i]>Not a single Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead reference? For shame![/i]  I thought long and hard about it. Seriously.

[/i]  Yes. Excellent points. The thing is, the "HTHTH" argument was a simplification (mentioned briefly in the post & comments above) ie a way of thinking about how the coin is spending its time in the aggregate, not necessarily meant to be an accurate portrayal of the physics. For example, if you flip the coin for say 1.5 revolutions it's obviously not approximating 51-49. This was a device, but an innocent one.   Coding the Wheel on Monday, August 24, 2009   [i]>The thing is, the "HTHTH" argument was a simplification (mentioned briefly in the post & comments above) ie a way of thinking about how the coin is spending its time in the aggregate[/i]  Yes, but you do specifically say that the reason (according to you) that the coin spends more of its time on "Heads" is that there are more H's then T's in your sequence, and that this is because you started with "H."  Simplification or not, this is fundamentally a wrong way to look at it, as several people have said. The problem with your approach is that it all depends on where you start counting, and you can pick wherever you want depending on what you want to prove, which is not good physics. The article doesn't suggest your explanation.  Although the article doesn't appear to suggest any explanation, a better explanation of the idea that the coin spends more time on one face than the other "in aggregate" would be one where this really is displayed where ever you start counting from. For example, the following argument, though not necessarily true, displays this property:  [quote]"Due to the asymmetry of flipping, the coin spends more time in the 360 degree flipped position than the 180 degree flipped position. If we write out the sequence showing what face is showing at time T, with the dT between values being 0.01 s, it would look like  ....2211111122211111222111111222...  as you can see, it spends more time on the first face ("1") than the second, so is more likely to be caught when displaying the first face."[/quote]  This argument, while probably incorrect and not supported by the article, at least is an explanation that doesn't depend on whether you start counting when the coin being on your thumb or after the first flip.   SamSam on Monday, August 24, 2009   I'm surprised no one mentioned (or at least I didn't notice) the fair coin flip where it doesn't matter whether the coin is biased or not. It can be done in the following way:  Flip coin two times. If it ends up HT or TH, the result is the first one of the sequence. If it ends up HH or TT, continue flipping it again two times until you get HT or TH.  p(1-p) = (1-p)p   Stephen on Tuesday, August 25, 2009   Agree with Stephen. Good idea!  Disagree with SamSam: the research clearly states the coin is biased based on where it starts.  Disagree with the author: it has nothing to do with aggregate time. The precession/wobbling of the coin around it's horizontal center of gravity is what creates the bias. At least that's my reading of the research.  You're all wrong.   Anonymous Coward on Tuesday, August 25, 2009   Very nice written, very clear and contains useful link to original research...only one problem with the above that seemed to me immediately clear:  there's no  empirical data supporting it's main conclusion of a 1% bias. Not even "my friend Jim and other graduate  students tossed a coin drawn from circulation ..." With a Ph.D in probability theory from Oxford I persisted and skimmed the origianl research (I have been developing my skimming skills by working on the redacted parts of the CIA's Inspector General's report - I have become most adept at getting through the large black blanks.) Low and behold I find in the original article on page 10 the staement that no empirical data has been found to support the hypothesis.  The coins studied have been gussied up like kids  going to a party... faces painted, ribbons attached etc. Without real experiments on mature coins (those drawn from circulation), the conclusions here seems highly questionable.

Starting on H and assuming a constant spin rate & time on one side = t, the ratio of time on each side would be H t, H t:T t, H 2t:T t, H 2t:T 2t, H 3t:T*2t,...  (that's 1:0, 1:1, 2:1, 1:1, 3:2, 1:1, 4:3, 1:1, 5:4, 1:1, 6:5, 1:1, 7:6,...)  (H yoctoflips t):(T yoctoflips t) = 1:1 (50/50),  ((H yoctoflips+1) t:(T yoctoflips t) = (pretty-darned-close-to-1):1 (~50/50)  So the fewer flips, the greater the likelyhood of the coin landing with its initial face in the same state. Greater only means greater = not less than or equal to.  While I think it was fair to say the odds increased. Quantifying the increase involved voodoo & was clearly used for illustrative purposes only.  Great article! A+  and Bruce sent me, too :-)   DoNoEvil on Thursday, October 15, 2009   Great article. Although I have to say that almost every person I have ever known to do a coin-toss uses the palm invert trick to add that element of "manual randomness"  . Which ...even if every coin in a coin toss IS geared slightly biased and lands on heads more of the time, by flipping it you're now making it biased for the other side of the coin.   TribalSeth on Sunday, October 25, 2009   A trick I always use is to vigorously rub on one side for 30 seconds before using it. The heat seems to have an effect such as to land heated side down 54.3% of the time   Rich Bateson on Monday, November 23, 2009   Interesting - apart from the Physics & Mathematics involved, there are some interesting conclusions that can be drawn from Statistics - eg to do with runs of heads or tails.  But - have you done any similar analysis on dice - eg is there any bias on the die, assuming it is not intentionally biased?  As a first step, try throwing it a few tens of thousands of times (get a few friends to assist to save some time) and see if the frequency of each number (1 to 6) is the same (within the expected limits forecast from statistical theory).

Yawn.   Yawn on Monday, January 18, 2010   Nice Web   Andy on Friday, April 09, 2010   And what if the coin doesn't fall at all?  G   George on Tuesday, April 20, 2010   Coin tossing is very familiar among people of commonwealth countries, especially India, Pakistan and Australia. In these cricket crazy nations (especially India where “cricket is our religion and Sachin is our god”) cricket is very popular and coin tossing is a very decisive factor in winning. I still remember waiting anxiously for Ravi Shastri to say “Saurav Ganguly has won the toss and India will bat first”. Anyways, a very interesting article.  It is one of those articles that give us information, which produces an Aha!   Rapid Prototyping on Sunday, April 25, 2010   I'm not sure if I understand this correctly, but you say that the reason (or at least the main one) for the 1% offset in percentages when a coin is flipped and caught is because of the whole HTHTHTHTH... sequence thing? Well, in that case the probability of it ending up in a the state it started in would be  51% only if there were about 100 flips in the air. However, I'm sure the actual number of flips when you flip a coin is more than that? Has anyone measured this? In that case, the offset is probably a lot less than 1%.

You need to get a "feel" for them to be a smart and successful person.  The toss of a coin, throwing  dice and  lottery draws are all examples of  random events.  Sometimes an event can affect the next event.   Example: taking colored marbles from a bag: as you take each marble there are less marbles left in the bag, so the probabilities change.   We call those Dependent Events , because what happens depends on what happened before (learn more about this at Conditional probability ).  But otherwise they are Independent Events ...  Independent Events   Independent Events are not affected by previous events.  This is an important idea!  A coin does not "know"  it came up heads before.  And each toss of a coin is a perfect isolated thing.   Example: You toss a coin and it comes up "Heads" three times ... what is the chance that the next toss will also be a "Head"?  The chance is simply ½ (or 0.5) just like ANY toss of the coin.  What it did in the past will not affect the current toss!   Some people think "it is overdue for a Tail", but really truly the next toss of the coin is totally independent of any previous tosses.  Saying "a Tail is due", or "just one more go, my luck is due"			is called The Gambler's Fallacy   Of course your luck may change, because each toss of the coin has an equal chance.  Probability of Independent Events  "Probability" (or  "Chance") is how likely something is to happen.  So how do we calculate probability?   Probability of an event happening =  Number of ways it can happen  Total number of outcomes         Example: what is the probability of getting a "Head" when tossing a coin?  Number of ways it can happen: 1 (Head)  Total number of outcomes: 2 (Head and Tail)  So the probability =  1  2  = 0.5     Example: what is the probability of getting a "4" or "6" when rolling a die?  Number of ways it can happen: 2 ("4" and  "6")  Total number of outcomes: 6 ("1",  "2", "3",  "4", "5" and  "6")  So the probability =  2  6  =  1  3  = 0.333...   Ways of Showing Probability  Probability goes from 0 (imposssible) to 1 (certain):   It is often shown as a decimal or fraction .   Example: the probability of getting a "Head" when tossing a coin:   As a decimal: 0.5  As a fraction: 1/2  As a percentage: 50%  Or sometimes like this: 1-in-2    Two or More Events  We can calculate the chances of two or more independent events by multiplying the chances.   Example: Probability of 3 Heads in a Row  For each toss of a coin a "Head" has a probability of 0.5:   And so the chance of getting 3 Heads in a row is 0.125   So each toss of a coin  has a ½ chance of being Heads, but lots of Heads in a row is unlikely.   Example: Why is it  unlikely to get, say, 7 heads in a row, when each toss of a coin  has a ½ chance of being Heads?  Because we are asking two different questions:  Question 1:  What is the probability of 7 heads in a row?  Answer: ½×½×½×½×½×½×½ = 0.0078125 (less than 1%).  Question 2:  Given that we have just got 6 heads in a row, what is the probability   that the next toss is also a head?  Answer: ½ , as the previous tosses don't affect the next toss.   You can have a play with the Quincunx to see how lots of independent effects can still have a pattern.  Notation  We use "P" to mean "Probability Of",  So, for Independent Events:  P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)  Probability of A and B equals the probability of A times the probability of B   Example: your boss (to be fair) randomly assigns everyone an extra 2 hours work on  weekend evenings between 4 and midnight.  What are the chances you get  Saturday between 6 and 8?   Day: there are two days on the weekend, so P(Saturday) = 0.5  Time: you want the 2 hours of 6-to-8, out of the 8 hours of 4-to-midnight):  P(Your Time) = 2/8 = 0.25  And:    P(Saturday and Your Time)  = P(Saturday) × P(Your Time)      = 0.5 × 0.25      = 0.125    Or a 12.5% Chance  (Note: we could ALSO have worked out that you wanted 2 hours out of a total possible  16 hours, which is 2/16 = 0.125. Both methods work here.)   Another Example  Imagine there are two groups:   A member of each group gets randomly chosen for the winners circle,  then one of those gets randomly chosen to get the big money prize:    What is your chance of winnning the big prize?   there is a 1/5 chance of going to the winners circle  and a 1/2 chance of winning the big prize   So you have a 1/5 chance followed by a 1/2 chance ... which makes a 1/10 chance overall:  1 5 × 1 2 = 1 5 × 2 = 1 10  Or we can  calculate using decimals (1/5 is 0.2, and 1/2 is 0.5):  0.2 x 0.5 = 0.1  So your chance of winning the big money is 0.1 (which is the same as 1/10).  Coincidence!  Many "Coincidences" are, in fact,  likely.   Example:  you are in a room with 30 people, and find that Zach and Anna  celebrate their birthday on the same day.  Do you say:   "Wow, how strange !", or  "That seems reasonable, with so many people here"   In fact there is a 70% chance that would happen ... so it is likely .   Why is the chance so high?  Because you are comparing everyone to everyone else (not just one to many).  And with 30 people that is 435 comparisons    (Read Shared Birthdays to find out more.)     Example:  Snap!  Did you ever say something at exactly the same time as someone else ?  Wow, how amazing!  But you were probably sharing an experience (movie, journey, whatever) and so your thoughts were similar.  And there are only so many ways of saying something ...  ... so it is like the card game "Snap!" (also called Slaps or Slapjack) ...  ... if you speak enough words together, they will eventually match up.  So, maybe not so amazing, just simple chance at work.   Can you think of other cases where a "coincidence" was simply a likely thing?  Conclusion    Probability is: (Number of ways it can happen) / (Total number of outcomes)  Dependent Events (such as removing marbles from a bag) are affected by previous events  Independent events (such as a coin toss) are not affected by previous events  We can calculate the probability of 2 or more Independent events by multiplying  Not all coincidences are really unlikely (when you think about them).

Tossed coin    Coin flipping , coin tossing , or heads or tails is the practice of throwing a coin in the air and checking which side is showing when it lands to choose between two alternatives, sometimes to resolve a dispute between two parties. It is a form of sortition which inherently has only two possible and equally likely outcomes .

Coin flipping was known to the Romans as navia aut caput ("ship or head"), as some coins had a ship on one side and the head of the emperor on the other. [1] In England, this was referred to as cross and pile . [1] [2] The expression Heads or Tails results from heads and tails being considered complementary body parts.  Process [ edit ]  During a coin toss, the coin is thrown into the air such that it rotates edge-over-edge several times. Either beforehand or when the coin is in the air, an interested party calls "heads" or "tails", indicating which side of the coin that party is choosing. The other party is assigned the opposite side. Depending on custom, the coin may be caught; caught and inverted; or allowed to land on the ground. When the coin comes to rest, the toss is complete and the party who called correctly or was assigned the upper side is declared the winner.  It is possible for a coin to land on its edge, usually by landing up against an object (such as a shoe) or by getting stuck in the ground. However, even on a flat surface it is possible for a coin to land on its edge, with a chance of about 1 in 6000 for an American nickel. [3]  Angular momentum typically prevents most coins from landing on their edges unsupported if flipped. Such cases in which a coin does land on its edge are exceptionally rare and in most cases the coin is simply re-flipped. [4]  The coin may be any type as long as it has two distinct sides; it need not be a circulating coin as such. Larger coins tend to be more popular than smaller ones. Some high-profile coin tosses, such as the Cricket World Cup and the Super Bowl, use custom-made ceremonial medallions. [5] [6]  Three-way [ edit ]  Three-way coin flips are also possible, by a different process – this can be done either to choose two out of three, or to choose one out of three. To choose two out of three, three coins are flipped, and if two coins come up the same and one different, the different one loses (is out), leaving two players. To choose one out of three, either reverse this (the odd coin out is the winner ), or add a regular two-way coin flip between the remaining players as a second step. Note that the three-way flip is 87.5% likely to work each time it is tried (if all coins are heads or all are tails, which occurs 1/8 of the time due to the chances being 0.5 by 0.5 by 0.5, the flip is repeated until the results differ), and does not require that "heads" or "tails" be called. A famous example of such a three-way coin flip (choose two out of three) is dramatized in Friday Night Lights (originally a book , subsequently film and TV series ), where three high school football teams with identical records use a three-way coin flip – at a truck stop – to determine which two will advance to the playoffs. [7] [8] A legacy of this coin flip was to reduce the use of coin flips to break ties in Texas sports, instead using point-systems to reduce the frequency of ties.  Use in dispute resolution [ edit ]     The coin toss at the start of Super Bowl XLIII    Coin tossing is a simple and unbiased way of settling a dispute or deciding between two or more arbitrary options. In a game theoretic analysis it provides even odds to both sides involved, requiring little effort and preventing the dispute from escalating into a struggle. It is used widely in sports and other games to decide arbitrary factors such as which side of the field a team will play from, or which side will attack or defend initially; these decisions may tend to favor one side, or may be neutral. Factors such as wind direction, the position of the sun, and other conditions may affect the decision. In team sports it is often the captain who makes the call, while the umpire or referee usually oversees such proceedings. A competitive method may be used instead of a toss in some situations, for example in basketball the jump ball is employed, while the face-off plays a similar role in ice hockey.     Navy-Notre Dame coin toss    Coin flipping is used to decide which end of the field the teams will play to and/or which team gets first use of the ball, or similar questions in football matches, American football games, Australian rules football , volleyball , and other sports requiring such decisions. In the U.S. a specially minted coin is flipped in National Football League games; the coin is then sent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame , and other coins of the special series minted at the same time are sold to collectors. The XFL , a short-lived American football league, attempted to avoid coin tosses by implementing a face-off style "opening scramble," in which one player from each team tried to recover a loose football; the team whose player recovered the ball got first choice. Because of the high rate of injury in these events, it has not achieved mainstream popularity in any football league (a modified version was adopted by X-League Indoor Football , in which each player pursued his own ball), and coin tossing remains the method of choice in American football.  In an association football match, the team winning the coin toss chooses which goal to attack in the first half; the opposing team kicks off for the first half. For the second half, the teams switch ends, and the team that won the coin toss kicks off. Coin tosses are also used to decide which team has the pick of going first or second in a penalty shoot-out . Before the early-1970s introduction of the penalty shootout , coin tosses were occasionally needed to decide the outcome of tied matches. The most famous instance of this was the semifinal game of the 1968 European Championship in Italy between Italy and the Soviet Union , which finished 0-0 after extra time. Italy won, and went on to become European champions. [9]     Tossing a coin is common in many sports, such as cricket , where it is used to decide which team gets the choice of bowling or batting first. Shown are Don Bradman and Gubby Allen  tossing for innings .    In cricket the toss is often significant, as the decision whether to bat or bowl first can influence the outcome of the game. Similarly, in tennis a coin toss is used in professional matches to determine which player serves first. The player who wins the toss decides whether to serve first or return, while the loser of the toss decides which end of the court each player plays on first.  In duels a coin toss was sometimes used to determine which combatant had the sun at his back. [10] In some other sports, the result of the toss is less crucial and merely a way to fairly choose between two more or less equal options.  The National Football League also has a coin toss for tie-breaking among teams for playoff berths and seeding, but the rules make the need for coin toss, which is random rather than competitive, very unlikely. A similar procedure breaks ties for the purposes of seeding in the NFL Draft ; these coin tosses are more common, since the tie-breaking procedure for the draft is much less elaborate than the one used for playoff seeding.  Major League Baseball once conducted a series of coin flips as a contingency on the last month of its regular season to determine home teams for any potential one-game playoff games that might need to be added to the regular season. Most of these cases did not occur. From the 2009 season , the method to determine home-field advantage was changed. [11]  Fédération Internationale d'Escrime rules use a coin toss to determine the winner of a fencing match that remains tied at the end of a " sudden death " extra minute of competition. Although in most international matches this is now done electronically by the scoring apparatus. [ citation needed ]  In the United States  Asa Lovejoy and Francis W. Pettygrove , who each owned the claim to the land that would later become Portland, Oregon , wanted to name the new town after their respective hometowns of Boston, Massachusetts and Portland, Maine ; Pettygrove won the coin flip . [12]  Scientists sometimes use coin flipping to determine the order in which they appear on the list of authors of scholarly papers . [13]  Politics [ edit ]  Australia [ edit ]  In December 2006, Australian television networks Seven and Ten , which shared the broadcasting of the 2007 AFL Season , decided who would broadcast the Grand Final with the toss of a coin. Network Ten won. [ citation needed ]  Canada [ edit ]  In some jurisdictions, a coin is flipped to decide between two candidates who poll equal number of votes in an election , or two companies tendering equal prices for a project. For example, a coin toss decided a City of Toronto tender in 2003 for painting lines on 1,605 km of city streets: the bids were $161,110.00 ($100.3800623 per km), $146,584.65 ($91.33 per km, exactly), and two equal bids of $111,242.55 ($69.31 per km, exactly).  Philippines [ edit ]  " Drawing of lots " is one of the methods to break ties to determine a winner in an election; the coin flip is considered an acceptable variant. Each candidate will be given five chances to flip a coin; the candidate with the most number of "heads" wins. The 2013 mayoral election in San Teodoro, Oriental Mindoro was decided on a coin flip, with a winner being proclaimed after the second round when both candidates remained tied in the first round. [14]  United Kingdom [ edit ]  In the United Kingdom, if a local or national election has resulted in a tie where candidates receive exactly the same number of votes, then the winner can be decided either by drawing straws/lots, coin flip, or drawing a high card in pack of cards. [15] [16]  United States [ edit ]  In the United States , a coin toss determines the class of the senators of a state being added to the Union, with the new state's senators due to be entering the US Senate . [17] A number of states provide for "drawing lots" in the event an election ends in a tie - this is usually resolved by a coin toss or picking names from a hat. [18] A 2017 election to the 94th District of the Virginia House of Delegates resulted in both Republican incumbent David Yancey and Democratic challenger Shelly Simmonds tied with exactly 11,608 votes. Under state law, the election was to be decided by drawing a name from a bowl, although a coin toss would also have been an acceptable option. The chair of the Board of Elections drew the film canister with Yancey's name, and he was declared the winner. [19] Additionally, the outcome of the draw determined control of the entire House, as Republicans won 50 of the other 99 seats and Democrats 49. A Yancey win extended the Republican advantage to 51-49, whereas a Simmonds win would have resulted in a 50-50 tie. As there is no provision for breaking ties in the House as a whole, this would have forced a power sharing agreement between the two parties. [20]  Physics [ edit ]  The outcome of coin flipping has been studied by Persi Diaconis and his collaborators. They have demonstrated that a mechanical coin flipper which imparts the same initial conditions for every toss has a highly predictable outcome – the phase space is fairly regular. Further, in actual flipping, people exhibit slight bias – "coin tossing is fair to two decimals but not to three. That is, typical flips show biases such as .495 or .503." [21]  In studying coin flipping, to observe the rotation speed of coin flips, Diaconis first used a strobe light and a coin with one side painted black, the other white, so that when the speed of the strobe flash equaled the rotation rate of the coin, it would appear to always show the same side. This proved difficult to use, and rotation rate was more accurately computed by attaching floss to a coin, such that it would wind around the coin – after a flip, one could count rotations by unwinding the floss, and then compute rotation rate as flips over air time. [21]  Moreover, their theoretical analysis of the physics of coin tosses predicts a slight bias for a caught coin to be caught the same way up as it was thrown, with a probability of around 0.51, [22] though a subsequent attempt to verify this experimentally gave ambiguous results. [23] Stage magicians and gamblers, with practice, are able to greatly increase this bias, whilst still making throws which are visually indistinguishable from normal throws. [21]  Since the images on the two sides of actual coins are made of raised metal, the toss is likely to slightly favor one face or the other if the coin is allowed to roll on one edge upon landing. Coin spinning is much more likely to be biased than flipping, and conjurers trim the edges of coins so that when spun they usually land on a particular face.  Counterintuitive properties [ edit ]  Human intuition about conditional probability is often very poor and can give rise to some seemingly surprising observations. For example, if the successive tosses of a coin are recorded as a string of "H" and "T", then for any trial of tosses, it is twice as likely that the triplet TTH will occur before THT than after it. It is three times as likely that THH will precede HHT, than that THH will follow HHT. [24] (See Penney's game )  Mathematics [ edit ]  The mathematical abstraction of the statistics of coin flipping is described by means of the Bernoulli process ; a single flip of a coin is a Bernoulli trial . In the study of statistics, coin-flipping plays the role of being an introductory example of the complexities of statistics. A commonly treated textbook topic is that of checking if a coin is fair .  Telecommunications [ edit ]  Further information: Commitment scheme  There is no reliable way to use a true coin flip to settle a dispute between two parties if they cannot both see the coin—for example, over the phone. The flipping party could easily lie about the outcome of the toss. In telecommunications and cryptography , the following algorithm can be used:   Alice and Bob each choose a random string, "ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd" and "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd" respectively.  Alice chooses an outcome for an imaginary coin flip, such as "tail"  Bob sends Alice his random string "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd"  Alice immediately computes a cryptographic hash of the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd gfdgdfjkherfsfsd", which is 59dea408d43183a3937957e71a4bcacc616d9cbc and sends it to Bob  Alice asks Bob: "heads or tails"?  Bob says, for instance, "heads".  Alice tells him she's just won, and proves it by showing the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd gfdgdfjkherfsfsd".  Bob can check that Alice didn't lie by computing the SHA-1 of the string himself  Furthermore, Bob by providing his own randomly generated string guarantees that Alice wasn't able to precompute an image pair of "tail/random string" or "head/random string".   Lotteries [ edit ]  The New Zealand  lottery game Big Wednesday uses a coin toss. If a player matches all 6 of their numbers, the coin toss will decide whether they win a cash jackpot (minimum of NZ$25,000) or a bigger jackpot with luxury prizes (minimum of NZ$2 million cash, plus value of luxury prizes.) The coin toss is also used in determining the Second Chance winner's prize.  Clarifying feelings [ edit ]  A technique attributed to Sigmund Freud to help in making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What I want you to do is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to make up your mind and come to the right decision." [25]  Danish poet Piet Hein 's book Grooks includes a poem on a similar theme:   A Psychological Tip  Whenever you're called on to make up your mind, And you're hampered by not having any, The best way to solve the dilemma, you'll find, Is simply by spinning a penny. No—not so that chance shall decide the affair While you're passively standing there moping; But the moment the penny is up in the air, You suddenly know what you're hoping.

Prerequisites  Distributions , Basic Probability , Variability  Learning Objectives  Define binomial outcomes  Compute the probability of getting X successes in N trials  Compute cumulative binomial probabilities  Find the mean and standard deviation of a binomial distribution    When you flip a coin, there are two possible outcomes: 
                heads and tails. Each outcome has a fixed probability, the same 
                from trial to trial. In the case of coins, heads and tails each 
                have the same probability of 1/2. More generally, there are situations 
                in which the coin is biased, so that heads and tails have different 
                probabilities. In the present section, we consider probability 
                distributions for which there are just two possible outcomes with 
                fixed probabilities summing to one. These distributions are called binomial 
                distributions .  A Simple Example  The four possible outcomes that could occur if you 
                flipped a coin twice are listed below in Table 1. Note that the 
                four outcomes are equally likely: each has probability 1/4. To 
                see this, note that the tosses of the coin are independent (neither 
                affects the other). Hence, the probability of a head on Flip 1 
                and a head on Flip 2 is the product of P(H) and P(H), which is 
                1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4. The same calculation applies to the probability 
                of a head on Flip 1 and a tail on Flip 2. Each is 1/2 x 1/2 
                = 1/4.    Table 1. Four Possible Outcomes.    Outcome  First Flip  Second Flip    1  Heads  Heads    2  Heads  Tails    3  Tails  Heads    4  Tails  Tails     The four possible outcomes can be classified
                in  terms of the number of heads that come up. The number could
                be  two (Outcome 1), one (Outcomes 2 and 3) or 0 (Outcome 4).
                The  probabilities of these possibilities are shown in Table
                2 and  in Figure 1. Since two of the outcomes represent the case
                in which  just one head appears in the two tosses, the probability
                of this  event is equal to 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Table 2 summarizes
                the situation.     Table 2. Probabilities of Getting 0, 1, or 2 Heads.    Number of Heads  Probability    0  1/4    1  1/2    2  1/4        Figure 1. Probabilities of 0, 1, and 2 
                      heads.   Figure 1 is a discrete probability distribution: 
                It shows the probability for each of the values on the X-axis. 
                Defining a head as a "success," Figure 1 shows the probability 
                of 0, 1, and 2 successes for two trials (flips) for an event that 
                has a probability of 0.5 of being a success on each trial. This 
                makes Figure 1 an example of a binomial distribution .  The Formula for Binomial Probabilities  The binomial distribution consists of the probabilities
                 of each of the possible numbers of successes on N trials for
                independent  events that each have a probability of π 
                (the Greek letter pi) of occurring. For the coin flip example,
                 N = 2 and π = 0.5. The formula for 
                the binomial distribution is shown below:   where P(x) is the probability of x successes out 
                of N trials, N is the number of trials, and π 
                is the probability of success on a given trial. Applying this 
                to the coin flip example,    If you flip a coin twice, what is the probability 
                of getting one or more heads? Since the probability of getting 
                exactly one head is 0.50 and the probability of getting exactly 
                two heads is 0.25, the probability of getting one or more heads 
                is 0.50 + 0.25 = 0.75.  Now suppose that the coin is biased. The probability 
                of heads is only 0.4. What is the probability of getting heads 
                at least once in two tosses? Substituting into the general formula 
                above, you should obtain the answer .64.  Cumulative Probabilities  We toss a coin 12 times. What is the probability 
                that we get from 0 to 3 heads? The answer is found by computing 
                the probability of exactly 0 heads, exactly 1 head, exactly 2 
                heads, and exactly 3 heads. The probability of getting from 0 
                to 3 heads is then the sum of these probabilities. The probabilities 
                are: 0.0002, 0.0029, 0.0161, and 0.0537. The sum of the probabilities 
                is 0.073. The calculation of cumulative binomial probabilities 
                can be quite tedious. Therefore we have provided a binomial calculator 
                to make it easy to calculate these probabilities.  Binomial
              Calculator  Mean and Standard Deviation of Binomial Distributions  Consider a coin-tossing experiment in which you 
                tossed a coin 12 times and recorded the number of heads. If you 
                performed this experiment over and over again, what would the 
                mean number of heads be? On average, you would expect half the 
                coin tosses to come up heads. Therefore the mean number of heads 
                would be 6. In general, the mean of a binomial distribution with 
                parameters N (the number of trials) and π 
                (the probability of success on each trial) is:  μ = Nπ  where μ is the mean 
                of the binomial distribution. The variance of the binomial distribution 
                is:  σ 2 = Nπ(1-π)  where σ 2 is the variance of the binomial distribution.  Let's return to the coin-tossing experiment. The 
                coin was tossed 12 times, so N = 12. A coin has a probability of 
                0.5 of coming up heads. Therefore, π 
                = 0.5. The mean and variance can therefore be computed 
                as follows:  μ = Nπ = (12)(0.5) = 6 σ 2 = Nπ(1-π) = 
                (12)(0.5)(1.0 - 0.5) = 3.0.  Naturally, the standard deviation (σ) 
              is the square root of the variance (σ 2 ).

Game Theory (Part 9)  John Baez  Last time we talked about independence of a pair of outcomes, but we can easily go on and talk about independence of a longer sequence of outcomes.  For example, suppose we have three coins.   Suppose:   the 1st coin has probability \( p_H\) of landing heads up and \( p_T\) of landing tails up;  the 2nd coin has probability \( q_H\) of landing heads up and \( q_T\) of landing tails up;  the 3rd coin has probability \( r_H\) of landing heads up and \( r_T\) of landing tails up.   Suppose we flip all of these coins: the 1st, then the 2nd, then the 3rd.  What's the probability that we get this sequence of results: \( (H, T, T)\) If the coin flips are independent , the probability is just this product: \( p_H \, q_T \, r_T \) See the pattern?  We just multiply the probabilities.  And there's nothing special about coins here, or the number three . We could flip a coin, roll a die, pick a card, and see if it's raining outside. For example, what's the probability that we get heads with our coin, the number 6 on our die, an ace of spades with our cards, and it's raining? If these outcomes are independent , we just calculate: the probability that we get heads, times
the probability that we roll a 6, times
the probability that we get an ace of spades, times
the probability that it's raining outside. Let's solve some puzzles using this idea! Three flips of a fair coin Example 1. Suppose you have a fair coin: this means it has a 50% chance of landing heads up and a 50% chance of landing tails up.  Suppose you flip it three times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up, then tails up, then heads up? We're asking about the probability of this outcome: \( (H, T, H)\) Since the flips are independent this is \( p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H \, p_T \, p_H \) Since the coin is fair we have \( \displaystyle{ p_H = p_T = \frac{1}{2} } \) so \(  \displaystyle{ p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} } \) So the answer is 1/8, or 12.5%. Example 2. In the same situation, what's the probability that the coin lands heads up exactly twice? There are 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 outcomes that can happen: \( (H,H,H) \)
\( (H,H,T), \; (H,T,H), \; (T,H,H) \)
\( (H,T,T), \; (T,H,T), \; (T,T,H) \)
\( (T,T,T) \) We can work out the probability of each of these outcomes.  For example, we've already seen that \( (H,T,H)\) is \( \displaystyle{ p_{(H,T,H)} = p_H p_T p_H = \frac{1}{8} }\) since the coin is fair and the flips are independent.  In fact, all 8 probabilities work out the same way.  We always get 1/8.  In other words, each of the 8 outcomes is equally likely! But we're interested in the probability that we get exactly two heads.  That's the probability of this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) Using the rule we saw in Part 7 , this probability is \( \displaystyle{ p(S) = p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} = 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) So the answer is 3/8, or 37.5%. I could have done this a lot faster.  I could say "there are 8 outcomes that can happen, each equally likely, and three that give us two heads, so the probability is 3/8."   But I wanted to show you how we're just following rules we've already seen! Three flips of a very unfair coin Example 3. Now suppose we have an unfair coin with a 90% chance of landing heads up and 10% chance of landing tails up!  What's the probability that if we flip it three times, it lands heads up exactly twice?  Again let's assume the coin flips are independent. Most of the calculation works exactly the same way, but now our coin has \( \displaystyle{ p_H = 0.9, \quad p_T = 0.1 } \) We're interested in the outcomes where the coin comes up heads twice, so we look at this subset: \( S = \{ (T,H,H), (H,T,H), (H,H,T) \} \) The probability of this subset is \( \begin{array}{ccl} p(S) &=& p_{(T,H,H)} + p_{(H,T,H)} + p_{(H,H,T)} \\  &=& p_T \, p_H  \, p_H + p_H \, p_T \, p_H + p_H \, p_H \, p_T \\ &=& 3 p_T p_H^2 \\ &=& 3 \times 0.1 \times 0.9^2 \\ &=& 0.3 \times 0.81 \\ &=& 0.243 \end{array}\) So now the probability is just 24.3%. Six flips of a fair coin Example 4. Suppose you have a fair coin.  Suppose you flip it six times and these flips are independent.  What is the probability that it lands heads up exactly twice? We did a similar problem already, where we flipped the coin three times.  Go back and look at that if you forget!  The answer to that problem was \( \displaystyle{ 3 \times \frac{1}{8} }\) Why?  Here's why: there were 3 ways to get two heads when you flipped 3 coins, and each of these outcomes had probability \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} }\) We can do our new problem the same way.  Count the number of ways to get two heads when we flip six coins.  Then multiply this by \( \displaystyle{ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = \frac{1}{64} }\) The hard part is to count how many ways we can get two heads when we flip six coins.  To get good at probabilities, we have to get good at counting.  It's boring to list all the outcomes we're trying to count: (H,H,T,T,T,T), (H,T,H,T,T,T), (H,T,T,H,T,T), ... So let's try to come up with a better idea. We have to pick 2 out of our 6 flips to be H's.  How many ways are there to do this? There are 6 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, and then 5 ways left over to pick another and draw a blue H on it... letting the rest be T's.  For example: (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, we've got 6 × 5 = 30 choices.  But we don't really care which H is red and which H is blue—that's just a trick to help us solve the problem.  For example, we don't want to count (T, H , T, T, H , T) as different from (T, H , T, T, H , T) So, there aren't really 30 ways to get two heads.  There are only half as many!  There are 15 ways. So, the probability of getting two heads when we flip the coin six times is \( \displaystyle{ 15 \times \frac{1}{64} = \frac{15}{64} \approx .234 } \) where the squiggle means 'approximately'.  So: about 23.4%. Binomial coefficients Now for some jargon, which will help when we do harder problems like this.  We say there are 6 choose 2 ways to choose 2 out of 6 things, and we write this as \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2} } \) This sort of number is called a binomial coefficient . We've just shown that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{6}{2}  = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15 }\) Why write it like this funky fraction: \( \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1}\)?  Because it'll help us see the pattern for doing harder problems like this! Nine flips of a fair coin If we flip a fair coin 9 times, and the flips are independent, what's the probability that we get heads exactly 6 times? This works just like the last problem, only the numbers are bigger.  So, I'll do it faster! When we flip the coin 9 times there are \( 2^9\) possible outcomes that can happen.   Each of these is equally likely if it's a fair coin and the flips are independent.  So each has probability \( \displaystyle{  \frac{1}{2^9} } \) To get the answer, we need to multiply this by the number of ways we can get heads exactly 6 times.  This number is called '9 choose 6' or \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6}  }\) for short.  It's the number of ways we can choose 6 things out of a collection of 9. So we just need to know: what's 9 choose 6?  We can work this out as before.  There are 9 ways to pick one of the flips and draw a red H on it, then 8 ways left to pick another and draw a blue H on it, and 7 ways left to pick a third and draw a orange H on it.  That sounds like 9 × 8 × 7. But we've overcounted!   After all, we don't care about the colors.  We don't care about the difference between this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) and this: (T, H , T, T, H , T, T, H , T) In fact we've counted each possibility 6 times!  Why six?   The first H could be red, green or blue — that's 3 choices.  But then the second H could be either of the two remaining 2 colors... and for the third, we just have 1 choice.  So there are 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways to permute the colors. So, the actual number of ways to get 6 heads out of 9 coin flips is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) In other words: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} } \) To get the answer to our actual problem, remember we need to multiply \( 1/2^9\) by this.  So the answer is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6} }\) If you're a pure mathematician, you can say you're done now.  But normal people won't understand this answer, so let's calculate it out.  I hope you know the first ten powers of two: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.  So: \( \displaystyle{ 2^9 = 512 }\) I hope you can also do basic arithmetic like this: \( \displaystyle{ \binom{9}{6} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84} \) So, the probability of getting 6 heads when you do 9 independent flips of a fair coin is \( \displaystyle{ \frac{1}{2^9} \times \binom{9}{6}  = \frac{84}{512} = 0.164025 } \) or 16.4025%. I broke down and used a calculator at the last step.   We're becoming serious nerds here. Okay, that's enough for now.  We've been counting how many ways we can get a certain number of heads from a certain number of coin flips.  What we're realy doing is taking a set of coin flips, say \( n\) of them, and choosing a subset of \( k\) of them to be heads.  So, we say Definition. The binomial coefficient  \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} } \) called \( n\) choose \( k,\) is the number of ways of choosing a subset of \( k\) things from a set of \( n\) things. We have seen in some examples that \( \displaystyle{ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots 1} } \) Here there's a product of \( k\) consecutive numbers on top, and \( k\) on bottom too.  We didn't prove this is true in general, but it's not hard to see, using the tricks we've used already.

Sunday, March 29, 2009  Have you ever flipped a coin as a way of deciding something with another person? The answer is probably yes. And you probably did so assuming you were getting a fair deal, because, as everybody knows, a coin is equally likely to show heads or tails after a single flip—unless it's been shaved or weighted or has a week-old smear of coffee on its underbelly.   So when your friend places a coin on his thumb and says "call it in the air", you realize that it doesn't really matter whether you pick heads or tails. Every person has a preference, of course—heads or tails might feel "luckier" to you—but logically the chances are equal.  Or are they?   Granted, everybody knows that newly-minted coins are born with tiny imperfections, minute deviations introduced by the fabrication process. Everybody knows that, over time, a coin will wear and tear, picking up scratches, dings, dents, bacteria, and finger-grease. And everybody knows that these imperfections can affect the physics of the coin flip, biasing the results by some infinitesimal amount which in practice we ignore.  But let's assume that's not the case.  Let's assume the coin is fabricated perfectly, down to the last vigintillionth of a yoctometer . And, since it's possible to train one's thumb to flip a coin such that it comes up heads or tails a huge percentage of the time, let's assume the person flipping the coin isn't a magician or a prestidigitator. In other words, let's assume both a perfect coin and an honest toss, such as the kind you might make with a friend to decide who pays for lunch.  In that case there's an absolute right and wrong answer to the age-old question...  Heads or tails?  ...because the two outcomes of a typical coin flip are not equally likely.  The 50-50 proposition is actually more of a 51-49 proposition, if not worse. The sacred coin flip exhibits (at minimum) a whopping 1% bias , and possibly much more. 1% may not sound like a lot, but it's more than the typical casino edge in a game of blackjack or slots. What's more, you can take advantage of this little-known fact to give yourself an edge in all future coin-flip battles.  The Physics of Coin Flipping  In the 31-page Dynamical Bias in the Coin Toss , Persi Diaconis, Susan Holmes, and Richard Montgomery lay out the theory and practice of coin-flipping to a degree that's just, well, downright intimidating.   Suffice to say their approach involved a lot of physics, a lot of math, motion-capture cameras, random experimentation, and an automated "coin-flipper" device capable of flipping a coin and producing Heads 100% of the time.   Here are the broad strokes of their research:   If the coin is tossed and caught , it has about a 51% chance of landing on the same face it was launched. (If it starts out as heads, there's a 51% chance it will end as heads).  If the coin is spun, rather than tossed , it can have a much-larger-than-50% chance of ending with the heavier side down. Spun coins can exhibit "huge bias" (some spun coins will fall tails-up 80% of the time).  If the coin is tossed and allowed to clatter to the floor , this probably adds randomness.  If the coin is tossed and allowed to clatter to the floor where it spins , as will sometimes happen, the above spinning bias probably comes into play.  A coin will land on its edge around 1 in 6000 throws , creating a flipistic singularity .  The same initial coin-flipping conditions produce the same coin flip result . That is, there's a certain amount of determinism to the coin flip.  A more robust coin toss (more revolutions) decreases the bias .   The 51% figure in Premise 1 is a bit curious and, when I first saw it, I assumed it was a minor bias introduced by the fact that the "heads" side of the coin has more decoration than the "tails" side, making it heavier. But it turns out that this sort of imbalance has virtually no effect unless you spin the coin on its edge, in which case you'll see a huge bias. The reason a typical coin toss is 51-49 and not 50-50 has nothing to do with the asymmetry of the coin and everything to do with the aggregate amount of time the coin spends in each state, as it flips through space.  A good way of thinking about this is by looking at the ratio of odd numbers to even numbers when you start counting from 1.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17  No matter how long you count, you'll find that at any given point, one of two things will be true:   You've touched more odd numbers than even numbers  You've touched an equal amount of odd numbers and even numbers   What will never happen, is this:   You've touched more even numbers than odd numbers.   Similarly, consider a coin, launched in the "heads" position, flipping heads over tails through the ether:  H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H  At any given point in time, either the coin will have spent equal time in the Heads and Tails states, or it will have spent more time in the Heads state. In the aggregate, it's slightly more likely that the coin shows Heads at a given point in time—including whatever time the coin is caught. And vice-versa if you start the coin-flip from the Tails position.  The Strategy of Coin Flipping  Unlike the article on the edge in a game of blackjack mentioned previously, I've never seen a description of "coin flipping strategy" which takes the above science into count. When it's a true 50-50 toss, there is no strategy. But if we take it as granted, or at least possible, that a coin flip does indeed exhibit a 1% or more bias, then the following rules of thumb might apply.   Always be the chooser, if possible . This allows you to leverage Premise 1 or Premise 2 for those extra percentage points.  Always be the tosser , if you can. This protects you from virtuoso coin-flippers who are able to leverage Premise 6 to produce a desired outcome. It also protects you against the added randomness (read: fairness) introduced by flippers who will occasionally, without rhyme or reason, invert the coin in their palm before revealing. Tricksy Hobbitses.  Don't allow the same person to both toss and choose . Unless, of course, that person is you.  If the coin is being tossed, and you're the chooser, always choose the side that's initially face down . According to Premise 1, you'd always choose the side that's initially face up, but most people, upon flipping a coin, will invert it into their other palm before revealing. Hence, you choose the opposite side, but you get the same 1% advantage. Of course, if you happen to know that a particular flipper doesn't do this, use your better judgment.  If you are the tosser but not the chooser, sometimes invert the coin into your other palm after catching, and sometimes don't . This protects you against people who follow Rule 4 blindly by assuming you'll either invert the coin or you won't.  If the coin is being spun rather than tossed , always choose whichever side is lightest . On a typical coin, the "Heads" side of the coin will have more "stuff" engraved on it, causing Tails to show up more frequently than it should. Choosing Tails in this situation is usually the power play.  Never under any circumstances agree to a coin spin if you're not the chooser . This opens you up to a devastating attack if your opponent is aware of Premise 2.   I hope I've made it clear that none of this is really to be taken seriously. The point is that adding even 1% of wobble to a situation of pure chance can create a lot of additional complexity, and that in turn, can create strategy where none existed before.  Tags: probability , coin flipping    54 comment(s)   Great little article. I very much enjoyed this.  I would add to your "coin flip strategy" that if you suspect you're facing a "virtuoso tosser" and he won't let you do the toss, make him toss it on the ground.  Cheers.   Heads I Win Tails You Lose on Sunday, March 29, 2009   Lol. Interesting.  I may be mistaken here, but I believe your term "one vigintillionth of a yoctometer" is below the Plank length, making it so small as to be meaningless. Been a while since I looked at this stuff (college in fact) but...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length   Anonymous Coward on Sunday, March 29, 2009   that's the point.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, October 17, 2011   Awesome article. Really enjoyed reading it and having a break from the indepth computer science. Thanks.   Poker Forums on Monday, March 30, 2009   One vigintillionth of a yoctometer? Major phail! If we're throwing away practical concerns, we should atleast adhere to realm of the theoretically possible.  Jokes aside, nice article. For a moment, I was thinking that, even given your explanation of the inherent bias, it doesn't make sense since the coin would never land in the position it started at without flipping, as that would really be an invalid flip. But then, I guess all you do is move the minimum number of flips ahead to 2 or 3, and the state of the coin there is your new "initial" state, and you can set up the same argument. Nice.  However, I wonder what the case would be if one started the coin at a half-flip, on its edge? You might say that the initial face would correspond to the next face to show up after it performs a half-flip. But instead of a half-flip, what if you had just behind a half-flip? What about a quarter flip? I don't know a good line of reasoning to take care of these cases, it almost seems arbitrary.  And of course, it's totally pointless too. But who cares, interesting nonetheless!   ehsanul on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   [i]>One vigintillionth of a yoctometer? Major phail! If we're throwing away practical concerns, we should at least adhere to realm of the theoretically possible.[/i]  Yes, major fail. Guilty! But more memorable than "down to the last molecule/nanometer/etc". I got the idea for the phrase from Neal Stephenson's book in which the villain has a knife with an edge "one molecule wide".  If you managed to flip the coin from the edge position (let E represent the edge state):  E H E T E H E T E H E T E H E T E H E T E H  I still think the sequence exhibits the clumping shown above, because the coin spends only a tiny fraction of its time in those E states (it's really only in E when it's perfectly vertical). Because the aggregate time in E is so small, the probabilities would still favor whatever state immediately followed the initial E state (in this case, heads). At least, it seems you could make the argument.   Coding the Wheel on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Another strategy. If not obvious:   If you are the tosser, and not the chooser, flip the coin into your palm after the toss only if they pick the face up side.    James R on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   You missed an important strategy.  I used to earn lunch money in high school thusly:
I could flip a coin to come out "heads" about 90% of the time (with practice, same as knife throwing, control # of flips through the air during a certain time between flip and catch).  Anyhow, I flip, you call while in the air.
I catch and you most always lose because after you call it in the air, I choose to catch, or catch and invert (your #5. above). You assume it was fair because you called it in the air. No one ever figured out what I was doing (or I would have been beaten up!).   Comfortable on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Persi Diaconis is also the guy who did the (often-misquoted) research into how many times you should shuffle a deck of cards.   bmm6o on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   So, to paraphrase Vizzini:  "But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you: are you the sort of man who would put the coin into his own hand or his enemy's? Now, a clever man would put the coin into his own hand, because he would know that only a great fool would request to make the call. I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the side facing up. But you must have known I was not a great fool, you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the side facing down."  But we all know how Vizzini ended up. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha...   Anonymous Coward on Tuesday, March 31, 2009   Just found your blog and have read quite a few of your posts - excellent job.  I think you're explanation of why it's 51% is suspect however.  In fact the paper does show that a coin flipped without precession does have a 50/50 chance (even though your H T H T H T H argument would still apply).  But with precession the coin will spend a greater frequency of it's time in the starting position (in fact with enough precession it will appear to flip but be 100% in the up position - alas I can not seem to master that).  If you take a coin and manually flip it end over end while precessing it at the same time you can kind of visualize this.  In the case without precession it's irrelevant that it starts as heads or tails.  What's relevant is that after flipping the coin spends equal amounts of time in the air in both states.  Again with precession this is not true.  Apparently their experiments showed that a typical coin flip done by hand precesses enough to give the 1% bias.   Anonymous Coward on Saturday, April 04, 2009   How did you get the 1 in 6000 figure for ending up on it's edge?  Seems low to my thinking. BTW, happened to me, a long time ago over who buys the next pitcher of beer.  I never met anyone else who has seen a coin land on its edge.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, April 06, 2009   [i]>I think you're explanation of why it's 51% is suspect however. In fact the paper does show that[/i]  You're right. The entire argument is an oversimplification.  [i]>How did you get the 1 in 6000 figure for ending up on it's edge?[/i]  That figure was for a nickel and I think it would be less for other coins. It was buried on page 10 of [url=http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~susan/papers/headswithJ.pdf]Dynamical Bias in the Coin Toss[/url] which references [url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993PhRvE..48.2547M]the original research[/url]. There's also some other [url=http://www.google.com/search?q=coin+landing+on+edge]research[/url] on this.   Coding the Wheel on Monday, April 06, 2009   A couple days ago I flipped a coin (nickel) and it landed, rolled, and stayed on edge. It was a new nickel and a flat (glass) table but it happened.  One of the more interesting "light reading" posts I've come across in weeks.   jzx on Wednesday, April 08, 2009   I'm neither a mathematician nor a physicist, having found my way here via the link from Freakonomics (I suppose I should say I'm not an economist either), but I think the HTHT analysis would lead to a conclusion opposite to the one given here.  If we assume that the coin is in fact flipped, and not simply "moved from Point A to Point B by a process that may or may not involve flipping," then isn't it correct to deem the initial state of a flipped coin as being 180 degrees revolved from its state in the flipper's hand? If so (and that seems right to me), the HTHT analysis leads to the conclusion that the side of the coin more likely to be up at the end of the flip is the side that was down in the flipper's hands.   DBH on Thursday, April 16, 2009   I would appreciate a strategy for Two-up
Two-up is a traditional Australian gambling game, involving a designated 'Spinner' throwing two coins into the air. Traditionally, these coins are pennies. Incidentally, their weight size and surface design make them ideal for the game. Weight and size make them stable on the 'kip' and easy to spin in the air. Decimal coins are generally considered to be too small and light and they don't 'fly' so well. The design of pennies that date pre 1939 had the soveriegns head on the obverse(front) and the reverse was totally covered in writing making the result very easy and quick to see. Pennies can often be obseved being used at games on Anzac Day, they are and brought out specifically for the purpose each year.  Players gamble on whether the coins will fall with both (obverse) heads up, both (reverse) tails up, or with one coin a head, and one a tail (known as 'Odds'). It is traditionally played on ANZAC Day in pubs and clubs throughout Australia, in part to mark a shared experience with Diggers through the ages.   Pablo Uribe on Monday, April 27, 2009   "Let's assume the coin is fabricated perfectly, down to the last vigintillionth of a yoctometer."  Its not. The research is highly biased based on the perfect flip and the coin not being a perfect coin.  On top of this, the coin may be flipped 500 million times showing a 51-49, but you could flip it 1 trillion times resulting in 50-50.  If I gave Sally half my meal, am I left with 49% or 50%? Yeah...  If anything, its more likely the coin has a 49.99999999....-49.9999999 probability, giving room for the randomness of variables like the blatant bias in this research.   Anonymous Coward on Friday, July 31, 2009   Impresive reasearch man...   John on Monday, August 03, 2009   The aggregate time hypothesis doesn't work. If you just shift the frame to the, say, third flip in the air - since it's highly unlikely that the coin will land before it's third flip - you'll get the same argument reversed. I.e., if I start with heads, let it flip 3 times with tails up, and then start counting aggregate time, I'll get a THTHTHTHT... pattern and tails will now win 51% of the time.   Nyet on Monday, August 24, 2009   I used to work with a guy who was sure that coins had memory.  To him if you had a fair coin and you flipped it 100 times and got heads the odds would be better that you would get a tail on the next flip.  No matter how I explained it to him he would not believe that it was still 50/50.  I asked him how the coin "remembered what it's last 100 flips were?"   Sitelinker on Monday, August 24, 2009   Not a single Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead reference? For shame!  "A weaker man might be moved to re-examine his faith, if in nothing else at least in the law of probability."  Fascinating piece, by the way.   Anonymous Coward on Monday, August 24, 2009   I'm afraid that the HTHTH... argument appears to me to be completely bogus.  The only reason that there might be one more heads is that you decided to start counting on heads. Why did you start counting on heads? Because that was what was showing in the beginning, when it was resting on the thumb.  But you could equally argue that that is the very worst place to start counting. A coin flip isn't a coin flip if it doesn't leave the thumb. Indeed, it has to have at least one flip. Therefore, it is completely impossible that the first H would ever be counted.  So you could make an equally good argument saying  [quote]Similarly, consider a coin, launched in the "heads" position, flipping heads over tails through the ether. After the first flip, naturally, it will be on Tails:  T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T H T  At any given point in time, either the coin will have spent equal time in the Heads and Tails states, or it will have spent more time in the Tails state.[/quote]  This argument sounds just as reasonable as the first one, if not more so, which implies to me that the whole argument doesn't work.  Note that if this [b]did[/b] make sense, then the coin would show a bias of much, much more than 51%, because the coin would have to flip at least 100 times before the effect of that "first side" bias, were it true, was as low as 1%. Since most coin flips are under 100 flips, the "first side" bias by your argument would be much higher (in your example, 52% of the options are Heads).   SamSam on Monday, August 24, 2009   [i]>Not a single Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead reference? For shame![/i]  I thought long and hard about it. Seriously.

[/i]  Yes. Excellent points. The thing is, the "HTHTH" argument was a simplification (mentioned briefly in the post & comments above) ie a way of thinking about how the coin is spending its time in the aggregate, not necessarily meant to be an accurate portrayal of the physics. For example, if you flip the coin for say 1.5 revolutions it's obviously not approximating 51-49. This was a device, but an innocent one.   Coding the Wheel on Monday, August 24, 2009   [i]>The thing is, the "HTHTH" argument was a simplification (mentioned briefly in the post & comments above) ie a way of thinking about how the coin is spending its time in the aggregate[/i]  Yes, but you do specifically say that the reason (according to you) that the coin spends more of its time on "Heads" is that there are more H's then T's in your sequence, and that this is because you started with "H."  Simplification or not, this is fundamentally a wrong way to look at it, as several people have said. The problem with your approach is that it all depends on where you start counting, and you can pick wherever you want depending on what you want to prove, which is not good physics. The article doesn't suggest your explanation.  Although the article doesn't appear to suggest any explanation, a better explanation of the idea that the coin spends more time on one face than the other "in aggregate" would be one where this really is displayed where ever you start counting from. For example, the following argument, though not necessarily true, displays this property:  [quote]"Due to the asymmetry of flipping, the coin spends more time in the 360 degree flipped position than the 180 degree flipped position. If we write out the sequence showing what face is showing at time T, with the dT between values being 0.01 s, it would look like  ....2211111122211111222111111222...  as you can see, it spends more time on the first face ("1") than the second, so is more likely to be caught when displaying the first face."[/quote]  This argument, while probably incorrect and not supported by the article, at least is an explanation that doesn't depend on whether you start counting when the coin being on your thumb or after the first flip.   SamSam on Monday, August 24, 2009   I'm surprised no one mentioned (or at least I didn't notice) the fair coin flip where it doesn't matter whether the coin is biased or not. It can be done in the following way:  Flip coin two times. If it ends up HT or TH, the result is the first one of the sequence. If it ends up HH or TT, continue flipping it again two times until you get HT or TH.  p(1-p) = (1-p)p   Stephen on Tuesday, August 25, 2009   Agree with Stephen. Good idea!  Disagree with SamSam: the research clearly states the coin is biased based on where it starts.  Disagree with the author: it has nothing to do with aggregate time. The precession/wobbling of the coin around it's horizontal center of gravity is what creates the bias. At least that's my reading of the research.  You're all wrong.   Anonymous Coward on Tuesday, August 25, 2009   Very nice written, very clear and contains useful link to original research...only one problem with the above that seemed to me immediately clear:  there's no  empirical data supporting it's main conclusion of a 1% bias. Not even "my friend Jim and other graduate  students tossed a coin drawn from circulation ..." With a Ph.D in probability theory from Oxford I persisted and skimmed the origianl research (I have been developing my skimming skills by working on the redacted parts of the CIA's Inspector General's report - I have become most adept at getting through the large black blanks.) Low and behold I find in the original article on page 10 the staement that no empirical data has been found to support the hypothesis.  The coins studied have been gussied up like kids  going to a party... faces painted, ribbons attached etc. Without real experiments on mature coins (those drawn from circulation), the conclusions here seems highly questionable.

Robert on Tuesday, September 15, 2009   James, your article was briefly referenced in the September 15, 2009 issue of Bruce Schneier's Crypto-Gram, which may generate some renewed interest. In fact, that's probably what drew Robert here.  There's also a discussion of your Physics of Coin Flipping explanation in the Science, Mathematics, Medicine, and Technology forum of the James Randi Educational Foundation website.

Starting on H and assuming a constant spin rate & time on one side = t, the ratio of time on each side would be H t, H t:T t, H 2t:T t, H 2t:T 2t, H 3t:T*2t,...  (that's 1:0, 1:1, 2:1, 1:1, 3:2, 1:1, 4:3, 1:1, 5:4, 1:1, 6:5, 1:1, 7:6,...)  (H yoctoflips t):(T yoctoflips t) = 1:1 (50/50),  ((H yoctoflips+1) t:(T yoctoflips t) = (pretty-darned-close-to-1):1 (~50/50)  So the fewer flips, the greater the likelyhood of the coin landing with its initial face in the same state. Greater only means greater = not less than or equal to.  While I think it was fair to say the odds increased. Quantifying the increase involved voodoo & was clearly used for illustrative purposes only.  Great article! A+  and Bruce sent me, too :-)   DoNoEvil on Thursday, October 15, 2009   Great article. Although I have to say that almost every person I have ever known to do a coin-toss uses the palm invert trick to add that element of "manual randomness"  . Which ...even if every coin in a coin toss IS geared slightly biased and lands on heads more of the time, by flipping it you're now making it biased for the other side of the coin.   TribalSeth on Sunday, October 25, 2009   A trick I always use is to vigorously rub on one side for 30 seconds before using it.

But - have you done any similar analysis on dice - eg is there any bias on the die, assuming it is not intentionally biased?  As a first step, try throwing it a few tens of thousands of times (get a few friends to assist to save some time) and see if the frequency of each number (1 to 6) is the same (within the expected limits forecast from statistical theory).

G   George on Tuesday, April 20, 2010   Coin tossing is very familiar among people of commonwealth countries, especially India, Pakistan and Australia. In these cricket crazy nations (especially India where “cricket is our religion and Sachin is our god”) cricket is very popular and coin tossing is a very decisive factor in winning. I still remember waiting anxiously for Ravi Shastri to say “Saurav Ganguly has won the toss and India will bat first”. Anyways, a very interesting article.  It is one of those articles that give us information, which produces an Aha!   Rapid Prototyping on Sunday, April 25, 2010   I'm not sure if I understand this correctly, but you say that the reason (or at least the main one) for the 1% offset in percentages when a coin is flipped and caught is because of the whole HTHTHTHTH... sequence thing? Well, in that case the probability of it ending up in a the state it started in would be  51% only if there were about 100 flips in the air. However, I'm sure the actual number of flips when you flip a coin is more than that? Has anyone measured this? In that case, the offset is probably a lot less than 1%.

If the coin is flipped two times what is the probability of getting a head in either of those attempts?  I think both the coin flips are mutually exclusive events, so the probability would be getting head in attempt 1 or attempt 2 which is :  P(attempt1) + P(attempt2) =  1/2 + 1/2 = 1  100% probability sounds wrong? What am I doing wrong. If i apply the same logic then probability of getting at least 1 head in 3 attempt will be 1/2+1/2+1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5 which I know for sure is wrong.

That is not the same as mutually exclusive . – Graham Kemp  Mar 28 '14 at 9:58        add a comment |           5 Answers 5     active  oldest  votes            up vote  8  down vote  accepted      You are confusing the terms "independent" and "mutually exclusive".  These are not the same thing.  In fact events cannot be both "independent" and "mutually exclusive".  It's either one, the other, or neither.  "Mutually exclusive" simply means that the two events cannot happen together.  If A happens then B does not and if B happens A does not.  "Independent" simply means that the occurrence of one event is not conditional on the occurrence of the other.  The probability of A happening does not depend on whether B happens or not, and vice versa.   Let $H_n$ be the indexed event of getting a head on the $n^{th}$ flip.  Given an unbiased coin, $P(H_1)=P(H_2)=\frac 1 2$  These events are independent so $P(H_1 \cap H_2) = P(H_1)\times P(H_2)$.  The outcome of one coin toss does not influence the outcome of the other.  However they are not  mutually exclusive , so $P(H_1 \cup H_2) = P(H_1)+P(H_2) - P(H_1 \cap H_2)$.  Both coins can turn up heads.  Putting it together: $$\therefore P(H_1 \cup H_2) = \frac 12 + \frac 1 2 - \frac 12 \times \frac 12 = \frac 3 4$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jan 22 at 14:08       Alex Johnson   32 7        answered Mar 28 '14 at 9:56       Graham Kemp   73.6k 4 30 66              1      So if I flip a coin 2 times, there is a 75% chance that I will get heads on at least one of the 2 flips? – Juan Velez  Aug 25 '15 at 16:47        3      @JuanVelez Yes, if there is no bias (ie: fair coins). $\boxed{\begin{array}{c|cc} ~& H & T \\ \hline H & HH & HT \\ T & TH & TT\end{array}}$ Four equally probable results, three of which are the favoured outcome. – Graham Kemp  Aug 25 '15 at 22:52         1      Would it follow, that in 3 tries you'd have an 87.5% chance of success? – Lonnie Best  Dec 20 '15 at 23:15        2      @LonnieBest Yes, it does indeed follow that the change of at least one success in three flips is $1-0.5^3$. – Graham Kemp  Dec 21 '15 at 0:29        add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      Let $A$ be the event of getting a tail in both tosses, then $A'$ be the event of getting a head in either tosses.

If the coin is flipped $6$ times, what is the probability that there are exactly $3$ heads?   The answer is $\frac5{16}$. I wonder why it isn't $\frac12$. Since a fair coin flip results in equally likely outcomes, any sequence is equally likely…  I know why it is $\frac5{16}$. We divide the number of possible outcomes with exactly 3 heads by the total possible outcomes.  What bothers me is how I should think about it so I won't make a mistake anymore. Why is $\frac12$ not right?

What is the probability that there are exactly $2.5$ heads? – Théophile  Oct 29 '16 at 5:34        add a comment |           4 Answers 4     active  oldest  votes            up vote  3  down vote  accepted      It sounds like you already have the intuition since you understand that the answer is obtained by dividing the number of outcomes with exactly 3 heads by the total number of outcomes.  From here it's a matter of understanding how to calculate these two things.  The total number of outcomes is simply $2^6 = 64$ since we're tossing a coin 6 times and each toss has only two possible outcomes.  The number of outcomes with exactly 3 heads is given by ${6 \choose 3}$ because we essentially want to know how many different ways we can take exactly 3 things from a total of 6 things.  The value of this is 20.  So the answer is $20/64 = 5/16$.  The error you made is thinking that "number of outcomes with exactly 3 heads" is equal to "half of the total number of outcomes of 6 tosses."  If this were the case then logically, "exactly 3 tails" must also be exactly half of the total outcomes.  This means that "exactly 3 heads or exactly 3 tails" must describe all possible outcomes (because each scenario joined by the "or" would have probability $1/2$) but this is clearly not the case since we can have, e.g., 1 heads and 5 tails, etc.  To put it another way... You said any sequence is equally likely.  That is correct.  But sequences containing exactly 3 heads do not make up half of the total number of sequences.  Therefore it does not follow that the probability is $1/2$.  The easiest way to see this clearly is to list every possible outcome.  But for 64 outcomes it can be tedious, so let's do it with a simpler and similar problem.  Say we want to know the probability of getting exactly 2 heads if we flip a coin 4 times.  Unless I'm misunderstanding your misunderstanding, your earlier thinking would lead you to believe the answer is $1/2$.   But if we list all possible outcomes:  HHHH
HHHT
HHTH
HHTT
HTHH
HTHT
HTTH
HTTT
THHH
THHT
THTH
THTT
TTHH
TTHT
TTTH
TTTT  We see that only 6 of them have exactly 2 heads.  $6/16 = 3/8$.  And if we do this problem the way I answered the original one, then the total number of outcomes is $2^4 = 16$ and the total number of outcomes with exactly 2 heads is ${4 \choose 2} = 6$. So we again get $6/16 = 3/8$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Oct 29 '16 at 4:53       tilper   12.7k 1 10 45              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      "exactly three heads" is not half of the outcomes.

It is true that each sequence of heads and tails is equally likely to occur – with probability $\frac1{64}$, in this case. However, the number of those sequences having exactly three heads is not 32, but $\binom63=20$, which leads to the correct answer of $\frac5{16}$.

You do $n = 10$ trials. The probability of one successful trial is $p = \frac{1}{2}$. You want $k = 3$ successes and $n - k = 7$ failures. The probability is:  $$
\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = \binom{10}{3} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{3} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{7} = \dfrac{15}{128}
$$  One way to understand this formula: You want $k$ successes (probability: $p^k$) and $n-k$ failures (probability: $(1-p)^{n-k}$). The successes can occur anywhere in the trials, and there are $\binom{n}{k}$ to arrange $k$ successes in $n$ trials.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 30 '12 at 22:51             answered May 30 '12 at 22:45       Ayman Hourieh   29.9k 4 58 107                  I am bit confused about this.

Since the positive outcomes are equally likely, it's simply adding them all up. – user190080  Nov 14 '17 at 15:02        add a comment |             up vote  22  down vote      We build a mathematical model of the experiment.  Write H for head and T for tail.  Record the results of the tosses as a string of length $10$, made up of the letters H and/or T.  So for example the string HHHTTHHTHT means that we got a head, then a head, then a head, then a tail, and so on.  There are $2^{10}$ such strings of length $10$.  This is because we have $2$ choices for the first letter, and for every such choice we have $2$ choices for the second letter, and for every choice of the first two letters, we have $2$ choices for the third letter, and so on.  Because we assume that the coin is fair, and that the result we get on say the first $6$ tosses does not affect the probability of getting a head on the $7$-th toss, each of these $2^{10}$ ($1024$) strings is equally likely . Since the probabilities must add up to $1$, each string has probability $\frac{1}{2^{10}}$.
So for example the outcome HHHHHHHHHH is just as likely as the outcome HTTHHTHTHT. This may have an intuitively implausible feel, but it fits in very well with experiments.  Now let us assume that we will be happy only if we get exactly $3$ heads.  To find the probability we will be happy, we count the number of strings that will make us happy. Suppose there are $k$ such strings. Then the probability we will be happy is $\frac{k}{2^{10}}$.  Now we need to find $k$. So we need to count the number of strings that have exactly $3$ H's.  To do this, we find the number of ways to choose  where the H's will occur. So we must choose $3$ places (from the $10$ available) for the H's to be.  We can choose $3$ objects from $10$ in $\binom{10}{3}$ ways. This number is called also by various other names, such as $C_3^{10}$, or ${}_{10}C_3$, or $C(10,3)$, and there are other names too. It is called a binomial coefficient , because it is the coefficient of $x^3$ when the expression $(1+x)^{10}$ is expanded.  There is a useful formula for the binomial coefficients. In general
$$\binom{n}{r}=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}.$$  In particular, $\binom{10}{3}=\frac{10!}{3!7!}$. This turns out to be $120$. So the probability of exactly $3$ heads in $10$ tosses is
$\frac{120}{1024}$.  Remark: The idea can be substantially generalized. If we toss a coin $n$ times, and the probability of a head on any toss is $p$ (which need not be equal to $1/2$, the coin could be unfair), then the probability of exactly $k$ heads is
$$\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}.$$
This probability model is called the Binomial distribution . It is of great practical importance, since it underlies all simple yes/no polling.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited May 31 '12 at 0:18             answered May 30 '12 at 23:01       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779              add a comment |             up vote  16  down vote      You are looking for  $$\frac{\text{Number of Relevant Outcomes}}{\text{Number ofTotal Outcomes}}.$$  The number of total outcomes is $2^{10}$.

Then you have to arrange 3 heads and 7 tails within 10 open slots.
We can name our Heads: $H(A)$, $H(B)$, and $H(C)$. Now, you can arrange the heads in such ways that $H(A)$ will essentially have 10 open slots, $H(B)$ will have 9 open slots and $H(C)$ will have 8 open slots. In other words there are: $$10 \times 9 \times 8 = 720$$ ways to arrange these heads. However, this accounts for the fact that all heads are different. Therefore the number of positions in which $H(x)$ can be arranged in is $$3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6,$$ and so there are: $$\frac{720}{6} = 120 $$
scenarios of which 3 heads and 7 tails are given. Therefore
$$P(\text{getting 3 heads and 7 tails}) = \frac{120}{1024} = \frac{15}{128} \approx 11.7\%.$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Nov 14 '17 at 14:51       Xander Henderson   10.9k 7 25 42        answered Nov 14 '17 at 14:23       Emil Eriksson   1              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Put differently, note that the probability that no heads appears is 1 out of four or $\frac 14$. So the probability of at least one head is $1$ minus the probability of getting NO heads, which is $1$ minus the probability of getting all tails: is $1 - \frac 14 = 1 - \frac{1}{2^2} = 1 - \frac 12 \cdot \frac 12$  In the above demonstration, it is quite easy to list out the "probability space": which is essentially, all possible outcomes.  The " at least one head" qualifier is handy, because it allows you to simplify the determination of probability for any arbitrarily large numbers of flips.  If you flip a coin $n$ times, and want to know the probability of getting at least one head, note the outcome of getting all tails is the "complement" of the set of outcomes in which you get at least one head. The probability of getting all/only tails, when flipping a coin $n$ times is equal to $$\underbrace{\dfrac 12 \cdot \frac 12 \cdot \cdots \cdot \frac 12}_{\large n\; \text{times}} = \left(\frac 1{2}\right)^n$$  So...$$\begin{align} \text{probability of getting at least one head}\; & = 1 -\text{probability of not getting any heads}\; \\ \\ & =  1 - \;\text{probability of getting all tails}\;\\ \\& = 1 - \left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^n\end{align}$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Jun 24 '13 at 18:32             answered Jun 24 '13 at 18:19       amWhy   187k 25 215 427              add a comment |             up vote  2  down vote      in problems like this one it's usually much easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event, so in this case - what is the probability of flipping a coin $n$ times without any heads? answer - it's $2^{-n}$ because each time you flip you need to get tails therefore the probability you seek is $1 - 2^{-n}$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 24 '13 at 18:10       mm-aops   3,210 8 24              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      You probably know that if $p$ is the probability of an event (say, flipping heads at least once) happening, then $1-p$ is the probability of that event not happening. Now let's apply this to your problem.  If you do not flip heads at least once in $n$ trials, then all $n$ trials must be tails. The probability of getting tails in one trial is $\frac12$, and since the trials are independent (what you get on flip 1 does not affect what you get on flip 2 does not affect what you get on flip k, etc.) the probability of getting tails in $n$ trials is $(\frac12)^n$. This is your $1-p$, so your $p=1-(\frac12)^n$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 24 '13 at 18:12       Zen   919 6 10              add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      I think it's helpful to generalize this question to a multi-sided coin (a coin with $m$ sides, which can be thought of as a die, if you will). I will call "side A" the desired outcome (heads for the coin). For two tosses, we can add the probabilities of two independent events.  Probability of getting side A on the first toss:  $\frac 1m$  Probability of not getting "side A" on the first toss, but getting it on the second toss=  $ p(not side A) \cdot p(side A) = (1-\frac 1m) \cdot \frac 1m$  Total probability of getting side A in two tosses is the sum of the two events:  $\frac 1m + (1-\frac 1m) \cdot \frac 1m$  If we continue with more tosses ($n$ total), the probability grows. The probability of not getting "side A" on the first, second, ... or $n-1$th toss, but getting it on the $n$th toss =  $(1-\frac 1m)^{n-1} \cdot \frac 1m$  Total probability of getting "side A" in $n$ tosses is the sum of the independent events:  $\frac 1m \cdot [1 + (1-\frac 1m) + (1-\frac 1m)^2 +  ...(1-\frac 1m)^{n-1}]$     share | cite | improve this answer     answered May 8 '17 at 22:25       Engenuity   11 3              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      The quickest way to find the probability of of an event happening at least once in a sequence of independent trials is to find the probability that it never happens in that sequence of trials, and then subtract from $1$.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jun 24 '13 at 18:27       Michael Hardy   198k 22 179 434              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Prerequisites  Distributions , Basic Probability , Variability  Learning Objectives  Define binomial outcomes  Compute the probability of getting X successes in N trials  Compute cumulative binomial probabilities  Find the mean and standard deviation of a binomial distribution    When you flip a coin, there are two possible outcomes: 
                heads and tails. Each outcome has a fixed probability, the same 
                from trial to trial. In the case of coins, heads and tails each 
                have the same probability of 1/2. More generally, there are situations 
                in which the coin is biased, so that heads and tails have different 
                probabilities. In the present section, we consider probability 
                distributions for which there are just two possible outcomes with 
                fixed probabilities summing to one. These distributions are called binomial 
                distributions .  A Simple Example  The four possible outcomes that could occur if you 
                flipped a coin twice are listed below in Table 1. Note that the 
                four outcomes are equally likely: each has probability 1/4. To 
                see this, note that the tosses of the coin are independent (neither 
                affects the other). Hence, the probability of a head on Flip 1 
                and a head on Flip 2 is the product of P(H) and P(H), which is 
                1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4. The same calculation applies to the probability 
                of a head on Flip 1 and a tail on Flip 2. Each is 1/2 x 1/2 
                = 1/4.    Table 1. Four Possible Outcomes.    Outcome  First Flip  Second Flip    1  Heads  Heads    2  Heads  Tails    3  Tails  Heads    4  Tails  Tails     The four possible outcomes can be classified
                in  terms of the number of heads that come up. The number could
                be  two (Outcome 1), one (Outcomes 2 and 3) or 0 (Outcome 4).
                The  probabilities of these possibilities are shown in Table
                2 and  in Figure 1. Since two of the outcomes represent the case
                in which  just one head appears in the two tosses, the probability
                of this  event is equal to 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Table 2 summarizes
                the situation.     Table 2. Probabilities of Getting 0, 1, or 2 Heads.    Number of Heads  Probability    0  1/4    1  1/2    2  1/4        Figure 1. Probabilities of 0, 1, and 2 
                      heads.   Figure 1 is a discrete probability distribution: 
                It shows the probability for each of the values on the X-axis. 
                Defining a head as a "success," Figure 1 shows the probability 
                of 0, 1, and 2 successes for two trials (flips) for an event that 
                has a probability of 0.5 of being a success on each trial. This 
                makes Figure 1 an example of a binomial distribution .  The Formula for Binomial Probabilities  The binomial distribution consists of the probabilities
                 of each of the possible numbers of successes on N trials for
                independent  events that each have a probability of π 
                (the Greek letter pi) of occurring. For the coin flip example,
                 N = 2 and π = 0.5. The formula for 
                the binomial distribution is shown below:   where P(x) is the probability of x successes out 
                of N trials, N is the number of trials, and π 
                is the probability of success on a given trial. Applying this 
                to the coin flip example,    If you flip a coin twice, what is the probability 
                of getting one or more heads? Since the probability of getting 
                exactly one head is 0.50 and the probability of getting exactly 
                two heads is 0.25, the probability of getting one or more heads 
                is 0.50 + 0.25 = 0.75.  Now suppose that the coin is biased. The probability 
                of heads is only 0.4. What is the probability of getting heads 
                at least once in two tosses? Substituting into the general formula 
                above, you should obtain the answer .64.  Cumulative Probabilities  We toss a coin 12 times. What is the probability 
                that we get from 0 to 3 heads? The answer is found by computing 
                the probability of exactly 0 heads, exactly 1 head, exactly 2 
                heads, and exactly 3 heads. The probability of getting from 0 
                to 3 heads is then the sum of these probabilities. The probabilities 
                are: 0.0002, 0.0029, 0.0161, and 0.0537. The sum of the probabilities 
                is 0.073. The calculation of cumulative binomial probabilities 
                can be quite tedious. Therefore we have provided a binomial calculator 
                to make it easy to calculate these probabilities.  Binomial
              Calculator  Mean and Standard Deviation of Binomial Distributions  Consider a coin-tossing experiment in which you 
                tossed a coin 12 times and recorded the number of heads. If you 
                performed this experiment over and over again, what would the 
                mean number of heads be? On average, you would expect half the 
                coin tosses to come up heads. Therefore the mean number of heads 
                would be 6. In general, the mean of a binomial distribution with 
                parameters N (the number of trials) and π 
                (the probability of success on each trial) is:  μ = Nπ  where μ is the mean 
                of the binomial distribution. The variance of the binomial distribution 
                is:  σ 2 = Nπ(1-π)  where σ 2 is the variance of the binomial distribution.  Let's return to the coin-tossing experiment. The 
                coin was tossed 12 times, so N = 12. A coin has a probability of 
                0.5 of coming up heads. Therefore, π 
                = 0.5. The mean and variance can therefore be computed

The probability of getting a heads at least once = 1 - probability of getting tails all 4 times. Ans                = 1 - (1/2)(1/2)(1/2)(1/2) = 1 - (1/16) = 15/16                        mehtakaustubh      Manager        B     Joined: 11 Jul 2009   Posts: 142   WE: Design (Computer Software)                       Re: John flips a coin 4 times.

There are 16 possible combinations here.

Aren't you glad we have the 1-x trick? Thank you all for the answer and explanation, but I'm a bit confused as I've looked up few sources on the Internet (not relating to GMAT), and they all indicated the chance of getting 1 head in 4 flips of a coin is 4/16 = 1/4  , I'm quoting here from a site linked to University page: Quote: If we assume that each individual coin is equally likely to come up heads or tails, then each of the above 16 outcomes to 4 flips is equally likely. Each occurs a fraction one out of 16 times, or each has a probability of 1/16. Alternatively, we could argue that the 1st coin has probability 1/2 to come up heads or tails, the 2nd coin has probability 1/2 to come up heads or tails, and so on for the 3rd and 4th coins, so that the probability for any one particular sequence of heads and tails is just (1/2)x(1/2)x(1/2)x(1/2)=(1/16). Now lets ask: what is the probability that in 4 flips, one gets N heads, where N=0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. We can get this just by counting the number of outcomes above which have the desired number of heads, and dividing by the total number of possible outcomes, 16.   N     # outcomes with N heads     probability to get N heads 0                1                                       1/16 = 0.0625 1                4                                       4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25 2                6                                      6/16 = 3/8 = 0.375 3                4                                      4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25 4                1                                      1/16 = 0.0625 What is the difference here? is it the "at least" phrase?

Aren't you glad we have the 1-x trick? Thank you all for the answer and explanation, but I'm a bit confused as I've looked up few sources on the Internet (not relating to GMAT), and they all indicated the chance of getting 1 head in 4 flips of a coin is 4/16 = 1/4  , I'm quoting here from a site linked to University page: Quote: If we assume that each individual coin is equally likely to come up heads or tails, then each of the above 16 outcomes to 4 flips is equally likely. Each occurs a fraction one out of 16 times, or each has a probability of 1/16. Alternatively, we could argue that the 1st coin has probability 1/2 to come up heads or tails, the 2nd coin has probability 1/2 to come up heads or tails, and so on for the 3rd and 4th coins, so that the probability for any one particular sequence of heads and tails is just (1/2)x(1/2)x(1/2)x(1/2)=(1/16). Now lets ask: what is the probability that in 4 flips, one gets N heads, where N=0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. We can get this just by counting the number of outcomes above which have the desired number of heads, and dividing by the total number of possible outcomes, 16.   N     # outcomes with N heads     probability to get N heads 0                1                                       1/16 = 0.0625 1                4                                       4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25 2                6                                      6/16 = 3/8 = 0.375 3                4                                      4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25 4                1                                      1/16 = 0.0625 What is the difference here? is it the "at least" phrase?

nature.  A subject repeatedly attempts a task with a known probability
of success due to chance, then the number of actual successes is compared
to the chance expectation.  If a subject scores consistently higher or
lower than the chance expectation after a large number of attempts,
one can calculate the probability of such a score due purely to
chance, and then argue, if the chance probability is sufficiently
small, that the results are evidence for the existence of some
mechanism (precognition, telepathy, psychokinesis, cheating, etc.)
which allowed the subject to perform better than chance would seem to
permit.  Suppose you ask a subject to guess, before it is flipped, whether a
coin will land with heads or tails up.  Assuming the coin is fair (has
the same probability of heads and tails), the chance of guessing
correctly is 50%, so you'd expect half the guesses to be correct and
half to be wrong.  So, if we ask the subject to guess heads or tails
for each of 100 coin flips, we'd expect about 50 of the guesses to be
correct.  Suppose a new subject walks into the lab and manages to
guess heads or tails correctly for 60 out of 100 tosses.  Evidence of
precognition, or perhaps the subject's possessing a telekinetic power
which causes the coin to land with the guessed face up?  Well,…no.
In all likelihood, we've observed nothing more than good luck.  The
probability of 60 correct guesses out of 100 is about 2.8%, which
means that if we do a large number of experiments flipping 100 coins,
about every 35 experiments we can expect a score of 60 or better,
purely due to chance.  But suppose this subject continues to guess about 60 right
out of a hundred, so that after ten runs of 100 tosses—1000
tosses in all, the subject has made 600 correct guesses.
The probability of that happening purely by chance is less
than one in seven billion, so it's time to start thinking
about explanations other than luck.  Still, improbable things
happen all the time: if you hit a golf ball, the odds it
will land on a given blade of grass are millions to one, yet
(unless it ends up in the lake or a sand trap) it is
certain to land on some blades of grass.  Finally, suppose this “dream subject” continues to guess 60%
of the flips correctly, observed by multiple video cameras,
under conditions prescribed by skeptics and debunkers, using
a coin provided and flipped by The Amazing Randi himself, with
a final tally of 1200 correct guesses in 2000 flips.  You'd
have to try the 2000 flips more than 5×10 18 times before you'd expect that result to occur by chance.
If it takes a day to do 2000 guesses and coin flips, it
would take more than 1.3×10 16 years of
2000 flips per day before you'd expect to see 1200 correct
guesses due to chance.  That's more than a million times
the age of the universe, so you'd better get started soon!  Claims of evidence for the paranormal are usually based upon
statistics which diverge so far from the expectation due to chance
that some other mechanism seems necessary to explain the experimental
results.  To interpret the results of our RetroPsychoKinesis
experiments, we'll be using the mathematics of probability and
statistics, so it's worth spending some time explaining how we go
about quantifying the consequences of chance.     Note to mathematicians: The following discussion of probability
is deliberately simplified to consider only binomial and normal distributions
with a probability of 0.5, the presumed probability of success in
the experiments in question.  I decided that
presenting and discussing the equations for arbitrary probability
would only decrease the probability that readers would persevere
and arrive at an understanding of the fundamentals of probability
theory.    Twelve and a half cents: one bit!  In slang harking back to the days of gold doubloons and pieces of
eight, the United States quarter-dollar coin is nicknamed “two bits”.
The Fourmilab radioactive random
number generator produces a stream of binary ones and zeroes, or bits .  Since we expect the generator to produce ones and
zeroes with equal probability, each bit from the generator is
equivalent to a coin flip: heads for one and tails for zero.  When we run
experiments with the generator, in effect, we're flipping a binary coin , one bit —twelve and a
half cents!     Two Bits    One Bit            Heads  Tails    Heads  Tails     (We could, of course, have called zero heads and one tails; since both
occur with equal probability, the choice is arbitrary.) Each bit
produced by the random number generator is a flip of our one-bit coin.
Now the key thing to keep in mind about a genuine random number
generator or flip of a fair coin is that it has no memory or,
as mathematicians say, each bit from the generator or flip is independent .  Even if, by chance, the coin has come up heads
ten times in a row, the probability of getting heads or tails on the
next flip is precisely equal.  Gamblers who've seen a coin come up
heads ten times in a row may believe “tails is way overdue”, but the
coin doesn't know and couldn't care less about the last ten flips; the
next flip is just as likely to be the eleventh head in a row as the
tail that breaks the streak.  Even though there is no way whatsoever to predict the outcome of the
next flip, if we flip a coin a number of times, the laws of
probability allow us to predict, with greater accuracy as the number
of flips increases, the probability of obtaining various results.  In
the discussion that follows, we'll ignore the order of the flips and
only count how many times the coin came up heads.  Since heads is one
and tails is zero, we can just add up the results from the flips, or
the bits from the random generator.  Four Flips  Suppose we flip a coin four times.  Since each flip can come up heads
or tails, there are 16 possible outcomes, tabulated below, grouped by
the number of heads in the four flips.     Number of Heads  Results of Flips  Number of Ways    0       1    1                       4    2                                 6    3                       4    4       1      Number of Ways summarises how many different ways the results
of the four flips could end up with a given number of heads.  Since
the only way to get zero heads is for all four flips to be tails,
there's only one way that can occur.  One head out of four flips can
happen four different ways since each of the four flips could have
been the head.  Two heads out of four flips can happen six different
ways, as tabulated.  And since what's true of heads applies equally to
tails, there are four ways to get three heads and one way to get four.  Mathematically, the number of ways to get x heads (or tails) in n flips is spoken of as
the “number of combinations of n things taken x at a time”, which is written as:     This, it turns out, can be calculated for any positive integers n and x whatsoever, as follows.     For example, if we plug in 4 for n and 2 for x ,
we get  4! / (2! (4 − 2)!) = 4! / (2! 2!) = 24 / (2 2) = 24 / 4 = 6  as expected.
Plotting the number of ways we can get different numbers of
heads yields the following graph.     Probability  Since the coin is fair, each flip has an equal chance of coming up
heads or tails, so all 16 possible outcomes tabulated above are
equally probable.  But since there are 6 ways to get 2 heads, in four
flips the probability of two heads is greater than that of
any other result.  We express probability as a number between 0 and 1.
A probability of zero is a result which cannot ever occur: the
probability of getting five heads in four flips is zero.  A
probability of one represents certainty: if you flip a coin, the
probability you'll get heads or tails is one (assuming it
can't land on the rim,  fall into a black hole, or some such).  The probability of getting a given number of heads from
four flips is, then, simply the number of ways that
number of heads can occur, divided by the number of total
results of four flips, 16.  We can then tabulate the
probabilities as follows.     Number of Heads  Number of Ways  Probability    0  1  1/16 = 0.0625    1  4  4/16 = 0.25    2  6  6/16 = 0.375    3  4  4/16 = 0.25    4  1  1/16 = 0.0625     Since we are absolutely certain the number of heads we get in four
flips is going to be between zero and four, the probabilities of the
different numbers of heads should add up to 1.  Summing the
probabilities in the table confirms this.  Further, we can calculate
the probability of any collection of results by adding the individual
probabilities of each.  Suppose we'd like to know the probability of
getting fewer than three heads from four flips.  There are three ways
this can happen: zero, one, or two heads.  The probability of fewer
than three, then, is the sum of the probabilities of these results,
1/16 + 4/16 + 6/16 = 11/16 = 0.6875, or a little more than two out of
three.  So to calculate the probability of one outcome or another, sum the probabilities.  To get probability of one result and another from two
separate experiments, multiply the individual
probabilities.  The probability of getting one head in four flips is
4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25.  What's the probability of getting one head in each
of two successive sets of four flips?  Well, it's just 1/4 × 1/4 =
1/16 = 0.0625.  The probability for any number of heads x in
any number of flips n is thus:     the number of ways in which x heads can occur
in n flips, divided by the number of different possible
results of the series of flips, measured by number of heads.
But there's no need to sum the combinations in the denominator,
since the number of possible results is simply two raised
to the power of the number of flips.  So, we can simplify
the expression for the probability to:     More Flips  Let's see how the probability behaves as we make more and more flips.
Since we have a general formula for calculating the probability for
any number of heads in any number of flips, we can graph of the
probability for various numbers of flips.   8 Flips  16 Flips  32 Flips  64 Flips  128 Flips   In every case, the peak probability is at half the number of flips and
declines on both sides, more steeply as the number of flips increases.
This is the simple consequence of there being many more possible ways
for results close to half heads and tails to occur than ways that
result in a substantial majority of heads or tails.

chance expectations greater than one in 100 thousand million
runs is available , as is a much
larger table listing probabilities for
all possible results .  (The latter document is more than 150K bytes
and will take a while to download, and contains a very large
table which some Web browsers, particularly on machines with
limited memory, may not display properly.)  Perfectly Normal  As we make more and more flips, the graph of the probability of a
given number of heads becomes smoother and approaches the
“bell curve”, or normal distribution , as a limit.  The
normal distribution gives the probability for x heads
in n flips as:     where μ= n /2 and
σ is the standard deviation , a measure of the breadth of the
curve which, for equal probability coin flipping, is:     We keep the standard deviation separate, as opposed to merging it into
the normal distribution probability equation, because it will play an
important rôle in interpreting the results of our experiments.  To
show how closely the probability chart approaches the normal
distribution even for a relatively small number of flips, here's the
normal distribution plotted in red, with the actual probabilities for
number of heads in 128 flips shown as blue bars.     The probability the outcome of an experiment with
a sufficiently large number of trials is due to
chance can be calculated directly from the result, and
the mean and standard deviation for the number of trials
in the experiment.  For additional details, including an

Probability Calculator .  Calculation and Reality  This is all very persuasive, you might say, and the formulas are
suitably intimidating, but does the real world actually behave this
way?  Well, as a matter of fact, it does, as we can see from a simple
experiment.  Get a coin, flip it 32 times, and write down the number
of times heads came up.  Now repeat the experiment fifty thousand
times.  When you're done, make a graph of the number of 32-flip sets
which resulted in a given number of heads.  Hmmmm…32 times
50,000 is 1.6 million, so if you flip the coin once a second,
twenty-four hours per day, it'll take eighteen and a half days to
complete the experiment….  Instead of marathon coin-flipping, let's use the same HotBits hardware random number generator our
experiments employ.  It's a simple matter of programming to withdraw
1.6 million bits from the generator, divide them up into 50,000 sets
of 32 bits each, then compute a histogram of the number of sets
containing each possible number of one bits (heads).  The results from
this experiment are presented in the following graph.     The red curve is the number of runs expected to result in each value
of heads, which is simply the probability of that number of heads
multiplied by the total number of experimental runs, 50,000.  The blue
diamonds are the actual number of 32 bit sets observed to contain each
number of one bits.  It is evident that the experimental results
closely match the expectation from probability.  Just as the
probability curve approaches the normal distribution for large numbers
of runs, experimental results from a truly random source will
inexorably converge on the predictions of probability as the number of
runs increases.   If
your Web browser supports Java applets, our Probability Pipe
Organ lets you run interactive experiments which demonstrate how
the results from random data approach the normal
curve expectation as the number of experiments grows large.   Experiments and Expectations  Performing an experiment amounts to asking the Universe a
question.  For the answer, the experimental results, to be
of any use, you have to be absolutely sure you've phrased the
question correctly.  When searching for elusive effects
among a sea of random events by statistical means, whether
in particle physics or parapsychology, one must take care
to apply statistics properly to the events being studied.
Misinterpreting genuine experimental results yields errors
just as serious as those due to faults in the design of the
experiment.  Evidence for the existence of a phenomenon must be significant , persistent , and consistent .
Statistical analysis can never entirely rule out the
possibility that the results of an experiment were entirely due to
chance—it can only calculate the probability of occurrence by
chance.  Only as more and more experiments are performed, which
reproduce the supposed effect and, by doing so, further decrease the
probability of chance, does the evidence for the effect become
persuasive.  To show how essential it is to ask the right question, consider an
experiment in which the subject attempts to influence a device which
generates random digits from 0 to 9 so that more nines are generated
than expected by chance.  Each experiment involves generation of one
thousand random digits.  We run the first experiment and get the
following result:   51866599999944246273322297520235159670265786865762

(we'll see how to calculate this numerically before long).
There was an excess of nines over the chance expectation, 100,
but greater excesses occurred for the digits 3 , 5 , 6 , and 7 .  But take a look at the first line of
the results!  518665 999999 44246273322297520235159670265786865762
                            .
                            .
                            .  These digits were supposed to be random , yet in the first
thousand, the first dozen for that matter, we found a pattern as
striking as “999999”.  What's the probability of that happening?  Just
the number of possible numbers of d digits which contain one
or more sequences of p or more consecutive nines:     Plugging in 1000 for d and 6 for p yields:     So the probability of finding “999999” in a set of 1000 random digits
is less than one in a thousand!  So then, are the digits not random,
after all?  Might our subject, while failing to influence the outcome
of the experiment in the way we've requested, have somehow marked the
results with a signature of a thousand-to-one probability of appearing
by chance?  Or have we simply asked the wrong question and gotten a
perfectly accurate answer that doesn't mean what we think it does at
first glance?  The latter turns out to be the case.  The data are right before our
eyes, and the probability we calculated is correct, but we asked
the wrong question , and in doing so fell into a trap littered
with the bones of many a naïve researcher.  Note the order in which we
did things.  We ran the experiment, examined the data, found something
seemingly odd in it, then calculated the probability of that
particular oddity appearing by chance.  We asked the question,
“ What is the probability of ‘999999’ appearing in a 1000 digit
random sequence? ” and got the answer “less than one in a
thousand”, a result most people would consider significant.  But since
we calculated the probability after seeing the data, in fact we were
asking the question “ What is the chance that ‘999999’ appears in a
1000 digit random sequence which contains one occurrence of
‘999999’?” .  The answer to that question is, of course,
“certainty”.  In the original examination of the data, we were really asking
“ What is the probability we'll find some striking sequence
of six digits in a random 1000 digit number? ”.  We can't
precisely quantify that without defining what “striking” means to the
observer, but it is clearly quite high.  Consider that I could have
made the case just as strongly for “000000”, “777777” or any other
six-digit repeat.  That alone reduces the probability of occurrence by
chance to one in ten.  Or, perhaps I might have pointed out a run of
digits like “123456”, “012345”, “987654”, and so on; or the first five
or six digits of a mathematical constant such as Pi, e, or the square
root of two; regular patterns like “101010”, “123321”, or a multitude
of others; or maybe my telephone or license plate number, or the
subject's!  It is, in fact, very likely you'll find some pattern you consider striking in a random 1000-digit number.  But, of course, if you don't examine the data from an experiment, how
are you going to notice if there's something odd about it?  Now we'll
see how a hypothesis is framed, tested by a series of experiments, and
confirmed or rejected by statistical analysis of the results.  So,
let's pursue this a bit further, exploring how we frame a hypothesis
based on an observation, run experiments to test it, and then analyse the
results to determine whether they confirm or
deny the hypothesis, and to what degree of certainty.  Our observation, based on examining the first thousand random digits,
is that “999999” appears once, while the probability of “999999”
appearing in a randomly chosen 1000 digit number is less than one in a
thousand.  Based on this observation we then suggest:    Hypothesis:  The sequence “999999” appears more frequently
in 1000-digit sequences with the subject attempting to influence
the generator than would be expected by chance.    We can now proceed to test this experimentally.  If the sequence
“999999” has a probability of occurring in a 1000 digit sequence of
0.000995, then for a thousand consecutive 1000 digit sequences (a
million digits in all), the probability of “999999” appearing will
be 0.995, almost unity. (To be correct, it's important
to test each 1000 digit sequence separately, then sum the results for
1000 consecutive sequences.  If we were to scan all million digits as
one sequence, we would count cases where the sequence “999999” begins
in one 1000 digit sequence and ends in the next.  The probability
(which you can calculate from the equation above) of finding “999999”
in a million digit sequence is 0.999995, somewhat higher than the
0.995 with the million digits are treated as separate 1000 digit
experiments.)   We will perform, then, the following experiment.  With our
ever-patient subject continuing to attempt to influence the output of the
generator, we will produce a million more sequences
of 1000 digits and, in each, count occurrences of “999999”.  Every
1000 sequences, we'll record the number of occurrences,
repeating the process until we've generated a thousand
runs of a million digits—10 9 digits in all.
With that data in hand, we'll see whether the “999999 effect”
is genuine or a fluke attributable to chance.  Here is a plot of the number of occurrences of the sequence “999999”
per block of 1000 digits over the thousand repetitions of the thousand
sequence experiment.  The number of occurrences expected by chance,
0.995, is marked by the green line.     At the outset, the results diverged substantially from chance, as is
frequently the case for small sample sizes.  But as the number of
experiments increased, the results converged toward the chance
expectation, ending up in a decreasing magnitude random walk around
it.  This is precisely what is expected from probability theory, and
hence we conclude no “999999 effect” exists.  Ensembles of Experiments: the X ² (Chi-Square) Test  So far, we've seen how the laws of probability predict the outcome of
large numbers of experiments involving random data, how to calculate
the probability of a given experimental result being due to chance,
and how one goes about framing a hypothesis, then designing and
running a series of experiments to test it.  Now it's time to examine
how to analyse the results from the experiments to determine whether
they provide evidence for the hypothesis and, if so, how much.  Since its introduction in 1900 by Karl Peterson, the chi-square
( X ²) test has become the most widely used measure of the
significance to which experimental results support or refute a
hypothesis.  Applicable to any experiment where discrete results can
be measured, it is used in almost every field of science.  The
chi-square test is the final step in a process which usually proceeds
as follows.   Based either on theory or examination of empirical
        data, a phenomenon is suggested to exist.  A hypothesis is framed incorporating the supposed
        phenomenon.  An experiment is designed to test the hypothesis.
        The experiment must produce results which differ
        based on the validity of the hypothesis.  The
        results of the experiment for the hypothesis-false
        ( null hypothesis ) case are calculated and,
        if appropriate, verified by a control experiment
        in which the hypothesised effect is excluded.  A series of experiments are conducted, and the
        results tabulated.  The chi-square test is applied to determine the
        significance of the discrepancy between the
        calculated null hypothesis case and the
        experimental results, and the probability that
        the discrepancy is the result of chance.  If
        that probability is very low, the experiment
        provides evidence for the hypothesis.   No experiment or series of experiments can ever prove a
hypothesis; one can only rule out other hypotheses and provide
evidence that assuming the truth of the hypothesis better explains the
experimental results than discarding it.  In many fields of science,
the task of estimating the null-hypothesis results can be formidable,
and can lead to prolonged and intricate arguments about the
assumptions involved.  Experiments must be carefully designed to
exclude selection effects which might bias the data.  Fortunately, retropsychokinesis experiments have an easily stated and
readily calculated null hypothesis: “The results will obey the
statistics for a sequence of random bits.” The fact that the data are
prerecorded guarantees (assuming the experiment software is properly
implemented and the results are presented without selection or
modification) that run selection or other forms of cheating cannot
occur.  (Anybody can score better than chance at coin flipping if
they're allowed to throw away experiments that come out poorly!)
Finally, the availability of all the programs in source code form and
the ability of others to repeat the experiments on their own premises
will allow independent confirmation of the results obtained here.  So, as the final step in analysing the results of a collection of n experiments, each with k possible outcomes, we
apply the chi-square test to compare the actual results with the
results expected by chance, which are just, for each outcome, its
probability times the number of experiments n .  Mathematically,
the chi-square statistic for an experiment with k possible outcomes, performed n times, in which Y 1 , Y 2 ,… Y k are the number of
experiments which resulted in each possible outcome, where the
probabilities of each outcome are p 1 ,
p 2 ,… p k is:     It's evident from examining this equation that the closer the
measured values are to those expected, the
lower the chi-square sum will be.  Further, from a chi-square
sum, the probability Q that the X ² sum for an experiment with d degrees of freedom (where d = k −1, one less
the number of possible outcomes) is consistent with the
null hypothesis can be calculated as:     Where Γ is the generalisation of the factorial
function to real and complex arguments:     Unfortunately, there is no closed form solution for Q , so it
must be evaluated numerically.  If your Web browser supports
JavaScript, you can use the Chi-Square
Calculator to calculate the probability from a chi-square value
and number of possible outcomes, or calculate the chi-square from the
probability and the number of possible outcomes.  In applying the chi-square test, it's essential to understand that only
very small probabilities of the null hypothesis are significant.
If the probability that the null hypothesis can explain the experimental
results is above 1%, an experiment is generally not considered evidence
of a different hypothesis.  The chi-square test takes
into account neither the number of experiments performed nor the
probability distribution of the expected outcomes; it is valid
only as the number of experiments becomes large, resulting in
substantial numbers for the most probable results.  If a hypothesis
is valid, the chi-square probability should converge on a
small value as more and more experiments are run.  Now let's examine an example of how the chi-square test identifies
experimental results which support or refute a hypothesis.  Our
simulated experiment consists of 50,000 runs of 32 random bits each.
The subject attempts to influence the random number generator to emit
an excess of one or zero bits compared to the chance expectation of
equal numbers of zeroes and ones.  The following table gives the
result of a control run using the random number generator without the
subject's attempting to influence it.  Even if the probability of
various outcomes is easily calculated, it's important to run control
experiments to make sure there are no errors in the experimental
protocol or apparatus which might bias the results away from those
expected.  The table below gives, for each possible number of one
bits, the number of runs which resulted in that count, the expectation
from probability, and the corresponding term in the chi-square sum.

(32, one less than the 33 possible outcomes of the experiment)
into the Chi-Square Calculator gives a probability of 0.85.  This falls within the “fat region” of the
probability curve, and thus supports the null hypothesis, just as we
expected.  Next, we invite our subject to attempt to influence the random output
of our generator.  How? Hypotheses non
fingo. Let's just presume that by some means: telekinesis,
voodoo, tampering with the apparatus when we weren't
looking—whatever, our subject is able to bias the generator so
that out of every 200 bits there's an average of 101 one bits and 99
zeroes.  This seemingly subtle bias would result in an experiment like
the following.

terribly obvious divergence from the expectation, yet the chi-square
test unambiguously fingers the bias.  A X ² sum of 89.6775 in
an experiment with 33 possible outcomes (32 degrees of freedom)
has a probability of occurring by chance of 0.00000022—about
two in ten million—a highly significant result, worthy of
follow-up experiments and investigation of possible mechanisms which
might explain the deviation from chance.

Flipping a coin isn't as fair as it seems. (Courtesy of flickr user MagnuMicah )    By Dan Lewis    smithsonian.com   November 30, 2012         Posted from Dan Lewis' fantastic Now I Know newsletter. Subscribe here or follow him on Twitter .    Imagine you’re at a bar and another patron offers you the following wager. He’s going to flip a coin — a standard U.S. penny like the ones seen above — a dozen or so times. If it comes up heads more often than tails, he’ll pay you $20. If it comes up tails more than heads, you pay him the same. There are no hidden tricks. It’s a fair bet — safe to take, if you’re looking for a 50/50 chance.  Now, imagine the same offer, except that instead of flipping the coin, the other patron tells you he’s going to spin it. In fact, he’ll even let you provide the penny, just to guarantee there is no funny business. Twenty-five spins and if it comes up heads more often than tails, he’ll give you $20 again. But if tails comes up more often, you owe him $20.  Fair bet? Not if Persi Diaconis is right.  Diaconis is a professor of mathematics and statistics at Stanford University and, formerly, a professional magician. While his claim to fame is determining how many times a deck of cards must be shuffled in order to give a mathematically random result (it’s either five or seven, depending on your criteria), he’s also dabbled in the world of coin games. What he and his fellow researchers discovered ( here’s a PDF of their paper ) is that most games of chance involving coins aren’t as even as you’d think. For example, even the 50/50 coin toss really isn’t 50/50 — it’s closer to 51/49, biased toward whatever side was up when the coin was thrown into the air.  But more incredibly, as reported by Science News , spinning a penny, in this case one with the Lincoln Memorial on the back, gives even more pronounced odds — the penny will land tails side up roughly 80 percent of the time. The reason: the side with Lincoln’s head on it is a bit heavier than the flip side, causing the coin’s center of mass to lie slightly toward heads. The spinning coin tends to fall toward the heavier side more often, leading to a pronounced number of extra “tails” results when it finally comes to rest.  Because the coins typically pick up dirt and oils over time, trying the experiment at home may not yield such a large percentage of “tails” over “heads” — but a relatively new coin should still give you noticeable results.
