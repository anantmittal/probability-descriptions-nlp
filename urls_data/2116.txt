Chances of getting selected in H-1B Lottery / H-1B Cap Published on April 11, 2015 Jay Terkiana Follow Following Unfollow Jay Terkiana Sign in to follow this author Managing Immigration Attorney at SAC Attorneys LLP What is H-1B Cap /  H-1B Quota?  The H-1B visa has an annual numerical limit, also referred to as “cap”, of 65,000 visas each fiscal year. The US Federal Government’s fiscal year is the 12-month period ending on 30 September of that year, having begun on 1 October of the previous calendar year. For Example the fiscal year 2016, written as “FY2016″, begins on 1 October 2015 and ends on 30 September 2016.  The first 20,000 petitions filed on behalf of employees/beneficiaries with a U.S. master’s degree or higher are exempt from the cap. Additionally, H-1B workers who are petitioned for or employed at an institution of higher education or its affiliated or related nonprofit entities or a nonprofit research organization, or a government research organization are not subject to this numerical cap.  Therefore, only 85,000 “new” H-1B visas are available each fiscal year. This includes 65,000 visas under the regular cap and 20,000 under the master’s cap. This numerical limitation is referred to as H1B cap.  Masters Cap: Out of this total of 85,000 visas available each fiscal year, 20,000 are restricted to individuals who have received master’s or higher degree from U.S colleges or universities. This 20,000 numerical limitation is referred to as H1B Master’s cap. Once this 20,000 limit is reached, any petitions filed for beneficiaries with a U.S. master’s degree or higher will count against the regular cap (remaining 65,000 visas).  Regular Cap: The reaming 65,000 visas are referred to as Regular Cap. Please note that up to 6,800 visas are set aside from the 65,000 each fiscal year for the H-1B1 program under the terms of the legislation implementing the U.S.-Chile and U.S.-Singapore free trade agreements. Unused visas in this group become available for H-1B use for the next fiscal year.  Filing Period and H-1B Lottery Selection Process  Under the current regulations, H-1B petition can be filed upto 6 months in advance. Therefore for every fiscal year, petitions can be submitted as early as April 1. Due to an increased demand and number of H-1B visa filings, USCIS receives a sufficient number of H1B cap filings to reach both the 65,000 regular cap limit and the 20,000 advanced-degree exemptions on April 1 or around April 1 every year, depending upon economy, job market and H-1B demand.  Upon receiving sufficient number of petitions, USCIS announces that it has reached the congressionally mandated H-1B cap for that particular fiscal year. Before running the lottery, USCIS will complete initial intake for all filings received during the filing period. USCIS then uses a computer-generated process, also known as the lottery, to randomly select the petitions needed to meet 65,000 visas for regular cap and 20,000 for the advanced-degree exemptions cap.  USCIS first randomly selects petitions for the master’s cap advanced degree exemption. Once 20,000 petitions are selected, all the remaining unselected master’s cap advanced degree petitions will become part of the random selection process for the 65,000 general limit. USCIS then randomly selects 65,000 petitions from the pool of all the petitions filed, including un-selected advanced degree exemption petitions.  After the selection process is over, USCIS returns the un-selected petitions along with filing fees, provided they are not duplicate filings.  Chances of getting selected in H-1B Lottery and Past H-1B Quota Trends  In early 1990s, the H-1B cap was rarely reached. By the mid-1990s, cap was filled each year on a first come first served basis. Cap was increased to 115,000 for FY 1999 and FY 2000. Cap was increased to 195,000 for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003. Thus, during these years, the fear for running out of H-1B quota did not materialize. However, during following years cap numbers were available for filled too quickly depending upon economic climate or job market. Please refer to the table below:   Chances of getting selected in H-1B Lottery / H-1B Cap.  (c) Jay Terkiana  USCIS announced on 4/13/2015 that it received approximately 233,000 petitions for FY 2016 Cap Season. This author has used a simple method to assign an approximate percentage. The accurate number cannot be ascertained because of two numbers are missing – i.e. a) How many total US Advanced Degree Exempt petitions were received, b) what is the rollover from H-1B1 (Singapore/Chile) cap, i.e. could account to 6,800 visa numbers. From the table above, in FY 2016 i.e. petitions filed in April 2015, USCIS received 233,000 petitions. After 20,000 U.S. advanced-degree cases were exempted by random selection, approximately 213,000 cases were left in the general lottery for 65,000 spots. This makes for 30.51 percentage chance for selection under regular cap, with 69.49% return petitions. For FY 2015 i.e. for petitions filed in April 2014, USCIS received a total of 172,500 petitions. After 20,000 U.S. advanced-degree cases were exempted by random selection, approximately 152,500 cases were left in the general lottery for 65,000 spots. Therefore it can be concluded that around 51% petitions were returned.  Therefore, during a good job market, with higher demands of H-1B, it is impossible to predict the chances of getting selected in the lottery. No one can assign any percentages or odds, without first knowing how many total petitions USCIS has received for a specific category.  Effective Start Date  Cap subject petitions can only be filed with an effective start date of October 1 of that Fiscal Year. Petitions cannot be filed more than 6 months in advance. Therefore a Petition filed on April 1 will have a start date of no later or earlier than October 1. A petition filed on April 4, can have a start date of October 1 to October 3. These dates must be carefully discussed with your attorney. Chances of getting selected in H-1B Lottery /  H-1B Cap  Who is Exempt from Cap  Certain employers and job positions are not subject to H-1B cap. Which means, they can file H-1B visa any time, with any start date, and are not subject to numerical restrictions. H-1B workers who are petitioned for or employed at an institution of higher education or its affiliated or related nonprofit entities or a nonprofit research organization, or a government research organization are not subject to this numerical cap. H-1B workers performing labor or services in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and Guam may also be exempt from the H-1B cap. Furthermore, certain H-1B holders already counted in the cap may not be subject to cap.   Already been counted against the H-1B quota within the past 6 years: Under most circumstances, H-1B beneficiaries who have previously been counted against the H-1B quota within the past 6 years, will not be subject to the current H1B cap. However, this should be carefully discussed with your attorney, because both USCIS and Consulates have been lately subjecting Beneficiaries to the Cap again, if they never activated their H-1B by either filing change of status to H-1B and working in the US or entering the US on H-1B after receiving a visa stamp on their H-1B. Therefore, under certain circumstances such H-1B Beneficiaries would be considered to be eligible for a new 6 years of H-1B status at the time the petition is filed. This author (Jay Terkiana) does not agree with USCIS or Consular interpretation and application of the law. However, it is safe to file under a new cap in certain scenarios. If a person has worked on an H-1B and even if left the US for more than a year, such person is still considered Cap exempt, and is not subject to cap, by merely being absent from US for over a year. All these issues should very carefully be discussed with your attorney – as small facts and details could make a difference in the outcome of the case. Please see H-1B Cap Exemption if previously selected in H-1B Cap / Quota.  Cap Exempt Employers: H-1B workers who are petitioned/employed by or work at an institution of higher education or its affiliated or related nonprofit entities or a nonprofit research organization, or a government research organization are not subject to this numerical cap. Note: Not all non-profits or government employers are cap exempt. And on the other hand, some for-profit employers can file under cap-exemption if the H-1B Beneficiary will be performing his/her job duties at a qualifying cap-exempt institution. For details on who is exempt from cap, please see H-1B Cap Exempt Employers.  Certain H-1B Physicians: H-1B physicians who have received a J-1 Conrad 20 waiver of the 2-year home/ foreign residency requirement described in section 214(l)(1)(B) or (C) of the Act , based on work in a health professional shortage area are also exempt from H-1B cap.  Concurrent Employment: If Beneficiary has an approved H-1B petition (weather through a cap-subject or cap-exempt employer), such Beneficiary can file a concurrent H-1B (for cap-subject or cap-exempt employer), without having to go through the cap. For example: Let’s say that Beneficiary is employed by a cap exempt non-profit research organization on an H-1B and was never selected in the cap before. He can work for Employer B, a cap-subject employer, if Employer B files a “concurrent” H-1B petition on Beneficiary’s behalf. Note: Concurrent employment or concurrent H-1B has its own limitations and Beneficiary must maintain his status and employment at principal H-1B petitioner. Please see H-1B Concurrent Employment for more details.   Options if not selected in the H-1B Cap  After the selection process is over, USCIS returns the un-selected petitions along with filing fees, provided they are not duplicate filings. There are still some options available if a candidate is not selected in the H-1B Cap or H-1B Quota. Please see Options if not selected in H-1B Cap or H-1B Quota.

The H1B Visa Quota is the allocated number of H1B visas that are available and can be issued in a fiscal year(FY). This quota has a cap-limit that is determined by the US Congress. The current H1B allocation is set to 85,000(Total Visa) = 20,000(US Grads with Masters or Higher Degrees) + 65,000(Common Pool i.e. International Professionals and Students). If a US Grad’s application is not approved in the first 20,000, it is moved for consideration as a Common Pool application. The H1B Extensions/Renewals, H1B Transfers, and H1B cap-exempt visas are not subject to the quota. How does the H1B Quota work? The US Congress determines the number of new H1B visas issued each year. This H1B quota is applicable in its particular financial year that starts on October 1. The USCIS accepts the H1B visa applications for each FY. The H1B employers/sponsors can start filing the H1B visa applications April 1st onwards, and USCIS accepts them until a certain limit is reached for that FY. What is an H1B Sponsor? An H1B Sponsor is a Legally Registered US Corporation/Organization/Company that provides employment to a Foreign national and files an H1B work visa for them so that they can work in the US. To Search for Employers who offer H1B Sponsorship according to job role and location in the United States, visit H1B Visa Sponsors What are the H1B Visa Qualification Requirements? The requirements and eligibility to qualify for an H1B visa are listed below. A candidate is required to meet any/only one of these criteria to be eligible. A Bachelor’s Degree(at least 4 years) or Higher from an accredited University in US or a foreign country. At least 12 years of progressive experience in their occupation. A license to practice in their chosen occupation. A total of 12 years with further education and work experience. What are the ways in which an H1B application can be processed? The H1B Visa applications can be filed by the Sponsor in two ways, depending upon how quickly they need the visa processed and approved. The ‘Regular’ Processing Method takes normal amount of time, whereas, the ‘Premium’ Processing Method is faster, with USCIS providing its decision within 15 calendar days. There is an additional $1,225 fee for Premium Processing.  However, the Premium Processing Method does not affect your chances of H1B Visa getting picked up in the lottery. Number of days taken to reach H1B cap-limit (includes weekends & holidays) Loading... Did You Know? For FY 2008, the entire cap limit was exhausted before the end of the first day the H1B visa applications were accepted (Apr 02, 2007). Did You Know? It took 265 and 301 days in FYs 2010 and 2011 respectively, to reach the H1B visa cap limit. This lengthy duration was mainly due to the aftereffects of economic recession. Did You Know? The H1B cap-exempt visas are sponsored by nonprofit organizations, government research organizations or institutions of higher education. They are unlimited in number and can be filed at any time of the year, and the employee can start working as soon as the visa is approved. Did You Know? A US Master's or higher degree holder is first considered under the Masters’ Cap(20,000 reserved visas), and if not selected is considered under the Common Pool(65,000 total visas). Therefore, they get two chances to get picked up in the lottery! Did You Know? More than one employer can file for an H1B visa for the same foreign national, therefore the employee can work for as many employers whose application is approved. This also helps in the case that the employee decides to switch from one employer to another(both applications approved), they don’t have to file an H1B transfer petition. Did You Know? The H1B Visa Premium Processing Method never affects your chances in the lottery, it is just a faster method to get the results. How App Works  Total H1B Applicants - Fill in what you think might be the total number of H1B visa applicants(including US Master’s or higher degree graduates) for the current FY. USCIS received 199,000 H1B petitions during the filing period for FY 2018. Fill in an estimate of what it would be for FY 2019 according to you.  US Grad H1B Applicants - Fill in what you think would be the number of H1B visa applicants that are US graduates with Master’s or higher degree for the current FY. USCIS does not disclose the actual number of US Grad applicants, however it is estimated to be between 20-60% of the number of total applications. Hence, fill this number matching accordingly with the ‘Total H1B Applicants’ you have entered above.  Total H1B Visa Quota - The H1B Visa Quota is the allocated number of H1B visas that are available and can be issued in an FY. This quota has a cap-limit that is determined by the US Congress. The H1B Quota for FY 2019 is 85,000 = 20,000(US Grads with Masters or Higher Degrees) + 65,000(Common Pool i.e. International Professionals and Students). This is a fixed value i.e. you cannot make changes to this number.  H1B Visa Quota for US Grads - A US Master's or higher degree holder is first considered under the Masters’ Cap(20,000 reserved visas), and if not selected is considered under the Common Pool(65,000 total visas). Therefore, they get two chances to get picked up in the lottery. This is a fixed value i.e. you cannot make changes to this number.  Category - There are two options to choose from: US Grad and Common Pool. If you are a US Graduate with Master’s or higher degree, select ‘US Grad’, otherwise if you are an international professional or student, select ‘Common Pool’.  Number of H1B Sponsors - An H1B Sponsor is the US Employer who files an H1B visa for an employee with a foreign nationality. More than one employer can file for an H1B visa for the same foreign national. Please fill in the number of H1B Sponsors that are filing for an H1B visa application or you.

Quota for Common ? :       Quota for Grads ? :       Total Applicants ? :       Percent of Grad Applicants ? :       Number of Sponsors ? :    1  2  3  4  5             Estimated Probabilities    Common Pool:       Grads:        Understand The Two-Step Random Selection Process  The lottery takes place when the number of H-1B applications exceeds the cap-limit.
    First, a lottery is held to award the 20,000 visas available to advanced degree (master’s/doctor's) holders,
    and those not selected are then entered in the regular lottery for the other 65,000 visas.
    Those without a U.S. master’s/doctor's are entered only in the second, regular, lottery.
    So people with advanced degrees have higher chances to win the lottery.  The probabilities depend on five factors:  the quota (cap) for college students (65,000 since 2004)  the quota for graduate students (20,000 since 2004)  the number of total applicants: 236,000 in 2016, 233,000 in 2015, 172,500 in 2014, 124,000 in 2013)  the percentage of graduate applicants in the total applicants (USCIS does not disclose this information, so need to guess)  the number of sponsors*   *Please be advised that USCIS prohibits a given employer filing multiple or duplicative H-1B petitions for the same employee.            ×  Quota (Cap) for Common Pool    Quota allocated for common pool (bachelor's).
            65,000 visas are allocated in the common pool since 2004.            ×  Quota (Cap) for Graduate Students    Quota allocated for graduate students (with Master’s/Doctor’s).
            20,000 visas are allocated in the grad pool since 2004.            ×  Number of Total Applicants    The number of applicants is increasing after recovery from 2008 financial crisis:
            236,000 in 2016 and 233,000 in 2015.            ×  Percent of Grad Applicants    Percentage of graduate applicants in the total applicants.
            USCIS does not disclose this information, so it needs to be guessed.            ×  Number of Sponsors    The number of sponsors (employers) filing an H-1B visa for you.

Chances of getting selected in H-1B Lottery / H-1B Cap Published on April 11, 2015 Jay Terkiana Follow Following Unfollow Jay Terkiana Sign in to follow this author Managing Immigration Attorney at SAC Attorneys LLP What is H-1B Cap /  H-1B Quota?  The H-1B visa has an annual numerical limit, also referred to as “cap”, of 65,000 visas each fiscal year. The US Federal Government’s fiscal year is the 12-month period ending on 30 September of that year, having begun on 1 October of the previous calendar year. For Example the fiscal year 2016, written as “FY2016″, begins on 1 October 2015 and ends on 30 September 2016.  The first 20,000 petitions filed on behalf of employees/beneficiaries with a U.S. master’s degree or higher are exempt from the cap. Additionally, H-1B workers who are petitioned for or employed at an institution of higher education or its affiliated or related nonprofit entities or a nonprofit research organization, or a government research organization are not subject to this numerical cap.  Therefore, only 85,000 “new” H-1B visas are available each fiscal year. This includes 65,000 visas under the regular cap and 20,000 under the master’s cap. This numerical limitation is referred to as H1B cap.  Masters Cap: Out of this total of 85,000 visas available each fiscal year, 20,000 are restricted to individuals who have received master’s or higher degree from U.S colleges or universities. This 20,000 numerical limitation is referred to as H1B Master’s cap. Once this 20,000 limit is reached, any petitions filed for beneficiaries with a U.S. master’s degree or higher will count against the regular cap (remaining 65,000 visas).  Regular Cap: The reaming 65,000 visas are referred to as Regular Cap. Please note that up to 6,800 visas are set aside from the 65,000 each fiscal year for the H-1B1 program under the terms of the legislation implementing the U.S.-Chile and U.S.-Singapore free trade agreements. Unused visas in this group become available for H-1B use for the next fiscal year.  Filing Period and H-1B Lottery Selection Process  Under the current regulations, H-1B petition can be filed upto 6 months in advance. Therefore for every fiscal year, petitions can be submitted as early as April 1. Due to an increased demand and number of H-1B visa filings, USCIS receives a sufficient number of H1B cap filings to reach both the 65,000 regular cap limit and the 20,000 advanced-degree exemptions on April 1 or around April 1 every year, depending upon economy, job market and H-1B demand.  Upon receiving sufficient number of petitions, USCIS announces that it has reached the congressionally mandated H-1B cap for that particular fiscal year. Before running the lottery, USCIS will complete initial intake for all filings received during the filing period. USCIS then uses a computer-generated process, also known as the lottery, to randomly select the petitions needed to meet 65,000 visas for regular cap and 20,000 for the advanced-degree exemptions cap.  USCIS first randomly selects petitions for the master’s cap advanced degree exemption. Once 20,000 petitions are selected, all the remaining unselected master’s cap advanced degree petitions will become part of the random selection process for the 65,000 general limit. USCIS then randomly selects 65,000 petitions from the pool of all the petitions filed, including un-selected advanced degree exemption petitions.  After the selection process is over, USCIS returns the un-selected petitions along with filing fees, provided they are not duplicate filings.  Chances of getting selected in H-1B Lottery and Past H-1B Quota Trends  In early 1990s, the H-1B cap was rarely reached. By the mid-1990s, cap was filled each year on a first come first served basis. Cap was increased to 115,000 for FY 1999 and FY 2000. Cap was increased to 195,000 for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003. Thus, during these years, the fear for running out of H-1B quota did not materialize. However, during following years cap numbers were available for filled too quickly depending upon economic climate or job market. Please refer to the table below:   Chances of getting selected in H-1B Lottery / H-1B Cap.  (c) Jay Terkiana  USCIS announced on 4/13/2015 that it received approximately 233,000 petitions for FY 2016 Cap Season. This author has used a simple method to assign an approximate percentage. The accurate number cannot be ascertained because of two numbers are missing – i.e. a) How many total US Advanced Degree Exempt petitions were received, b) what is the rollover from H-1B1 (Singapore/Chile) cap, i.e. could account to 6,800 visa numbers. From the table above, in FY 2016 i.e. petitions filed in April 2015, USCIS received 233,000 petitions. After 20,000 U.S. advanced-degree cases were exempted by random selection, approximately 213,000 cases were left in the general lottery for 65,000 spots. This makes for 30.51 percentage chance for selection under regular cap, with 69.49% return petitions. For FY 2015 i.e. for petitions filed in April 2014, USCIS received a total of 172,500 petitions. After 20,000 U.S. advanced-degree cases were exempted by random selection, approximately 152,500 cases were left in the general lottery for 65,000 spots. Therefore it can be concluded that around 51% petitions were returned.  Therefore, during a good job market, with higher demands of H-1B, it is impossible to predict the chances of getting selected in the lottery. No one can assign any percentages or odds, without first knowing how many total petitions USCIS has received for a specific category.  Effective Start Date  Cap subject petitions can only be filed with an effective start date of October 1 of that Fiscal Year. Petitions cannot be filed more than 6 months in advance. Therefore a Petition filed on April 1 will have a start date of no later or earlier than October 1. A petition filed on April 4, can have a start date of October 1 to October 3. These dates must be carefully discussed with your attorney. Chances of getting selected in H-1B Lottery /  H-1B Cap  Who is Exempt from Cap  Certain employers and job positions are not subject to H-1B cap. Which means, they can file H-1B visa any time, with any start date, and are not subject to numerical restrictions. H-1B workers who are petitioned for or employed at an institution of higher education or its affiliated or related nonprofit entities or a nonprofit research organization, or a government research organization are not subject to this numerical cap. H-1B workers performing labor or services in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and Guam may also be exempt from the H-1B cap. Furthermore, certain H-1B holders already counted in the cap may not be subject to cap.   Already been counted against the H-1B quota within the past 6 years: Under most circumstances, H-1B beneficiaries who have previously been counted against the H-1B quota within the past 6 years, will not be subject to the current H1B cap. However, this should be carefully discussed with your attorney, because both USCIS and Consulates have been lately subjecting Beneficiaries to the Cap again, if they never activated their H-1B by either filing change of status to H-1B and working in the US or entering the US on H-1B after receiving a visa stamp on their H-1B. Therefore, under certain circumstances such H-1B Beneficiaries would be considered to be eligible for a new 6 years of H-1B status at the time the petition is filed. This author (Jay Terkiana) does not agree with USCIS or Consular interpretation and application of the law. However, it is safe to file under a new cap in certain scenarios. If a person has worked on an H-1B and even if left the US for more than a year, such person is still considered Cap exempt, and is not subject to cap, by merely being absent from US for over a year. All these issues should very carefully be discussed with your attorney – as small facts and details could make a difference in the outcome of the case. Please see H-1B Cap Exemption if previously selected in H-1B Cap / Quota.  Cap Exempt Employers: H-1B workers who are petitioned/employed by or work at an institution of higher education or its affiliated or related nonprofit entities or a nonprofit research organization, or a government research organization are not subject to this numerical cap. Note: Not all non-profits or government employers are cap exempt. And on the other hand, some for-profit employers can file under cap-exemption if the H-1B Beneficiary will be performing his/her job duties at a qualifying cap-exempt institution. For details on who is exempt from cap, please see H-1B Cap Exempt Employers.  Certain H-1B Physicians: H-1B physicians who have received a J-1 Conrad 20 waiver of the 2-year home/ foreign residency requirement described in section 214(l)(1)(B) or (C) of the Act , based on work in a health professional shortage area are also exempt from H-1B cap.  Concurrent Employment: If Beneficiary has an approved H-1B petition (weather through a cap-subject or cap-exempt employer), such Beneficiary can file a concurrent H-1B (for cap-subject or cap-exempt employer), without having to go through the cap. For example: Let’s say that Beneficiary is employed by a cap exempt non-profit research organization on an H-1B and was never selected in the cap before. He can work for Employer B, a cap-subject employer, if Employer B files a “concurrent” H-1B petition on Beneficiary’s behalf. Note: Concurrent employment or concurrent H-1B has its own limitations and Beneficiary must maintain his status and employment at principal H-1B petitioner. Please see H-1B Concurrent Employment for more details.   Options if not selected in the H-1B Cap  After the selection process is over, USCIS returns the un-selected petitions along with filing fees, provided they are not duplicate filings. There are still some options available if a candidate is not selected in the H-1B Cap or H-1B Quota. Please see Options if not selected in H-1B Cap or H-1B Quota.

The H1B Visa Quota is the allocated number of H1B visas that are available and can be issued in a fiscal year(FY). This quota has a cap-limit that is determined by the US Congress. The current H1B allocation is set to 85,000(Total Visa) = 20,000(US Grads with Masters or Higher Degrees) + 65,000(Common Pool i.e. International Professionals and Students). If a US Grad’s application is not approved in the first 20,000, it is moved for consideration as a Common Pool application. The H1B Extensions/Renewals, H1B Transfers, and H1B cap-exempt visas are not subject to the quota. How does the H1B Quota work? The US Congress determines the number of new H1B visas issued each year. This H1B quota is applicable in its particular financial year that starts on October 1. The USCIS accepts the H1B visa applications for each FY. The H1B employers/sponsors can start filing the H1B visa applications April 1st onwards, and USCIS accepts them until a certain limit is reached for that FY. What is an H1B Sponsor? An H1B Sponsor is a Legally Registered US Corporation/Organization/Company that provides employment to a Foreign national and files an H1B work visa for them so that they can work in the US. To Search for Employers who offer H1B Sponsorship according to job role and location in the United States, visit H1B Visa Sponsors What are the H1B Visa Qualification Requirements? The requirements and eligibility to qualify for an H1B visa are listed below. A candidate is required to meet any/only one of these criteria to be eligible. A Bachelor’s Degree(at least 4 years) or Higher from an accredited University in US or a foreign country. At least 12 years of progressive experience in their occupation. A license to practice in their chosen occupation. A total of 12 years with further education and work experience. What are the ways in which an H1B application can be processed? The H1B Visa applications can be filed by the Sponsor in two ways, depending upon how quickly they need the visa processed and approved. The ‘Regular’ Processing Method takes normal amount of time, whereas, the ‘Premium’ Processing Method is faster, with USCIS providing its decision within 15 calendar days. There is an additional $1,225 fee for Premium Processing.  However, the Premium Processing Method does not affect your chances of H1B Visa getting picked up in the lottery. Number of days taken to reach H1B cap-limit (includes weekends & holidays) Loading... Did You Know? For FY 2008, the entire cap limit was exhausted before the end of the first day the H1B visa applications were accepted (Apr 02, 2007). Did You Know? It took 265 and 301 days in FYs 2010 and 2011 respectively, to reach the H1B visa cap limit. This lengthy duration was mainly due to the aftereffects of economic recession. Did You Know? The H1B cap-exempt visas are sponsored by nonprofit organizations, government research organizations or institutions of higher education. They are unlimited in number and can be filed at any time of the year, and the employee can start working as soon as the visa is approved. Did You Know? A US Master's or higher degree holder is first considered under the Masters’ Cap(20,000 reserved visas), and if not selected is considered under the Common Pool(65,000 total visas). Therefore, they get two chances to get picked up in the lottery! Did You Know? More than one employer can file for an H1B visa for the same foreign national, therefore the employee can work for as many employers whose application is approved. This also helps in the case that the employee decides to switch from one employer to another(both applications approved), they don’t have to file an H1B transfer petition. Did You Know? The H1B Visa Premium Processing Method never affects your chances in the lottery, it is just a faster method to get the results. How App Works  Total H1B Applicants - Fill in what you think might be the total number of H1B visa applicants(including US Master’s or higher degree graduates) for the current FY. USCIS received 199,000 H1B petitions during the filing period for FY 2018. Fill in an estimate of what it would be for FY 2019 according to you.  US Grad H1B Applicants - Fill in what you think would be the number of H1B visa applicants that are US graduates with Master’s or higher degree for the current FY. USCIS does not disclose the actual number of US Grad applicants, however it is estimated to be between 20-60% of the number of total applications. Hence, fill this number matching accordingly with the ‘Total H1B Applicants’ you have entered above.  Total H1B Visa Quota - The H1B Visa Quota is the allocated number of H1B visas that are available and can be issued in an FY. This quota has a cap-limit that is determined by the US Congress. The H1B Quota for FY 2019 is 85,000 = 20,000(US Grads with Masters or Higher Degrees) + 65,000(Common Pool i.e. International Professionals and Students). This is a fixed value i.e. you cannot make changes to this number.  H1B Visa Quota for US Grads - A US Master's or higher degree holder is first considered under the Masters’ Cap(20,000 reserved visas), and if not selected is considered under the Common Pool(65,000 total visas). Therefore, they get two chances to get picked up in the lottery. This is a fixed value i.e. you cannot make changes to this number.  Category - There are two options to choose from: US Grad and Common Pool. If you are a US Graduate with Master’s or higher degree, select ‘US Grad’, otherwise if you are an international professional or student, select ‘Common Pool’.  Number of H1B Sponsors - An H1B Sponsor is the US Employer who files an H1B visa for an employee with a foreign nationality. More than one employer can file for an H1B visa for the same foreign national. Please fill in the number of H1B Sponsors that are filing for an H1B visa application or you.

      Thus, the number of applicants is reduced by random selection (H1B Lottery).
      How to calculate the probabilities/chances of getting H-1B visa?
      You can find out below.         Quota for Common ? :       Quota for Grads ? :       Total Applicants ? :       Percent of Grad Applicants ? :       Number of Sponsors ? :    1  2  3  4  5             Estimated Probabilities    Common Pool:       Grads:        Understand The Two-Step Random Selection Process  The lottery takes place when the number of H-1B applications exceeds the cap-limit.
    First, a lottery is held to award the 20,000 visas available to advanced degree (master’s/doctor's) holders,
    and those not selected are then entered in the regular lottery for the other 65,000 visas.
    Those without a U.S. master’s/doctor's are entered only in the second, regular, lottery.
    So people with advanced degrees have higher chances to win the lottery.  The probabilities depend on five factors:  the quota (cap) for college students (65,000 since 2004)  the quota for graduate students (20,000 since 2004)  the number of total applicants: 236,000 in 2016, 233,000 in 2015, 172,500 in 2014, 124,000 in 2013)  the percentage of graduate applicants in the total applicants (USCIS does not disclose this information, so need to guess)  the number of sponsors*   *Please be advised that USCIS prohibits a given employer filing multiple or duplicative H-1B petitions for the same employee.            ×  Quota (Cap) for Common Pool    Quota allocated for common pool (bachelor's).
            65,000 visas are allocated in the common pool since 2004.            ×  Quota (Cap) for Graduate Students    Quota allocated for graduate students (with Master’s/Doctor’s).
            20,000 visas are allocated in the grad pool since 2004.            ×  Number of Total Applicants    The number of applicants is increasing after recovery from 2008 financial crisis:
            236,000 in 2016 and 233,000 in 2015.            ×  Percent of Grad Applicants    Percentage of graduate applicants in the total applicants.
            USCIS does not disclose this information, so it needs to be guessed.            ×  Number of Sponsors    The number of sponsors (employers) filing an H-1B visa for you.
