KidsHealth / For Teens / Can You Get Pregnant From Fingering?     Print I've never had sex but my boyfriend fingers me. Can you get pregnant from fingering? – Ciara*  Fingering on its own can't lead to pregnancy. But it is possible to get pregnant if a guy gets pre-ejaculate (precum) or ejaculate on his finger and then puts it in a girl's vagina. The chances of this happening are low, though.  A more likely situation than pregnancy is getting an infection from fingering. So not only will you need to avoid any contact with precum or ejaculate, your boyfriend should wash his hands first and you should make sure neither of you has cuts and sores.  If you have any questions or concerns, or if you think you might have an infection, talk to your doctor.  *Names have been changed to protect user privacy.

Top 4 Questions Revealed        Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-Cum? Top 4 Questions Revealed   By  Pobby -   April 12, 2016  51       Share on Facebook  Tweet on Twitter     tweet    pre cum and pregnant       Many people take the risk of having sex without protection because they believe that as long as they don’t cum, the woman won’t get pregnant. While this makes perfect sense, it’s not the case at all. Precum can cause a woman to get pregnant although the male didn’t fully ejaculate inside of her.  Pulling out may lower the risk of getting pregnant, but there will always be a chance of pregnancy due to precum. Let’s determine what precum is first before we dig deeper into the subject.   Table of Contents What is Precum? Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum? Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum? Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy? Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  What is Precum?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum? The short answer is yes. Precum occurs when a male is aroused and before a person has an orgasm. Now, this white sticky fluid isn’t as thick as regular cum and won’t have the same potency.  In fact, precum doesn’t contain any sperm – at all. But, it can still get you pregnant. The issue is that this precum flows through the same opening that cum does. So, leftover sperm is picked up in the urethra, will travel with the pre cum and can cause pregnancy.  Scientists still don’t know the exact reason for pre-ejaculate, but they believe that it helps reduce the acidity in the vagina. Ultimately, by reducing the acidity levels, the sperm would survive longer inside of the vagina as it travels. Acid will kill the sperm, so pre cum aims to lessen this acidity to promote fertilization.  Can precum get you pregnant? Absolutely, but the chances are much lower than regular cum.   Studies found that out of a sampling of 27 men, only 41% of them had sperm in their precum. The amount of sperm present was very low, but that doesn’t indicate that pregnancy can’t occur. There is simply a lower chance for pregnancy.  If you’re practicing the pull out method, you’ll want to ensure that cum does not come in contact with the vagina at all. Many couples believe that as long as cum is on the outside of the body, the woman won’t get pregnant. However, this is only partially correct. Cum located near the vagina can travel inside of the vagina with even just a drip of cum.  So, you want to ensure that you do not ejaculate on the outside of the vagina or in the immediate vicinity. Even a minute amount of ejaculate contains enough sperm for a woman to get pregnant. Instead, you want to wear a condom or ensure that the woman is on birth control to prevent any unexpected pregnancies from occurring.   Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum?  Precum has been associated with a “safe way” to ensure that STDs are not transferred. This is misinformation that every couple should be aware of. Studies have demonstrated that HIV is present in the majority of precum samples.  This demonstrates that precum can carry an STD.  A major issue exists with precum because it often flows through the urethra and escapes out of the tip of the penis unnoticed. Unlike ejaculation, men are not able to feel precum and won’t know when precum is starting to come out of the body.  Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum?  Pre-ejaculate occurs before ejaculation. When a man reaches this point, there will be two times in which a woman can become pregnant:   High Risk: A high of pregnancy exists if a man ejaculates fully during intercourse. This would occur after precum.  Low Risk: Precum without full ejaculation presents a low risk of pregnancy.   There is a very low amount of sperm in precum fluid. This amount is much lower than what is present inside of a man’s cum, but there is still a risk of pregnancy occurring.  A good way to visualize this is to know how much sperm is found within normal cum. In normal ejaculation, there are approximately 100 million sperm in just one milliliter of fluid. This sperm then gets lessened because only 10 million sperm will get past cervical mucus in the woman’s vagina.  [Read more about Cervical Mucus]  The uterine tract will also filter an additional 10% of sperm, leaving just 1 million sperm left. Ultimately, only 100,000 sperm that will exist long enough to enter the fallopian tubes. This all occurs when there is 100 million sperm. Precum only contains 3 million sperm on average (when present).  The chances of pregnancy are extremely low, but they do exist.  Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy?  Avoiding pregnancy requires diligence and some other form of contraceptive aside from the famous pull out method. There are plenty of forms of contraceptives on the market, but the most common are:   Condoms: A very highly effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs. Condoms are worn over the penis and trap semen before it’s allowed to enter into the vagina. There is a 0.02 chance of becoming pregnancy when a condom is worn.  Female Condom: While not as common, the female condom can be purchased over-the-counter and has proven to be 95% effective at protecting against pregnancy. More expensive, a female condom is more durable and can be inserted into the vagina up to 8 hours before intercourse.  Birth Control : Birth control can be highly effective, but it depends on the woman. The percentage of protection that birth control provides is 91% – 99%. The 91% protection is a little low for most people and will provide a 9% chance of pregnancy. Ultimately, 1 out of 12 people on birth control can become pregnant based off of these statistics.   A mix of contraceptives is recommended to boost the risk of successful pregnancy avoidance. Typically, a condom and birth control are used in conjunction with one another to ensure the utmost in protection against getting pregnant. The pullout method can be used at this time to further reduce the risk of getting pregnant.  Contraceptive implants are becoming more popular and require surgery to be implanted in the body. These implants are very effective, yet they come with side effects that can be life threatening and will be very costly.  Male sterilization provides full protection against pregnancy. A woman can get her tubes tied , which would reduce the risk of pregnancy with a very high accuracy rate. While 99.9% effective, there have been cases wherein a woman with her tubes tied did get pregnant, but this is not the norm.  Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum when dry humping? There is always a possibility, but the chances are so small that it is very unlikely. Since precum contains such little sperm, if any, there is already a small chance of getting pregnant.  Since dry humping occurs outside of the body, it would take a drop of precum to drip into the vagina and pass through the cervical mucus all the way into the fallopian tubes for pregnancy to occur.  Can it happen? Hypothetically, it can happen, but the chances are extremely low. In fact, the chances are so low that it would be nearly impossible for pregnancy to occur with dry humping.  [Read more about Dry Humping]  Precum does contain sperm in most samples thanks to the cut in the urethra. If you’re trying to avoid pregnancy, make sure you do not allow precum to enter into the vagina.

Would the person who fully ejaculated be more likely to make a woman pregnant?    Reply         Andrea Miller   July 15, 2017 at 5:05 am     Yes, there is a chance of getting pregnant with full ejaculation. As you know cum contains sperm and if the male sperm comes in contacts with a vagina then, the chances are high to get pregnant. According to NHS http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/975.aspx you can easily get pregnant from cum/discharge and also if you don’t to want to pregnant then, make sure you follow the precaution https://thelifesquare.com/pregnant-from-precum-8575481/ .

The chances are extremely slim, near zero but highly unlikely    Reply           Jess20   October 2, 2017 at 8:10 am     Had sex with boyfriend, using the pullout method, have never gotten pregnant(been doing it for more than a year with him), since I’m not on BC we usually do it once a day, we had a fuck it lets do it twice moment, he came, wiped it off, went to the bathroom fully once then forced it out two more times, even washed his entire dick with soap then we went at it again, we started regretting it a few hours later. I’m currently a broke college student, I don’t have health insurance, and I know I fucked up I knew the risk, I don’t need to hear the ‘oh well you should of gotten some sort of protection’. I’m just here to see if anyone has gone through the same situation. — For anyone wondering if the pullout method works. YES PULLOUT METHOD HAS WORKED FOR ME BUT ONLY ONCE A DAY. IT DOESNT WORK FOR EVERYONE OKAY? The guy has to be in complete control and know when he’s close, if you’re sexually inexperienced DO NOT try the pullout method, it might be working for me and my boyfriend also because of how fertile we are. We’ve never gone to the doctor(Which I know is really stupid and I highly recommend to go check yourself out if you’re having unprotected sex). I’m irregular and have extremely bad periods since I can remember but I’m assuming I may not be that fertile because of it. Do not be stupid and just use a condom and get on birth control.

He ended up cumming but not inside of me, he pulled out and pumped himself until he came. December 7th was the day that we did it the first time, but we both didn’t reach our climax. December 8th he came but pulled out and as I said, pumped himself until he came. He says that he’s almost 100% sure that no precum got inside of me and we’ve done it twice. What are the chances that I’m pregnant? My menstrual period starts around either the 20th or the 25th.

Top 4 Questions Revealed        Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-Cum? Top 4 Questions Revealed   By  Pobby -   April 12, 2016  51       Share on Facebook  Tweet on Twitter     tweet    pre cum and pregnant       Many people take the risk of having sex without protection because they believe that as long as they don’t cum, the woman won’t get pregnant. While this makes perfect sense, it’s not the case at all. Precum can cause a woman to get pregnant although the male didn’t fully ejaculate inside of her.  Pulling out may lower the risk of getting pregnant, but there will always be a chance of pregnancy due to precum. Let’s determine what precum is first before we dig deeper into the subject.   Table of Contents What is Precum? Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum? Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum? Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy? Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  What is Precum?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum? The short answer is yes. Precum occurs when a male is aroused and before a person has an orgasm. Now, this white sticky fluid isn’t as thick as regular cum and won’t have the same potency.  In fact, precum doesn’t contain any sperm – at all. But, it can still get you pregnant. The issue is that this precum flows through the same opening that cum does. So, leftover sperm is picked up in the urethra, will travel with the pre cum and can cause pregnancy.  Scientists still don’t know the exact reason for pre-ejaculate, but they believe that it helps reduce the acidity in the vagina. Ultimately, by reducing the acidity levels, the sperm would survive longer inside of the vagina as it travels. Acid will kill the sperm, so pre cum aims to lessen this acidity to promote fertilization.  Can precum get you pregnant? Absolutely, but the chances are much lower than regular cum.   Studies found that out of a sampling of 27 men, only 41% of them had sperm in their precum. The amount of sperm present was very low, but that doesn’t indicate that pregnancy can’t occur. There is simply a lower chance for pregnancy.  If you’re practicing the pull out method, you’ll want to ensure that cum does not come in contact with the vagina at all. Many couples believe that as long as cum is on the outside of the body, the woman won’t get pregnant. However, this is only partially correct. Cum located near the vagina can travel inside of the vagina with even just a drip of cum.  So, you want to ensure that you do not ejaculate on the outside of the vagina or in the immediate vicinity. Even a minute amount of ejaculate contains enough sperm for a woman to get pregnant. Instead, you want to wear a condom or ensure that the woman is on birth control to prevent any unexpected pregnancies from occurring.   Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum?  Precum has been associated with a “safe way” to ensure that STDs are not transferred. This is misinformation that every couple should be aware of. Studies have demonstrated that HIV is present in the majority of precum samples.  This demonstrates that precum can carry an STD.  A major issue exists with precum because it often flows through the urethra and escapes out of the tip of the penis unnoticed. Unlike ejaculation, men are not able to feel precum and won’t know when precum is starting to come out of the body.  Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum?  Pre-ejaculate occurs before ejaculation. When a man reaches this point, there will be two times in which a woman can become pregnant:   High Risk: A high of pregnancy exists if a man ejaculates fully during intercourse. This would occur after precum.  Low Risk: Precum without full ejaculation presents a low risk of pregnancy.   There is a very low amount of sperm in precum fluid. This amount is much lower than what is present inside of a man’s cum, but there is still a risk of pregnancy occurring.  A good way to visualize this is to know how much sperm is found within normal cum. In normal ejaculation, there are approximately 100 million sperm in just one milliliter of fluid. This sperm then gets lessened because only 10 million sperm will get past cervical mucus in the woman’s vagina.  [Read more about Cervical Mucus]  The uterine tract will also filter an additional 10% of sperm, leaving just 1 million sperm left. Ultimately, only 100,000 sperm that will exist long enough to enter the fallopian tubes. This all occurs when there is 100 million sperm. Precum only contains 3 million sperm on average (when present).  The chances of pregnancy are extremely low, but they do exist.  Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy?  Avoiding pregnancy requires diligence and some other form of contraceptive aside from the famous pull out method. There are plenty of forms of contraceptives on the market, but the most common are:   Condoms: A very highly effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs. Condoms are worn over the penis and trap semen before it’s allowed to enter into the vagina. There is a 0.02 chance of becoming pregnancy when a condom is worn.  Female Condom: While not as common, the female condom can be purchased over-the-counter and has proven to be 95% effective at protecting against pregnancy. More expensive, a female condom is more durable and can be inserted into the vagina up to 8 hours before intercourse.  Birth Control : Birth control can be highly effective, but it depends on the woman. The percentage of protection that birth control provides is 91% – 99%. The 91% protection is a little low for most people and will provide a 9% chance of pregnancy. Ultimately, 1 out of 12 people on birth control can become pregnant based off of these statistics.   A mix of contraceptives is recommended to boost the risk of successful pregnancy avoidance. Typically, a condom and birth control are used in conjunction with one another to ensure the utmost in protection against getting pregnant. The pullout method can be used at this time to further reduce the risk of getting pregnant.  Contraceptive implants are becoming more popular and require surgery to be implanted in the body. These implants are very effective, yet they come with side effects that can be life threatening and will be very costly.  Male sterilization provides full protection against pregnancy. A woman can get her tubes tied , which would reduce the risk of pregnancy with a very high accuracy rate. While 99.9% effective, there have been cases wherein a woman with her tubes tied did get pregnant, but this is not the norm.  Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum when dry humping? There is always a possibility, but the chances are so small that it is very unlikely. Since precum contains such little sperm, if any, there is already a small chance of getting pregnant.  Since dry humping occurs outside of the body, it would take a drop of precum to drip into the vagina and pass through the cervical mucus all the way into the fallopian tubes for pregnancy to occur.  Can it happen? Hypothetically, it can happen, but the chances are extremely low. In fact, the chances are so low that it would be nearly impossible for pregnancy to occur with dry humping.  [Read more about Dry Humping]  Precum does contain sperm in most samples thanks to the cut in the urethra. If you’re trying to avoid pregnancy, make sure you do not allow precum to enter into the vagina.

Would the person who fully ejaculated be more likely to make a woman pregnant?    Reply         Andrea Miller   July 15, 2017 at 5:05 am     Yes, there is a chance of getting pregnant with full ejaculation. As you know cum contains sperm and if the male sperm comes in contacts with a vagina then, the chances are high to get pregnant. According to NHS http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/975.aspx you can easily get pregnant from cum/discharge and also if you don’t to want to pregnant then, make sure you follow the precaution https://thelifesquare.com/pregnant-from-precum-8575481/ .

The chances are extremely slim, near zero but highly unlikely    Reply           Jess20   October 2, 2017 at 8:10 am     Had sex with boyfriend, using the pullout method, have never gotten pregnant(been doing it for more than a year with him), since I’m not on BC we usually do it once a day, we had a fuck it lets do it twice moment, he came, wiped it off, went to the bathroom fully once then forced it out two more times, even washed his entire dick with soap then we went at it again, we started regretting it a few hours later. I’m currently a broke college student, I don’t have health insurance, and I know I fucked up I knew the risk, I don’t need to hear the ‘oh well you should of gotten some sort of protection’. I’m just here to see if anyone has gone through the same situation. — For anyone wondering if the pullout method works. YES PULLOUT METHOD HAS WORKED FOR ME BUT ONLY ONCE A DAY. IT DOESNT WORK FOR EVERYONE OKAY? The guy has to be in complete control and know when he’s close, if you’re sexually inexperienced DO NOT try the pullout method, it might be working for me and my boyfriend also because of how fertile we are. We’ve never gone to the doctor(Which I know is really stupid and I highly recommend to go check yourself out if you’re having unprotected sex). I’m irregular and have extremely bad periods since I can remember but I’m assuming I may not be that fertile because of it. Do not be stupid and just use a condom and get on birth control.

He ended up cumming but not inside of me, he pulled out and pumped himself until he came. December 7th was the day that we did it the first time, but we both didn’t reach our climax. December 8th he came but pulled out and as I said, pumped himself until he came. He says that he’s almost 100% sure that no precum got inside of me and we’ve done it twice. What are the chances that I’m pregnant? My menstrual period starts around either the 20th or the 25th.

Reply         Henny   January 8, 2018 at 3:20 pm     My boyfriend and I did naked grinding for less then 2 min and I was a day before I ovulate. Is there a chance that pre cum can be all over my vaginal opening?  We had protected sex afterwards. Will the penetrative action push the sperm from the precum into my vagine?  Is there a chance that I’ll get pregnant?    Reply         H.   February 2, 2018 at 12:25 am     So me and my bf have had sex while I was on my period and the day after and maybe a week after that. We didn’t use protection when I was in my period, and the last couple of times we had sex without a condom for a bit before he put a condom on. I want to know for SURE if it’s a possibility that I am pregnant because my boobs have been  sore lately and I haven’t started my next period yet which worries me.

Top 4 Questions Revealed        Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-Cum? Top 4 Questions Revealed   By  Pobby -   April 12, 2016  51       Share on Facebook  Tweet on Twitter     tweet    pre cum and pregnant       Many people take the risk of having sex without protection because they believe that as long as they don’t cum, the woman won’t get pregnant. While this makes perfect sense, it’s not the case at all. Precum can cause a woman to get pregnant although the male didn’t fully ejaculate inside of her.  Pulling out may lower the risk of getting pregnant, but there will always be a chance of pregnancy due to precum. Let’s determine what precum is first before we dig deeper into the subject.   Table of Contents What is Precum? Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum? Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum? Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy? Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  What is Precum?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum? The short answer is yes. Precum occurs when a male is aroused and before a person has an orgasm. Now, this white sticky fluid isn’t as thick as regular cum and won’t have the same potency.  In fact, precum doesn’t contain any sperm – at all. But, it can still get you pregnant. The issue is that this precum flows through the same opening that cum does. So, leftover sperm is picked up in the urethra, will travel with the pre cum and can cause pregnancy.  Scientists still don’t know the exact reason for pre-ejaculate, but they believe that it helps reduce the acidity in the vagina. Ultimately, by reducing the acidity levels, the sperm would survive longer inside of the vagina as it travels. Acid will kill the sperm, so pre cum aims to lessen this acidity to promote fertilization.  Can precum get you pregnant? Absolutely, but the chances are much lower than regular cum.   Studies found that out of a sampling of 27 men, only 41% of them had sperm in their precum. The amount of sperm present was very low, but that doesn’t indicate that pregnancy can’t occur. There is simply a lower chance for pregnancy.  If you’re practicing the pull out method, you’ll want to ensure that cum does not come in contact with the vagina at all. Many couples believe that as long as cum is on the outside of the body, the woman won’t get pregnant. However, this is only partially correct. Cum located near the vagina can travel inside of the vagina with even just a drip of cum.  So, you want to ensure that you do not ejaculate on the outside of the vagina or in the immediate vicinity. Even a minute amount of ejaculate contains enough sperm for a woman to get pregnant. Instead, you want to wear a condom or ensure that the woman is on birth control to prevent any unexpected pregnancies from occurring.   Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum?  Precum has been associated with a “safe way” to ensure that STDs are not transferred. This is misinformation that every couple should be aware of. Studies have demonstrated that HIV is present in the majority of precum samples.  This demonstrates that precum can carry an STD.  A major issue exists with precum because it often flows through the urethra and escapes out of the tip of the penis unnoticed. Unlike ejaculation, men are not able to feel precum and won’t know when precum is starting to come out of the body.  Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum?  Pre-ejaculate occurs before ejaculation. When a man reaches this point, there will be two times in which a woman can become pregnant:   High Risk: A high of pregnancy exists if a man ejaculates fully during intercourse. This would occur after precum.  Low Risk: Precum without full ejaculation presents a low risk of pregnancy.   There is a very low amount of sperm in precum fluid. This amount is much lower than what is present inside of a man’s cum, but there is still a risk of pregnancy occurring.  A good way to visualize this is to know how much sperm is found within normal cum. In normal ejaculation, there are approximately 100 million sperm in just one milliliter of fluid. This sperm then gets lessened because only 10 million sperm will get past cervical mucus in the woman’s vagina.  [Read more about Cervical Mucus]  The uterine tract will also filter an additional 10% of sperm, leaving just 1 million sperm left. Ultimately, only 100,000 sperm that will exist long enough to enter the fallopian tubes. This all occurs when there is 100 million sperm. Precum only contains 3 million sperm on average (when present).  The chances of pregnancy are extremely low, but they do exist.  Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy?  Avoiding pregnancy requires diligence and some other form of contraceptive aside from the famous pull out method. There are plenty of forms of contraceptives on the market, but the most common are:   Condoms: A very highly effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs. Condoms are worn over the penis and trap semen before it’s allowed to enter into the vagina. There is a 0.02 chance of becoming pregnancy when a condom is worn.  Female Condom: While not as common, the female condom can be purchased over-the-counter and has proven to be 95% effective at protecting against pregnancy. More expensive, a female condom is more durable and can be inserted into the vagina up to 8 hours before intercourse.  Birth Control : Birth control can be highly effective, but it depends on the woman. The percentage of protection that birth control provides is 91% – 99%. The 91% protection is a little low for most people and will provide a 9% chance of pregnancy. Ultimately, 1 out of 12 people on birth control can become pregnant based off of these statistics.   A mix of contraceptives is recommended to boost the risk of successful pregnancy avoidance. Typically, a condom and birth control are used in conjunction with one another to ensure the utmost in protection against getting pregnant. The pullout method can be used at this time to further reduce the risk of getting pregnant.  Contraceptive implants are becoming more popular and require surgery to be implanted in the body. These implants are very effective, yet they come with side effects that can be life threatening and will be very costly.  Male sterilization provides full protection against pregnancy. A woman can get her tubes tied , which would reduce the risk of pregnancy with a very high accuracy rate. While 99.9% effective, there have been cases wherein a woman with her tubes tied did get pregnant, but this is not the norm.  Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum when dry humping? There is always a possibility, but the chances are so small that it is very unlikely. Since precum contains such little sperm, if any, there is already a small chance of getting pregnant.  Since dry humping occurs outside of the body, it would take a drop of precum to drip into the vagina and pass through the cervical mucus all the way into the fallopian tubes for pregnancy to occur.  Can it happen? Hypothetically, it can happen, but the chances are extremely low. In fact, the chances are so low that it would be nearly impossible for pregnancy to occur with dry humping.  [Read more about Dry Humping]  Precum does contain sperm in most samples thanks to the cut in the urethra. If you’re trying to avoid pregnancy, make sure you do not allow precum to enter into the vagina.

Would the person who fully ejaculated be more likely to make a woman pregnant?    Reply         Andrea Miller   July 15, 2017 at 5:05 am     Yes, there is a chance of getting pregnant with full ejaculation. As you know cum contains sperm and if the male sperm comes in contacts with a vagina then, the chances are high to get pregnant. According to NHS http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/975.aspx you can easily get pregnant from cum/discharge and also if you don’t to want to pregnant then, make sure you follow the precaution https://thelifesquare.com/pregnant-from-precum-8575481/ .

She had sex on the 24th and he did cum inside of her also multiple more times after that.  The pregnancy test came back positive 8/12. What are the chances of her getting pregnant by the first time?

The chances are extremely slim, near zero but highly unlikely    Reply           Jess20   October 2, 2017 at 8:10 am     Had sex with boyfriend, using the pullout method, have never gotten pregnant(been doing it for more than a year with him), since I’m not on BC we usually do it once a day, we had a fuck it lets do it twice moment, he came, wiped it off, went to the bathroom fully once then forced it out two more times, even washed his entire dick with soap then we went at it again, we started regretting it a few hours later. I’m currently a broke college student, I don’t have health insurance, and I know I fucked up I knew the risk, I don’t need to hear the ‘oh well you should of gotten some sort of protection’. I’m just here to see if anyone has gone through the same situation. — For anyone wondering if the pullout method works. YES PULLOUT METHOD HAS WORKED FOR ME BUT ONLY ONCE A DAY. IT DOESNT WORK FOR EVERYONE OKAY? The guy has to be in complete control and know when he’s close, if you’re sexually inexperienced DO NOT try the pullout method, it might be working for me and my boyfriend also because of how fertile we are. We’ve never gone to the doctor(Which I know is really stupid and I highly recommend to go check yourself out if you’re having unprotected sex). I’m irregular and have extremely bad periods since I can remember but I’m assuming I may not be that fertile because of it. Do not be stupid and just use a condom and get on birth control.

He ended up cumming but not inside of me, he pulled out and pumped himself until he came. December 7th was the day that we did it the first time, but we both didn’t reach our climax. December 8th he came but pulled out and as I said, pumped himself until he came. He says that he’s almost 100% sure that no precum got inside of me and we’ve done it twice. What are the chances that I’m pregnant? My menstrual period starts around either the 20th or the 25th.

Reply         Henny   January 8, 2018 at 3:20 pm     My boyfriend and I did naked grinding for less then 2 min and I was a day before I ovulate. Is there a chance that pre cum can be all over my vaginal opening?  We had protected sex afterwards. Will the penetrative action push the sperm from the precum into my vagine?  Is there a chance that I’ll get pregnant?    Reply         H.   February 2, 2018 at 12:25 am     So me and my bf have had sex while I was on my period and the day after and maybe a week after that. We didn’t use protection when I was in my period, and the last couple of times we had sex without a condom for a bit before he put a condom on. I want to know for SURE if it’s a possibility that I am pregnant because my boobs have been  sore lately and I haven’t started my next period yet which worries me.

Top 4 Questions Revealed        Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-Cum? Top 4 Questions Revealed   By  Pobby -   April 12, 2016  51       Share on Facebook  Tweet on Twitter     tweet    pre cum and pregnant       Many people take the risk of having sex without protection because they believe that as long as they don’t cum, the woman won’t get pregnant. While this makes perfect sense, it’s not the case at all. Precum can cause a woman to get pregnant although the male didn’t fully ejaculate inside of her.  Pulling out may lower the risk of getting pregnant, but there will always be a chance of pregnancy due to precum. Let’s determine what precum is first before we dig deeper into the subject.   Table of Contents What is Precum? Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum? Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum? Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy? Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  What is Precum?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum? The short answer is yes. Precum occurs when a male is aroused and before a person has an orgasm. Now, this white sticky fluid isn’t as thick as regular cum and won’t have the same potency.  In fact, precum doesn’t contain any sperm – at all. But, it can still get you pregnant. The issue is that this precum flows through the same opening that cum does. So, leftover sperm is picked up in the urethra, will travel with the pre cum and can cause pregnancy.  Scientists still don’t know the exact reason for pre-ejaculate, but they believe that it helps reduce the acidity in the vagina. Ultimately, by reducing the acidity levels, the sperm would survive longer inside of the vagina as it travels. Acid will kill the sperm, so pre cum aims to lessen this acidity to promote fertilization.  Can precum get you pregnant? Absolutely, but the chances are much lower than regular cum.   Studies found that out of a sampling of 27 men, only 41% of them had sperm in their precum. The amount of sperm present was very low, but that doesn’t indicate that pregnancy can’t occur. There is simply a lower chance for pregnancy.  If you’re practicing the pull out method, you’ll want to ensure that cum does not come in contact with the vagina at all. Many couples believe that as long as cum is on the outside of the body, the woman won’t get pregnant. However, this is only partially correct. Cum located near the vagina can travel inside of the vagina with even just a drip of cum.  So, you want to ensure that you do not ejaculate on the outside of the vagina or in the immediate vicinity. Even a minute amount of ejaculate contains enough sperm for a woman to get pregnant. Instead, you want to wear a condom or ensure that the woman is on birth control to prevent any unexpected pregnancies from occurring.   Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum?  Precum has been associated with a “safe way” to ensure that STDs are not transferred. This is misinformation that every couple should be aware of. Studies have demonstrated that HIV is present in the majority of precum samples.  This demonstrates that precum can carry an STD.  A major issue exists with precum because it often flows through the urethra and escapes out of the tip of the penis unnoticed. Unlike ejaculation, men are not able to feel precum and won’t know when precum is starting to come out of the body.  Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum?  Pre-ejaculate occurs before ejaculation. When a man reaches this point, there will be two times in which a woman can become pregnant:   High Risk: A high of pregnancy exists if a man ejaculates fully during intercourse. This would occur after precum.  Low Risk: Precum without full ejaculation presents a low risk of pregnancy.   There is a very low amount of sperm in precum fluid. This amount is much lower than what is present inside of a man’s cum, but there is still a risk of pregnancy occurring.  A good way to visualize this is to know how much sperm is found within normal cum. In normal ejaculation, there are approximately 100 million sperm in just one milliliter of fluid. This sperm then gets lessened because only 10 million sperm will get past cervical mucus in the woman’s vagina.  [Read more about Cervical Mucus]  The uterine tract will also filter an additional 10% of sperm, leaving just 1 million sperm left. Ultimately, only 100,000 sperm that will exist long enough to enter the fallopian tubes. This all occurs when there is 100 million sperm. Precum only contains 3 million sperm on average (when present).  The chances of pregnancy are extremely low, but they do exist.  Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy?  Avoiding pregnancy requires diligence and some other form of contraceptive aside from the famous pull out method. There are plenty of forms of contraceptives on the market, but the most common are:   Condoms: A very highly effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs. Condoms are worn over the penis and trap semen before it’s allowed to enter into the vagina. There is a 0.02 chance of becoming pregnancy when a condom is worn.  Female Condom: While not as common, the female condom can be purchased over-the-counter and has proven to be 95% effective at protecting against pregnancy. More expensive, a female condom is more durable and can be inserted into the vagina up to 8 hours before intercourse.  Birth Control : Birth control can be highly effective, but it depends on the woman. The percentage of protection that birth control provides is 91% – 99%. The 91% protection is a little low for most people and will provide a 9% chance of pregnancy. Ultimately, 1 out of 12 people on birth control can become pregnant based off of these statistics.   A mix of contraceptives is recommended to boost the risk of successful pregnancy avoidance. Typically, a condom and birth control are used in conjunction with one another to ensure the utmost in protection against getting pregnant. The pullout method can be used at this time to further reduce the risk of getting pregnant.  Contraceptive implants are becoming more popular and require surgery to be implanted in the body. These implants are very effective, yet they come with side effects that can be life threatening and will be very costly.  Male sterilization provides full protection against pregnancy. A woman can get her tubes tied , which would reduce the risk of pregnancy with a very high accuracy rate. While 99.9% effective, there have been cases wherein a woman with her tubes tied did get pregnant, but this is not the norm.  Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum when dry humping? There is always a possibility, but the chances are so small that it is very unlikely. Since precum contains such little sperm, if any, there is already a small chance of getting pregnant.  Since dry humping occurs outside of the body, it would take a drop of precum to drip into the vagina and pass through the cervical mucus all the way into the fallopian tubes for pregnancy to occur.  Can it happen? Hypothetically, it can happen, but the chances are extremely low. In fact, the chances are so low that it would be nearly impossible for pregnancy to occur with dry humping.  [Read more about Dry Humping]  Precum does contain sperm in most samples thanks to the cut in the urethra. If you’re trying to avoid pregnancy, make sure you do not allow precum to enter into the vagina.

Reply         Andrea Miller   July 15, 2017 at 5:05 am     Yes, there is a chance of getting pregnant with full ejaculation. As you know cum contains sperm and if the male sperm comes in contacts with a vagina then, the chances are high to get pregnant. According to NHS http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/975.aspx you can easily get pregnant from cum/discharge and also if you don’t to want to pregnant then, make sure you follow the precaution https://thelifesquare.com/pregnant-from-precum-8575481/ .

The chances are extremely slim, near zero but highly unlikely    Reply           Jess20   October 2, 2017 at 8:10 am     Had sex with boyfriend, using the pullout method, have never gotten pregnant(been doing it for more than a year with him), since I’m not on BC we usually do it once a day, we had a fuck it lets do it twice moment, he came, wiped it off, went to the bathroom fully once then forced it out two more times, even washed his entire dick with soap then we went at it again, we started regretting it a few hours later. I’m currently a broke college student, I don’t have health insurance, and I know I fucked up I knew the risk, I don’t need to hear the ‘oh well you should of gotten some sort of protection’. I’m just here to see if anyone has gone through the same situation. — For anyone wondering if the pullout method works. YES PULLOUT METHOD HAS WORKED FOR ME BUT ONLY ONCE A DAY. IT DOESNT WORK FOR EVERYONE OKAY? The guy has to be in complete control and know when he’s close, if you’re sexually inexperienced DO NOT try the pullout method, it might be working for me and my boyfriend also because of how fertile we are. We’ve never gone to the doctor(Which I know is really stupid and I highly recommend to go check yourself out if you’re having unprotected sex). I’m irregular and have extremely bad periods since I can remember but I’m assuming I may not be that fertile because of it. Do not be stupid and just use a condom and get on birth control.

But I’m afraid because there is surely pre ejaculation during the rubbing and I wasn’t putting on condom and also I had a full ejaculation during the process but outside her vagina and it kind off close to her vagina. Is it possible she get pregnant and if Yes, what pill can she use?. I need the answer ASAP before it get out of hand.

Reply         Lou   December 5, 2017 at 2:14 pm     Okay so me and my boyfriend had sex one day after my period. The first time that night he pulled out just in time. He did wash after but through out the night we had sex about 4 times and pulled out in time. Is it possible for sperm to then come out with his pre cum.    Reply         Lex   December 9, 2017 at 1:10 am     So me and my boyfriend had sex for the first time, taking each others virginity. He ended up cumming but not inside of me, he pulled out and pumped himself until he came. December 7th was the day that we did it the first time, but we both didn’t reach our climax. December 8th he came but pulled out and as I said, pumped himself until he came. He says that he’s almost 100% sure that no precum got inside of me and we’ve done it twice. What are the chances that I’m pregnant? My menstrual period starts around either the 20th or the 25th.

Reply         Henny   January 8, 2018 at 3:20 pm     My boyfriend and I did naked grinding for less then 2 min and I was a day before I ovulate. Is there a chance that pre cum can be all over my vaginal opening?  We had protected sex afterwards. Will the penetrative action push the sperm from the precum into my vagine?  Is there a chance that I’ll get pregnant?    Reply         H.   February 2, 2018 at 12:25 am     So me and my bf have had sex while I was on my period and the day after and maybe a week after that. We didn’t use protection when I was in my period, and the last couple of times we had sex without a condom for a bit before he put a condom on. I want to know for SURE if it’s a possibility that I am pregnant because my boobs have been  sore lately and I haven’t started my next period yet which worries me.

Top 4 Questions Revealed        Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-Cum? Top 4 Questions Revealed   By  Pobby -   April 12, 2016  51       Share on Facebook  Tweet on Twitter     tweet    pre cum and pregnant       Many people take the risk of having sex without protection because they believe that as long as they don’t cum, the woman won’t get pregnant. While this makes perfect sense, it’s not the case at all. Precum can cause a woman to get pregnant although the male didn’t fully ejaculate inside of her.  Pulling out may lower the risk of getting pregnant, but there will always be a chance of pregnancy due to precum. Let’s determine what precum is first before we dig deeper into the subject.   Table of Contents What is Precum? Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum? Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum? Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy? Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  What is Precum?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum? The short answer is yes. Precum occurs when a male is aroused and before a person has an orgasm. Now, this white sticky fluid isn’t as thick as regular cum and won’t have the same potency.  In fact, precum doesn’t contain any sperm – at all. But, it can still get you pregnant. The issue is that this precum flows through the same opening that cum does. So, leftover sperm is picked up in the urethra, will travel with the pre cum and can cause pregnancy.  Scientists still don’t know the exact reason for pre-ejaculate, but they believe that it helps reduce the acidity in the vagina. Ultimately, by reducing the acidity levels, the sperm would survive longer inside of the vagina as it travels. Acid will kill the sperm, so pre cum aims to lessen this acidity to promote fertilization.  Can precum get you pregnant? Absolutely, but the chances are much lower than regular cum.   Studies found that out of a sampling of 27 men, only 41% of them had sperm in their precum. The amount of sperm present was very low, but that doesn’t indicate that pregnancy can’t occur. There is simply a lower chance for pregnancy.  If you’re practicing the pull out method, you’ll want to ensure that cum does not come in contact with the vagina at all. Many couples believe that as long as cum is on the outside of the body, the woman won’t get pregnant. However, this is only partially correct. Cum located near the vagina can travel inside of the vagina with even just a drip of cum.  So, you want to ensure that you do not ejaculate on the outside of the vagina or in the immediate vicinity. Even a minute amount of ejaculate contains enough sperm for a woman to get pregnant. Instead, you want to wear a condom or ensure that the woman is on birth control to prevent any unexpected pregnancies from occurring.   Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum?  Precum has been associated with a “safe way” to ensure that STDs are not transferred. This is misinformation that every couple should be aware of. Studies have demonstrated that HIV is present in the majority of precum samples.  This demonstrates that precum can carry an STD.  A major issue exists with precum because it often flows through the urethra and escapes out of the tip of the penis unnoticed. Unlike ejaculation, men are not able to feel precum and won’t know when precum is starting to come out of the body.  Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum?  Pre-ejaculate occurs before ejaculation. When a man reaches this point, there will be two times in which a woman can become pregnant:   High Risk: A high of pregnancy exists if a man ejaculates fully during intercourse. This would occur after precum.  Low Risk: Precum without full ejaculation presents a low risk of pregnancy.   There is a very low amount of sperm in precum fluid. This amount is much lower than what is present inside of a man’s cum, but there is still a risk of pregnancy occurring.  A good way to visualize this is to know how much sperm is found within normal cum. In normal ejaculation, there are approximately 100 million sperm in just one milliliter of fluid. This sperm then gets lessened because only 10 million sperm will get past cervical mucus in the woman’s vagina.  [Read more about Cervical Mucus]  The uterine tract will also filter an additional 10% of sperm, leaving just 1 million sperm left. Ultimately, only 100,000 sperm that will exist long enough to enter the fallopian tubes. This all occurs when there is 100 million sperm. Precum only contains 3 million sperm on average (when present).  The chances of pregnancy are extremely low, but they do exist.  Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy?  Avoiding pregnancy requires diligence and some other form of contraceptive aside from the famous pull out method. There are plenty of forms of contraceptives on the market, but the most common are:   Condoms: A very highly effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs. Condoms are worn over the penis and trap semen before it’s allowed to enter into the vagina. There is a 0.02 chance of becoming pregnancy when a condom is worn.  Female Condom: While not as common, the female condom can be purchased over-the-counter and has proven to be 95% effective at protecting against pregnancy. More expensive, a female condom is more durable and can be inserted into the vagina up to 8 hours before intercourse.  Birth Control : Birth control can be highly effective, but it depends on the woman. The percentage of protection that birth control provides is 91% – 99%. The 91% protection is a little low for most people and will provide a 9% chance of pregnancy. Ultimately, 1 out of 12 people on birth control can become pregnant based off of these statistics.   A mix of contraceptives is recommended to boost the risk of successful pregnancy avoidance. Typically, a condom and birth control are used in conjunction with one another to ensure the utmost in protection against getting pregnant. The pullout method can be used at this time to further reduce the risk of getting pregnant.  Contraceptive implants are becoming more popular and require surgery to be implanted in the body. These implants are very effective, yet they come with side effects that can be life threatening and will be very costly.  Male sterilization provides full protection against pregnancy. A woman can get her tubes tied , which would reduce the risk of pregnancy with a very high accuracy rate. While 99.9% effective, there have been cases wherein a woman with her tubes tied did get pregnant, but this is not the norm.  Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum when dry humping? There is always a possibility, but the chances are so small that it is very unlikely. Since precum contains such little sperm, if any, there is already a small chance of getting pregnant.  Since dry humping occurs outside of the body, it would take a drop of precum to drip into the vagina and pass through the cervical mucus all the way into the fallopian tubes for pregnancy to occur.  Can it happen? Hypothetically, it can happen, but the chances are extremely low. In fact, the chances are so low that it would be nearly impossible for pregnancy to occur with dry humping.  [Read more about Dry Humping]  Precum does contain sperm in most samples thanks to the cut in the urethra. If you’re trying to avoid pregnancy, make sure you do not allow precum to enter into the vagina.

Reply         Andrea Miller   July 15, 2017 at 5:05 am     Yes, there is a chance of getting pregnant with full ejaculation. As you know cum contains sperm and if the male sperm comes in contacts with a vagina then, the chances are high to get pregnant.

The chances are extremely slim, near zero but highly unlikely    Reply           Jess20   October 2, 2017 at 8:10 am     Had sex with boyfriend, using the pullout method, have never gotten pregnant(been doing it for more than a year with him), since I’m not on BC we usually do it once a day, we had a fuck it lets do it twice moment, he came, wiped it off, went to the bathroom fully once then forced it out two more times, even washed his entire dick with soap then we went at it again, we started regretting it a few hours later. I’m currently a broke college student, I don’t have health insurance, and I know I fucked up I knew the risk, I don’t need to hear the ‘oh well you should of gotten some sort of protection’. I’m just here to see if anyone has gone through the same situation. — For anyone wondering if the pullout method works. YES PULLOUT METHOD HAS WORKED FOR ME BUT ONLY ONCE A DAY. IT DOESNT WORK FOR EVERYONE OKAY? The guy has to be in complete control and know when he’s close, if you’re sexually inexperienced DO NOT try the pullout method, it might be working for me and my boyfriend also because of how fertile we are. We’ve never gone to the doctor(Which I know is really stupid and I highly recommend to go check yourself out if you’re having unprotected sex). I’m irregular and have extremely bad periods since I can remember but I’m assuming I may not be that fertile because of it. Do not be stupid and just use a condom and get on birth control.

Reply         Kens-avs   November 11, 2017 at 9:28 am     My boyfriend and i kinda done something. I masturbate him but there’s no ejaculation happened especially penetration. But there is this clear and colorless fluid came out, i searched for it and all of the results said that, that was the Pre Cum.  Can i get pregnant by Pre Cum and Non Ejaculation?  Cos i searched for it and some answered Yes some are No. And it’s really confusing me.

But I’m afraid because there is surely pre ejaculation during the rubbing and I wasn’t putting on condom and also I had a full ejaculation during the process but outside her vagina and it kind off close to her vagina. Is it possible she get pregnant and if Yes, what pill can she use?. I need the answer ASAP before it get out of hand.

Reply         Lou   December 5, 2017 at 2:14 pm     Okay so me and my boyfriend had sex one day after my period. The first time that night he pulled out just in time. He did wash after but through out the night we had sex about 4 times and pulled out in time. Is it possible for sperm to then come out with his pre cum.    Reply         Lex   December 9, 2017 at 1:10 am     So me and my boyfriend had sex for the first time, taking each others virginity. He ended up cumming but not inside of me, he pulled out and pumped himself until he came. December 7th was the day that we did it the first time, but we both didn’t reach our climax. December 8th he came but pulled out and as I said, pumped himself until he came. He says that he’s almost 100% sure that no precum got inside of me and we’ve done it twice. What are the chances that I’m pregnant? My menstrual period starts around either the 20th or the 25th.

Reply         Henny   January 8, 2018 at 3:20 pm     My boyfriend and I did naked grinding for less then 2 min and I was a day before I ovulate. Is there a chance that pre cum can be all over my vaginal opening?  We had protected sex afterwards. Will the penetrative action push the sperm from the precum into my vagine?  Is there a chance that I’ll get pregnant?    Reply         H.   February 2, 2018 at 12:25 am     So me and my bf have had sex while I was on my period and the day after and maybe a week after that. We didn’t use protection when I was in my period, and the last couple of times we had sex without a condom for a bit before he put a condom on. I want to know for SURE if it’s a possibility that I am pregnant because my boobs have been  sore lately and I haven’t started my next period yet which worries me.

Top 4 Questions Revealed        Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-Cum? Top 4 Questions Revealed   By  Pobby -   April 12, 2016  51       Share on Facebook  Tweet on Twitter     tweet    pre cum and pregnant       Many people take the risk of having sex without protection because they believe that as long as they don’t cum, the woman won’t get pregnant. While this makes perfect sense, it’s not the case at all. Precum can cause a woman to get pregnant although the male didn’t fully ejaculate inside of her.  Pulling out may lower the risk of getting pregnant, but there will always be a chance of pregnancy due to precum. Let’s determine what precum is first before we dig deeper into the subject.   Table of Contents What is Precum? Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum? Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum? Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy? Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  What is Precum?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum? The short answer is yes. Precum occurs when a male is aroused and before a person has an orgasm. Now, this white sticky fluid isn’t as thick as regular cum and won’t have the same potency.  In fact, precum doesn’t contain any sperm – at all. But, it can still get you pregnant. The issue is that this precum flows through the same opening that cum does. So, leftover sperm is picked up in the urethra, will travel with the pre cum and can cause pregnancy.  Scientists still don’t know the exact reason for pre-ejaculate, but they believe that it helps reduce the acidity in the vagina. Ultimately, by reducing the acidity levels, the sperm would survive longer inside of the vagina as it travels. Acid will kill the sperm, so pre cum aims to lessen this acidity to promote fertilization.  Can precum get you pregnant? Absolutely, but the chances are much lower than regular cum.   Studies found that out of a sampling of 27 men, only 41% of them had sperm in their precum. The amount of sperm present was very low, but that doesn’t indicate that pregnancy can’t occur. There is simply a lower chance for pregnancy.  If you’re practicing the pull out method, you’ll want to ensure that cum does not come in contact with the vagina at all. Many couples believe that as long as cum is on the outside of the body, the woman won’t get pregnant. However, this is only partially correct. Cum located near the vagina can travel inside of the vagina with even just a drip of cum.  So, you want to ensure that you do not ejaculate on the outside of the vagina or in the immediate vicinity. Even a minute amount of ejaculate contains enough sperm for a woman to get pregnant. Instead, you want to wear a condom or ensure that the woman is on birth control to prevent any unexpected pregnancies from occurring.   Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum?  Precum has been associated with a “safe way” to ensure that STDs are not transferred. This is misinformation that every couple should be aware of. Studies have demonstrated that HIV is present in the majority of precum samples.  This demonstrates that precum can carry an STD.  A major issue exists with precum because it often flows through the urethra and escapes out of the tip of the penis unnoticed. Unlike ejaculation, men are not able to feel precum and won’t know when precum is starting to come out of the body.  Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum?  Pre-ejaculate occurs before ejaculation. When a man reaches this point, there will be two times in which a woman can become pregnant:   High Risk: A high of pregnancy exists if a man ejaculates fully during intercourse. This would occur after precum.  Low Risk: Precum without full ejaculation presents a low risk of pregnancy.   There is a very low amount of sperm in precum fluid. This amount is much lower than what is present inside of a man’s cum, but there is still a risk of pregnancy occurring.  A good way to visualize this is to know how much sperm is found within normal cum. In normal ejaculation, there are approximately 100 million sperm in just one milliliter of fluid. This sperm then gets lessened because only 10 million sperm will get past cervical mucus in the woman’s vagina.  [Read more about Cervical Mucus]  The uterine tract will also filter an additional 10% of sperm, leaving just 1 million sperm left. Ultimately, only 100,000 sperm that will exist long enough to enter the fallopian tubes. This all occurs when there is 100 million sperm. Precum only contains 3 million sperm on average (when present).  The chances of pregnancy are extremely low, but they do exist.  Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy?  Avoiding pregnancy requires diligence and some other form of contraceptive aside from the famous pull out method. There are plenty of forms of contraceptives on the market, but the most common are:   Condoms: A very highly effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs. Condoms are worn over the penis and trap semen before it’s allowed to enter into the vagina. There is a 0.02 chance of becoming pregnancy when a condom is worn.  Female Condom: While not as common, the female condom can be purchased over-the-counter and has proven to be 95% effective at protecting against pregnancy. More expensive, a female condom is more durable and can be inserted into the vagina up to 8 hours before intercourse.  Birth Control : Birth control can be highly effective, but it depends on the woman. The percentage of protection that birth control provides is 91% – 99%. The 91% protection is a little low for most people and will provide a 9% chance of pregnancy. Ultimately, 1 out of 12 people on birth control can become pregnant based off of these statistics.   A mix of contraceptives is recommended to boost the risk of successful pregnancy avoidance. Typically, a condom and birth control are used in conjunction with one another to ensure the utmost in protection against getting pregnant. The pullout method can be used at this time to further reduce the risk of getting pregnant.  Contraceptive implants are becoming more popular and require surgery to be implanted in the body. These implants are very effective, yet they come with side effects that can be life threatening and will be very costly.  Male sterilization provides full protection against pregnancy. A woman can get her tubes tied , which would reduce the risk of pregnancy with a very high accuracy rate. While 99.9% effective, there have been cases wherein a woman with her tubes tied did get pregnant, but this is not the norm.  Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum when dry humping? There is always a possibility, but the chances are so small that it is very unlikely. Since precum contains such little sperm, if any, there is already a small chance of getting pregnant.  Since dry humping occurs outside of the body, it would take a drop of precum to drip into the vagina and pass through the cervical mucus all the way into the fallopian tubes for pregnancy to occur.  Can it happen? Hypothetically, it can happen, but the chances are extremely low. In fact, the chances are so low that it would be nearly impossible for pregnancy to occur with dry humping.  [Read more about Dry Humping]  Precum does contain sperm in most samples thanks to the cut in the urethra. If you’re trying to avoid pregnancy, make sure you do not allow precum to enter into the vagina.

Reply         Andrea Miller   July 15, 2017 at 5:05 am     Yes, there is a chance of getting pregnant with full ejaculation. As you know cum contains sperm and if the male sperm comes in contacts with a vagina then, the chances are high to get pregnant.

The chances are extremely slim, near zero but highly unlikely    Reply           Jess20   October 2, 2017 at 8:10 am     Had sex with boyfriend, using the pullout method, have never gotten pregnant(been doing it for more than a year with him), since I’m not on BC we usually do it once a day, we had a fuck it lets do it twice moment, he came, wiped it off, went to the bathroom fully once then forced it out two more times, even washed his entire dick with soap then we went at it again, we started regretting it a few hours later. I’m currently a broke college student, I don’t have health insurance, and I know I fucked up I knew the risk, I don’t need to hear the ‘oh well you should of gotten some sort of protection’. I’m just here to see if anyone has gone through the same situation. — For anyone wondering if the pullout method works. YES PULLOUT METHOD HAS WORKED FOR ME BUT ONLY ONCE A DAY. IT DOESNT WORK FOR EVERYONE OKAY? The guy has to be in complete control and know when he’s close, if you’re sexually inexperienced DO NOT try the pullout method, it might be working for me and my boyfriend also because of how fertile we are. We’ve never gone to the doctor(Which I know is really stupid and I highly recommend to go check yourself out if you’re having unprotected sex). I’m irregular and have extremely bad periods since I can remember but I’m assuming I may not be that fertile because of it. Do not be stupid and just use a condom and get on birth control.

But after 2 or 3 strokes the condom broke at the lower part (i.e. far away from the tip) and we stopped right then. There wasn’t much precum and he didn’t ejaculate at all. I took a plan B(contraceptive) pill for safety. In August I had my period on 8th and in September I had my period on 21th. I have had a delay of 14 days earlier 2 times this year (February and September) but it is 9th of November already, 20 days. And I still didn’t get my period and no PMS either.

Uhm, Can i get pregnant from pre cum? Cos my boyfriend and i kinda done something. But there’s no penetration happened, he just uhh rub it, oh and he also didn’t ejaculated.  So can i get pregnant with Non-Penetration and Pre-Cum and Non Ejaculation?  Sorry my grammar sucks.    Reply         Kens-avs   November 11, 2017 at 9:28 am     My boyfriend and i kinda done something. I masturbate him but there’s no ejaculation happened especially penetration. But there is this clear and colorless fluid came out, i searched for it and all of the results said that, that was the Pre Cum.  Can i get pregnant by Pre Cum and Non Ejaculation?  Cos i searched for it and some answered Yes some are No. And it’s really confusing me.

But I’m afraid because there is surely pre ejaculation during the rubbing and I wasn’t putting on condom and also I had a full ejaculation during the process but outside her vagina and it kind off close to her vagina. Is it possible she get pregnant and if Yes, what pill can she use?. I need the answer ASAP before it get out of hand.

Reply         Lou   December 5, 2017 at 2:14 pm     Okay so me and my boyfriend had sex one day after my period. The first time that night he pulled out just in time. He did wash after but through out the night we had sex about 4 times and pulled out in time. Is it possible for sperm to then come out with his pre cum.    Reply         Lex   December 9, 2017 at 1:10 am     So me and my boyfriend had sex for the first time, taking each others virginity. He ended up cumming but not inside of me, he pulled out and pumped himself until he came. December 7th was the day that we did it the first time, but we both didn’t reach our climax. December 8th he came but pulled out and as I said, pumped himself until he came. He says that he’s almost 100% sure that no precum got inside of me and we’ve done it twice. What are the chances that I’m pregnant? My menstrual period starts around either the 20th or the 25th.

(Hint: Not Zero)     4 Comments  by Olivia Maloy — 2017-05-05  Pregnancy Medical Team                       Is the withdrawal method an effective contraceptive choice? Do you need to be freaking out about a possible pregnancy after 10-second unprotected intercourse without ejaculation? In short — can you get pregnant from precum? Let's take a look.  Is the withdrawal method an effective contraceptive choice? Do you need to be worried about an unwanted pregnancy if you and your partner had 10-second unprotected intercourse? Is it at all possible, even theoretically, for pregnancy to result from dry-humping because precum might somehow seep through your clothes and into all the wrong places?  In short, what are your chances of getting pregnant from precum, and how should the risk of getting pregnant from precum influence your sex life if you really don't want to get pregnant or get your girlfriend pregnant?  What Is 'Precum' Or Pre-Ejaculatory Fluid?  Pre-ejaculatory fluid or pre-ejaculate, colloquially referred to as "precum", is a fluid released from the penis during sexual activity. Precum is believed to come from the Cowper’s glands and the Glands of Littre, but that probably isn't interesting to you right now — what you do want to know is that precum is released spontaneously , that it helps facilitate pleasurable sexual intercourse in much the same way vaginal discharge does, and that men have zero control over its production . In fact, they don't even feel it being released. [ 1 ]        Share this image with your friends:  Email  Embed                <a href="https://www.steadyhealth.com/articles/what-are-your-chances-of-getting-pregnant-from-precum-hint-not-zero"><img src="https://userfiles.steadyhealth.com/userfiles/23630/articles/What-Are-The-Chances-Of-Getting-Pregnant-From-Precum.png" border="0"></a>              Can You Get Pregnant From 'Precum'?  It's true that it only takes one sperm and one egg to create a pregnancy, but the story is also an awful lot more complicated than that. If a man only released one sperm cell every time he ejaculated, the human race would probably be extinct by now.  Fortunately for those folks who want kids and those who simply want humans to keep being around, the average ejaculate contains millions of sperm cells. Men who have 39 million sperm cells per ejaculate are only barely considered to have viable sperm counts [ 2 ], and the average ejaculate features around 100 million sperm . Out of that 100 million, only about 10 million make it past the cervix, only about a million make it into the upper uterine tract, and a meager 100,000 get as far as the fallopian tubes. [ 3 ]  That sheds a different perspective on your "light reading" about your chances of getting pregnant from precum: when you're informed that pre-ejaculatory fluid may "contain thousands of sperm" [ 4 ], that suddenly doesn't seem like very much at all.  What's more, one study shows that precum doesn't contain any sperm most of the time, and that if it does, most of the sperm is immobile (that is, can't "swim"). [3] We'll add that that particular study happened to refer to HIV-positive men, and that another study contradicted its findings.  It's worth quoting part of that study:   Although our pre-ejaculatory samples often contained sperm with equivalent concentration and motility to what would be regarded as fertile in ejaculatory samples, the actual number of sperm in the pre-ejaculates was very low. We are unable to say how this finding might translate into the chances of pregnancy if these samples of pre-ejaculate were deposited in the vagina except that the chances would not be zero. [1]   What does that mean, in real terms, for those who don't want to get pregnant and don't want to get their partners pregnant? Let's look at that now.  Is The Withdrawal Method An Effective Contraceptive Choice?  Almost 60 percent of US women aged between 15 and 44 have ever used the withdrawal method (or pull-out method) as a form of contraception [ 5 ]. If you're wondering if you should use the withdrawal method as your chosen birth control as well, it's important to know that there's the pull-out method and the pull-out method:  You could just have sex whenever you feel like it and have the male partner pull out before ejaculation.  Some couples carefully monitor the female partner's menstrual cycle to find out when she is in her fertile window, and adjust their sex life accordingly.  The latter method is also referred to as " natural family planning ", and couples who practice it monitor ovulation by charting basal body temperature and looking at the consistency of cervical mucus. They then either avoid sex altogether during the woman's (presumed) fertile days, or they use condoms only during those days. They use the withdrawal method the rest of the month.  Couples who practice the withdrawal method in this particular manner actually have a pretty low pregnancy rate of 2.2 percent with perfect use [ 6 ].  The efficacy of every user-dependent contraceptive method depends on a user's ability to follow its instructions perfectly, of course. The combined oral contraceptive pill has a failure rate of about 0.1 percent when it's used perfectly, for instance, but because most people aren't perfect, research indicates that the actual failure rate is much closer to 8.5 percent. [ 7 ]  To get back to precum, the sperm that might be lurking in there, and the less official way of practicing withdrawal, just pulling out before the male partner reaches climax without paying any attention to the female partner's menstrual cycle, well, we can only repeat what the study above said. Your chances of getting pregnant aren't zero even when you use the really thought-out form of the pull-out method as you have already seen above, so they're definitely not going to be zero if you have no clue when you are fertile, or your girlfriend is.  The Bottom Line  Is it even theoretically possible to get pregnant from precum released during dry-humping? I'd have to go with "no" on that one. Do you have to worry about pregnancy after 10-second intercourse? Not really. (You may want to look out for sexually transmitted diseases, though.) Is the withdrawal method an effective contraceptive choice? That depends on how you practice it.  If you want to have satisfying sexual intercourse without worrying about pregnancy or monitoring your fertility, you may want to choose a more user-friendly contraceptive method, like an intrauterine device or Depo-Provera.

Info Center      General      What are the chances of getting pregnant from precum     10 Comments   over a year ago                        Unfortunately, may people seem to think that coitus interruptus, also called withdrawal or pull-out method, is an efficient method of birth control.  Not only it is not 100% efficient as a way of preventing unwanted pregnancy, but it is also unsafe in terms of sexually transmitted diseases.  The reason why this method should not be adopted by people who want to be absolutely safe from pregnancy is that even before the ejaculation the penis secretes small amounts of semen, called precum or pre-ejaculate. If the precum reaches the egg, there is a chance it will fertilize it and pregnancy will occur.  What is precum?  Precum is a colloquial term for pre-ejaculate, a fluid that the penis releases during the intercourse, before the actual ejaculation. This fluid, also called pre-seminal fluid, is secreted from bulbourethral gland and its purpose is to clear the path for the upcoming ejaculation. The secretion starts when the man is aroused and continues throughout the intercourse.  Pre-ejaculate is alkaline in its nature and as it travels through the urethra it neutralizes the remaining acidity from the urine, so that the path is safe for the sperm, which does not handle acidity well. It also smoothens the passage of sperm by lubricating the urethra. This fluid also contains some spermatozoa, although not very much.  The chances of getting pregnant by precum  Fortunately, today many people know that precum contains some amount of spermatozoa, which, if they reach the egg, may fertilize it. For this reason, the pull-out method is not considered to be a very safe one. There is a chance a woman could get pregnant with precum .  However, several studies have found that precum itself does not contain any spermatozoa and that instead it picks them up from the urethra, where they have remained after the previous ejaculation. Since the spermatozoa can survive and remain motile in the urethra and on top of the penis, when the fluid picks them up and carries them into the vagina, there is a possibility of fertilization and pregnancy.  One of the best ways to prevent this, aside from having protected sex, of course, is to have the man urinate after the orgasm and prior to the next intercourse . That way the urine will wash away the remaining spermatozoa and raise the acidity in the urethra.  To put it simple, the pull-out method does carry a certain risk of pregnancy, even though the chances seem rather slim. Because of this, the pull-out method should be combined with other methods, such as the rhythm method. Still, the best way to prevent an unwanted pregnancy is to use a condom and contraceptive pills.

What are the chances?             ladyrootbeer    Last edited 07/22/2013        Sorry if this is tmi but I'm worried. I was just wondering what the chances were for getting pregnant from precum. My last period came on June 12, and it's very regular on a 28-day cycle. I should've gotten it last Wednesday, July 10, but it never came and still hasn't. My boyfriend and I had sex June 29th & 30th. Over those 2 days we had sex 4 times, but he never ejaculated inside. Then the following week we had sex multiple times on July 3, 4, 5 & 6 but he still never came inside me. I read somewhere that there's little to no sperm in precum so we just did the pull-out method because condoms really irritate my vagina and make it swell up. I have an appointment on July 25 (the earliest they could get me in) to get on birth control but since my period is now late I'm worried I might be pregnant. I don't really have any symptoms though except occasional cramping like I'm about to start my period yet nothing is there. I haven't taken a hpt yet but I'm thinking I should pick one up today. What are the chances I could've gotten pregnant by precum?

Take a test to ease your mind.    --  Sophie - my wisdom - 5/21/11 Lucy - my light - 5/23/14 Ryan - my last- 7/8/16                     Report this comment       0                     JenV724    Posted 07/15/2013      Pre Cum is actually show to have a higher concentration of sperm than regular cum.

I'd just be a little embarrassed that we aren't married yet. He's hoping I am pregnant, which is actually sweet.  I'm kind of excited that there's a possibility, too. I've always wanted to be a Mom, and we have no financial stresses or strains. Plus I think he'd be the greatest father on Earth. I just was curious of the chances because I don't want to get my hopes way up just in case it's a fluke. Oy.

I'm not sure if I should test or just wait for my appointment on July 25th. On one hand, not knowing is killing us but on the other, we'd be really sad if I wasn't. I'm so torn!

Af is now a week late. I'm not going to test again, just wait until the 25th when I have my appt with my OBGYN and see what's up.

Those are the other main reasons other then being pregnant that af is "late" Also pre cum normally only has sperm in it if he had ejaculated not long before. Pre cum DOESN'T have more sperm in then full on cum. Thats ridiculous. People would be getting pregnant all the time from pull out. Like pp said its not impossible but its not likley.

Pre-ejaculation is fluid produced by a manâ€™s body during sexual intercourse. This fluid travels through the urethra and out of the manâ€™s penis. This fluid helps to clear the way for sperm, and also helps with lubrication during sex. Pre-ejaculation is known by other names as well. Some of these include precum, pre-seminal fluid, or pre-ejaculate.    There is definitely a chance of getting pregnant from pre-ejaculation. While pre-ejaculation is not produced with any sperm in it to begin with, it may pick some up along the way. What happens is that, as it travels through the urethra, the pre-ejaculation may pick up sperm from a previous ejaculation. The sperm then travels with the pre-ejaculation and can cause pregnancy. The best way to avoid having sperm in the pre-ejaculation is for a man to urinate after ejaculating the previous time, but before vaginal penetration"    --  TTC#1             Reply            Report this comment       0                     defyingodds    Posted 10/25/2012      I actually did concieve over the summer when my husband pulled out.

By Teen Health Source  So, we here at Teen Health Source get a lot of questions about precum. A LOT . We have some info about it buried on the Inside Scoop: Penis and Testicles * page, under the spot about the Cowper’s Gland, but frig load of good it does just sitting there! So we’re pulling some of that info out, and hopefully also addressing some of the stuff that comes up in our faqs about precum. Here we go!  What is precum?   Precum is the pre-ejaculate fluid that can be released from the penis during sexual stimulation.  Precum prepares/lubricates the urethra for ejaculation. The more lubricated the urethra, the easier it should be for sperm to make it out of a person’s body.  Precum also acts as additional lubricant during sex.  The amount of precum that is released varies from person-to-person. So the amount that you produce normally is whatever is normal for you and your body.   Can precum cause pregnancy?   Precum itself does not contain any sperm and can therefore not cause pregnancy on its own.  However, an earlier ejaculation (either from sex, masturbation, etc.) may leave some leftover sperm in the urethra. This sperm can get flushed out by precum (aka, the precum would then contain sperm), and together would have a chance to cause pregnancy.  Urinating can flush out any leftover sperm in the urethra. If people do this before having sex, then there should be no sperm in the urethra to be flushed out instead by the precum.   Can you contract an STI from precum?   Yes, you can contract an STI from precum.  The glands that produce precum can be subjected to bacterial and viral STIs and any precum that is produced has a risk of transmitting the STI.   If people are about to have sex and aren’t sure about each other’s STI status or testing history, or aren’t sure if someone peed since their last ejaculation and there’s a risk of someone getting pregnant, then we’d always recommend that folks consider using condoms ( external or internal ) to prevent the transmission of fluids, and lowering the risk of pregnancy or sharing STIs.  If you still have more questions about precum, then consider talking to one of our peer educators: Contact Us !  ____  *Not everyone experiences or relates to their penis and testicles in the same way or uses the words used on this page for their bodies.

Evaluate Your Chances   October 13, 2015 September 27, 2016     Maria Shevtsova    Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-cum? Evaluate Your Chances   So can you get pregnant from precum? The short answer is: Yes, you can get pregnant from precum. Though the chances are quite low. Pre-cum (Pre-ejaculate or Cowper’s fluid) is the transparent, viscous fluid, coming out of penis at the moment of erection or sexual arousal. Almost like the semen, but contains quite a few spermatozoa (sperm cells, delivering the nucleus with the genetic information of the male to the ovum of the female). The concentration of the active sperm in the pre-ejaculate is variable and individual. Presumably, the pre-cum works like a lubricant and acid neutralizer. Not only the concentration of sperm in pre-cum is individual, but also the presence of pre-cum at all. Some men don’t produce this type of liquid at all. Pregnancy is (lat. Graviditas) is a special state of the woman’s body, in which her reproductive organs are incubating and developing an embryo or fetus. Pregnancy is the result of a merger of female and male sex cells as a result of  fertilization of the ovum by the sperm, which is an active carrier of the man cells. The matter: pregnant from precum You can easily get pregnant from precum under the following conditions: You have so-called “dangerous days” – ovulation You are not using any other method of contraception, but the coitus interruptus (aka the pull out method or withdrawal) Your partner has already ejaculated previously and this is your second or more intercourse per day. In the case the above-written conditions coincide, the chances of getting a girl pregnant with pre-cum are quite high. Before having unprotected sex with a partner you are not going to have children with in the nearest future, choose the best method of contraception for you. However, if the intercourse took place and you’re not sure, if that would lead to pregnancy – there’s a low risk. I personally know only two women, who got pregnant that way. In order not to cram yourself with hormonal pills, exclude the most important risk factors. Make an ovulation test , check your period calendar, if you have one. If you don’t  – get yourself one.   Knowing the date of your ovulation may help you to predict the days of the higher risk of letting birth out of control. And only after that, if you are afraid that there was a risk of penetration of the active spermatozoids on your territory – study the emergency contraception means. Also check:  Can You Get Pregnant on Your Period? So why there’s a certain risk of pregnancy without the fact of the ejaculation? A certain quantity of capable of fertilization sperm is released during your sexual intercourse with a natural lubricant together with penis erection. That’s why getting pregnant by the male secretions is, of course, possible, but the probability is low. A certain percentage of the sperm can remain in the urethra after the previous ejaculation, and may present in secretions or on the penis. The next time you have sex, they can easily fall into the vagina if the man has not observed certain hygiene rules after the previous coitus. The possibility to conceive is higher for the second and subsequent sexual acts that are not accompanied by shower before each of them.  Coitus interruptus can be more dangerous not only because of the risk to get pregnant from precum. Each man experiences difficulty in this delicate matter: do not think that it’s so easy – to catch the right moment before the onset of ejaculation. Unfortunately, this also disturbs a man to relax completely and experience the full range of sexual pleasure. And even with an excellent ability to capture the right moment, there is a risk of pregnancy as the sperm can easily get into the vagina from the hands or even bed linen. We must not forget that sperm lives for about 3 to 7 days in a friendly environment, which is the vagina. Unfortunately, due to the absence of the possibility to obtain a certain data on the way a woman actually got pregnant, it is hard to get any true statistics of precum pregnancies. We may rely only on the mentioned above facts to state that there’s a chance of getting pregnant that particular way. Many men are not even aware that they discharge precum during intercourse, moreover, they can’t control it. Accepting the risks of pre-cum pregnancy Preventing an unwanted pregnancy is far better, than aborting it for many reasons. There’s no chance of getting pregnant from precum while taking birth control pills (if taking them right) or combining the contraception methods with one another. But in case there’s no trust between partners or pregnancy is not an option for any of the partners and you consider a probable pregnancy as a risk – this feeling will definitely affect the quality of sex itself. It is better if you choose a partner, with whom you are not afraid to get pregnant of pre-cum or secure the intercourse with the additional means. One must also remember, that precum, just like semen itself can transport many sexually transmitted infections , including HIV, that “sticks” to semen. The research cases show , that some viruses (like hepatitis) can be contained in a spermatozoon itself, thus causing vertical transmission of the disease (directly to the cells of the fetus). The easiest way to secure the contraception effect of coitus interruptus and avoid a pre-cum pregnancy, however, is to use a contraceptive gel, suppository or cream, which are plenty in the market and safe for your health.

First of all, you should try to relax. Then, I recommend you to do a pregnancy test. It is the easiest and right way to determine whether you’re pregnant or not. If the result is positive, visit a doctor. He’ll do a blood test to confirm your state. What concerns your period…You say that it is not regular and now you’re on your period. I’d rather say, that you are not pregnant (but it doesn’t mean that you don’t have to do a test). Sometimes it happens. Whether changes, stress, infection, diet, physical exercises could lead to some problems. In this case you also should consult a specialist. He may prescribe pills or drops to improve the flora of your body. And often it is enough. About your boyfriend and precum. No, you can’t get pregnant if you slowed it. But using a pull-out method can be quite risky, because some experts think that precum may contain sperm. However, large-scale studies on the subject haven’t been conducted. My advise: use condoms. He will be satisfied in any case and you protect yourself from unplanned pregnancy and infections that can lead to serious problems. If your boyfriend refuse it – he don’t deserve to be with you. Trust and be close only with a reliable (and tested) person. Take care of yourself! I hope you will be fine and healthy! You can handle with everything!  Reply  18   Danielle   Oct 13, 2016 at 6:31 pm  Thank you so Victoria I will get a test and take it and I’m scared if he has something and I can catch it from him  Reply  19   Danielle   Oct 13, 2016 at 6:33 pm  I don’t no how to tell my mom this is my first time pregnancy  Reply  20   Victoria   Oct 17, 2016 at 3:49 pm  Danielle, of course risks to get infection when you don’t use condoms always exist. That is way you better sign up for an appointment with the gynecologist. So you may learn about your health and how to cope with the problems, if there is any. I’m sure no matter  what your mother will understand and help you. Good luck!  Reply  21   Tisha   Oct 16, 2016 at 7:45 pm  I didnt had sex with my boyfriend but he ejaculated on my navel… i am pretty scared that i might get pregnant, also i had my periods n it happenned on 5th day of my periods. Also he was fingering me after touching himself ..I dont know what to do??  Reply  22   Victoria   Oct 17, 2016 at 3:39 pm  Hi, Tisha! You can’t get pregnant by ejaculation on your navel. It is impossible. He needs to be into you. What concerns fingering… There is a very-very little chance, as I know, to get pregnant. And it is only possible if sperm remained in his fingers and he put them into your vagina. But I must repeat the risk is small. If you are so afraid – do a pregnancy test. And to be more informed I suggest you to read about all possible ways to get pregnant. Good luck!  Reply  23   Brittney   Dec 31, 2016 at 8:17 am  Hi victoria! I am 25 years old, no kids. I usually have 3 to 4 day periods. For the past couple months ive been having unprotected sex with my male friend (actually on and off for 4 years lol) the last times we had sex was nov. 5th (i was fertile) the 11 and 12th ( 3 times each boths nights) and the 20th ( which was the lasy day of a 3 day period that came 3 days early) we have not seen each other since due to him getting back with his ex. I recently was 2 days late on my period, i then started on the 15th of dec. For 2 days and then barely spotted for the next 5 days after. Ive been feeling nauseas to certain smells, when i dont eat for a period of time. Im veryvtired all the time. On edge. Constantly cramping like im constipated. I dont want to accept the symptoms but i very worried. Whats your intake?! You seem very smart! I plan on taking a test soon just dont want to test too early and miss something because i do drink quite often:/  Reply  24   Sam D   Oct 24, 2016 at 11:52 am  I was messing around with a guy on 7th August we never hand sex nor did he penis go inside me but we was rubbing really close naked .

Who is the father ? Should I be worried  Reply  25   Victoria   Oct 25, 2016 at 7:42 am  Hi, Sam! Your second partner, with whom you had sex, is the father. Make an appointment with a doctor and follow his advices! Don’t worry! Take care of yourself and your baby!  Reply  26   Nalini   Oct 27, 2016 at 3:05 pm  I had sex with my partner on 25 oct. initially he didn’t use condom, but later on he put it on. I am not sure whether his precum entered into my vagina, but I feel it did. I am having some serious irregular period issues, like the last period I had was almost after a gap of 5-6 months. It was on 10 Sept. Since then, my period has already been delayed by 15 days and meanwhile I didn’t have any intercourse except on 25 Oct. So should I go for a contraceptive pill to avoid unwanted pregnancy. Out of my irregular period problem I am fearing to take a pill but definitely dont want a pregnancy now. Please reply asap, as it is more than 48 hrs since I had sex.  Reply  27   Nalini   Oct 28, 2016 at 2:17 am  Please reply, its urgent  Reply  28   Victoria   Oct 28, 2016 at 10:14 am  Nalini, unfortunately, I can’t reply to you with all confidence. I don’t think that you may be pregnant, and, yes, a pregnancy test won’t show anything on such an early stage. Probably, you can secure yourself and use a pill. But be very cautious and pick up the pills that won’t harm you or affect your reproductive capacity. Consult with a doctor or at least with a pharmacist. Also, I recommend you to visit a gynecologist. Urgently! Because such gaps between your period are not normal. Don’t postpone it and take care of yourself!

My cycle is usually a 24 days cycle although it has been a bit irregular of late (coming in quite early like 2 days early). Please which one of them could be my baby daddy?  Reply  33   Natalie   Jan 4, 2017 at 6:52 am  Hi, Leslie! I can’t be completely sure who your baby’s daddy is. To me, it’s more likely the second guy (Nov 17), but if you want to know for sure I believe you’d better wait and then ask for a DNA test. If you know exactly when your ovulation comes it can be of some help.  Reply  34   Jaime   Jan 3, 2017 at 1:35 am  Hi, my bf and I had sex on Wednesday the 28th, and when I put the condom on him I accidentally put it on backwards but I did not unroll it. I quickly realized and flipped it over and unrolled it. We then continued, and he never came in me or anything we checked the condom for holes and it was clear. I’m only scared because of the pre come that may have gotten on the condom when it was on him backwards. My period was the 20th through the 26th(this all happened the 28th) thank you.  Reply  35   Natalie   Jan 4, 2017 at 6:58 am  Hello, Jaime! I don’t think you’re pregnant. Even if some of the precum got onto the condom it’s too early in your period. But you can use a test after a couple of weeks just to be sure.

Like I’ve only had my cycle twice before and they were one year apart from each other, it’s been about a year since I’ve had my last and I’m kind of concerned. I’m just worried of the possibility, but this only happened 3 days ago.  Reply  57   Berenice   Jul 17, 2017 at 8:58 am  Hello! Such an irregular cycle itself is a reason for concern. Have you discussed it with a gynecologist?  Reply  58   N/A   Jul 20, 2017 at 4:33 am  I’m worried that I’m pregnant even though I didn’t have full on sex and my boyfriend didn’t ejaculate near/in me. We both lost our virginities to each other just about 3 weeks ago. Im taking the pill but I missed one because I threw it up (food poisoning). I took the pill assigned for the next day because I threw up the pill 30 minutes after I took it. The first time we tried it was a day before my period and he had a condom on. He didn’t go inside of my fully- he could only get the head in and it really hurt me so we just stopped. The day after the first incident I got my period but it was irregular with me bleeding hard for 2 days and spotting to nothing on other days. I thought that this was normal because I started crossfit the day of my period and I did it Tuesday through Thursday. Maybe the stress from working out a lot made my period irregular? I don’t know. We tried to have sex again on Thursday because my period basically last for 3 days (that’s normal btw). We put the condom on wrong (or so we thought) and we kept flipping it back/ forward, rolling and unrolling  for just about 5 minutes. He went inside of me once with that condom on (it was the only one that we had) and we stopped after a few seconds because it hurt. Maybe precum could have gotten on the condom? He kept losing his erection in the process of flipping and stuff so he wasn’t fully aroused.  Im only worried about the second time because that could result in pregnancy even though it’s almost impossible. It’s been 3 weeks now and all of a sudden I’m peeing frequently, and I think I’m constipated. Im also a little bloated and I’m having small cramps in my lower abdomen. These are pregnancy symptoms but maybe it’s PMS? My period is coming up next week so maybe that’s it? What are my chances of being pregnant?  Reply  59   Berenice   Jul 20, 2017 at 11:20 am  Hello! It’s not likely you’re pregnant. Wait for your next period, and if it’s not on time, do a pregnancy test.

But I have been having a “relationship” with this guy for the past year. And we have sex quite often we usually use protection but being the dumb kids we are we notice that without one it feels a lot better so for the past couple of months we have been doing it without the one. I know for a fact that he hasn’t came in because he pulls out extra early and I finish him off. But I read some where that if you have sex muitlpe times in a day without protection that the chances of getting pregnant from pre-cum is higher. This week I was suppose to start but I’m late four days. But my period has never been regular. I would sometimes go 3 months without a period and then only been on it for 3 days. However last 3 months I have gotten one, but each month they started later later. So is it possible I’m pregnant?  Reply  68   Berenice   Oct 20, 2017 at 12:19 pm  Hi, Pat!

I searched it up on google to see if you can get pregnant by pre-cum and it says the most usual answer is no but only if sperm gets to the pre-cum that’s the only how you can get pregnant because pre-cum is only dead sperm cells .

Last November 10th friday me and my girlfriend messed around or the thing you called dry humping but no underwears we just did that for a minute or minute i guess and we stopped. the i fingered her after few moments and oh i accidentally touched the tip of my penis but i didn’t felt any pre cum im not sure and my fingers are dry. and after 2 days she’s having cramps and later that day she feel nauseous only 2 days after our dry humping. On november 14th tuesday She had her period lasted for 4 days and on sunday She said that there’s still a drops of blood from her period and we think that’s totally normal after having period and on monday after that day she saw brown discharges that made us worried then searched it in the internet that brown discharges after a period is typically normal. and the next month 1 week and a half she experienced soreness of breats and sometimes she feels nauseous but we didn’t think she’s pregnant because she’s not eating properly that’s why she experiencing nauseous and a little bit stomach ache, we did a home pregnancy test jusr to make sure and came out negative. And on December 12 she had her period that lasted for 5 days like a normal period. We had another dry humping on December 26 and this time i used condoms cause we’re so sick of being worried all the time. but we quickly alarmed on december 31 because she’s peeing more often than she usually does and having stomach pain and feel nauseous sometimes. And now january 5 she’s experiencing a slightly fever for a few days and she already felt soreness on her breast but she’s not peeing more often anymore. but when she’s pushing down the area on the lower abdomen she feel slightly pain. We’re so worried again and her period is expected next week!! Is there any chance of getting pregnant in this situation? please Reply ASAP!!!

Well, the following must be present:    Healthy egg from a woman  Quality sperm from the man  A warm and a healthy environment- to support the egg for fertilization and implantation  Most people have the basic knowledge of how the reproductive works; however many misconceptions go around reproductive health, for example, you can’t get pregnant from precum. What is Precum?   Precum is the bodily fluid that usually seeps from the penis during intercourse  Cowper’s glands produce the fluid  It travels from the urethra then to the penis  It is also known as pre-ejaculate, pre-ejaculatory fluid, pre-seminal fluid or Cowper’s fluid  You now understand what pre-ejaculate is; let’s move to the misconception that you can’t get pregnant from precum. Truth be told, there are chances of getting pregnant from precum. What are the chances of getting pregnant from precum? You may be asking yourself “what are my chances of getting pregnant from precum” since you are sexually active. Chances of getting pregnant from precum are high. To begin with, during the production of pre-seminal fluid no sperm is present. As earlier mentioned, Cowper’s glands produce the precum and testicles produce sperm. However, the fluid picks sperm along the way. What exactly happens? As the fluid travel via the urethra, the pre-ejaculate can take sperms that are from a previous ejaculation. You have to know that many men don’t notice when the precum comes out. Additionally, they have no control over it. The purpose of the precum is to neutralize the environment of the urethra which is acidic. Precum is alkaline; therefore, making the environment conducive for the sperm to survive. The fluid makes the way clear for the sperm and acts as a lubricant during sex.   For pregnancy to occur, a healthy egg from a woman must be available. Sperm can survive in the body of a woman for seven days. So, if the opening of your vagina comes into contact with pre-seminal fluid from your partner, the precum, containing the sperm will have ample time to travel to the fallopian tubes and wait for ovulation to occur. Although the pre-ejaculate contains a few sperm when compared to the ejaculate itself, studies have proven that the sperm count is evidently high in the precum. Bear in mind that a man starts creating pre-seminal fluid once he becomes erect. Most likely, the fluid was present from the beginning of sexual intercourse. Thus, there are chances of getting pregnant from precum during ovulation. An egg lives between 12 to 24 hours after ovulation; the duration is adequate to increase the chances of getting pregnant from precum while ovulating. Only one sperm is needed to cause a pregnancy. Is it possible to know when you are ovulating? It is possible. The following signs can enable you to predict when ovulating :  Changes in cervical mucus. As you get close to ovulation, the body produces estrogen resulting to cervical mucus which is stretchy and clear. The egg like whites enables the sperm to reach to the egg released during ovulation.  The heightened sense of smell. If you are sensitive to smells in your monthly cycle; chances are that you are ovulating.  Breast tenderness or soreness. If you note your nipples and the breast are sensitive, you are at the peak of ovulation.  Mild pelvic or lower abdominal pain. You may experience a slight ache or pain in the lower abdomen.  Light spotting or discharge. Spotting a brown discharge is a typical sign of ovulation.  During sex, both partners use fingers for sexual arousal or foreplay. Take note that precum is produced when the man is aroused. At this point, if the man touches his penis and gets precum on his fingers and caress your vagina with precum on his fingers, the vagina gets into contact with the fluid, chances of getting pregnant from precum on fingers can’t be ruled out. Remember, the precum contains sperms. The sperm will travel and wait to fertilize an egg released during ovulation hence a pregnancy will occur. Getting pregnant while on birth control Birth control methods are used to prevent pregnancy and plan when to become pregnant. Numerous birth control methods are available for example;  Abstinence  Implants  Exclusive breastfeeding  Diaphragm  Condoms  Pills  Withdrawal (pull out method)  Spermicide  The above methods are not 100% successful. Relying on the pull out of method as a way of birth control is very controversial. The success rate ranges between 73 t0 96 %. On the other hand, the pill is 99%. As for the condom, its success rate is 100% if used well. The man is responsible for the pullout method; he pulls out his penis from the vagina canal just before ejaculation. It is a hard method to use as the success rate depends on the ability of the man to pull out after every sexual experience. When compared to other birth control methods, it is the least efficient. Therefore, chances of getting pregnant from precum while on birth control are possible, withdrawal method being on the lead. Why is it so?   Withdrawal method lies entirely with the male. The woman has no control over it. He has to be in a position to determine when he is ready to ejaculate and practice self-control at the point of passion and ensures he doesn’t ejaculate. If the precum contains sperm, you are likely to become pregnant; this is because the man may not notice the pre-ejaculate and have no control over it. Pregnancy may end taking place. The reliable way to avoid the presence of sperm in the precum is for the man to urinate after the previous ejaculation. In Conclusion Chances of becoming pregnant are high under the following conditions:  If you are ovulating  If you are using withdrawal method as a way birth control  If your partner had previously ejaculated, and you are having intercourse the second time but he didn't urinate.  If the above conditions are present, chances of getting pregnant with precum are high. Wish you well as you take the necessary precautions to avoid getting pregnant from precum. Be in control of your sex life.        Share:   Tweet this   Share on Facebook  Share on Google+         RECENTLY ADDED     What Is Letrozole Used For In Men ?  Health & Wellness > General Health  November 23rd 2016  Hormonal balance is very important; when the hormones are properly balanced, the body works as expected. But when they are out of balance, the body begins experiencing problems. Estrogen, commonly termed as the female hormone and testosterone considered as the male hormone are crucial in the reproductive system. Men can experience elevated levels of estrogen. But does a man produce estrogen? Yes, a man’s body produces estrogen but in low levels. It’s produced mainly by adrenal glands as well as the testicles. Estrogen hormone is important in a man; it plays a critical role in bone density, lipid metabolism, sexual maturation, and growth. However, it becomes a problem when the levels rise causing a number of problems in a male like:

Water retention 
Gynecomastia 
Acne 
Cholesterol problems 
Cardiovascular issues 
Low libido 
Infertility

Health & Wellness > General Health  November 14th 2017  Current medications used to prevent migraines are separated into a first, second, and third choice, a hierarchy of sorts that provides a flowsheet of what to do when some medications fail. It is not etched in stone, offered as a guideline only. Many physicians and headache specialists will mix or jump classes according to their own preferences or experience.
1. First choice includes

propranolol (beta-blocker), verapamil (Calan—calcium channel blocker),
amitriptyline (Elavil—antidepressant), and
topiramate (Topamax) and valproate (Depakene)—anti-seizure meds.

 
Pregnancy is a contraindication to valproate, which can cause birth defects. The beta-blockers shouldn’t be used in smokers or people over 60, which may raise the risk of stroke.
 
2. Second choice: for those who don’t respond adequately to the first-choice medications, there are

No, they’re not called beta blockers because they’re being tested. That’s in the computer world. Instead, these are medications, so-called because they actually block things called beta receptors in the heart, blood vessels, and kidneys (and other flavors of them can affect the lungs and intestines, too). Besides blocking the beta-1 receptors being discussed here, there are two other types of beta receptors, beta-2 and beta-3—in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, smooth muscles, and even in fat; but for our purposes we’ll be talking about blocking the effect of the beta-1 receptors.
How do beta blockers work?
The beta-1 blockers not only “block”—that is, compete—with the things that turn the receptors on, but occupy them to render them inactive. Since these receptors, when otherwise properly filled, raise blood pressure by constricting arterial walls and stimulate the heart, blocking them is an excelle ...

KidsHealth / For Teens / Can You Get Pregnant From Fingering?     Print I've never had sex but my boyfriend fingers me. Can you get pregnant from fingering? – Ciara*  Fingering on its own can't lead to pregnancy. But it is possible to get pregnant if a guy gets pre-ejaculate (precum) or ejaculate on his finger and then puts it in a girl's vagina. The chances of this happening are low, though.  A more likely situation than pregnancy is getting an infection from fingering. So not only will you need to avoid any contact with precum or ejaculate, your boyfriend should wash his hands first and you should make sure neither of you has cuts and sores.  If you have any questions or concerns, or if you think you might have an infection, talk to your doctor.  *Names have been changed to protect user privacy.

Top 4 Questions Revealed        Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-Cum? Top 4 Questions Revealed   By  Pobby -   April 12, 2016  51       Share on Facebook  Tweet on Twitter     tweet    pre cum and pregnant       Many people take the risk of having sex without protection because they believe that as long as they don’t cum, the woman won’t get pregnant. While this makes perfect sense, it’s not the case at all. Precum can cause a woman to get pregnant although the male didn’t fully ejaculate inside of her.  Pulling out may lower the risk of getting pregnant, but there will always be a chance of pregnancy due to precum. Let’s determine what precum is first before we dig deeper into the subject.   Table of Contents What is Precum? Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum? Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum? Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy? Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  What is Precum?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum? The short answer is yes. Precum occurs when a male is aroused and before a person has an orgasm. Now, this white sticky fluid isn’t as thick as regular cum and won’t have the same potency.  In fact, precum doesn’t contain any sperm – at all. But, it can still get you pregnant. The issue is that this precum flows through the same opening that cum does. So, leftover sperm is picked up in the urethra, will travel with the pre cum and can cause pregnancy.  Scientists still don’t know the exact reason for pre-ejaculate, but they believe that it helps reduce the acidity in the vagina. Ultimately, by reducing the acidity levels, the sperm would survive longer inside of the vagina as it travels. Acid will kill the sperm, so pre cum aims to lessen this acidity to promote fertilization.  Can precum get you pregnant? Absolutely, but the chances are much lower than regular cum.   Studies found that out of a sampling of 27 men, only 41% of them had sperm in their precum. The amount of sperm present was very low, but that doesn’t indicate that pregnancy can’t occur. There is simply a lower chance for pregnancy.  If you’re practicing the pull out method, you’ll want to ensure that cum does not come in contact with the vagina at all. Many couples believe that as long as cum is on the outside of the body, the woman won’t get pregnant. However, this is only partially correct. Cum located near the vagina can travel inside of the vagina with even just a drip of cum.  So, you want to ensure that you do not ejaculate on the outside of the vagina or in the immediate vicinity. Even a minute amount of ejaculate contains enough sperm for a woman to get pregnant. Instead, you want to wear a condom or ensure that the woman is on birth control to prevent any unexpected pregnancies from occurring.   Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum?  Precum has been associated with a “safe way” to ensure that STDs are not transferred. This is misinformation that every couple should be aware of. Studies have demonstrated that HIV is present in the majority of precum samples.  This demonstrates that precum can carry an STD.  A major issue exists with precum because it often flows through the urethra and escapes out of the tip of the penis unnoticed. Unlike ejaculation, men are not able to feel precum and won’t know when precum is starting to come out of the body.  Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum?  Pre-ejaculate occurs before ejaculation. When a man reaches this point, there will be two times in which a woman can become pregnant:   High Risk: A high of pregnancy exists if a man ejaculates fully during intercourse. This would occur after precum.  Low Risk: Precum without full ejaculation presents a low risk of pregnancy.   There is a very low amount of sperm in precum fluid. This amount is much lower than what is present inside of a man’s cum, but there is still a risk of pregnancy occurring.  A good way to visualize this is to know how much sperm is found within normal cum. In normal ejaculation, there are approximately 100 million sperm in just one milliliter of fluid. This sperm then gets lessened because only 10 million sperm will get past cervical mucus in the woman’s vagina.  [Read more about Cervical Mucus]  The uterine tract will also filter an additional 10% of sperm, leaving just 1 million sperm left. Ultimately, only 100,000 sperm that will exist long enough to enter the fallopian tubes. This all occurs when there is 100 million sperm. Precum only contains 3 million sperm on average (when present).  The chances of pregnancy are extremely low, but they do exist.  Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy?  Avoiding pregnancy requires diligence and some other form of contraceptive aside from the famous pull out method. There are plenty of forms of contraceptives on the market, but the most common are:   Condoms: A very highly effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs. Condoms are worn over the penis and trap semen before it’s allowed to enter into the vagina. There is a 0.02 chance of becoming pregnancy when a condom is worn.  Female Condom: While not as common, the female condom can be purchased over-the-counter and has proven to be 95% effective at protecting against pregnancy. More expensive, a female condom is more durable and can be inserted into the vagina up to 8 hours before intercourse.  Birth Control : Birth control can be highly effective, but it depends on the woman. The percentage of protection that birth control provides is 91% – 99%. The 91% protection is a little low for most people and will provide a 9% chance of pregnancy. Ultimately, 1 out of 12 people on birth control can become pregnant based off of these statistics.   A mix of contraceptives is recommended to boost the risk of successful pregnancy avoidance. Typically, a condom and birth control are used in conjunction with one another to ensure the utmost in protection against getting pregnant. The pullout method can be used at this time to further reduce the risk of getting pregnant.  Contraceptive implants are becoming more popular and require surgery to be implanted in the body. These implants are very effective, yet they come with side effects that can be life threatening and will be very costly.  Male sterilization provides full protection against pregnancy. A woman can get her tubes tied , which would reduce the risk of pregnancy with a very high accuracy rate. While 99.9% effective, there have been cases wherein a woman with her tubes tied did get pregnant, but this is not the norm.  Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum when dry humping? There is always a possibility, but the chances are so small that it is very unlikely. Since precum contains such little sperm, if any, there is already a small chance of getting pregnant.  Since dry humping occurs outside of the body, it would take a drop of precum to drip into the vagina and pass through the cervical mucus all the way into the fallopian tubes for pregnancy to occur.  Can it happen? Hypothetically, it can happen, but the chances are extremely low. In fact, the chances are so low that it would be nearly impossible for pregnancy to occur with dry humping.  [Read more about Dry Humping]  Precum does contain sperm in most samples thanks to the cut in the urethra. If you’re trying to avoid pregnancy, make sure you do not allow precum to enter into the vagina.

Which i didnt know how to answer her  because i wasnt SURE. My friend started her period July 14th or 17th. A guy slid his penis in half way on the 20th. He didnt cum inside her. She had sex on the 24th and he did cum inside of her also multiple more times after that.  The pregnancy test came back positive 8/12. What are the chances of her getting pregnant by the first time? Why did the test come back positive so early?    Reply         Tita   August 29, 2017 at 7:15 pm     You only have to wait 2 weeks after conception.

The first time he pulled out and came the second time it was longer and pulled out but didn’t ejaculate. I’m scared that I might be pregnant from pre cum and my period starts next week! What are the chances that I am pregnant?    Reply         Strng   September 28, 2017 at 9:05 am     My girlfriend is still a virgin and We decided to have sex. My penis is on the opening of her vagina and just pretend that im fucking her but we havent undergo intercourse because she said it hurts she likes the feeling of my penis touching her vaginal wall.

The chances are extremely slim, near zero but highly unlikely    Reply           Jess20   October 2, 2017 at 8:10 am     Had sex with boyfriend, using the pullout method, have never gotten pregnant(been doing it for more than a year with him), since I’m not on BC we usually do it once a day, we had a fuck it lets do it twice moment, he came, wiped it off, went to the bathroom fully once then forced it out two more times, even washed his entire dick with soap then we went at it again, we started regretting it a few hours later. I’m currently a broke college student, I don’t have health insurance, and I know I fucked up I knew the risk, I don’t need to hear the ‘oh well you should of gotten some sort of protection’. I’m just here to see if anyone has gone through the same situation. — For anyone wondering if the pullout method works. YES PULLOUT METHOD HAS WORKED FOR ME BUT ONLY ONCE A DAY. IT DOESNT WORK FOR EVERYONE OKAY? The guy has to be in complete control and know when he’s close, if you’re sexually inexperienced DO NOT try the pullout method, it might be working for me and my boyfriend also because of how fertile we are. We’ve never gone to the doctor(Which I know is really stupid and I highly recommend to go check yourself out if you’re having unprotected sex). I’m irregular and have extremely bad periods since I can remember but I’m assuming I may not be that fertile because of it. Do not be stupid and just use a condom and get on birth control.

Top 4 Questions Revealed        Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-Cum? Top 4 Questions Revealed   By  Pobby -   April 12, 2016  51       Share on Facebook  Tweet on Twitter     tweet    pre cum and pregnant       Many people take the risk of having sex without protection because they believe that as long as they don’t cum, the woman won’t get pregnant. While this makes perfect sense, it’s not the case at all. Precum can cause a woman to get pregnant although the male didn’t fully ejaculate inside of her.  Pulling out may lower the risk of getting pregnant, but there will always be a chance of pregnancy due to precum. Let’s determine what precum is first before we dig deeper into the subject.   Table of Contents What is Precum? Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum? Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum? Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy? Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  What is Precum?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum? The short answer is yes. Precum occurs when a male is aroused and before a person has an orgasm. Now, this white sticky fluid isn’t as thick as regular cum and won’t have the same potency.  In fact, precum doesn’t contain any sperm – at all. But, it can still get you pregnant. The issue is that this precum flows through the same opening that cum does. So, leftover sperm is picked up in the urethra, will travel with the pre cum and can cause pregnancy.  Scientists still don’t know the exact reason for pre-ejaculate, but they believe that it helps reduce the acidity in the vagina. Ultimately, by reducing the acidity levels, the sperm would survive longer inside of the vagina as it travels. Acid will kill the sperm, so pre cum aims to lessen this acidity to promote fertilization.  Can precum get you pregnant? Absolutely, but the chances are much lower than regular cum.   Studies found that out of a sampling of 27 men, only 41% of them had sperm in their precum. The amount of sperm present was very low, but that doesn’t indicate that pregnancy can’t occur. There is simply a lower chance for pregnancy.  If you’re practicing the pull out method, you’ll want to ensure that cum does not come in contact with the vagina at all. Many couples believe that as long as cum is on the outside of the body, the woman won’t get pregnant. However, this is only partially correct. Cum located near the vagina can travel inside of the vagina with even just a drip of cum.  So, you want to ensure that you do not ejaculate on the outside of the vagina or in the immediate vicinity. Even a minute amount of ejaculate contains enough sperm for a woman to get pregnant. Instead, you want to wear a condom or ensure that the woman is on birth control to prevent any unexpected pregnancies from occurring.   Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum?  Precum has been associated with a “safe way” to ensure that STDs are not transferred. This is misinformation that every couple should be aware of. Studies have demonstrated that HIV is present in the majority of precum samples.  This demonstrates that precum can carry an STD.  A major issue exists with precum because it often flows through the urethra and escapes out of the tip of the penis unnoticed. Unlike ejaculation, men are not able to feel precum and won’t know when precum is starting to come out of the body.  Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum?  Pre-ejaculate occurs before ejaculation. When a man reaches this point, there will be two times in which a woman can become pregnant:   High Risk: A high of pregnancy exists if a man ejaculates fully during intercourse. This would occur after precum.  Low Risk: Precum without full ejaculation presents a low risk of pregnancy.   There is a very low amount of sperm in precum fluid. This amount is much lower than what is present inside of a man’s cum, but there is still a risk of pregnancy occurring.  A good way to visualize this is to know how much sperm is found within normal cum. In normal ejaculation, there are approximately 100 million sperm in just one milliliter of fluid. This sperm then gets lessened because only 10 million sperm will get past cervical mucus in the woman’s vagina.  [Read more about Cervical Mucus]  The uterine tract will also filter an additional 10% of sperm, leaving just 1 million sperm left. Ultimately, only 100,000 sperm that will exist long enough to enter the fallopian tubes. This all occurs when there is 100 million sperm. Precum only contains 3 million sperm on average (when present).  The chances of pregnancy are extremely low, but they do exist.  Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy?  Avoiding pregnancy requires diligence and some other form of contraceptive aside from the famous pull out method. There are plenty of forms of contraceptives on the market, but the most common are:   Condoms: A very highly effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs. Condoms are worn over the penis and trap semen before it’s allowed to enter into the vagina. There is a 0.02 chance of becoming pregnancy when a condom is worn.  Female Condom: While not as common, the female condom can be purchased over-the-counter and has proven to be 95% effective at protecting against pregnancy. More expensive, a female condom is more durable and can be inserted into the vagina up to 8 hours before intercourse.  Birth Control : Birth control can be highly effective, but it depends on the woman. The percentage of protection that birth control provides is 91% – 99%. The 91% protection is a little low for most people and will provide a 9% chance of pregnancy. Ultimately, 1 out of 12 people on birth control can become pregnant based off of these statistics.   A mix of contraceptives is recommended to boost the risk of successful pregnancy avoidance. Typically, a condom and birth control are used in conjunction with one another to ensure the utmost in protection against getting pregnant. The pullout method can be used at this time to further reduce the risk of getting pregnant.  Contraceptive implants are becoming more popular and require surgery to be implanted in the body. These implants are very effective, yet they come with side effects that can be life threatening and will be very costly.  Male sterilization provides full protection against pregnancy. A woman can get her tubes tied , which would reduce the risk of pregnancy with a very high accuracy rate. While 99.9% effective, there have been cases wherein a woman with her tubes tied did get pregnant, but this is not the norm.  Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum when dry humping? There is always a possibility, but the chances are so small that it is very unlikely. Since precum contains such little sperm, if any, there is already a small chance of getting pregnant.  Since dry humping occurs outside of the body, it would take a drop of precum to drip into the vagina and pass through the cervical mucus all the way into the fallopian tubes for pregnancy to occur.  Can it happen? Hypothetically, it can happen, but the chances are extremely low. In fact, the chances are so low that it would be nearly impossible for pregnancy to occur with dry humping.  [Read more about Dry Humping]  Precum does contain sperm in most samples thanks to the cut in the urethra. If you’re trying to avoid pregnancy, make sure you do not allow precum to enter into the vagina.

Reply         Therese   August 1, 2017 at 1:42 pm     we had unprotected sex with my bf and I was so sure that he ejaculated outside my vagina. He pulled it off of me when he was about to ejaculate. Can I still get pregnant through precum?    Reply         Jojo   August 13, 2017 at 6:00 pm     So im trying to find something out for a friend. Which i didnt know how to answer her  because i wasnt SURE. My friend started her period July 14th or 17th. A guy slid his penis in half way on the 20th. He didnt cum inside her. She had sex on the 24th and he did cum inside of her also multiple more times after that.  The pregnancy test came back positive 8/12. What are the chances of her getting pregnant by the first time? Why did the test come back positive so early?    Reply         Tita   August 29, 2017 at 7:15 pm     You only have to wait 2 weeks after conception.

The chances are extremely slim, near zero but highly unlikely    Reply           Jess20   October 2, 2017 at 8:10 am     Had sex with boyfriend, using the pullout method, have never gotten pregnant(been doing it for more than a year with him), since I’m not on BC we usually do it once a day, we had a fuck it lets do it twice moment, he came, wiped it off, went to the bathroom fully once then forced it out two more times, even washed his entire dick with soap then we went at it again, we started regretting it a few hours later. I’m currently a broke college student, I don’t have health insurance, and I know I fucked up I knew the risk, I don’t need to hear the ‘oh well you should of gotten some sort of protection’. I’m just here to see if anyone has gone through the same situation. — For anyone wondering if the pullout method works. YES PULLOUT METHOD HAS WORKED FOR ME BUT ONLY ONCE A DAY. IT DOESNT WORK FOR EVERYONE OKAY? The guy has to be in complete control and know when he’s close, if you’re sexually inexperienced DO NOT try the pullout method, it might be working for me and my boyfriend also because of how fertile we are. We’ve never gone to the doctor(Which I know is really stupid and I highly recommend to go check yourself out if you’re having unprotected sex). I’m irregular and have extremely bad periods since I can remember but I’m assuming I may not be that fertile because of it. Do not be stupid and just use a condom and get on birth control.

Top 4 Questions Revealed        Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-Cum? Top 4 Questions Revealed   By  Pobby -   April 12, 2016  51       Share on Facebook  Tweet on Twitter     tweet    pre cum and pregnant       Many people take the risk of having sex without protection because they believe that as long as they don’t cum, the woman won’t get pregnant. While this makes perfect sense, it’s not the case at all. Precum can cause a woman to get pregnant although the male didn’t fully ejaculate inside of her.  Pulling out may lower the risk of getting pregnant, but there will always be a chance of pregnancy due to precum. Let’s determine what precum is first before we dig deeper into the subject.   Table of Contents What is Precum? Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum? Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum? Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy? Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  What is Precum?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum? The short answer is yes. Precum occurs when a male is aroused and before a person has an orgasm. Now, this white sticky fluid isn’t as thick as regular cum and won’t have the same potency.  In fact, precum doesn’t contain any sperm – at all. But, it can still get you pregnant. The issue is that this precum flows through the same opening that cum does. So, leftover sperm is picked up in the urethra, will travel with the pre cum and can cause pregnancy.  Scientists still don’t know the exact reason for pre-ejaculate, but they believe that it helps reduce the acidity in the vagina. Ultimately, by reducing the acidity levels, the sperm would survive longer inside of the vagina as it travels. Acid will kill the sperm, so pre cum aims to lessen this acidity to promote fertilization.  Can precum get you pregnant? Absolutely, but the chances are much lower than regular cum.   Studies found that out of a sampling of 27 men, only 41% of them had sperm in their precum. The amount of sperm present was very low, but that doesn’t indicate that pregnancy can’t occur. There is simply a lower chance for pregnancy.  If you’re practicing the pull out method, you’ll want to ensure that cum does not come in contact with the vagina at all. Many couples believe that as long as cum is on the outside of the body, the woman won’t get pregnant. However, this is only partially correct. Cum located near the vagina can travel inside of the vagina with even just a drip of cum.  So, you want to ensure that you do not ejaculate on the outside of the vagina or in the immediate vicinity. Even a minute amount of ejaculate contains enough sperm for a woman to get pregnant. Instead, you want to wear a condom or ensure that the woman is on birth control to prevent any unexpected pregnancies from occurring.   Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum?  Precum has been associated with a “safe way” to ensure that STDs are not transferred. This is misinformation that every couple should be aware of. Studies have demonstrated that HIV is present in the majority of precum samples.  This demonstrates that precum can carry an STD.  A major issue exists with precum because it often flows through the urethra and escapes out of the tip of the penis unnoticed. Unlike ejaculation, men are not able to feel precum and won’t know when precum is starting to come out of the body.  Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum?  Pre-ejaculate occurs before ejaculation. When a man reaches this point, there will be two times in which a woman can become pregnant:   High Risk: A high of pregnancy exists if a man ejaculates fully during intercourse. This would occur after precum.  Low Risk: Precum without full ejaculation presents a low risk of pregnancy.   There is a very low amount of sperm in precum fluid. This amount is much lower than what is present inside of a man’s cum, but there is still a risk of pregnancy occurring.  A good way to visualize this is to know how much sperm is found within normal cum. In normal ejaculation, there are approximately 100 million sperm in just one milliliter of fluid. This sperm then gets lessened because only 10 million sperm will get past cervical mucus in the woman’s vagina.  [Read more about Cervical Mucus]  The uterine tract will also filter an additional 10% of sperm, leaving just 1 million sperm left. Ultimately, only 100,000 sperm that will exist long enough to enter the fallopian tubes. This all occurs when there is 100 million sperm. Precum only contains 3 million sperm on average (when present).  The chances of pregnancy are extremely low, but they do exist.  Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy?  Avoiding pregnancy requires diligence and some other form of contraceptive aside from the famous pull out method. There are plenty of forms of contraceptives on the market, but the most common are:   Condoms: A very highly effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs. Condoms are worn over the penis and trap semen before it’s allowed to enter into the vagina. There is a 0.02 chance of becoming pregnancy when a condom is worn.  Female Condom: While not as common, the female condom can be purchased over-the-counter and has proven to be 95% effective at protecting against pregnancy. More expensive, a female condom is more durable and can be inserted into the vagina up to 8 hours before intercourse.  Birth Control : Birth control can be highly effective, but it depends on the woman. The percentage of protection that birth control provides is 91% – 99%. The 91% protection is a little low for most people and will provide a 9% chance of pregnancy. Ultimately, 1 out of 12 people on birth control can become pregnant based off of these statistics.   A mix of contraceptives is recommended to boost the risk of successful pregnancy avoidance. Typically, a condom and birth control are used in conjunction with one another to ensure the utmost in protection against getting pregnant. The pullout method can be used at this time to further reduce the risk of getting pregnant.  Contraceptive implants are becoming more popular and require surgery to be implanted in the body. These implants are very effective, yet they come with side effects that can be life threatening and will be very costly.  Male sterilization provides full protection against pregnancy. A woman can get her tubes tied , which would reduce the risk of pregnancy with a very high accuracy rate. While 99.9% effective, there have been cases wherein a woman with her tubes tied did get pregnant, but this is not the norm.  Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum when dry humping? There is always a possibility, but the chances are so small that it is very unlikely. Since precum contains such little sperm, if any, there is already a small chance of getting pregnant.  Since dry humping occurs outside of the body, it would take a drop of precum to drip into the vagina and pass through the cervical mucus all the way into the fallopian tubes for pregnancy to occur.  Can it happen? Hypothetically, it can happen, but the chances are extremely low. In fact, the chances are so low that it would be nearly impossible for pregnancy to occur with dry humping.  [Read more about Dry Humping]  Precum does contain sperm in most samples thanks to the cut in the urethra. If you’re trying to avoid pregnancy, make sure you do not allow precum to enter into the vagina.

Reply         Andrea Miller   July 15, 2017 at 5:05 am     Yes, there is a chance of getting pregnant with full ejaculation. As you know cum contains sperm and if the male sperm comes in contacts with a vagina then, the chances are high to get pregnant.

The chances are extremely slim, near zero but highly unlikely    Reply           Jess20   October 2, 2017 at 8:10 am     Had sex with boyfriend, using the pullout method, have never gotten pregnant(been doing it for more than a year with him), since I’m not on BC we usually do it once a day, we had a fuck it lets do it twice moment, he came, wiped it off, went to the bathroom fully once then forced it out two more times, even washed his entire dick with soap then we went at it again, we started regretting it a few hours later. I’m currently a broke college student, I don’t have health insurance, and I know I fucked up I knew the risk, I don’t need to hear the ‘oh well you should of gotten some sort of protection’. I’m just here to see if anyone has gone through the same situation. — For anyone wondering if the pullout method works. YES PULLOUT METHOD HAS WORKED FOR ME BUT ONLY ONCE A DAY. IT DOESNT WORK FOR EVERYONE OKAY? The guy has to be in complete control and know when he’s close, if you’re sexually inexperienced DO NOT try the pullout method, it might be working for me and my boyfriend also because of how fertile we are. We’ve never gone to the doctor(Which I know is really stupid and I highly recommend to go check yourself out if you’re having unprotected sex). I’m irregular and have extremely bad periods since I can remember but I’m assuming I may not be that fertile because of it. Do not be stupid and just use a condom and get on birth control.

Top 4 Questions Revealed        Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-Cum? Top 4 Questions Revealed   By  Pobby -   April 12, 2016  51       Share on Facebook  Tweet on Twitter     tweet    pre cum and pregnant       Many people take the risk of having sex without protection because they believe that as long as they don’t cum, the woman won’t get pregnant. While this makes perfect sense, it’s not the case at all. Precum can cause a woman to get pregnant although the male didn’t fully ejaculate inside of her.  Pulling out may lower the risk of getting pregnant, but there will always be a chance of pregnancy due to precum. Let’s determine what precum is first before we dig deeper into the subject.   Table of Contents What is Precum? Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum? Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum? Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy? Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  What is Precum?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum? The short answer is yes. Precum occurs when a male is aroused and before a person has an orgasm. Now, this white sticky fluid isn’t as thick as regular cum and won’t have the same potency.  In fact, precum doesn’t contain any sperm – at all. But, it can still get you pregnant. The issue is that this precum flows through the same opening that cum does. So, leftover sperm is picked up in the urethra, will travel with the pre cum and can cause pregnancy.  Scientists still don’t know the exact reason for pre-ejaculate, but they believe that it helps reduce the acidity in the vagina. Ultimately, by reducing the acidity levels, the sperm would survive longer inside of the vagina as it travels. Acid will kill the sperm, so pre cum aims to lessen this acidity to promote fertilization.  Can precum get you pregnant? Absolutely, but the chances are much lower than regular cum.   Studies found that out of a sampling of 27 men, only 41% of them had sperm in their precum. The amount of sperm present was very low, but that doesn’t indicate that pregnancy can’t occur. There is simply a lower chance for pregnancy.  If you’re practicing the pull out method, you’ll want to ensure that cum does not come in contact with the vagina at all. Many couples believe that as long as cum is on the outside of the body, the woman won’t get pregnant. However, this is only partially correct. Cum located near the vagina can travel inside of the vagina with even just a drip of cum.  So, you want to ensure that you do not ejaculate on the outside of the vagina or in the immediate vicinity. Even a minute amount of ejaculate contains enough sperm for a woman to get pregnant. Instead, you want to wear a condom or ensure that the woman is on birth control to prevent any unexpected pregnancies from occurring.   Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum?  Precum has been associated with a “safe way” to ensure that STDs are not transferred. This is misinformation that every couple should be aware of. Studies have demonstrated that HIV is present in the majority of precum samples.  This demonstrates that precum can carry an STD.  A major issue exists with precum because it often flows through the urethra and escapes out of the tip of the penis unnoticed. Unlike ejaculation, men are not able to feel precum and won’t know when precum is starting to come out of the body.  Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum?  Pre-ejaculate occurs before ejaculation. When a man reaches this point, there will be two times in which a woman can become pregnant:   High Risk: A high of pregnancy exists if a man ejaculates fully during intercourse. This would occur after precum.  Low Risk: Precum without full ejaculation presents a low risk of pregnancy.   There is a very low amount of sperm in precum fluid. This amount is much lower than what is present inside of a man’s cum, but there is still a risk of pregnancy occurring.  A good way to visualize this is to know how much sperm is found within normal cum. In normal ejaculation, there are approximately 100 million sperm in just one milliliter of fluid. This sperm then gets lessened because only 10 million sperm will get past cervical mucus in the woman’s vagina.  [Read more about Cervical Mucus]  The uterine tract will also filter an additional 10% of sperm, leaving just 1 million sperm left. Ultimately, only 100,000 sperm that will exist long enough to enter the fallopian tubes. This all occurs when there is 100 million sperm. Precum only contains 3 million sperm on average (when present).  The chances of pregnancy are extremely low, but they do exist.  Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy?  Avoiding pregnancy requires diligence and some other form of contraceptive aside from the famous pull out method. There are plenty of forms of contraceptives on the market, but the most common are:   Condoms: A very highly effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs. Condoms are worn over the penis and trap semen before it’s allowed to enter into the vagina. There is a 0.02 chance of becoming pregnancy when a condom is worn.  Female Condom: While not as common, the female condom can be purchased over-the-counter and has proven to be 95% effective at protecting against pregnancy. More expensive, a female condom is more durable and can be inserted into the vagina up to 8 hours before intercourse.  Birth Control : Birth control can be highly effective, but it depends on the woman. The percentage of protection that birth control provides is 91% – 99%. The 91% protection is a little low for most people and will provide a 9% chance of pregnancy. Ultimately, 1 out of 12 people on birth control can become pregnant based off of these statistics.   A mix of contraceptives is recommended to boost the risk of successful pregnancy avoidance. Typically, a condom and birth control are used in conjunction with one another to ensure the utmost in protection against getting pregnant. The pullout method can be used at this time to further reduce the risk of getting pregnant.  Contraceptive implants are becoming more popular and require surgery to be implanted in the body. These implants are very effective, yet they come with side effects that can be life threatening and will be very costly.  Male sterilization provides full protection against pregnancy. A woman can get her tubes tied , which would reduce the risk of pregnancy with a very high accuracy rate. While 99.9% effective, there have been cases wherein a woman with her tubes tied did get pregnant, but this is not the norm.  Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum when dry humping? There is always a possibility, but the chances are so small that it is very unlikely. Since precum contains such little sperm, if any, there is already a small chance of getting pregnant.  Since dry humping occurs outside of the body, it would take a drop of precum to drip into the vagina and pass through the cervical mucus all the way into the fallopian tubes for pregnancy to occur.  Can it happen? Hypothetically, it can happen, but the chances are extremely low. In fact, the chances are so low that it would be nearly impossible for pregnancy to occur with dry humping.  [Read more about Dry Humping]  Precum does contain sperm in most samples thanks to the cut in the urethra. If you’re trying to avoid pregnancy, make sure you do not allow precum to enter into the vagina.

Me and my boyfriend had sex for 10 months, which he never even got off, but I got pregnant from precum.. but it took a whole 10 months for it to happen    Reply         abby   November 9, 2017 at 9:57 pm     hi jess ..are your partner wearing condom and get pregnant cause it rolls off thanks    Reply               Hello   June 18, 2017 at 6:46 pm     So, if I had sex with two different people, one only leaving precum, and the other fully ejaculating. Would the person who fully ejaculated be more likely to make a woman pregnant?    Reply         Andrea Miller   July 15, 2017 at 5:05 am     Yes, there is a chance of getting pregnant with full ejaculation. As you know cum contains sperm and if the male sperm comes in contacts with a vagina then, the chances are high to get pregnant. According to NHS http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/975.aspx you can easily get pregnant from cum/discharge and also if you don’t to want to pregnant then, make sure you follow the precaution https://thelifesquare.com/pregnant-from-precum-8575481/ .

The chances are extremely slim, near zero but highly unlikely    Reply           Jess20   October 2, 2017 at 8:10 am     Had sex with boyfriend, using the pullout method, have never gotten pregnant(been doing it for more than a year with him), since I’m not on BC we usually do it once a day, we had a fuck it lets do it twice moment, he came, wiped it off, went to the bathroom fully once then forced it out two more times, even washed his entire dick with soap then we went at it again, we started regretting it a few hours later. I’m currently a broke college student, I don’t have health insurance, and I know I fucked up I knew the risk, I don’t need to hear the ‘oh well you should of gotten some sort of protection’. I’m just here to see if anyone has gone through the same situation. — For anyone wondering if the pullout method works. YES PULLOUT METHOD HAS WORKED FOR ME BUT ONLY ONCE A DAY. IT DOESNT WORK FOR EVERYONE OKAY? The guy has to be in complete control and know when he’s close, if you’re sexually inexperienced DO NOT try the pullout method, it might be working for me and my boyfriend also because of how fertile we are. We’ve never gone to the doctor(Which I know is really stupid and I highly recommend to go check yourself out if you’re having unprotected sex). I’m irregular and have extremely bad periods since I can remember but I’m assuming I may not be that fertile because of it. Do not be stupid and just use a condom and get on birth control.

Top 4 Questions Revealed        Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-Cum? Top 4 Questions Revealed   By  Pobby -   April 12, 2016  51       Share on Facebook  Tweet on Twitter     tweet    pre cum and pregnant       Many people take the risk of having sex without protection because they believe that as long as they don’t cum, the woman won’t get pregnant. While this makes perfect sense, it’s not the case at all. Precum can cause a woman to get pregnant although the male didn’t fully ejaculate inside of her.  Pulling out may lower the risk of getting pregnant, but there will always be a chance of pregnancy due to precum. Let’s determine what precum is first before we dig deeper into the subject.   Table of Contents What is Precum? Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum? Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum? Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy? Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  What is Precum?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum? The short answer is yes. Precum occurs when a male is aroused and before a person has an orgasm. Now, this white sticky fluid isn’t as thick as regular cum and won’t have the same potency.  In fact, precum doesn’t contain any sperm – at all. But, it can still get you pregnant. The issue is that this precum flows through the same opening that cum does. So, leftover sperm is picked up in the urethra, will travel with the pre cum and can cause pregnancy.  Scientists still don’t know the exact reason for pre-ejaculate, but they believe that it helps reduce the acidity in the vagina. Ultimately, by reducing the acidity levels, the sperm would survive longer inside of the vagina as it travels. Acid will kill the sperm, so pre cum aims to lessen this acidity to promote fertilization.  Can precum get you pregnant? Absolutely, but the chances are much lower than regular cum.   Studies found that out of a sampling of 27 men, only 41% of them had sperm in their precum. The amount of sperm present was very low, but that doesn’t indicate that pregnancy can’t occur. There is simply a lower chance for pregnancy.  If you’re practicing the pull out method, you’ll want to ensure that cum does not come in contact with the vagina at all. Many couples believe that as long as cum is on the outside of the body, the woman won’t get pregnant. However, this is only partially correct. Cum located near the vagina can travel inside of the vagina with even just a drip of cum.  So, you want to ensure that you do not ejaculate on the outside of the vagina or in the immediate vicinity. Even a minute amount of ejaculate contains enough sperm for a woman to get pregnant. Instead, you want to wear a condom or ensure that the woman is on birth control to prevent any unexpected pregnancies from occurring.   Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum?  Precum has been associated with a “safe way” to ensure that STDs are not transferred. This is misinformation that every couple should be aware of. Studies have demonstrated that HIV is present in the majority of precum samples.  This demonstrates that precum can carry an STD.  A major issue exists with precum because it often flows through the urethra and escapes out of the tip of the penis unnoticed. Unlike ejaculation, men are not able to feel precum and won’t know when precum is starting to come out of the body.  Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum?  Pre-ejaculate occurs before ejaculation. When a man reaches this point, there will be two times in which a woman can become pregnant:   High Risk: A high of pregnancy exists if a man ejaculates fully during intercourse. This would occur after precum.  Low Risk: Precum without full ejaculation presents a low risk of pregnancy.   There is a very low amount of sperm in precum fluid. This amount is much lower than what is present inside of a man’s cum, but there is still a risk of pregnancy occurring.  A good way to visualize this is to know how much sperm is found within normal cum. In normal ejaculation, there are approximately 100 million sperm in just one milliliter of fluid. This sperm then gets lessened because only 10 million sperm will get past cervical mucus in the woman’s vagina.  [Read more about Cervical Mucus]  The uterine tract will also filter an additional 10% of sperm, leaving just 1 million sperm left. Ultimately, only 100,000 sperm that will exist long enough to enter the fallopian tubes. This all occurs when there is 100 million sperm. Precum only contains 3 million sperm on average (when present).  The chances of pregnancy are extremely low, but they do exist.  Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy?  Avoiding pregnancy requires diligence and some other form of contraceptive aside from the famous pull out method. There are plenty of forms of contraceptives on the market, but the most common are:   Condoms: A very highly effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs. Condoms are worn over the penis and trap semen before it’s allowed to enter into the vagina. There is a 0.02 chance of becoming pregnancy when a condom is worn.  Female Condom: While not as common, the female condom can be purchased over-the-counter and has proven to be 95% effective at protecting against pregnancy. More expensive, a female condom is more durable and can be inserted into the vagina up to 8 hours before intercourse.  Birth Control : Birth control can be highly effective, but it depends on the woman. The percentage of protection that birth control provides is 91% – 99%. The 91% protection is a little low for most people and will provide a 9% chance of pregnancy. Ultimately, 1 out of 12 people on birth control can become pregnant based off of these statistics.   A mix of contraceptives is recommended to boost the risk of successful pregnancy avoidance. Typically, a condom and birth control are used in conjunction with one another to ensure the utmost in protection against getting pregnant. The pullout method can be used at this time to further reduce the risk of getting pregnant.  Contraceptive implants are becoming more popular and require surgery to be implanted in the body. These implants are very effective, yet they come with side effects that can be life threatening and will be very costly.  Male sterilization provides full protection against pregnancy. A woman can get her tubes tied , which would reduce the risk of pregnancy with a very high accuracy rate. While 99.9% effective, there have been cases wherein a woman with her tubes tied did get pregnant, but this is not the norm.  Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum when dry humping? There is always a possibility, but the chances are so small that it is very unlikely. Since precum contains such little sperm, if any, there is already a small chance of getting pregnant.  Since dry humping occurs outside of the body, it would take a drop of precum to drip into the vagina and pass through the cervical mucus all the way into the fallopian tubes for pregnancy to occur.  Can it happen? Hypothetically, it can happen, but the chances are extremely low. In fact, the chances are so low that it would be nearly impossible for pregnancy to occur with dry humping.  [Read more about Dry Humping]  Precum does contain sperm in most samples thanks to the cut in the urethra. If you’re trying to avoid pregnancy, make sure you do not allow precum to enter into the vagina.

Reply         meh   June 18, 2017 at 6:48 pm     There’s very little and low chances of you being pregnant by pre ejaculation, I’ve had unprotected sex with my boyfriend for over a year, and I haven’t gotten pregnant from precum yet. So the odds must be very small    Reply         Jess   October 10, 2017 at 8:59 am     I thought the same thing! Me and my boyfriend had sex for 10 months, which he never even got off, but I got pregnant from precum.. but it took a whole 10 months for it to happen    Reply         abby   November 9, 2017 at 9:57 pm     hi jess ..are your partner wearing condom and get pregnant cause it rolls off thanks    Reply               Hello   June 18, 2017 at 6:46 pm     So, if I had sex with two different people, one only leaving precum, and the other fully ejaculating. Would the person who fully ejaculated be more likely to make a woman pregnant?    Reply         Andrea Miller   July 15, 2017 at 5:05 am     Yes, there is a chance of getting pregnant with full ejaculation. As you know cum contains sperm and if the male sperm comes in contacts with a vagina then, the chances are high to get pregnant. According to NHS http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/975.aspx you can easily get pregnant from cum/discharge and also if you don’t to want to pregnant then, make sure you follow the precaution https://thelifesquare.com/pregnant-from-precum-8575481/ . I used Apple vinegar method and pulled out a method for unprotected sex.

The chances are extremely slim, near zero but highly unlikely    Reply           Jess20   October 2, 2017 at 8:10 am     Had sex with boyfriend, using the pullout method, have never gotten pregnant(been doing it for more than a year with him), since I’m not on BC we usually do it once a day, we had a fuck it lets do it twice moment, he came, wiped it off, went to the bathroom fully once then forced it out two more times, even washed his entire dick with soap then we went at it again, we started regretting it a few hours later. I’m currently a broke college student, I don’t have health insurance, and I know I fucked up I knew the risk, I don’t need to hear the ‘oh well you should of gotten some sort of protection’. I’m just here to see if anyone has gone through the same situation. — For anyone wondering if the pullout method works. YES PULLOUT METHOD HAS WORKED FOR ME BUT ONLY ONCE A DAY. IT DOESNT WORK FOR EVERYONE OKAY? The guy has to be in complete control and know when he’s close, if you’re sexually inexperienced DO NOT try the pullout method, it might be working for me and my boyfriend also because of how fertile we are. We’ve never gone to the doctor(Which I know is really stupid and I highly recommend to go check yourself out if you’re having unprotected sex). I’m irregular and have extremely bad periods since I can remember but I’m assuming I may not be that fertile because of it. Do not be stupid and just use a condom and get on birth control.

Top 4 Questions Revealed        Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-Cum? Top 4 Questions Revealed   By  Pobby -   April 12, 2016  51       Share on Facebook  Tweet on Twitter     tweet    pre cum and pregnant       Many people take the risk of having sex without protection because they believe that as long as they don’t cum, the woman won’t get pregnant. While this makes perfect sense, it’s not the case at all. Precum can cause a woman to get pregnant although the male didn’t fully ejaculate inside of her.  Pulling out may lower the risk of getting pregnant, but there will always be a chance of pregnancy due to precum. Let’s determine what precum is first before we dig deeper into the subject.   Table of Contents What is Precum? Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum? Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum? Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy? Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  What is Precum?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum? The short answer is yes. Precum occurs when a male is aroused and before a person has an orgasm. Now, this white sticky fluid isn’t as thick as regular cum and won’t have the same potency.  In fact, precum doesn’t contain any sperm – at all. But, it can still get you pregnant. The issue is that this precum flows through the same opening that cum does. So, leftover sperm is picked up in the urethra, will travel with the pre cum and can cause pregnancy.  Scientists still don’t know the exact reason for pre-ejaculate, but they believe that it helps reduce the acidity in the vagina. Ultimately, by reducing the acidity levels, the sperm would survive longer inside of the vagina as it travels. Acid will kill the sperm, so pre cum aims to lessen this acidity to promote fertilization.  Can precum get you pregnant? Absolutely, but the chances are much lower than regular cum.   Studies found that out of a sampling of 27 men, only 41% of them had sperm in their precum. The amount of sperm present was very low, but that doesn’t indicate that pregnancy can’t occur. There is simply a lower chance for pregnancy.  If you’re practicing the pull out method, you’ll want to ensure that cum does not come in contact with the vagina at all. Many couples believe that as long as cum is on the outside of the body, the woman won’t get pregnant. However, this is only partially correct. Cum located near the vagina can travel inside of the vagina with even just a drip of cum.  So, you want to ensure that you do not ejaculate on the outside of the vagina or in the immediate vicinity. Even a minute amount of ejaculate contains enough sperm for a woman to get pregnant. Instead, you want to wear a condom or ensure that the woman is on birth control to prevent any unexpected pregnancies from occurring.   Question 1: Can I Get an STD from Precum?  Precum has been associated with a “safe way” to ensure that STDs are not transferred. This is misinformation that every couple should be aware of. Studies have demonstrated that HIV is present in the majority of precum samples.  This demonstrates that precum can carry an STD.  A major issue exists with precum because it often flows through the urethra and escapes out of the tip of the penis unnoticed. Unlike ejaculation, men are not able to feel precum and won’t know when precum is starting to come out of the body.  Question 2: What Are The Chances of Getting Pregnant from Precum?  Pre-ejaculate occurs before ejaculation. When a man reaches this point, there will be two times in which a woman can become pregnant:   High Risk: A high of pregnancy exists if a man ejaculates fully during intercourse. This would occur after precum.  Low Risk: Precum without full ejaculation presents a low risk of pregnancy.   There is a very low amount of sperm in precum fluid. This amount is much lower than what is present inside of a man’s cum, but there is still a risk of pregnancy occurring.  A good way to visualize this is to know how much sperm is found within normal cum. In normal ejaculation, there are approximately 100 million sperm in just one milliliter of fluid. This sperm then gets lessened because only 10 million sperm will get past cervical mucus in the woman’s vagina.  [Read more about Cervical Mucus]  The uterine tract will also filter an additional 10% of sperm, leaving just 1 million sperm left. Ultimately, only 100,000 sperm that will exist long enough to enter the fallopian tubes. This all occurs when there is 100 million sperm. Precum only contains 3 million sperm on average (when present).  The chances of pregnancy are extremely low, but they do exist.  Question 3: What Methods Are Effective to Avoid Pregnancy?  Avoiding pregnancy requires diligence and some other form of contraceptive aside from the famous pull out method. There are plenty of forms of contraceptives on the market, but the most common are:   Condoms: A very highly effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs. Condoms are worn over the penis and trap semen before it’s allowed to enter into the vagina. There is a 0.02 chance of becoming pregnancy when a condom is worn.  Female Condom: While not as common, the female condom can be purchased over-the-counter and has proven to be 95% effective at protecting against pregnancy. More expensive, a female condom is more durable and can be inserted into the vagina up to 8 hours before intercourse.  Birth Control : Birth control can be highly effective, but it depends on the woman. The percentage of protection that birth control provides is 91% – 99%. The 91% protection is a little low for most people and will provide a 9% chance of pregnancy. Ultimately, 1 out of 12 people on birth control can become pregnant based off of these statistics.   A mix of contraceptives is recommended to boost the risk of successful pregnancy avoidance. Typically, a condom and birth control are used in conjunction with one another to ensure the utmost in protection against getting pregnant. The pullout method can be used at this time to further reduce the risk of getting pregnant.  Contraceptive implants are becoming more popular and require surgery to be implanted in the body. These implants are very effective, yet they come with side effects that can be life threatening and will be very costly.  Male sterilization provides full protection against pregnancy. A woman can get her tubes tied , which would reduce the risk of pregnancy with a very high accuracy rate. While 99.9% effective, there have been cases wherein a woman with her tubes tied did get pregnant, but this is not the norm.  Question 4: Can Dry Humping Precum Get You Pregnant?  Can you get pregnant from pre cum when dry humping? There is always a possibility, but the chances are so small that it is very unlikely. Since precum contains such little sperm, if any, there is already a small chance of getting pregnant.  Since dry humping occurs outside of the body, it would take a drop of precum to drip into the vagina and pass through the cervical mucus all the way into the fallopian tubes for pregnancy to occur.  Can it happen? Hypothetically, it can happen, but the chances are extremely low. In fact, the chances are so low that it would be nearly impossible for pregnancy to occur with dry humping.

Condoms are worn over the penis and trap semen before it’s allowed to enter into the vagina. There is a 0.02 chance of becoming pregnancy when a condom is worn.”  Please research this properly. Condoms are great for STIs, but nowhere near that effective at preventing pregnancy.

Would the person who fully ejaculated be more likely to make a woman pregnant?    Reply         Andrea Miller   July 15, 2017 at 5:05 am     Yes, there is a chance of getting pregnant with full ejaculation. As you know cum contains sperm and if the male sperm comes in contacts with a vagina then, the chances are high to get pregnant. According to NHS http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/975.aspx you can easily get pregnant from cum/discharge and also if you don’t to want to pregnant then, make sure you follow the precaution https://thelifesquare.com/pregnant-from-precum-8575481/ .

The chances are extremely slim, near zero but highly unlikely    Reply           Jess20   October 2, 2017 at 8:10 am     Had sex with boyfriend, using the pullout method, have never gotten pregnant(been doing it for more than a year with him), since I’m not on BC we usually do it once a day, we had a fuck it lets do it twice moment, he came, wiped it off, went to the bathroom fully once then forced it out two more times, even washed his entire dick with soap then we went at it again, we started regretting it a few hours later. I’m currently a broke college student, I don’t have health insurance, and I know I fucked up I knew the risk, I don’t need to hear the ‘oh well you should of gotten some sort of protection’. I’m just here to see if anyone has gone through the same situation. — For anyone wondering if the pullout method works. YES PULLOUT METHOD HAS WORKED FOR ME BUT ONLY ONCE A DAY. IT DOESNT WORK FOR EVERYONE OKAY? The guy has to be in complete control and know when he’s close, if you’re sexually inexperienced DO NOT try the pullout method, it might be working for me and my boyfriend also because of how fertile we are. We’ve never gone to the doctor(Which I know is really stupid and I highly recommend to go check yourself out if you’re having unprotected sex). I’m irregular and have extremely bad periods since I can remember but I’m assuming I may not be that fertile because of it. Do not be stupid and just use a condom and get on birth control.

(Hint: Not Zero)     4 Comments  by Olivia Maloy — 2017-05-05  Pregnancy Medical Team                       Is the withdrawal method an effective contraceptive choice? Do you need to be freaking out about a possible pregnancy after 10-second unprotected intercourse without ejaculation? In short — can you get pregnant from precum? Let's take a look.  Is the withdrawal method an effective contraceptive choice? Do you need to be worried about an unwanted pregnancy if you and your partner had 10-second unprotected intercourse? Is it at all possible, even theoretically, for pregnancy to result from dry-humping because precum might somehow seep through your clothes and into all the wrong places?  In short, what are your chances of getting pregnant from precum, and how should the risk of getting pregnant from precum influence your sex life if you really don't want to get pregnant or get your girlfriend pregnant?  What Is 'Precum' Or Pre-Ejaculatory Fluid?  Pre-ejaculatory fluid or pre-ejaculate, colloquially referred to as "precum", is a fluid released from the penis during sexual activity. Precum is believed to come from the Cowper’s glands and the Glands of Littre, but that probably isn't interesting to you right now — what you do want to know is that precum is released spontaneously , that it helps facilitate pleasurable sexual intercourse in much the same way vaginal discharge does, and that men have zero control over its production . In fact, they don't even feel it being released. [ 1 ]        Share this image with your friends:  Email  Embed                <a href="https://www.steadyhealth.com/articles/what-are-your-chances-of-getting-pregnant-from-precum-hint-not-zero"><img src="https://userfiles.steadyhealth.com/userfiles/23630/articles/What-Are-The-Chances-Of-Getting-Pregnant-From-Precum.png" border="0"></a>              Can You Get Pregnant From 'Precum'?  It's true that it only takes one sperm and one egg to create a pregnancy, but the story is also an awful lot more complicated than that. If a man only released one sperm cell every time he ejaculated, the human race would probably be extinct by now.  Fortunately for those folks who want kids and those who simply want humans to keep being around, the average ejaculate contains millions of sperm cells. Men who have 39 million sperm cells per ejaculate are only barely considered to have viable sperm counts [ 2 ], and the average ejaculate features around 100 million sperm . Out of that 100 million, only about 10 million make it past the cervix, only about a million make it into the upper uterine tract, and a meager 100,000 get as far as the fallopian tubes. [ 3 ]  That sheds a different perspective on your "light reading" about your chances of getting pregnant from precum: when you're informed that pre-ejaculatory fluid may "contain thousands of sperm" [ 4 ], that suddenly doesn't seem like very much at all.  What's more, one study shows that precum doesn't contain any sperm most of the time, and that if it does, most of the sperm is immobile (that is, can't "swim"). [3] We'll add that that particular study happened to refer to HIV-positive men, and that another study contradicted its findings.  It's worth quoting part of that study:   Although our pre-ejaculatory samples often contained sperm with equivalent concentration and motility to what would be regarded as fertile in ejaculatory samples, the actual number of sperm in the pre-ejaculates was very low. We are unable to say how this finding might translate into the chances of pregnancy if these samples of pre-ejaculate were deposited in the vagina except that the chances would not be zero. [1]   What does that mean, in real terms, for those who don't want to get pregnant and don't want to get their partners pregnant? Let's look at that now.  Is The Withdrawal Method An Effective Contraceptive Choice?  Almost 60 percent of US women aged between 15 and 44 have ever used the withdrawal method (or pull-out method) as a form of contraception [ 5 ]. If you're wondering if you should use the withdrawal method as your chosen birth control as well, it's important to know that there's the pull-out method and the pull-out method:  You could just have sex whenever you feel like it and have the male partner pull out before ejaculation.  Some couples carefully monitor the female partner's menstrual cycle to find out when she is in her fertile window, and adjust their sex life accordingly.  The latter method is also referred to as " natural family planning ", and couples who practice it monitor ovulation by charting basal body temperature and looking at the consistency of cervical mucus. They then either avoid sex altogether during the woman's (presumed) fertile days, or they use condoms only during those days. They use the withdrawal method the rest of the month.  Couples who practice the withdrawal method in this particular manner actually have a pretty low pregnancy rate of 2.2 percent with perfect use [ 6 ].  The efficacy of every user-dependent contraceptive method depends on a user's ability to follow its instructions perfectly, of course. The combined oral contraceptive pill has a failure rate of about 0.1 percent when it's used perfectly, for instance, but because most people aren't perfect, research indicates that the actual failure rate is much closer to 8.5 percent. [ 7 ]  To get back to precum, the sperm that might be lurking in there, and the less official way of practicing withdrawal, just pulling out before the male partner reaches climax without paying any attention to the female partner's menstrual cycle, well, we can only repeat what the study above said. Your chances of getting pregnant aren't zero even when you use the really thought-out form of the pull-out method as you have already seen above, so they're definitely not going to be zero if you have no clue when you are fertile, or your girlfriend is.  The Bottom Line  Is it even theoretically possible to get pregnant from precum released during dry-humping? I'd have to go with "no" on that one. Do you have to worry about pregnancy after 10-second intercourse? Not really. (You may want to look out for sexually transmitted diseases, though.) Is the withdrawal method an effective contraceptive choice? That depends on how you practice it.  If you want to have satisfying sexual intercourse without worrying about pregnancy or monitoring your fertility, you may want to choose a more user-friendly contraceptive method, like an intrauterine device or Depo-Provera.

Info Center      General      What are the chances of getting pregnant from precum     10 Comments   over a year ago                        Unfortunately, may people seem to think that coitus interruptus, also called withdrawal or pull-out method, is an efficient method of birth control.  Not only it is not 100% efficient as a way of preventing unwanted pregnancy, but it is also unsafe in terms of sexually transmitted diseases.  The reason why this method should not be adopted by people who want to be absolutely safe from pregnancy is that even before the ejaculation the penis secretes small amounts of semen, called precum or pre-ejaculate. If the precum reaches the egg, there is a chance it will fertilize it and pregnancy will occur.  What is precum?  Precum is a colloquial term for pre-ejaculate, a fluid that the penis releases during the intercourse, before the actual ejaculation. This fluid, also called pre-seminal fluid, is secreted from bulbourethral gland and its purpose is to clear the path for the upcoming ejaculation. The secretion starts when the man is aroused and continues throughout the intercourse.  Pre-ejaculate is alkaline in its nature and as it travels through the urethra it neutralizes the remaining acidity from the urine, so that the path is safe for the sperm, which does not handle acidity well. It also smoothens the passage of sperm by lubricating the urethra. This fluid also contains some spermatozoa, although not very much.  The chances of getting pregnant by precum  Fortunately, today many people know that precum contains some amount of spermatozoa, which, if they reach the egg, may fertilize it. For this reason, the pull-out method is not considered to be a very safe one. There is a chance a woman could get pregnant with precum .  However, several studies have found that precum itself does not contain any spermatozoa and that instead it picks them up from the urethra, where they have remained after the previous ejaculation. Since the spermatozoa can survive and remain motile in the urethra and on top of the penis, when the fluid picks them up and carries them into the vagina, there is a possibility of fertilization and pregnancy.  One of the best ways to prevent this, aside from having protected sex, of course, is to have the man urinate after the orgasm and prior to the next intercourse . That way the urine will wash away the remaining spermatozoa and raise the acidity in the urethra.  To put it simple, the pull-out method does carry a certain risk of pregnancy, even though the chances seem rather slim. Because of this, the pull-out method should be combined with other methods, such as the rhythm method. Still, the best way to prevent an unwanted pregnancy is to use a condom and contraceptive pills.

What are the chances?             ladyrootbeer    Last edited 07/22/2013        Sorry if this is tmi but I'm worried. I was just wondering what the chances were for getting pregnant from precum. My last period came on June 12, and it's very regular on a 28-day cycle. I should've gotten it last Wednesday, July 10, but it never came and still hasn't. My boyfriend and I had sex June 29th & 30th. Over those 2 days we had sex 4 times, but he never ejaculated inside. Then the following week we had sex multiple times on July 3, 4, 5 & 6 but he still never came inside me. I read somewhere that there's little to no sperm in precum so we just did the pull-out method because condoms really irritate my vagina and make it swell up. I have an appointment on July 25 (the earliest they could get me in) to get on birth control but since my period is now late I'm worried I might be pregnant. I don't really have any symptoms though except occasional cramping like I'm about to start my period yet nothing is there. I haven't taken a hpt yet but I'm thinking I should pick one up today. What are the chances I could've gotten pregnant by precum?

Although not common, it is possible to get pregnant by the withdrawal method.

I'd just be a little embarrassed that we aren't married yet. He's hoping I am pregnant, which is actually sweet.  I'm kind of excited that there's a possibility, too. I've always wanted to be a Mom, and we have no financial stresses or strains. Plus I think he'd be the greatest father on Earth. I just was curious of the chances because I don't want to get my hopes way up just in case it's a fluke. Oy.

Those are the other main reasons other then being pregnant that af is "late" Also pre cum normally only has sperm in it if he had ejaculated not long before. Pre cum DOESN'T have more sperm in then full on cum. Thats ridiculous. People would be getting pregnant all the time from pull out. Like pp said its not impossible but its not likley.

Pre-ejaculation is fluid produced by a manâ€™s body during sexual intercourse. This fluid travels through the urethra and out of the manâ€™s penis. This fluid helps to clear the way for sperm, and also helps with lubrication during sex. Pre-ejaculation is known by other names as well. Some of these include precum, pre-seminal fluid, or pre-ejaculate.    There is definitely a chance of getting pregnant from pre-ejaculation. While pre-ejaculation is not produced with any sperm in it to begin with, it may pick some up along the way. What happens is that, as it travels through the urethra, the pre-ejaculation may pick up sperm from a previous ejaculation. The sperm then travels with the pre-ejaculation and can cause pregnancy. The best way to avoid having sperm in the pre-ejaculation is for a man to urinate after ejaculating the previous time, but before vaginal penetration"    --  TTC#1             Reply            Report this comment       0                     defyingodds    Posted 10/25/2012      I actually did concieve over the summer when my husband pulled out.

By Teen Health Source  So, we here at Teen Health Source get a lot of questions about precum. A LOT . We have some info about it buried on the Inside Scoop: Penis and Testicles * page, under the spot about the Cowper’s Gland, but frig load of good it does just sitting there! So we’re pulling some of that info out, and hopefully also addressing some of the stuff that comes up in our faqs about precum. Here we go!  What is precum?   Precum is the pre-ejaculate fluid that can be released from the penis during sexual stimulation.  Precum prepares/lubricates the urethra for ejaculation. The more lubricated the urethra, the easier it should be for sperm to make it out of a person’s body.  Precum also acts as additional lubricant during sex.  The amount of precum that is released varies from person-to-person. So the amount that you produce normally is whatever is normal for you and your body.   Can precum cause pregnancy?   Precum itself does not contain any sperm and can therefore not cause pregnancy on its own.  However, an earlier ejaculation (either from sex, masturbation, etc.) may leave some leftover sperm in the urethra. This sperm can get flushed out by precum (aka, the precum would then contain sperm), and together would have a chance to cause pregnancy.  Urinating can flush out any leftover sperm in the urethra. If people do this before having sex, then there should be no sperm in the urethra to be flushed out instead by the precum.   Can you contract an STI from precum?   Yes, you can contract an STI from precum.  The glands that produce precum can be subjected to bacterial and viral STIs and any precum that is produced has a risk of transmitting the STI.   If people are about to have sex and aren’t sure about each other’s STI status or testing history, or aren’t sure if someone peed since their last ejaculation and there’s a risk of someone getting pregnant, then we’d always recommend that folks consider using condoms ( external or internal ) to prevent the transmission of fluids, and lowering the risk of pregnancy or sharing STIs.  If you still have more questions about precum, then consider talking to one of our peer educators: Contact Us !  ____  *Not everyone experiences or relates to their penis and testicles in the same way or uses the words used on this page for their bodies.

Evaluate Your Chances   October 13, 2015 September 27, 2016     Maria Shevtsova    Can You Get Pregnant From Pre-cum? Evaluate Your Chances   So can you get pregnant from precum? The short answer is: Yes, you can get pregnant from precum. Though the chances are quite low. Pre-cum (Pre-ejaculate or Cowper’s fluid) is the transparent, viscous fluid, coming out of penis at the moment of erection or sexual arousal. Almost like the semen, but contains quite a few spermatozoa (sperm cells, delivering the nucleus with the genetic information of the male to the ovum of the female). The concentration of the active sperm in the pre-ejaculate is variable and individual. Presumably, the pre-cum works like a lubricant and acid neutralizer. Not only the concentration of sperm in pre-cum is individual, but also the presence of pre-cum at all. Some men don’t produce this type of liquid at all. Pregnancy is (lat. Graviditas) is a special state of the woman’s body, in which her reproductive organs are incubating and developing an embryo or fetus. Pregnancy is the result of a merger of female and male sex cells as a result of  fertilization of the ovum by the sperm, which is an active carrier of the man cells. The matter: pregnant from precum You can easily get pregnant from precum under the following conditions: You have so-called “dangerous days” – ovulation You are not using any other method of contraception, but the coitus interruptus (aka the pull out method or withdrawal) Your partner has already ejaculated previously and this is your second or more intercourse per day. In the case the above-written conditions coincide, the chances of getting a girl pregnant with pre-cum are quite high. Before having unprotected sex with a partner you are not going to have children with in the nearest future, choose the best method of contraception for you. However, if the intercourse took place and you’re not sure, if that would lead to pregnancy – there’s a low risk. I personally know only two women, who got pregnant that way. In order not to cram yourself with hormonal pills, exclude the most important risk factors. Make an ovulation test , check your period calendar, if you have one. If you don’t  – get yourself one.   Knowing the date of your ovulation may help you to predict the days of the higher risk of letting birth out of control. And only after that, if you are afraid that there was a risk of penetration of the active spermatozoids on your territory – study the emergency contraception means. Also check:  Can You Get Pregnant on Your Period? So why there’s a certain risk of pregnancy without the fact of the ejaculation? A certain quantity of capable of fertilization sperm is released during your sexual intercourse with a natural lubricant together with penis erection. That’s why getting pregnant by the male secretions is, of course, possible, but the probability is low. A certain percentage of the sperm can remain in the urethra after the previous ejaculation, and may present in secretions or on the penis. The next time you have sex, they can easily fall into the vagina if the man has not observed certain hygiene rules after the previous coitus. The possibility to conceive is higher for the second and subsequent sexual acts that are not accompanied by shower before each of them.  Coitus interruptus can be more dangerous not only because of the risk to get pregnant from precum. Each man experiences difficulty in this delicate matter: do not think that it’s so easy – to catch the right moment before the onset of ejaculation. Unfortunately, this also disturbs a man to relax completely and experience the full range of sexual pleasure. And even with an excellent ability to capture the right moment, there is a risk of pregnancy as the sperm can easily get into the vagina from the hands or even bed linen. We must not forget that sperm lives for about 3 to 7 days in a friendly environment, which is the vagina. Unfortunately, due to the absence of the possibility to obtain a certain data on the way a woman actually got pregnant, it is hard to get any true statistics of precum pregnancies. We may rely only on the mentioned above facts to state that there’s a chance of getting pregnant that particular way. Many men are not even aware that they discharge precum during intercourse, moreover, they can’t control it. Accepting the risks of pre-cum pregnancy Preventing an unwanted pregnancy is far better, than aborting it for many reasons. There’s no chance of getting pregnant from precum while taking birth control pills (if taking them right) or combining the contraception methods with one another. But in case there’s no trust between partners or pregnancy is not an option for any of the partners and you consider a probable pregnancy as a risk – this feeling will definitely affect the quality of sex itself. It is better if you choose a partner, with whom you are not afraid to get pregnant of pre-cum or secure the intercourse with the additional means. One must also remember, that precum, just like semen itself can transport many sexually transmitted infections , including HIV, that “sticks” to semen. The research cases show , that some viruses (like hepatitis) can be contained in a spermatozoon itself, thus causing vertical transmission of the disease (directly to the cells of the fetus). The easiest way to secure the contraception effect of coitus interruptus and avoid a pre-cum pregnancy, however, is to use a contraceptive gel, suppository or cream, which are plenty in the market and safe for your health.

First of all, you should try to relax. Then, I recommend you to do a pregnancy test. It is the easiest and right way to determine whether you’re pregnant or not. If the result is positive, visit a doctor. He’ll do a blood test to confirm your state. What concerns your period…You say that it is not regular and now you’re on your period. I’d rather say, that you are not pregnant (but it doesn’t mean that you don’t have to do a test). Sometimes it happens. Whether changes, stress, infection, diet, physical exercises could lead to some problems. In this case you also should consult a specialist. He may prescribe pills or drops to improve the flora of your body. And often it is enough. About your boyfriend and precum. No, you can’t get pregnant if you slowed it. But using a pull-out method can be quite risky, because some experts think that precum may contain sperm. However, large-scale studies on the subject haven’t been conducted. My advise: use condoms. He will be satisfied in any case and you protect yourself from unplanned pregnancy and infections that can lead to serious problems. If your boyfriend refuse it – he don’t deserve to be with you. Trust and be close only with a reliable (and tested) person. Take care of yourself! I hope you will be fine and healthy! You can handle with everything!  Reply  18   Danielle   Oct 13, 2016 at 6:31 pm  Thank you so Victoria I will get a test and take it and I’m scared if he has something and I can catch it from him  Reply  19   Danielle   Oct 13, 2016 at 6:33 pm  I don’t no how to tell my mom this is my first time pregnancy  Reply  20   Victoria   Oct 17, 2016 at 3:49 pm  Danielle, of course risks to get infection when you don’t use condoms always exist. That is way you better sign up for an appointment with the gynecologist. So you may learn about your health and how to cope with the problems, if there is any. I’m sure no matter  what your mother will understand and help you. Good luck!  Reply  21   Tisha   Oct 16, 2016 at 7:45 pm  I didnt had sex with my boyfriend but he ejaculated on my navel… i am pretty scared that i might get pregnant, also i had my periods n it happenned on 5th day of my periods. Also he was fingering me after touching himself ..I dont know what to do??  Reply  22   Victoria   Oct 17, 2016 at 3:39 pm  Hi, Tisha! You can’t get pregnant by ejaculation on your navel. It is impossible. He needs to be into you. What concerns fingering… There is a very-very little chance, as I know, to get pregnant. And it is only possible if sperm remained in his fingers and he put them into your vagina. But I must repeat the risk is small. If you are so afraid – do a pregnancy test. And to be more informed I suggest you to read about all possible ways to get pregnant. Good luck!  Reply  23   Brittney   Dec 31, 2016 at 8:17 am  Hi victoria! I am 25 years old, no kids. I usually have 3 to 4 day periods. For the past couple months ive been having unprotected sex with my male friend (actually on and off for 4 years lol) the last times we had sex was nov. 5th (i was fertile) the 11 and 12th ( 3 times each boths nights) and the 20th ( which was the lasy day of a 3 day period that came 3 days early) we have not seen each other since due to him getting back with his ex. I recently was 2 days late on my period, i then started on the 15th of dec. For 2 days and then barely spotted for the next 5 days after. Ive been feeling nauseas to certain smells, when i dont eat for a period of time. Im veryvtired all the time. On edge. Constantly cramping like im constipated. I dont want to accept the symptoms but i very worried. Whats your intake?! You seem very smart! I plan on taking a test soon just dont want to test too early and miss something because i do drink quite often:/  Reply  24   Sam D   Oct 24, 2016 at 11:52 am  I was messing around with a guy on 7th August we never hand sex nor did he penis go inside me but we was rubbing really close naked . And I am not sure if his Precum went up me or not on the 13th August I had full sex with a guy and he did injaculated inside me and on the 2nd September found out I was expecting my 1st child My period was from 1st August ended the 5th August . Who is the father ? Should I be worried  Reply  25   Victoria   Oct 25, 2016 at 7:42 am  Hi, Sam! Your second partner, with whom you had sex, is the father. Make an appointment with a doctor and follow his advices! Don’t worry! Take care of yourself and your baby!  Reply  26   Nalini   Oct 27, 2016 at 3:05 pm  I had sex with my partner on 25 oct. initially he didn’t use condom, but later on he put it on. I am not sure whether his precum entered into my vagina, but I feel it did. I am having some serious irregular period issues, like the last period I had was almost after a gap of 5-6 months. It was on 10 Sept. Since then, my period has already been delayed by 15 days and meanwhile I didn’t have any intercourse except on 25 Oct. So should I go for a contraceptive pill to avoid unwanted pregnancy. Out of my irregular period problem I am fearing to take a pill but definitely dont want a pregnancy now. Please reply asap, as it is more than 48 hrs since I had sex.  Reply  27   Nalini   Oct 28, 2016 at 2:17 am  Please reply, its urgent  Reply  28   Victoria   Oct 28, 2016 at 10:14 am  Nalini, unfortunately, I can’t reply to you with all confidence. I don’t think that you may be pregnant, and, yes, a pregnancy test won’t show anything on such an early stage. Probably, you can secure yourself and use a pill. But be very cautious and pick up the pills that won’t harm you or affect your reproductive capacity. Consult with a doctor or at least with a pharmacist. Also, I recommend you to visit a gynecologist. Urgently! Because such gaps between your period are not normal. Don’t postpone it and take care of yourself!

My cycle is usually a 24 days cycle although it has been a bit irregular of late (coming in quite early like 2 days early). Please which one of them could be my baby daddy?  Reply  33   Natalie   Jan 4, 2017 at 6:52 am  Hi, Leslie! I can’t be completely sure who your baby’s daddy is. To me, it’s more likely the second guy (Nov 17), but if you want to know for sure I believe you’d better wait and then ask for a DNA test. If you know exactly when your ovulation comes it can be of some help.  Reply  34   Jaime   Jan 3, 2017 at 1:35 am  Hi, my bf and I had sex on Wednesday the 28th, and when I put the condom on him I accidentally put it on backwards but I did not unroll it. I quickly realized and flipped it over and unrolled it. We then continued, and he never came in me or anything we checked the condom for holes and it was clear. I’m only scared because of the pre come that may have gotten on the condom when it was on him backwards. My period was the 20th through the 26th(this all happened the 28th) thank you.  Reply  35   Natalie   Jan 4, 2017 at 6:58 am  Hello, Jaime! I don’t think you’re pregnant. Even if some of the precum got onto the condom it’s too early in your period. But you can use a test after a couple of weeks just to be sure.

Reply  58   N/A   Jul 20, 2017 at 4:33 am  I’m worried that I’m pregnant even though I didn’t have full on sex and my boyfriend didn’t ejaculate near/in me. We both lost our virginities to each other just about 3 weeks ago. Im taking the pill but I missed one because I threw it up (food poisoning). I took the pill assigned for the next day because I threw up the pill 30 minutes after I took it. The first time we tried it was a day before my period and he had a condom on. He didn’t go inside of my fully- he could only get the head in and it really hurt me so we just stopped. The day after the first incident I got my period but it was irregular with me bleeding hard for 2 days and spotting to nothing on other days. I thought that this was normal because I started crossfit the day of my period and I did it Tuesday through Thursday. Maybe the stress from working out a lot made my period irregular? I don’t know. We tried to have sex again on Thursday because my period basically last for 3 days (that’s normal btw). We put the condom on wrong (or so we thought) and we kept flipping it back/ forward, rolling and unrolling  for just about 5 minutes. He went inside of me once with that condom on (it was the only one that we had) and we stopped after a few seconds because it hurt. Maybe precum could have gotten on the condom? He kept losing his erection in the process of flipping and stuff so he wasn’t fully aroused.  Im only worried about the second time because that could result in pregnancy even though it’s almost impossible. It’s been 3 weeks now and all of a sudden I’m peeing frequently, and I think I’m constipated. Im also a little bloated and I’m having small cramps in my lower abdomen. These are pregnancy symptoms but maybe it’s PMS? My period is coming up next week so maybe that’s it? What are my chances of being pregnant?  Reply  59   Berenice   Jul 20, 2017 at 11:20 am  Hello! It’s not likely you’re pregnant. Wait for your next period, and if it’s not on time, do a pregnancy test.  Reply  60   Tom   Sep 11, 2017 at 12:47 pm  I had sex 5 days ago he had a condom on but it ripped during sex he didn’t ejaculate or nothing. You think pre cum got me pregnant?  Reply  61   Berenice   Sep 11, 2017 at 2:49 pm  Hello! Yes, you might actually be pregnant. But the chances are really low. Wait for a missed period and do a test to find out for sure.  Reply  62   N/A   Sep 17, 2017 at 7:55 pm  So I’m on birth control but I messed up last months because of time differences when traveling. Now I’m back on track, but it’s the first seven days of my pills and I had unprotected sex until my boyfriend felt he was going to finish, then he put on the condom and finished. I’m not sure if there was pre-cum or not. Is there a chance I could get pregnant since I messed up last months birth control and was still in the first seven days of this months?  Reply  63   Berenice   Sep 18, 2017 at 9:24 am  There still is a chance, but it’s a very small one.

The chances of a pregnancy are small, but if you have a missed period, do a pregnancy test immediately.  Reply  67   Pat   Oct 19, 2017 at 9:13 pm  I’m  young and quite nervous because I have never had a boy friend before and as far as my parents are concerned they don’t think I mess with boys. But I have been having a “relationship” with this guy for the past year. And we have sex quite often we usually use protection but being the dumb kids we are we notice that without one it feels a lot better so for the past couple of months we have been doing it without the one. I know for a fact that he hasn’t came in because he pulls out extra early and I finish him off. But I read some where that if you have sex muitlpe times in a day without protection that the chances of getting pregnant from pre-cum is higher. This week I was suppose to start but I’m late four days. But my period has never been regular. I would sometimes go 3 months without a period and then only been on it for 3 days. However last 3 months I have gotten one, but each month they started later later. So is it possible I’m pregnant?  Reply  68   Berenice   Oct 20, 2017 at 12:19 pm  Hi, Pat! Yes, it’s possible you are pregnant. But you can use emergency contraception to make sure you won’t have a baby.  Reply  69   Adam cobb   Oct 24, 2017 at 12:17 am  I had sex with a girl with a condom I took the condom off and she gave me blowjob, I never had time to shower and 12 hours later we had sex with no condom is there any chance she could be pregnant as there could be sperm on my penisfrom previous sexual inter course???  Reply  70   Berenice   Oct 24, 2017 at 8:57 am  Hello! The chance of such an outcome is very small but it’s still there. If you really don’t want to have a baby and this small risk is too much for you, tell your girlfriend to use emergency contraception just in case.  Reply  71   Dhriti   Nov 9, 2017 at 5:36 am  I had protected sex on 15th of September. But after 2 or 3 strokes the condom broke at the lower part (i.e. far away from the tip) and we stopped right then. There wasn’t much precum and he didn’t ejaculate at all. I took a plan B(contraceptive) pill for safety. In August I had my period on 8th and in September I had my period on 21th. I have had a delay of 14 days earlier 2 times this year (February and September) but it is 9th of November already, 20 days. And I still didn’t get my period and no PMS either. Please Help Me I am not pregnant, right ? And this there anything wrong with my body (irregular periods) ?

I double up the pills on Monday. He didn’t cum in me, but I’m not sure about pre cum What are the chances that I’m pregnant  Reply  73   Berenice   Nov 17, 2017 at 11:33 am  Hi, Kim! The chances are very small. Watch out for your next period. If it doesn’t come in time, use a test.  Reply  74   Kayla   Dec 16, 2017 at 1:50 pm  I’ve been on birth control pills for 4 days . My doctor told me to use protection for about 2 weeks and for some reason I forgot to ask her why? My boyfriend and I needed up having unprotected sex on the 3rd day I was taking the pill . He said he didn’t ejaculate in me but I searched it up and it says it doesn’t  matter whether he ejaculated or not you are still pregnant . I searched it up on google to see if you can get pregnant by pre-cum and it says the most usual answer is no but only if sperm gets to the pre-cum that’s the only how you can get pregnant because pre-cum is only dead sperm cells . Idk what it could be .  Reply  75   Kayla   Dec 16, 2017 at 1:51 pm  Ended up *  Reply  76   Berenice   Dec 18, 2017 at 11:06 am  Hi, Kayla! Your chances to get pregnant from precum are very small, so you don’t have to worry until you have a missed period.  Reply  77   unknown   Jan 5, 2018 at 2:18 pm  sorry for this long story. Last November 10th friday me and my girlfriend messed around or the thing you called dry humping but no underwears we just did that for a minute or minute i guess and we stopped. the i fingered her after few moments and oh i accidentally touched the tip of my penis but i didn’t felt any pre cum im not sure and my fingers are dry. and after 2 days she’s having cramps and later that day she feel nauseous only 2 days after our dry humping. On november 14th tuesday She had her period lasted for 4 days and on sunday She said that there’s still a drops of blood from her period and we think that’s totally normal after having period and on monday after that day she saw brown discharges that made us worried then searched it in the internet that brown discharges after a period is typically normal. and the next month 1 week and a half she experienced soreness of breats and sometimes she feels nauseous but we didn’t think she’s pregnant because she’s not eating properly that’s why she experiencing nauseous and a little bit stomach ache, we did a home pregnancy test jusr to make sure and came out negative. And on December 12 she had her period that lasted for 5 days like a normal period. We had another dry humping on December 26 and this time i used condoms cause we’re so sick of being worried all the time. but we quickly alarmed on december 31 because she’s peeing more often than she usually does and having stomach pain and feel nauseous sometimes. And now january 5 she’s experiencing a slightly fever for a few days and she already felt soreness on her breast but she’s not peeing more often anymore. but when she’s pushing down the area on the lower abdomen she feel slightly pain. We’re so worried again and her period is expected next week!! Is there any chance of getting pregnant in this situation? please Reply ASAP!!!

Well, the following must be present:    Healthy egg from a woman  Quality sperm from the man  A warm and a healthy environment- to support the egg for fertilization and implantation  Most people have the basic knowledge of how the reproductive works; however many misconceptions go around reproductive health, for example, you can’t get pregnant from precum. What is Precum?   Precum is the bodily fluid that usually seeps from the penis during intercourse  Cowper’s glands produce the fluid  It travels from the urethra then to the penis  It is also known as pre-ejaculate, pre-ejaculatory fluid, pre-seminal fluid or Cowper’s fluid  You now understand what pre-ejaculate is; let’s move to the misconception that you can’t get pregnant from precum. Truth be told, there are chances of getting pregnant from precum. What are the chances of getting pregnant from precum? You may be asking yourself “what are my chances of getting pregnant from precum” since you are sexually active. Chances of getting pregnant from precum are high. To begin with, during the production of pre-seminal fluid no sperm is present. As earlier mentioned, Cowper’s glands produce the precum and testicles produce sperm. However, the fluid picks sperm along the way. What exactly happens? As the fluid travel via the urethra, the pre-ejaculate can take sperms that are from a previous ejaculation. You have to know that many men don’t notice when the precum comes out. Additionally, they have no control over it. The purpose of the precum is to neutralize the environment of the urethra which is acidic. Precum is alkaline; therefore, making the environment conducive for the sperm to survive. The fluid makes the way clear for the sperm and acts as a lubricant during sex.   For pregnancy to occur, a healthy egg from a woman must be available. Sperm can survive in the body of a woman for seven days. So, if the opening of your vagina comes into contact with pre-seminal fluid from your partner, the precum, containing the sperm will have ample time to travel to the fallopian tubes and wait for ovulation to occur. Although the pre-ejaculate contains a few sperm when compared to the ejaculate itself, studies have proven that the sperm count is evidently high in the precum. Bear in mind that a man starts creating pre-seminal fluid once he becomes erect. Most likely, the fluid was present from the beginning of sexual intercourse. Thus, there are chances of getting pregnant from precum during ovulation. An egg lives between 12 to 24 hours after ovulation; the duration is adequate to increase the chances of getting pregnant from precum while ovulating. Only one sperm is needed to cause a pregnancy. Is it possible to know when you are ovulating? It is possible. The following signs can enable you to predict when ovulating :  Changes in cervical mucus. As you get close to ovulation, the body produces estrogen resulting to cervical mucus which is stretchy and clear. The egg like whites enables the sperm to reach to the egg released during ovulation.  The heightened sense of smell. If you are sensitive to smells in your monthly cycle; chances are that you are ovulating.  Breast tenderness or soreness. If you note your nipples and the breast are sensitive, you are at the peak of ovulation.  Mild pelvic or lower abdominal pain. You may experience a slight ache or pain in the lower abdomen.  Light spotting or discharge. Spotting a brown discharge is a typical sign of ovulation.  During sex, both partners use fingers for sexual arousal or foreplay. Take note that precum is produced when the man is aroused. At this point, if the man touches his penis and gets precum on his fingers and caress your vagina with precum on his fingers, the vagina gets into contact with the fluid, chances of getting pregnant from precum on fingers can’t be ruled out. Remember, the precum contains sperms. The sperm will travel and wait to fertilize an egg released during ovulation hence a pregnancy will occur. Getting pregnant while on birth control Birth control methods are used to prevent pregnancy and plan when to become pregnant. Numerous birth control methods are available for example;  Abstinence  Implants  Exclusive breastfeeding  Diaphragm  Condoms  Pills  Withdrawal (pull out method)  Spermicide  The above methods are not 100% successful. Relying on the pull out of method as a way of birth control is very controversial. The success rate ranges between 73 t0 96 %. On the other hand, the pill is 99%. As for the condom, its success rate is 100% if used well. The man is responsible for the pullout method; he pulls out his penis from the vagina canal just before ejaculation. It is a hard method to use as the success rate depends on the ability of the man to pull out after every sexual experience. When compared to other birth control methods, it is the least efficient. Therefore, chances of getting pregnant from precum while on birth control are possible, withdrawal method being on the lead. Why is it so?   Withdrawal method lies entirely with the male. The woman has no control over it. He has to be in a position to determine when he is ready to ejaculate and practice self-control at the point of passion and ensures he doesn’t ejaculate. If the precum contains sperm, you are likely to become pregnant; this is because the man may not notice the pre-ejaculate and have no control over it. Pregnancy may end taking place. The reliable way to avoid the presence of sperm in the precum is for the man to urinate after the previous ejaculation. In Conclusion Chances of becoming pregnant are high under the following conditions:  If you are ovulating  If you are using withdrawal method as a way birth control  If your partner had previously ejaculated, and you are having intercourse the second time but he didn't urinate.  If the above conditions are present, chances of getting pregnant with precum are high. Wish you well as you take the necessary precautions to avoid getting pregnant from precum. Be in control of your sex life.        Share:   Tweet this   Share on Facebook  Share on Google+         RECENTLY ADDED     What Is Letrozole Used For In Men ?  Health & Wellness > General Health  November 23rd 2016  Hormonal balance is very important; when the hormones are properly balanced, the body works as expected. But when they are out of balance, the body begins experiencing problems. Estrogen, commonly termed as the female hormone and testosterone considered as the male hormone are crucial in the reproductive system. Men can experience elevated levels of estrogen. But does a man produce estrogen? Yes, a man’s body produces estrogen but in low levels. It’s produced mainly by adrenal glands as well as the testicles. Estrogen hormone is important in a man; it plays a critical role in bone density, lipid metabolism, sexual maturation, and growth. However, it becomes a problem when the levels rise causing a number of problems in a male like:

Weird, but not fun. That’s one way of describing migraine headaches. But the term, migraine headache, itself, is very broad. What we’re talking about here is something that messes with the brain, and since the brain is the way everyone deciphers the electromagnetic wavelengths and atoms of the universe to construct a worldview through which to navigate in life, alterations there can be debilitating to that navigation.
