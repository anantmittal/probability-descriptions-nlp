The problem is that in the Gregorian calendar, the pattern of days of the week repeats according to a 400-year cycle, which includes 303 non-leap years and 97 leap years. Neither 303 nor 97 is exactly divisible by 7, so the probability of a particular kind of year cannot be exactly 1/7 or 3/28 when taken over that 400-year cycle. (However, the 400 years contain 146,097 days, which is exactly divisible by 7.) In particular, over the 400 years, there are 43 years with 53 Fridays, so the probability of a non-leap year having 53 Fridays is 43/303, which is slightly less than 1/7. 204 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Springboard Learn data science in Python with a mentor.

Answered Jan 25, 2018 · Author has 155 answers and 284.8k answer views The intuitive answer is 1/7 because each common year is 52 weeks and 1 day long, so that an arbitrary year has 53 occurrences of one day only, so the answer should be 1/7. This is not correct. As Jim said, our calendar recurs every 400 years because of the non-trivial leap year rules. This means that in each cycle of 400 years, there are 303 common years. Of these, 43 start on a Wednesday, so the actual probability is 43/303 or 14.1914%. By the way, 43 common years in each cycle start on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, while 44 start on Tuesday and Thursday. Another fun fact is that with our current calendar rules, the thirteenth day of a month is most likely to be on a Friday. 637 Views · Answer requested by  Adam Strayer Quora User Answered Dec 10, 2017 · Author has 66 answers and 30k answer views Originally Answered: What is the chance that a non-leap year should have 53 Sundays?

Every 400 years repeats itself and since you are only interested in common years (non-leap) and there are 303 of them in the 400 year block, one only need to determine how may years in those 303 years start on a Sunday. 43 or those years start on a Sunday Percentage (43/303) = 14.1914% If you assume that all days have an equal probability of starting a common year, it would be (1/7) = 14.2857% .

In an non-leap year, there are 365 days. Since 364 is a multiple of 7, there will be 52 Sundays, 52 Mondays,…………….53 Saturdays. We have one extra day which could be any one of Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. This is called the sample space denoted by S. Hence all the possible days are 7 in number and therefore n(S) = 7. We want the desired event E that the extra day to be Sunday so that we can have 53 Sundays. So n(E) =1. Therefore the probability of a year having 53 Sundays = n(E)/n(S) = 1/7. 5 Views   Rohit Katiyar , studied at National Institute of Technology, Patna Answered Sep 24, 2017 A Non Leap year has 365 days i.e. 52 complete weeks+1 day , i.e each day(mon,Tues,……) will be 52 times.

Most years have 365 days, and thus have 52 7 day periods and one leftover day. Therefore any given day of the week that January 1 falls on will happen 53 times, while the remaining days of the week will each have only 52 appearances that year. Thus, 1/7. BUT some years are leap years, and have 366 days. In those years, the days of the week that fall on both January 1 and 2 each happen 53 times, so there are 2/7 chances that Sunday is such a day. Thus 2/7 Since the usual scheme is one leap year every 4th year, this would then be (3*1/7+2/7)/4=5/28 But there are years when the leap year is skipped, and since we don’t know what time period we’re talking about, it’s really impossible to pin things down to a nice neat percentage at all.

Updated Nov 20, 2017 · Author has 677 answers and 113.1k answer views Originally Answered: What is the probability that an ordinary year has 53 Sundays? In an ‘ordinary’ year , (not a leap year), the day on which the year starts is the same as that in which it ends, so you will only get a year with 53 Sundays, when the year itself starts on a Sunday, 2017 for example. In the case of a leap year, then the year can start on a Saturday or a Sunday, and it will still have 53 Sundays in it. These patterns repeat every 4 * 7 = 28 years, so let’s make the PC do some hard work with a short C# program to find the years starting with a Sunday or Saturday if a leap year from 1901 to 1928. Note: We can’t start from 1900 as that was not a leap year, and will skew the result. using System;
namespace CSCON
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            DateTime dt;
            for (int i = 1901; i <= 1929; i++)
            {
                dt = new DateTime(i, 1, 1);
                if(dt.DayOfWeek==DayOfWeek.Sunday ||
                  (dt.DayOfWeek==DayOfWeek.Saturday &&
                   dt.Year%4==0))
                   Console.WriteLine(i + "  " + dt.DayOfWeek);
            }

        }
    }
} Output: 1905  Sunday
1911  Sunday
1916  Saturday
1922  Sunday
1928  Sunday So, over any consecutive period of 28 years, 5 will have 53 Sundays. So the probability of a year having 53 Sundays is 5/28 This applies to any day of the week, in a twenty eight year cycle four of the years will start with that day and one leap year will start on the day before. 617 Views · View Upvoters   Tanmay S.

A leap year has 366 days or 52 weeks and 2 odd days. The two odd days can be {Sunday,Monday},{Monday,Tuesday},{Tuesday,Wednesday}, Wednesday,Thursday},{Thursday,Friday},{Friday,Saturday},{Saturday,Sunday}.So there are 7 possibiliyies out of which 2 have a Sunday. So the probability of 53 Sundays in a leap year is 2/7. A non-leap year has 365 days or 52 weeks and 1 odd day. The odd day can be Sunday,Monday, Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday or Saturday. So there are 7 possibilities out of which 1 is favorable. So the probability  of  53 Sundays in non-leap year is 1/7.

In addition to this, a leap year has an extra day which might be a Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday...or Sunday. We've now reduced the question to : what is the probability that in a given pair of consecutive days of the year one of them is a Sunday? Our sample space is S : {Monday-Tuesday, Tuesday-Wednesday, Wednesday-Thursday,..., Sunday-Monday} Number of elements in S = n(S) = 7 What we want is a set A (say) that comprises of the elements Saturday-Sunday and Sunday-Monday i.e. A : {Saturday-Sunday, Sunday-Monday} Number of elements in set A = n(A) = 2 By definition, probability of occurrence of A = n(A)/n(S) = 2/7 Therefore, probability that a leap year has 53 Sundays is 2/7.

The problem is not well posed as it doesn't say how the year was chosen. Assume a randomly chosen year in the 400 year cycle of leap years, and assume the same number of years start with each day of the week. Then the answer is obvious. The latter assumption is probably not quite true, but I haven't checked. Edit: In fact over the 97 leap years in the 400 year cycle, 15 begin on a Sunday and 13 begin on a Saturday.

We have to examine the entire 400 year cycle of the Gregorian calendar system. Let’s start with January 1, 1901, which was a Tuesday. Since non-leap-years are 365 days long, 1 more than a multiple of 7, a non-leap-year shifts the calendar ahead by 1 day of the week. It follows that a leap year shifts the calendar ahead by 2 days of the week. So we have the following pattern of January 1sts starting January 1, 1901: Tue Wed Thu Fri(L) Sun Mon Tue Wed(L) Fri Sat Sun Mon(L) Wed Thu Fri Sat(L) Mon Tue Wed Thu(L) Sat Sun Mon Tue(L) Thu Fri Sat Sun(L) Tue … The leap years are marked with (L). The table says January 1, 1901 is Tue, Jan 1 1902 is Wed, Jan 1 1903 is Thu, Jan 1, 1904 is Fri (a leap year), so Jan 1, 1905 is Sun (day of week moved two days ahead because of the leap year), and so on. Notice that the pattern cycles every 28 years. So Jan 1, 1929 is a Tue at the start of the cycle; Jan 1, 1957 is the same; Jan 1, 1985 is the same; Jan 1, 2013 is the same; Jan 1, 2041 is the same; Jan 1, 2069 is the same; Jan 1, 2097 is the same. If this pattern persisted forever, then your question would be easy to answer. We look for leap years beginning on Sun, or Sat, which contain 52 whole weeks ending on a Sat, Fri, respectively, plus two more days which include Sun Mon or Sat Sun, for a total of 53 Sundays. So 2 out of 28 years have the pattern you require (leap year with 53 Sundays). Unfortunately, the pattern is broken for years like 2100, 2200, 2300, which are divisible by 100 but not by 400, and so are not leap years in the Gregorian calendar. We’ll have to restart the pattern in 2101 and 2201. (By 2300 we will have completed a 400 year cycle, which is a complete cycle for the Gregorian calendar; the pattern of leap years repeats after 400 years, and 400 years contains a number of days which is a multiple of 7 so the week days cycle too.) So, here we go: 1901 through 2096: 7 cycles of 28 years = 196 years, with 2x7=14 years with the pattern you want 2097, 2098, 2099, 2100: Jan 1 is Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, and none of them are leap years anyway; so this is 4 years, with 0 years with your pattern 2101 through 2184: like the previous 28 year pattern, except it starts with Sat Sun Mon Tue(L). That’s 3x28 = 84 years with 3x2 = 6 leap years with 53 Sundays. 2185 through 2200: 16 years with only 1 with the pattern you require (see below) Sat Sun Mon Tue(L) Thu Fri Sat Sun(L) Tue Wed Thu Fri(L) Sun Mon Tue Wed(non-L) 2201 through 2284: 84 years with 6 leap years with 53 Sundays. 2284 through 2300: 16 years with only 1 with the pattern you require (see 4 lines below) Thu Fri Sat Sun(L) Tue Wed Thu Fri(L) Sun Mon Tue Wed(L) Fri Sat Sun Mon(non-L) Altogether we have 196 + 4 + 84 + 16 + 84 + 16 = 400 years, with 97 leap years, with 14 + 0 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 = 28 leap years with 53 Sundays. So altogether for the Gregorian calendar system, the probability of any given year being a leap year with 53 Sundays is 28/400 = 7/100, or exactly 7 percent, which is a little different from our earlier estimate of 2/28 = 7.14… percent. I’m not entirely clear about your question, but if you are asking if a year is a leap year, then what is the probability of having 53 Sundays (i.e., the conditional probability), that would be 28/97 = 28.87…%. 1.7k Views · View Upvoters   Lance Berg , I know some math, minored in math at FSU Answered Mar 31, 2018 · Author has 5.3k answers and 2.3m answer views Originally Answered: What is the probability of getting 52 Sundays in a leap year? 100%. However, the chances of getting MORE THAN 52 Sundays in a leap year are 2/7. If Sunday falls on January 1 or 2, then there will be a Sunday on the 30th or 31st, respectively, of December. In non-leap years, this only happens to the day of the week that falls on January 1, and thus repeating a 53rd time on December 31st. But leap years have an extra day, meaning that the last day of the 52nd week falls on December 29th instead of December 30th, thus leaving room for two 53rd weekdays instead of the more usual one. 30 Views   Tripti Singh , studied at Modern Indian School, Kathmandu Answered Mar 24, 2018 a leap year has 52 weeks and 2 days so the last 2 days can be (sunday,monday) or (monday,tuesday) or (tuesday,wednesday) or (wednesday,thursday) or (thursday,friday) or (friday,saturday) or (saturday,sunday) sunday can come 2 times so total favourable conditions/total conditions=probability=2/7 11 Views   Manjunath Subramanya Iyer , I am a retired bank officer teaching maths Answered Feb 6, 2018 · Author has 1.5k answers and 75.4k answer views Originally Answered: What is the probability of selecting a leap year with 53 Sundays? A leap year has 366 days. Now 364 is divisible by 7 and therefore there will be two excess week days in a leap year. The two excess week days can be (Sunday, Monday), (Monday, Tuesday), (Tuesday, Wednesday), (Wednesday, Thursday), (Thursday, Friday), (Friday, Saturday), (Saturday, Sunday). So, the sample space S has 7 pairs of excess week days. i.e. n(S) = 7. Now we want the desired event E to be 53 Sundays. E consists of the pairs (Saturday, Sunday), (Sunday, Monday). So n(E) = 2 Hence, the probability that a leap year selected at random will contain 53 Sundays = n(E)/n(S) = 2/7 33 Views Quora User , Feel the wrath of the math Answered Aug 27, 2017 Originally Answered: What is the probability that a leap year selected at random will contain 53 Sundays?

Leap years in the popularly used Gregorian calendar add one day to the end of February. The probability that a leap year will have 53 Sundays is one out of seven. There’s one more day-of-the-week than side-of-the-die, but this is still a good illustration. 76 Views   Gowtham Sarvanan , Mathematics student Answered Nov 27, 2015 Even though everyone's answer i.e 2/7 is correct but the arguments given is not enough. We are making an assumption that our sample space, S ={Mon-Tue, Tue-wed, .......} consist of all 7 possibilities. Problems: 1. S need not contains all 7 possible occurrences 2. Each occurrences need not have equal probability for occurring.

Hence there will be 52 Tuesdays for sure. 52 weeks = 52 x 7 = 364 days 366 – 364 =2 days In a leap year there will be 52 Tuesdays and 2 days will be left. These 2 days can be: Sunday, Monday  Monday, Tuesday  Tuesday, Wednesday Wednesday, Thursday Thursday, Friday Friday, Saturday Saturday, Sunday Of these total 7 outcomes, the favourable outcomes are 2. Hence the probability of getting 53 Tuesdays in a leap year = 2/7.          SME Approved      Recommend(0)      Comment (0)                 Add Comment   Done       Please enter the comment.

For solving this question we should know a basic fact about a year i.e. it has 52 weeks. 52 weeks means 52×7 = 364 days. If the year in an ordinary year, the one odd day could be Monday,Tuesday, Wednesday…… Sunday. Thus the probability of getting a sunday is 1/7. If the year is a leap year, the two odd days could be Mon Tue, Tue Wed, Wed Thu , Thu Fri , Fri Sat , Sat Sun , Sun Mon.

A year is leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not 100 (except if it is divisible by 400). Probability that year is leap year is 97/400. Probability that leap year will have 53 Sundays is 2/7 i.e. probability that year will start with Saturday or Sunday. Probability that year is not a leap year is 303/400. Probability that non leap year will have 53 Sundays is 1/7 i.e. probability that year will start with Sunday. Therefore probability that any randomly picked year has 53 Sundays is = ((97/400)*(2/7)) + ((303/400)*(1/7)) =497/2800 1.5k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Udacity.com Develop new tech skills.

Leap Years have an extra day = 366 days Non Leap Years have 365 days If the extra day on a normal year falls on a sunday there will be 53 Sundays. Otherwise there will be 52. If (on leapyear) the extra 2 days fall on either Sat+Sun or on Sun+Mon then there will be 53 Sundays that year… So the answer is (1/7)*P(normal year)+(2/7)*P(leap year) If P(leap year) = Q Then P(53 Sundays) = [math]\frac{2Q}{7}+\frac{1-Q}{7}[/math] [math]= \frac{1+Q}{7}[/math] Leap years happen every 4th year, but not on the years divisible by 20, but yes for years divisible by 100, but not if divisible by 1000… and these crazy ass rules have to do with the actual number of days in one full solar earth orbit being a non integer in need of periodic correction.

[note - this is also the answer for having 53 mondays or 53 tuesdays or 53 wednesdays or 53 thursdays or 53 fridays or 53 saturdays.] considering a leap year leap year contains 366 days 52 weeks plus two two extra days 52 weeks means definitely there are 52 sundays (this is true for all other days also). if either of these two is sunday then we will have 53 sundays these two days can be {mon, tue} or { tue , wed} or { wed , thurs} or {thurs , fri} or      { fri, sat} or { sat , sun} or {sun , mon} i.e total =7 out of these only two outcomes i.e { sat , sun} and {sun , mon} is having sunday with them . so our desired prob is 2/7. 10.6k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Aryan Ambastha   Lance Berg , I know some math, minored in math at FSU Answered Mar 27, 2018 · Author has 5.3k answers and 2.3m answer views Originally Answered: What is the probability of getting 53 Sundays in one year? Most years have 365 days, and thus have 52 7 day periods and one leftover day. Therefore any given day of the week that January 1 falls on will happen 53 times, while the remaining days of the week will each have only 52 appearances that year. Thus, 1/7. BUT some years are leap years, and have 366 days. In those years, the days of the week that fall on both January 1 and 2 each happen 53 times, so there are 2/7 chances that Sunday is such a day. Thus 2/7 Since the usual scheme is one leap year every 4th year, this would then be (3*1/7+2/7)/4=5/28 But there are years when the leap year is skipped, and since we don’t know what time period we’re talking about, it’s really impossible to pin things down to a nice neat percentage at all. I’d go with “a little less than 5/28.” 474 Views · View Upvoters   Shaswat Bisi , Business Associate at Tech Mahindra (2017-present) Answered Sep 7, 2017 There are 2 cases, Case 1: Leap year Case 2: Non leap year Case 1: A year of 366 days has 52 weeks.

Updated Nov 20, 2017 · Author has 677 answers and 113.1k answer views Originally Answered: What is the probability that an ordinary year has 53 Sundays? In an ‘ordinary’ year , (not a leap year), the day on which the year starts is the same as that in which it ends, so you will only get a year with 53 Sundays, when the year itself starts on a Sunday, 2017 for example. In the case of a leap year, then the year can start on a Saturday or a Sunday, and it will still have 53 Sundays in it. These patterns repeat every 4 * 7 = 28 years, so let’s make the PC do some hard work with a short C# program to find the years starting with a Sunday or Saturday if a leap year from 1901 to 1928. Note: We can’t start from 1900 as that was not a leap year, and will skew the result. using System;
namespace CSCON
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            DateTime dt;
            for (int i = 1901; i <= 1929; i++)
            {
                dt = new DateTime(i, 1, 1);
                if(dt.DayOfWeek==DayOfWeek.Sunday ||
                  (dt.DayOfWeek==DayOfWeek.Saturday &&
                   dt.Year%4==0))
                   Console.WriteLine(i + "  " + dt.DayOfWeek);
            }

        }
    }
} Output: 1905  Sunday
1911  Sunday
1916  Saturday
1922  Sunday
1928  Sunday So, over any consecutive period of 28 years, 5 will have 53 Sundays. So the probability of a year having 53 Sundays is 5/28 This applies to any day of the week, in a twenty eight year cycle four of the years will start with that day and one leap year will start on the day before. 617 Views · View Upvoters   Tanmay S.

In an ordinary year , there are 365 days. Since 364 is a multiple of 7, there will be 52 Sundays, 52 Mondays,…………….53 Saturdays. We have one extra day which could be any one of Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. This is called the sample space denoted by S. Hence all the possible days are 7 in number and therefore n(S) = 7. We want the desired event E that the extra day to be Sunday so that we can have 53 Sundays. So n(E) =1. Therefore the probability of a year having 53 Sundays = n(E)/n(S) = 1/7. If the year in question is a leap year, there are 366 days. Since 364 is a multiple of 7, there will be 52 Sundays, 52 Mondays,…………….53 Saturdays. We have two extra days which could be any one of the pairs (Sunday, Monday),(Monday,Tuesday), (Tuesday,Wednesday), (Wednesday, Thursday), (Thursday, Friday), (Friday, Saturday) and (Saturday, Sunday). This is called the sample space denoted by S. Hence all the possible pairs of week days are 7 in number and therefore n(S) = 7. We want the desired event E that the extra day to be Sunday so that we can have 53 Sundays. The possible pairs are ( Saturday, Sunday) and (Sunday, Monday), So n(E) =2. Therefore the probability of a leap year having 53 Sundays = n(E)/n(S) = 2/7. 39 Views Anonymous Answered Feb 24, 2018 Originally Answered: What is the probability of getting 53 Sundays in a year?

There will be 52 fridays, one for each week except when the first day of the year is a Friday. That probability is 1/7. Also, the probability of non-leap year is 3/4 so overall probability is 1/7*3/4=3/28 4.1k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

Ask New Question   Krishna Singh , Bachelor of science Statistics & Mathematician And Theoretical Physicist, Patna Science College, Patna (2020) Answered Apr 5, 2018 In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, For number of weeks = [math]\frac{365}{7} = 52 weeks (i.e. 52Friday) + 1 day.[/math] and that one day can be any day of 7 days of week i.e. {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday & Sunday} Therefore [math],[/math] probability of getting 1 more Friday = [math]\frac{1}{7}[/math] 51 Views   Giles Martin Answered Mar 16, 2018 · Author has 518 answers and 308.4k answer views The three answers previously given by Arpit Shukla, Jeet Kapadia and Prem Rathaur are all slightly wrong. The problem is that in the Gregorian calendar, the pattern of days of the week repeats according to a 400-year cycle, which includes 303 non-leap years and 97 leap years. Neither 303 nor 97 is exactly divisible by 7, so the probability of a particular kind of year cannot be exactly 1/7 or 3/28 when taken over that 400-year cycle. (However, the 400 years contain 146,097 days, which is exactly divisible by 7.) In particular, over the 400 years, there are 43 years with 53 Fridays, so the probability of a non-leap year having 53 Fridays is 43/303, which is slightly less than 1/7. 204 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by DigitalOcean Deploy your Python project - free $100/60-day credit.

The extra day is equally likely to be monday , tuesday, wednesday or any other day. Therefore the required probability that it is friday is 1/7 402 Views · View Upvoters Quora User , studied at Dhirubhai Ambani International School Answered Aug 25, 2015 Any non-leap year has 52 weeks and 1 day. 52*7=364 so 1 extra day to make it 365. Also, the probability of any day being one of the 7 is 1/7, given that no other information is given. So the probability of the 1 extra day being a Friday is 1/7. 4k Views · View Upvoters   Prem Rathaur , Geologist || ONGCian || DGHian Answered Aug 25, 2015 · Author has 101 answers and 386.9k answer views A normal Julian year has 365 days = 52*7 + 1 days that means there are atleast 52 Fridays in a year. To be 53 Fridays in a Non-Leap year that extra 1 day must be Friday. The probability to that extra day is Friday is 1/7 and the probability that a year is a non-leap year is 3/4 So the Probability that a non leap year has 53 fridays will be 1/7 * 3/4 = 3/28. 1.4k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions What is the probability of getting 53 Sundays in a year?

What is the probability of getting 53 thursdays in a leap year?           edit Answer    Like    Follow  Following       Asked by Manish  Nov 24     person          1 Answers     Top Recommend   |   Recent         person     Manish  Member since Sep 20 2014                      person     Ramesh , SubjectMatterExpert  Member since Apr 01 2014       Solution: 1 year = 365 days A leap year has 366 days A year has 52 weeks. Hence there will be 52 Thursdays for sure. 52 weeks = 52 x 7 = 364 days 366 – 364 =2 days In a leap year there will be 52 Thursdays and 2 days will be left. These 2 days can be: Sunday, Monday Monday, Tuesday Tuesday, Wednesday  Wednesday, Thursday  Thursday, Friday Friday, Saturday Saturday, Sunday Of these total 7 outcomes, the favourable outcomes are 2. Hence the probability of getting 53 Thursdays in a leap year = 2/7.          SME Approved      Recommend(1)      Comment (0)                 Add Comment   Done       Please enter the comment.

The calendar is completely deterministic and is known in advance for as far in the future as you wish to calculate it.  It's not like you roll the dice to see what happens each year.  So it would be pretty easy to just run the next 1000 years (or 10,000 or whatever) and see how many have 53 Sundays or whatever you want to know.  It's not clear to me that the probabilistic arguments hold (such as saying 1/7 of the time the first day is a Sunday), since there are deterministic patterns. For example, if you look at the next 200 years and ask how many of the January 1 dates are Sundays, there are 30 Sundays in the next 200 years.  This is significantly more than 1/7 of the time.  Also, if you look at the number of years between successive Sundays on January 1, you get the following pattern: 6,11,6,5,6,11,6,5,6,11...           phyzguy ,  Mar 2, 2014            Mar 3, 2014    #8       FactChecker      Science Advisor   Gold Member   2017 Award                  phyzguy said: ↑   I'm not sure what probability means in this context.  The calendar is completely deterministic and is known in advance for as far in the future as you wish to calculate it.   You are right that the OP should define the problem better, but many probability problems have deterministic components.  If the calendar is determined, but the selection of a year is random, then it is a probability problem.  Just like a coin has determined sides, heads and tails, but the result of a coin toss is a probability problem.

The problem is that in the Gregorian calendar, the pattern of days of the week repeats according to a 400-year cycle, which includes 303 non-leap years and 97 leap years. Neither 303 nor 97 is exactly divisible by 7, so the probability of a particular kind of year cannot be exactly 1/7 or 3/28 when taken over that 400-year cycle. (However, the 400 years contain 146,097 days, which is exactly divisible by 7.) In particular, over the 400 years, there are 43 years with 53 Fridays, so the probability of a non-leap year having 53 Fridays is 43/303, which is slightly less than 1/7. 204 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Springboard Learn data science in Python with a mentor.

To be 53 Fridays in a Non-Leap year that extra 1 day must be Friday.

Bcoz there are in a non- leap year there are 365 days (52 weeks + 1day) In 52 weeks we will have 52 sundays and the one remaining day can be any from the following Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday So, the probability of getting 53 sundays in a non- leap year is 1/7. The probability of getting 53 sundays in a leap year is 2/7. How? In a leap year we have 366 days(52 weeks + 2 days) The remaining 2 days may be of order Sunday & Monday Monday & Tuesday Tuesday & Wednesday Wednesday & Thursday Thursday & Friday Friday & Saturday Saturday & Sunday Only the above order will be followed for the remaining 2 days (366–364) of leap year.

This is not correct. As Jim said, our calendar recurs every 400 years because of the non-trivial leap year rules. This means that in each cycle of 400 years, there are 303 common years. Of these, 43 start on a Wednesday, so the actual probability is 43/303 or 14.1914%. By the way, 43 common years in each cycle start on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, while 44 start on Tuesday and Thursday. Another fun fact is that with our current calendar rules, the thirteenth day of a month is most likely to be on a Friday. 637 Views · Answer requested by  Adam Strayer Quora User Answered Dec 10, 2017 · Author has 66 answers and 30k answer views Originally Answered: What is the chance that a non-leap year should have 53 Sundays?

Every 400 years repeats itself and since you are only interested in common years (non-leap) and there are 303 of them in the 400 year block, one only need to determine how may years in those 303 years start on a Sunday. 43 or those years start on a Sunday Percentage (43/303) = 14.1914% If you assume that all days have an equal probability of starting a common year, it would be (1/7) = 14.2857% .

In an non-leap year, there are 365 days. Since 364 is a multiple of 7, there will be 52 Sundays, 52 Mondays,…………….53 Saturdays. We have one extra day which could be any one of Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. This is called the sample space denoted by S. Hence all the possible days are 7 in number and therefore n(S) = 7. We want the desired event E that the extra day to be Sunday so that we can have 53 Sundays. So n(E) =1.

The Gregorian calendar has a cycle that repeats itself after 400 years, so we just need to look at the occurrence of 53-Sunday non-leap years during a 400-year period, such as 1600–2000 or 2000–2400.

Most years have 365 days, and thus have 52 7 day periods and one leftover day.

In an ‘ordinary’ year , (not a leap year), the day on which the year starts is the same as that in which it ends, so you will only get a year with 53 Sundays, when the year itself starts on a Sunday, 2017 for example. In the case of a leap year, then the year can start on a Saturday or a Sunday, and it will still have 53 Sundays in it. These patterns repeat every 4 * 7 = 28 years, so let’s make the PC do some hard work with a short C# program to find the years starting with a Sunday or Saturday if a leap year from 1901 to 1928. Note: We can’t start from 1900 as that was not a leap year, and will skew the result. using System;
namespace CSCON

            }

        }
    }
} Output: 1905  Sunday
1911  Sunday
1916  Saturday
1922  Sunday
1928  Sunday So, over any consecutive period of 28 years, 5 will have 53 Sundays.

Since 364 is a multiple of 7, there will be 52 Sundays, 52 Mondays,…………….53 Saturdays. We have two extra days which could be any one of the pairs (Sunday, Monday),(Monday,Tuesday), (Tuesday,Wednesday), (Wednesday, Thursday), (Thursday, Friday), (Friday, Saturday) and (Saturday, Sunday). This is called the sample space denoted by S. Hence all the possible pairs of week days are 7 in number and therefore n(S) = 7. We want the desired event E that the extra day to be Sunday so that we can have 53 Sundays. The possible pairs are ( Saturday, Sunday) and (Sunday, Monday), So n(E) =2. Therefore the probability of a leap year having 53 Sundays = n(E)/n(S) = 2/7. 39 Views Anonymous Answered Feb 24, 2018 Originally Answered: What is the probability of getting 53 Sundays in a year?

Undo Answer Wiki 30 Answers   Jessica Willson , works at The United Kingdom Answered May 5, 2017 · Author has 103 answers and 80.2k answer views The probability of a year being a leap year is 1/4 and being non-leap is 3/4. A leap year has 366 days or 52 weeks and 2 odd days. The two odd days can be {Sunday,Monday},{Monday,Tuesday},{Tuesday,Wednesday}, Wednesday,Thursday},{Thursday,Friday},{Friday,Saturday},{Saturday,Sunday}.So there are 7 possibiliyies out of which 2 have a Sunday. So the probability of 53 Sundays in a leap year is 2/7. A non-leap year has 365 days or 52 weeks and 1 odd day. The odd day can be Sunday,Monday, Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday or Saturday. So there are 7 possibilities out of which 1 is favorable. So the probability  of  53 Sundays in non-leap year is 1/7. So the probability of 53 Sundays in a year is 1/4×2/7+3/4×1/7=2/28+3/28=5/28 Note:The probability of a year being leap is normally taken to be 1/4 but more exactly it is 97/400 as out of century years only those divisible by 400 are leap.

Ask New Question   Ashreya Jayaram Answered Apr 4, 2014 A normal year has 52 Mondays, 52 Tuesdays, 52 Wednesdays, 52 Thursdays, 52 Fridays, 52 Saturdays and 52 Sundays + 1 day that could be anything depending upon the year under consideration. In addition to this, a leap year has an extra day which might be a Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday...or Sunday. We've now reduced the question to : what is the probability that in a given pair of consecutive days of the year one of them is a Sunday? Our sample space is S : {Monday-Tuesday, Tuesday-Wednesday, Wednesday-Thursday,..., Sunday-Monday} Number of elements in S = n(S) = 7 What we want is a set A (say) that comprises of the elements Saturday-Sunday and Sunday-Monday i.e. A : {Saturday-Sunday, Sunday-Monday} Number of elements in set A = n(A) = 2 By definition, probability of occurrence of A = n(A)/n(S) = 2/7 Therefore, probability that a leap year has 53 Sundays is 2/7.

The problem is not well posed as it doesn't say how the year was chosen. Assume a randomly chosen year in the 400 year cycle of leap years, and assume the same number of years start with each day of the week. Then the answer is obvious. The latter assumption is probably not quite true, but I haven't checked. Edit: In fact over the 97 leap years in the 400 year cycle, 15 begin on a Sunday and 13 begin on a Saturday. So the probability is 28/97. I used the calendar in Open Office.

However, if you want to be really precise, remember that the Gregorian calendar's distribution of days repeats every 400 years. Every 400 years, there are: - 146097 days - 20871 complete weeks (146097 is divisible by 7) - 97 leap years We can therefore calculate the probability exactly by considering any 400-year-long set of dates (that occur since the Gregorian calendar was adopted in your region). Here are my results: Probability that a leap year has 53 ... - Sundays: 28/97 = 0.28866 - Mondays: 28/97 = 0.28866 - Tuesdays: 27/97 = 0.278351 - Wednesdays: 28/97 = 0.28866 - Thursdays: 27/97 = 0.278351 - Fridays: 28/97 = 0.28866 - Saturdays: 28/97 = 0.28866 Trivia: I initially tried to calculate these figures using Excel, working with the range 1900-01-01 -> 2299-12-31. However, Excel incorrectly represented that range as comprising 146098 (one too many) days... It turns out there's a bug in Excel; it incorrectly represents 1900-02-29 as a valid date, and returns incorrect weekdays for days in January and February 1900. I therefore used a later range.

Very slightly higher than 2/7, owing to the 400-year cycle of leap years (years which are divisible by 100, but not by 400, are not leap years — so 2100 will not be one.) Probability that a leap year has 52 Sundays 13.3k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Bibi Amna   Edward Doolittle , Call me weird but I really like thinking about timekeeping standards Answered Mar 19, 2017 · Author has 100 answers and 156.7k answer views Originally Answered: What is the probability of having 53 Sundays in a leap year? We have to examine the entire 400 year cycle of the Gregorian calendar system. Let’s start with January 1, 1901, which was a Tuesday. Since non-leap-years are 365 days long, 1 more than a multiple of 7, a non-leap-year shifts the calendar ahead by 1 day of the week. It follows that a leap year shifts the calendar ahead by 2 days of the week. So we have the following pattern of January 1sts starting January 1, 1901: Tue Wed Thu Fri(L) Sun Mon Tue Wed(L) Fri Sat Sun Mon(L) Wed Thu Fri Sat(L) Mon Tue Wed Thu(L) Sat Sun Mon Tue(L) Thu Fri Sat Sun(L) Tue … The leap years are marked with (L). The table says January 1, 1901 is Tue, Jan 1 1902 is Wed, Jan 1 1903 is Thu, Jan 1, 1904 is Fri (a leap year), so Jan 1, 1905 is Sun (day of week moved two days ahead because of the leap year), and so on. Notice that the pattern cycles every 28 years. So Jan 1, 1929 is a Tue at the start of the cycle; Jan 1, 1957 is the same; Jan 1, 1985 is the same; Jan 1, 2013 is the same; Jan 1, 2041 is the same; Jan 1, 2069 is the same; Jan 1, 2097 is the same. If this pattern persisted forever, then your question would be easy to answer. We look for leap years beginning on Sun, or Sat, which contain 52 whole weeks ending on a Sat, Fri, respectively, plus two more days which include Sun Mon or Sat Sun, for a total of 53 Sundays. So 2 out of 28 years have the pattern you require (leap year with 53 Sundays). Unfortunately, the pattern is broken for years like 2100, 2200, 2300, which are divisible by 100 but not by 400, and so are not leap years in the Gregorian calendar. We’ll have to restart the pattern in 2101 and 2201. (By 2300 we will have completed a 400 year cycle, which is a complete cycle for the Gregorian calendar; the pattern of leap years repeats after 400 years, and 400 years contains a number of days which is a multiple of 7 so the week days cycle too.) So, here we go: 1901 through 2096: 7 cycles of 28 years = 196 years, with 2x7=14 years with the pattern you want 2097, 2098, 2099, 2100: Jan 1 is Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, and none of them are leap years anyway; so this is 4 years, with 0 years with your pattern 2101 through 2184: like the previous 28 year pattern, except it starts with Sat Sun Mon Tue(L). That’s 3x28 = 84 years with 3x2 = 6 leap years with 53 Sundays. 2185 through 2200: 16 years with only 1 with the pattern you require (see below) Sat Sun Mon Tue(L) Thu Fri Sat Sun(L) Tue Wed Thu Fri(L) Sun Mon Tue Wed(non-L) 2201 through 2284: 84 years with 6 leap years with 53 Sundays. 2284 through 2300: 16 years with only 1 with the pattern you require (see 4 lines below) Thu Fri Sat Sun(L) Tue Wed Thu Fri(L) Sun Mon Tue Wed(L) Fri Sat Sun Mon(non-L) Altogether we have 196 + 4 + 84 + 16 + 84 + 16 = 400 years, with 97 leap years, with 14 + 0 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 1 = 28 leap years with 53 Sundays. So altogether for the Gregorian calendar system, the probability of any given year being a leap year with 53 Sundays is 28/400 = 7/100, or exactly 7 percent, which is a little different from our earlier estimate of 2/28 = 7.14… percent. I’m not entirely clear about your question, but if you are asking if a year is a leap year, then what is the probability of having 53 Sundays (i.e., the conditional probability), that would be 28/97 = 28.87…%. 1.7k Views · View Upvoters   Lance Berg , I know some math, minored in math at FSU Answered Mar 31, 2018 · Author has 5.3k answers and 2.3m answer views Originally Answered: What is the probability of getting 52 Sundays in a leap year? 100%. However, the chances of getting MORE THAN 52 Sundays in a leap year are 2/7. If Sunday falls on January 1 or 2, then there will be a Sunday on the 30th or 31st, respectively, of December. In non-leap years, this only happens to the day of the week that falls on January 1, and thus repeating a 53rd time on December 31st. But leap years have an extra day, meaning that the last day of the 52nd week falls on December 29th instead of December 30th, thus leaving room for two 53rd weekdays instead of the more usual one. 30 Views   Tripti Singh , studied at Modern Indian School, Kathmandu Answered Mar 24, 2018 a leap year has 52 weeks and 2 days so the last 2 days can be (sunday,monday) or (monday,tuesday) or (tuesday,wednesday) or (wednesday,thursday) or (thursday,friday) or (friday,saturday) or (saturday,sunday) sunday can come 2 times so total favourable conditions/total conditions=probability=2/7 11 Views   Manjunath Subramanya Iyer , I am a retired bank officer teaching maths Answered Feb 6, 2018 · Author has 1.5k answers and 75.4k answer views Originally Answered: What is the probability of selecting a leap year with 53 Sundays?

The two excess week days can be (Sunday, Monday), (Monday, Tuesday), (Tuesday, Wednesday), (Wednesday, Thursday), (Thursday, Friday), (Friday, Saturday), (Saturday, Sunday). So, the sample space S has 7 pairs of excess week days. i.e. n(S) = 7. Now we want the desired event E to be 53 Sundays. E consists of the pairs (Saturday, Sunday), (Sunday, Monday).

Hence the probability of getting 53 Tuesdays in a leap year = 2/7.          SME Approved      Recommend(0)      Comment (0)                 Add Comment   Done       Please enter the comment.

Undo Answer Wiki 19 Answers   Hemant Kr Malani , Passed CT1,CT3 & CT7 from IAI Updated Mar 2, 2018 · Author has 213 answers and 172.4k answer views The probability of a year being a leap year is [math]\frac{1}{4}[/math] [math] [/math] and being non-leap is [math] \frac{3}{4}[/math] A leap year has 366 days or 52 weeks and 2 odd days. The two odd days can be {Sunday,Monday},{Monday,Tuesday},{Tuesday,Wednesday},{Wednesday,Thursday},{Thursday,Friday},{Friday,Saturday},{Saturday,Sunday}.

The odd day can be Sunday,Monday, Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday or Saturday. So there are 7 possibilities out of which 1 is favorable. So the probability  of  53 Sundays in non-leap year is [math]\frac{1}{7}.[/math] So the probability of 53 Sundays in a year is [math]\frac{1}{4}×\frac{2}{7}+\frac{3}{4}×\frac{1}{7}[/math] = [math]\frac{2}{28}+\frac{3}{28}[/math] = [math]\frac{5}{28}[/math] Note:The probability of a year being leap is normally taken to be [math]\frac{1}{4}[/math] but more exactly it is [math]\frac{97}{400} [/math] as out of century years only those divisible by 400 are leap.

How can I find the probability that there are five Sundays in the month of February in a leap year? What is the probability that a leap year will have 53 Sundays and 53 Mondays? What's the probability that a leap year has 53 fridays or 53 saturdays? Find the probability of getting exactly 52 Sundays in a leap year? Ask New Question   Ritvik Gupta Answered Mar 5, 2017 Hello!! For solving this question we should know a basic fact about a year i.e. it has 52 weeks. 52 weeks means 52×7 = 364 days. If the year in an ordinary year, the one odd day could be Monday,Tuesday, Wednesday…… Sunday. Thus the probability of getting a sunday is 1/7. If the year is a leap year, the two odd days could be Mon Tue, Tue Wed, Wed Thu , Thu Fri , Fri Sat , Sat Sun , Sun Mon. Thus the probability of getting a sunday is 2/7 Hope this Helps !! 13k Views · View Upvoters   Ojasvi Rajput , shuffling deck of cards Answered Dec 19, 2016 · Author has 138 answers and 61.2k answer views If we consider a non leap year. It has 365 days . Which is equivalent to 52 weeks and one day. This day can be either sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or saturday. So,probability of getting a 53rd sunday=1/7 Now,consider case of a leap year. A leap year has 366 days. Ths is equivalent to 52 weeks and 2 extra days. These 2 days can be combination of (sunday, Monday),(Monday, Tuesday),(Tuesday, Wednesday),(Wednesday, Thursday),(Thursday, Friday),(Friday, Saturday) or (saturday, sunday) So,probability of getting a 53rd sunday=2/7 5.1k Views · View Upvoters   Ganesh Divekar Answered Nov 16, 2017 Originally Answered: What is the probability that an ordinary year has 53 Sundays? A year is leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not 100 (except if it is divisible by 400). Probability that year is leap year is 97/400. Probability that leap year will have 53 Sundays is 2/7 i.e. probability that year will start with Saturday or Sunday. Probability that year is not a leap year is 303/400. Probability that non leap year will have 53 Sundays is 1/7 i.e. probability that year will start with Sunday. Therefore probability that any randomly picked year has 53 Sundays is = ((97/400)*(2/7)) + ((303/400)*(1/7)) =497/2800 1.5k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Udacity.com Develop new tech skills.

Undo   Rajdeep Dutta , studied at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Answered Aug 1, 2017 Originally Answered: What is the probability of 53 Sunday in a year? There are 365 days in a year. No of weeks in 365 days= 52 weeks +1 day remaining. Thus for 52 weeks, there are 52 Sundays. Now the remaining 1 day can be any of the 7 days from a week. now Probability that this day is Sunday= 1/[No of days in a week]= 1/7 and as 52 Sundays are guaranteed in a year, so 53 Sundays will occur only if the remaining 1 day is a Sunday Thus, Probability that there are 53 Sundays=Probability that remaining day is Sunday= 1/7 4k Views · View Upvoters   Gopal Menon , B Sc (Hons) Mathematics, Indira Gandhi National Open University (2010) Answered Feb 4, 2018 · Author has 1.5k answers and 186.8k answer views Originally Answered: What is the probability of getting 53 Sundays in a normal year?

Leap Years have an extra day = 366 days Non Leap Years have 365 days If the extra day on a normal year falls on a sunday there will be 53 Sundays. Otherwise there will be 52. If (on leapyear) the extra 2 days fall on either Sat+Sun or on Sun+Mon then there will be 53 Sundays that year… So the answer is (1/7)*P(normal year)+(2/7)*P(leap year) If P(leap year) = Q Then P(53 Sundays) = [math]\frac{2Q}{7}+\frac{1-Q}{7}[/math] [math]= \frac{1+Q}{7}[/math] Leap years happen every 4th year, but not on the years divisible by 20, but yes for years divisible by 100, but not if divisible by 1000… and these crazy ass rules have to do with the actual number of days in one full solar earth orbit being a non integer in need of periodic correction.

[note - this is also the answer for having 53 mondays or 53 tuesdays or 53 wednesdays or 53 thursdays or 53 fridays or 53 saturdays.] considering a leap year leap year contains 366 days 52 weeks plus two two extra days 52 weeks means definitely there are 52 sundays (this is true for all other days also). if either of these two is sunday then we will have 53 sundays these two days can be {mon, tue} or { tue , wed} or { wed , thurs} or {thurs , fri} or      { fri, sat} or { sat , sun} or {sun , mon} i.e total =7 out of these only two outcomes i.e { sat , sun} and {sun , mon} is having sunday with them . so our desired prob is 2/7. 10.6k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Aryan Ambastha   Lance Berg , I know some math, minored in math at FSU Answered Mar 27, 2018 · Author has 5.3k answers and 2.3m answer views Originally Answered: What is the probability of getting 53 Sundays in one year? Most years have 365 days, and thus have 52 7 day periods and one leftover day. Therefore any given day of the week that January 1 falls on will happen 53 times, while the remaining days of the week will each have only 52 appearances that year. Thus, 1/7. BUT some years are leap years, and have 366 days. In those years, the days of the week that fall on both January 1 and 2 each happen 53 times, so there are 2/7 chances that Sunday is such a day. Thus 2/7 Since the usual scheme is one leap year every 4th year, this would then be (3*1/7+2/7)/4=5/28 But there are years when the leap year is skipped, and since we don’t know what time period we’re talking about, it’s really impossible to pin things down to a nice neat percentage at all. I’d go with “a little less than 5/28.” 474 Views · View Upvoters   Shaswat Bisi , Business Associate at Tech Mahindra (2017-present) Answered Sep 7, 2017 There are 2 cases, Case 1: Leap year Case 2: Non leap year Case 1: A year of 366 days has 52 weeks.

Updated Nov 20, 2017 · Author has 677 answers and 113.1k answer views Originally Answered: What is the probability that an ordinary year has 53 Sundays? In an ‘ordinary’ year , (not a leap year), the day on which the year starts is the same as that in which it ends, so you will only get a year with 53 Sundays, when the year itself starts on a Sunday, 2017 for example. In the case of a leap year, then the year can start on a Saturday or a Sunday, and it will still have 53 Sundays in it. These patterns repeat every 4 * 7 = 28 years, so let’s make the PC do some hard work with a short C# program to find the years starting with a Sunday or Saturday if a leap year from 1901 to 1928. Note: We can’t start from 1900 as that was not a leap year, and will skew the result. using System;
namespace CSCON
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            DateTime dt;
            for (int i = 1901; i <= 1929; i++)
            {
                dt = new DateTime(i, 1, 1);
                if(dt.DayOfWeek==DayOfWeek.Sunday ||
                  (dt.DayOfWeek==DayOfWeek.Saturday &&
                   dt.Year%4==0))
                   Console.WriteLine(i + "  " + dt.DayOfWeek);
            }

        }
    }
} Output: 1905  Sunday
1911  Sunday
1916  Saturday
1922  Sunday
1928  Sunday So, over any consecutive period of 28 years, 5 will have 53 Sundays. So the probability of a year having 53 Sundays is 5/28 This applies to any day of the week, in a twenty eight year cycle four of the years will start with that day and one leap year will start on the day before. 617 Views · View Upvoters   Tanmay S.

In an ordinary year , there are 365 days. Since 364 is a multiple of 7, there will be 52 Sundays, 52 Mondays,…………….53 Saturdays. We have one extra day which could be any one of Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. This is called the sample space denoted by S. Hence all the possible days are 7 in number and therefore n(S) = 7. We want the desired event E that the extra day to be Sunday so that we can have 53 Sundays. So n(E) =1. Therefore the probability of a year having 53 Sundays = n(E)/n(S) = 1/7. If the year in question is a leap year, there are 366 days. Since 364 is a multiple of 7, there will be 52 Sundays, 52 Mondays,…………….53 Saturdays. We have two extra days which could be any one of the pairs (Sunday, Monday),(Monday,Tuesday), (Tuesday,Wednesday), (Wednesday, Thursday), (Thursday, Friday), (Friday, Saturday) and (Saturday, Sunday). This is called the sample space denoted by S. Hence all the possible pairs of week days are 7 in number and therefore n(S) = 7. We want the desired event E that the extra day to be Sunday so that we can have 53 Sundays. The possible pairs are ( Saturday, Sunday) and (Sunday, Monday), So n(E) =2.

The problem is that in the Gregorian calendar, the pattern of days of the week repeats according to a 400-year cycle, which includes 303 non-leap years and 97 leap years. Neither 303 nor 97 is exactly divisible by 7, so the probability of a particular kind of year cannot be exactly 1/7 or 3/28 when taken over that 400-year cycle. (However, the 400 years contain 146,097 days, which is exactly divisible by 7.) In particular, over the 400 years, there are 43 years with 53 Fridays, so the probability of a non-leap year having 53 Fridays is 43/303, which is slightly less than 1/7. 204 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Springboard Learn data science in Python with a mentor.

What is the probability of getting 53 thursdays in a leap year?           edit Answer    Like    Follow  Following       Asked by Manish  Nov 24     person          1 Answers     Top Recommend   |   Recent         person     Manish  Member since Sep 20 2014                      person     Ramesh , SubjectMatterExpert  Member since Apr 01 2014       Solution: 1 year = 365 days A leap year has 366 days A year has 52 weeks. Hence there will be 52 Thursdays for sure. 52 weeks = 52 x 7 = 364 days 366 – 364 =2 days In a leap year there will be 52 Thursdays and 2 days will be left. These 2 days can be: Sunday, Monday Monday, Tuesday Tuesday, Wednesday  Wednesday, Thursday  Thursday, Friday Friday, Saturday Saturday, Sunday Of these total 7 outcomes, the favourable outcomes are 2. Hence the probability of getting 53 Thursdays in a leap year = 2/7.          SME Approved      Recommend(1)      Comment (0)                 Add Comment   Done       Please enter the comment.

The ratio of expected event to all the possible events of a sample space for 1 odd day to be Thursday is the probability of getting 53 Thursdays for a non-leap year.  P(A) = 1/7 = 0.14   How to find probability of 53 Thursdays in a non-leap year?  Users may refer the below detailed information to learn how to find the probability of 53 Thursdays in an ordinary year. The total number of weeks in a non-leap year {365 days = 52 (1/7)} is 52 weeks and one odd day. Since, finding the probability for an odd day to be Thursday is enough to find the probability of getting 53 Thursdays in an ordinary year of a Gregorian calendar.  Workout  step 1 Possible events for 1 odd day The odd day may be either Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or Saturday. Therefore, the total number of possible outcome or elements of sample space is 7.  step 2 Probability of 1 Odd day to be Thursday : The sample space S = {Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday} Expected event of A = {Thursday} P(A) = {Thursday}/{Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday} P(A) = 1/7 P(A) = 0.14  0.14 or 1/7 is probability for 53 Thursdays in a non-leap year.

Probability of getting 53 sundays                      May 11, 2013    #1       mia5                        In a leap year the probability of getting 53 sundays or 53 tuesdays or 53 thursdays is           mia5 ,  May 11, 2013                Phys.org - latest science and technology news stories on Phys.org  • Survival strategy: How one enzyme helps bacteria recover from exposure to antibiotics  • Food packaging could be negatively affecting nutrient absorption in your body  • First dynamic spine brace—robotic spine exoskeleton—characterizes spine deformities          May 11, 2013    #2       HallsofIvy      Science Advisor               There are 366 days in a leap year so 366/7= 52 complete weeks with two additional days.  There will be 53 sundays if and only if sunday is the first or second day of the year- that is if the year starts on a saturday or a sunday.  What is the probability of that?

This makes the odds different for some days of the week.           haruspex ,  May 11, 2013            May 12, 2013    #4       mia5                   correction in the question  The actual question says what is the probability of 53 Sundays or 53 Tuesdays or 53 Thursdays in a non leap year            mia5 ,  May 12, 2013            May 13, 2013    #5       willem2                           mia5 said: ↑   The actual question says what is the probability of 53 Sundays or 53 Tuesdays or 53 Thursdays in a non leap year   If you know one, it should be easy to compute the other since the probability of any day of the week in all years is 1 in 7, and that 97 out of 400 years are leap years.           willem2 ,  May 13, 2013            May 17, 2013    #6       HallsofIvy      Science Advisor                  mia5 said: ↑   The actual question says what is the probability of 53 Sundays or 53 Tuesdays or 53 Thursdays in a non leap year   Your original post said "in a leap year".           HallsofIvy ,  May 17, 2013            Mar 2, 2014    #7       phyzguy      Science Advisor               I'm not sure what probability means in this context.  The calendar is completely deterministic and is known in advance for as far in the future as you wish to calculate it.  It's not like you roll the dice to see what happens each year.  So it would be pretty easy to just run the next 1000 years (or 10,000 or whatever) and see how many have 53 Sundays or whatever you want to know.  It's not clear to me that the probabilistic arguments hold (such as saying 1/7 of the time the first day is a Sunday), since there are deterministic patterns. For example, if you look at the next 200 years and ask how many of the January 1 dates are Sundays, there are 30 Sundays in the next 200 years.  This is significantly more than 1/7 of the time.  Also, if you look at the number of years between successive Sundays on January 1, you get the following pattern: 6,11,6,5,6,11,6,5,6,11...           phyzguy ,  Mar 2, 2014            Mar 3, 2014    #8       FactChecker      Science Advisor   Gold Member   2017 Award                  phyzguy said: ↑   I'm not sure what probability means in this context.  The calendar is completely deterministic and is known in advance for as far in the future as you wish to calculate it.   You are right that the OP should define the problem better, but many probability problems have deterministic components.  If the calendar is determined, but the selection of a year is random, then it is a probability problem.  Just like a coin has determined sides, heads and tails, but the result of a coin toss is a probability problem.
