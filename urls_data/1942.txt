Find the probability of matching exactly 4 of the 6 winning numbers if the winning numbers are all randomly chosen.  The answer is $\frac{\binom{6}{4}\cdot\binom{43}{2}}{\binom{49}{6}}$, but I don't understand why that is the answer and not $\frac{\binom{6}{4}\cdot\binom{45}{2}}{\binom{49}{6}}$, since if you match 4 numbers than there are $\binom{49-4}{2}=\binom{45}{2}$ ways to choose the last 2 numbers.    probability  combinatorics     share | cite | improve this question     asked Dec 22 '15 at 2:22       Matt G   809 6 16              add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  5  down vote  accepted      If there are 6 winning numbers, then you want to take away the possibility of choosing any of them when you choose the last 2 numbers.

The North American lottery record was set in January 2016 when a Munford, TN couple split the $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot with two other winners. The previous record belonged to Mega Millions when its March 2012 jackpot reached $656 million. Right now, the next drawing is at an estimated $700 million--and that number could continue to rise. Which lottery numbers turn up the most?

In 2008 an analyst poured through the statistics. His research is below. ------- BATON ROUGE, LA (WAFB) - Millions of people try their luck on big lottery games like Powerball every week. Often, we wonder what the odds actually are that you'll choose the winning combinations. Now, experts can analyze past numbers to see which ones are most likely to help you strike it rich. "It's a form of entertainment, an escape, a way to dream," says Kimberly Chopin with Louisiana Lottery. For some, the games are much more. Everyone seems to have their own set system, a way to win. "I think if you play the same numbers, it increases the odds," says Steve Johnson. He is someone retailers would call a "regular." Whether pumping gas, picking up a snack or some smokes, Johnson is guaranteed to take a chance. As freely as these numbers roll, so do the odds that someone's lucky numerals will pop up. "The odd ratio is pretty small - 1 out of 146 million. It's almost impossible to win," says Dr. Min Su Kim. Dr. Kim teaches statistics at Southern University. This self-proclaimed realist says with the chances of a win so slim, Powerball is not the way to go for him. "I learned statistics and probability, so I'm a rational person (laughter)." Johnson says he's laughing all the way to the bank. He recently won $500 back-to-back, one week after the other. The Powerball drawing consists of five white balls and one red Powerball. Dr. Kim went back 10 years and found the top 5 numbers that have won millions of dollars for thousands of people. Dr. Kim says the most frequently drawn Powerball number for the past 10 years is number 20. It is followed by 37, 2, 31, and 35. As for those white balls, the most popular is number 42. It is closely followed by 16, 35, 26, and 19. "If you pick these numbers, there's probably more probability to win the grand prize," Dr. Kim says. Kimberly Chopin of the Louisiana Lottery warns that just because some numbers have won big bucks in the past for others, that does not mean they're going to do the same for you. "Every number has a equal chance of being drawn. No number more likely to come up," she says. There are still those who believe otherwise. "It works. It worked for me. I'm playing on Lotto money now," Johnson says. As for Dr. Kim who is deeply rooted in his Asian traditions, shelling out some cash for tickets would have to follow a dream about pigs. "A pig represents good fortune," he says. Copyright 2008 WAFB. All rights reserved.

(April 2011)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Lottery mathematics is used to calculate probabilities in a lottery game.     Contents    1  Choosing 6 from 49  2  Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49  3  Pick8-32 odds and calculations  4  Powerballs And Bonus Balls  5  Minimum number of tickets for a match  6  References  7  External links     Choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  In a typical 6/49 game, each player chooses six non-duplicate numbers from a range of 1-49. If the six numbers on a ticket match the numbers drawn by the lottery, the ticket holder is a jackpot winner—regardless of the order of the numbers. The probability of this happening is 1 in 13,983,816.  The chance of winning can be demonstrated as follows : The first number drawn has a 1 in 49 chance of matching . When the draw comes to the second number, there are now only 48 balls left in the bag (because the balls already drawn are not returned to the bag) so there is now a 1 in 48 chance of predicting this number.  Thus for each of the 49 ways of choosing the first number there are 48 different ways of choosing the second. This means that the probability of correctly predicting 2 numbers drawn from 49 in the correct order is calculated as 1 in 49 × 48. On drawing the third number there are only 47 ways of choosing the number; but of course we could have arrived at this point in any of 49 × 48 ways, so the chances of correctly predicting 3 numbers drawn from 49, again in the correct order, is 1 in 49 × 48 × 47. This continues until the sixth number has been drawn, giving the final calculation, 49 × 48 × 47 × 46 × 45 × 44, which can also be written as        49  !    (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over (49-6)!}}   or 49 factorial divided by 43 factorial. This works out to 10,068,347,520, which is much bigger than the ~14 million stated above.  However; the order of the 6 numbers is not significant. That is, if a ticket has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, it wins as long as all the numbers 1 through 6 are drawn, no matter what order they come out in. Accordingly, given any set of 6 numbers, there are 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ! or 720 orders in which they could be drawn. Dividing 10,068,347,520 by 720 gives 13,983,816, also written as        49  !    6  !  ∗  (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over 6!*(49-6)!}}   , or more generally as          (    n  k    )     =     n  !    k  !  (  n  −  k  )  !       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={n! \over k!(n-k)!}}   , where n is the number of alternatives and k is the number of choices.   This function is called the combination function; in Microsoft Excel , this function is implemented as COMBIN( n , k ). For example, COMBIN(49, 6) (the calculation shown above), would return 13,983,816. For the rest of this article, we will use the notation        (    n  k    )       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}}   . "Combination" means the group of numbers selected, irrespective of the order in which they are drawn.  An alternative method of calculating the odds is to note that the probability of the first ball corresponding to one of the six chosen is 6/49; the probability of the second ball corresponding to one of the remaining five chosen is 5/48; and so on. This yields a final formula of          (    n  k    )     =     (    49  6    )     =    49  6    ∗    48  5    ∗    47  4    ∗    46  3    ∗    45  2    ∗    44  1      {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={49 \choose 6}={49 \over 6}*{48 \over 5}*{47 \over 4}*{46 \over 3}*{45 \over 2}*{44 \over 1}}     The range of possible combinations for a given lottery can be referred to as the "number space". "Coverage" is the percentage of a lottery's number space that is in play for a given drawing.  Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  One must divide the number of combinations producing the given result by the total number of possible combinations (for example,        (    49  6    )     =  13  ,  983  ,  816    {\displaystyle {49 \choose 6}=13,983,816}   ). The numerator equates to the number of ways to select the winning numbers multiplied by the number of ways to select the losing numbers.  For a score of n (for example, if 3 choices match three of the 6 balls drawn, then n = 3),        (    6  n    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}}   describes the odds of selecting n winning numbers from the 6 winning numbers. This means that there are 6 - n losing numbers, which are chosen from the 43 losing numbers in        (    43   6  −  n     )       {\displaystyle {43 \choose 6-n}}   ways. The total number of combinations giving that result is, as stated above, the first number multiplied by the second. The expression is therefore         (    6  n    )        (    43   6  −  n     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}{43 \choose 6-n} \over {49 \choose 6}}   .  This can be written in a general form for all lotteries as:         (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}   , where     N    {\displaystyle N}   is the number of balls in lottery,     K    {\displaystyle K}   is the number of balls in a single ticket, and     B    {\displaystyle B}   is the number of matching balls for a winning ticket.  The generalisation of this formula is called the hypergeometric distribution .

The odds of a play ticket matching all 8 numbers is simple to calculate and is illustrated by the following math.         8  32    ∗    7  32    ∗    6  32    ∗    5  32    ∗    4  32    ∗    3  32    ∗    2  32    ∗    1  32    =    40320  1099511627776      {\displaystyle {8 \over 32}*{7 \over 32}*{6 \over 32}*{5 \over 32}*{4 \over 32}*{3 \over 32}*{2 \over 32}*{1 \over 32}={40320 \over 1099511627776}}     Which means there is a 1 in 27,269,633 chance of matching all 8 numbers. The Trillion Coins lottery is a pay-out-on-every-drawing lotto game. The odds are dependent on the total number of tickets that are played. The player who matches the most of the picked numbers wins.  Powerballs And Bonus Balls [ edit ]  Many lotteries have a powerball (or "bonus ball"). If the powerball is drawn from a pool of numbers different from the main lottery, the odds are multiplied by the number of powerballs. For example, in the 6 from 49 lottery, given 10 powerball numbers, then the odds of getting a score of 3 and the powerball would be 1 in 56.66 × 10, or 566.6 (the probability would be divided by 10, to give an exact value of 8815/4994220). Another example of such a game is Mega Millions , albeit with different jackpot odds.  Where more than 1 powerball is drawn from a separate pool of balls to the main lottery (for example, in the EuroMillions game), the odds of the different possible powerball matching scores are calculated using the method shown in the " other scores " section above (in other words, the powerballs are like a mini-lottery in their own right), and then multiplied by the odds of achieving the required main-lottery score.  If the powerball is drawn from the same pool of numbers as the main lottery, then, for a given target score, the number of winning combinations includes the powerball. For games based on the Canadian lottery (such as the lottery of the United Kingdom ), after the 6 main balls are drawn, an extra ball is drawn from the same pool of balls, and this becomes the powerball (or "bonus ball"). An extra prize is given for matching 5 balls and the bonus ball. As described in the " other scores " section above, the number of ways one can obtain a score of 5 from a single ticket is        (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1}}   or 258. Since the number of remaining balls is 43, and the ticket has 1 unmatched number remaining, 1/43 of these 258 combinations will match the next ball drawn (the powerball), leaving 258/43 = 6 ways of achieving it. Therefore, the odds of getting a score of 5 and the powerball are       6       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1 in 2,330,636.  Of the 258 combinations that match 5 of the main 6 balls, in 42/43 of them the remaining number will not match the powerball, giving odds of       258  ⋅     42    43          (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {258\cdot {{42} \over {43}}} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 3/166,474 (approximately 55,491.33) for obtaining a score of 5 without matching the powerball.  Using the same principle, the odds of getting a score of 2 and the powerball are        (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4}}   = 1,851,150 for the score of 2 multiplied by the probability of one of the remaining four numbers matching the bonus ball, which is 4/43. Since 1,851,150 × (4/43) = 172,200, the probability of obtaining the score of 2 and the bonus ball is       172  ,  200       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {172,200} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1025/83237. This gives approximate decimal odds of 1 in 81.2.

In the 5-from-90 lotto, the minimum number of tickets that can guarantee a ticket with at least 2 matches is 100. [3]  References [ edit ]     ^  Zabrocki, Mike (2003-03-01).

Of course, there's no perfect method for choosing winning lottery numbers, but there are several ways that you can do it. You can take a scientific or mathematical approach, gamble and choose randomly, follow your gut. Experiment with a few different ways. You never know. You might get lucky.         Steps    Method  1   Choosing Frequently Picked Numbers           1   Look up the frequency chart for previous lottery draws. Most state lottery programs offer charts showing how often each number has been drawn during a given time frame. For instance, it shows how often the number 1 was chosen as a Powerball number between 1997 and 2015. You can view a Powerball frequency chart via the Iowa State Lottery. here ). [1]   If you can look up the all-time frequencies, that's the best possible data set for you to analyze. It’s more comprehensive, and you should base your numbers on as large a time frame as possible.  There's no clear way to know if you should be looking up frequent winning numbers or numbers that come up less frequently. Look up both types of numbers and play sequences with a combo of both if you wish.  However, winning numbers that come up more frequently are likely to remain frequent winners. If you play a number that doesn't come up as frequently, then you simply may need to wait a while to see if it comes up when its "due" to win.  Make sure you're looking up the right frequency chart for the lottery game you plan to play. For instance, Powerball stats will differ from Mega Millions stats.            2   Choose your numbers based on the frequency chart. Review the numbers that are the most frequently chosen and the least frequently chosen. Review the odds for those as well as the numbers in between. [2] After you've looked over the odds, you have two options:  Select numbers that are drawn frequently. If you notice that a few numbers stand out for being drawn significantly more often than the others, consider including them in your pick. Be aware, though, that several other people will be trying this tactic; if you win with frequently picked numbers, you might be at a greater risk of having to share the prize with other winners.  Select numbers that are drawn less frequently. Choosing numbers that aren't picked very often might seem counterintuitive, but consider this: If everyone else is busy picking frequently drawn numbers and you win with your “long-shot” picks, you might not have to share the prize with as many other winners.           3   Acknowledge that each number still has an equal chance of being drawn. Looking at frequency charts might show you which numbers tend to be drawn, but keep in mind that when the actual lottery drawing comes around, each number still has an absolutely equal chance of being picked. It’s all in the luck of the draw. [3]               Score 0 / 0    Method 1 Quiz  Why should you pick numbers that are drawn less frequently?     Because you won't have to share the prize with as many people if you win.  Yes! Numbers that are drawn less frequently are also picked less frequently by players. Therefore, if you do win, you'll share the prize with less people. Read on for another quiz question.    Because they are due to hit soon.  Not exactly! Remember that each number has an equal chance to be drawn. Picking numbers that are not drawn frequently does not mean that they will come up sooner. Click on another answer to find the right one...    Because they yield a higher jackpot.  Nope! The jackpot is the same no matter which numbers you pick. Picking numbers that are drawn infrequently will not increase your winnings. Click on another answer to find the right one...              Method  2   Using the Delta System          1   Learn the Delta System. The Delta Lotto method is way to choose lottery numbers based on a statistical study of numbers that are next to each other. This information has been related back to winning lottery numbers, which has formed the basis for this method. In other words, the delta method is based on research, but keep in mind there’s no guarantee you’re going to win if you choose your numbers this way. [4]          2   Choose a very low number. The number should be between 1 and 5. For instance, the number 1 is a good number to choose because often, more than 60% of the time, the number 1 is part of the winning delta numbers included in the series. However, feel free to choose another low number that you feel good about such as 3 or 5 There is no exact science. Example: 1         3   Pick two numbers between 1 and 8. There are a number of combinations that you could choose from. For instance, you could choose 3 and 5. Or, 2 and 6 could be an option. You could also choose two consecutive numbers like 7 and 8. Example: 3 and 5 Sequence: 1-3-5         4   Pick a number very close to 8. It can be above the number 8 , such as the number 9. Or, it can be below, for instance, 7. For the fourth number, pick something pretty close to 8 ,either above or below it. Example:9 Sequence 1-3-5-9         5   Pick two numbers between 8 and 15. Choose two numbers a few numbers away from each other such as 11 and 13. Another option could be 14 and 9 or 10 and 14. Choose the numbers randomly or choose your favorite numbers between the given range. The smaller number doesn’t have to be listed first. Example: 11 and 13 Sequence: 1-3-5-9-11-13.         6   Write down your delta numbers. Once you have selected 6 numbers in the method described, you have created a six-digit lottery number sequence. Write it down in the order that you selected them. In our example, the numbers are 1-3-5-9-11-13         7   Add up the numbers. Make sure the sum of the numbers is not greater than the highest number allowed in the game you’re playing. For instance, if the highest lottery number you can play is 56, then our numbers are within the range because the total sum equals 42. 1 +3+5+9+11+13 = 42  If your is within about about 15 from the total but not greater than the total, then you have selected some good numbers.  If you need to select different numbers so that you sum is not greater than the highest lottery number, then do so.  It’s okay if numbers repeat themselves where applicable. For instance, you’re number close to 8 could be the number 9, and you could also select 9 for your number between 8 and 15. If you need to do this to make sure that your sum total is not greater, that is fine. Remember numbers sometimes repeat in winning lottery numbers.           8   Rearrange the delta numbers. Delta numbers aren’t usually in sequential order. So, change the numbers around a bit. Put the first number last and the last number first. Put the numbers in the middle at the end or beginning. Rearrange them so that they are in a different order. For example, our numbers rearranged could be 1-3-5-9-11-13 or it could be 5-3-11-9-1-13. There are a number of different variations that you could have. [5]          9   Write down the final delta number. For now, our delta series is 5-3-11-9-1-13. This is not your final lottery number. You will use these numbers to create your lottery number sequence.         10   Write down the first lottery number. The first delta number of the series becomes the first lottery number of your lottery sequence. It remains unchanged. However, the remainder of the numbers will be added together to create the lottery numbers. For example:, the first lottery number is 5. Example: 5         11   Add the first lottery number and the second delta number together. (5 +3 =8) This sum of these two become your second lottery number, the number 4. Repeat this for the rest of the delta numbers. Adding the sum of the numbers next to each other is how you create each number in the series to create your final lottery number sequence. If our delta numbers are 5-3-11-9-1-13, then our lottery numbers are created in the following way:  The first lottery number is 5. Example: 5-  The second lottery number is created by adding the first lottery number to the second delta number. For our example, we get 8 as the sum of 5 and 3. The number 8 is our second lottery number. For example, the number ares 5,8 so far. Example: 5-8-  Add the second lottery number to the third delta number. For example, the number 8 is our second lottery number. Our third delta number is 11. For instance, the number 8 plus 11 equals 19. ( 8+11 =19) So, nineteen is our third lottery number. For example, the lottery numbers are 5,8,19 so far. Example: 5-8-19-  Add the third lottery number and the fourth delta number. In our case, 19 is our third lottery number and 9 is our fourth delta number. For instance, 19 plus 9 equals 28. (19+9 = 28) Twenty-eight is our fourth lottery number. The numbers are 5,8,19 and 28 thus far. Example 5-8-19-28-  Add the fourth lottery number and the fifth delta number. For our example, 28 is our fourth lottery number and 1 is our fifth delta number. Twenty-eight plus 1 equals 29. (28 +1 = 29) So, Twenty-nine is our fifth lottery number. Thus far, the numbers are 5,8,19, 28 and 29. Example: 5-8-19-28-29-  Add the fifth lottery number and the sixth delta number. In this case, 29 is our fifth lottery number and 13 is our sixth delta number. 29 + 13 =42 . Forty-two is our sixth lottery number. The lottery numbers are 5,8,19,28,29 and 42 so far. Example: 5-8-19-28-29-42  Our final lottery numbers are 5-8-19-28-29-42. Now, your numbers are ready to play. Repeat the process again to create another delta number.           Score 0 / 0    Method 2 Quiz  When using the delta system, the first number you pick should fit what parameters?     It should be between 8 and 15.  Not exactly! You pick 2 numbers between 8 and 15 to complete the fifth and sixth numbers in your delta series. However, this is not how you select the first number. Try another answer...    It should be very close to 8.  Not quite! This is how you select the fourth, not the first, number in your delta series. Guess again!    It should be between 1 and 8.  Nope! This is how you choose the second 2 numbers in your delta series. You select the first in a different way. Try again...    It should be a very low number.  Nice! The number 1 is a good choice because it is 1 of the winning numbers (when using the delta system) more than 60 percent of time. Read on for another quiz question.              Method  3   Choosing Lucky Numbers          1   Choose numbers that are significant to you. If you believe in lucky numbers, they're probably digits that center around important dates or events in your life. Mix the numbers of significant numbers together. For instance, you might use your grandfather’s birthday month and year,10/1929 and your mother’s birth month and day, 3/21. Together you might come up with something like 10-19-3-21-29. Other examples of significant numbers might include::  Birthdays: Yours, your children's, your spouse's, and so on.  Anniversaries: This could be a wedding anniversary date, or the date of another significant event.  Ages: Using your age or the ages of your loved ones is also a common practice.  Addresses: The address of your childhood or current home is another tactic you can try.  Phone numbers: Try breaking down your phone number into a sequence of single- or double-digit lotto numbers.           2   Choose numbers you consider lucky. Some folks have a lucky number they use for everything. It isn't connected a birthday or anything like that, they just like the number. If this is the case for you, add your lucky number to your lottery number. You never know. You might get lucky!  If you're playing a lottery game such as Powerball, consider making your lucky number the Powerball pick.  Also if you’re lucky numbers are 7 and 11 lucky, keep in mind that those are really common lottery picks. If you win with these numbers on your ticket, you might end up sharing the prize with a lot of people.           3   Choose a lucky number and stick with it. Some people choose a number sequence that they consider lucky and play it over and over again until it comes up a winner -- if it ever does. For instance, if you’re favorite number sequence is your favorite number, combined with your birthday and your spouse’s lucky number and birthday (3-6-11-9-10-31), then you would play this number religiously every time you play the lottery. Then, you wait for your number to come up a winner. This could be considered making your own luck.         Score 0 / 0    Method 3 Quiz  What significant numbers can you use to play the lottery?     Birthdays  Try again! You can absolutely choose birthdays to play the lottery. Try yours, your children's, and your spouse's. But keep in mind that there are other significant numbers you can use to play the lottery. Pick another answer!    Anniversaries  You're partially right! Anniversaries are popular lucky numbers to play in the lottery. You can use a wedding anniversary or other significant event. But remember that there are other significant numbers you can use to play the lottery. Try another answer...    Addresses  Close! The address for your current or childhood home might be lucky to play in the lottery. You could include the zip code if you need more numbers. Still, there are other significant numbers you can use to play the lottery. There’s a better option out there!    Phone numbers  Almost! Break important phone numbers into single- and double-digit numbers to make your picks! However, there are other significant numbers you can use to play the lottery. There’s a better option out there!    All of the above  Correct! When choosing lucky numbers, birthdays, anniversaries, addresses, and phone numbers are all great options. Get creative, and go with your gut! Read on for another quiz question.              Method  4   Using Random Numbers          1   Find a random number generator.  Random.org has a number generator specifically designed for lottery picks. The advantage of using random draws is that winning lottery numbers are chosen randomly as well. So, it might be a lucky draw.  Choose how many tickets you want. Then, choose the country or state in which you’re playing.  Choose the lottery game that you’re playing such as Powerball, Nebraska-Pick 5, etc. You are able to choose specific games for each state.  Choose how many numbers are available in the draw. For instance, a five sequence number such as 5-10-14-2-6-7. Or, is it a six sequence number like 11-5-3-9-15-24.  Chose the highest number in the sequence. For instance, if any number up to 59 is available to play, the sequence 6-59-30-15-5 is a viable lottery number. The number 60-3-67-3-10-5-1 is not.Then, click pick tickets. The settings and the site will calculate a number for you. [6]            2   Use a random number generator for single numbers. If you still want to have a little control over your numbers, you could use a random number generator to choose individual numbers. For instance, you could choose the parameters such as a number between 1 and 30. Then, let the random number choose. Do that for each number.  You also could follow the steps of the delta method except instead of picking the numbers yourself, you could allow the random number generator to do it. You simply set the parameters for each step of the process. [7]            3   Use "lotto pick" computer generated numbers. Allow the lottery to choose randomly for you. You can request random picks when you purchase your lottery ticket. When the attendant asked you for the numbers, tell him or her that you want the system to choose the numbers for you. With the click of a few buttons, you’ll have your lottery numbers. If you're buying several tickets at one time, this is probably the way to go.         Score 0 / 0    Method 4 Quiz  What information do you need to input into a random number generator?     The jackpot amount.  Nope! The random number generator does not need to know the jackpot amount for the game you're playing. It selects numbers based on the type of game, how many numbers you can select, and the highest number available to play. Guess again!    Which lottery game you are playing.  Absolutely! Examples include Powerball or Pick 3, although the games may vary depending on your state. The random number generator needs this information so it can set parameters such as how many numbers you need to select and what numbers are available for selection. Read on for another quiz question.    The lowest number possible to play.  Not quite! The lowest possible number will always be 1. Instead, you will need to enter the highest number available to play. Click on another answer to find the right one...    The most frequently drawn numbers.  Not exactly! The random number generator does not take frequently drawn number into account. You do not need to enter this information. Choose another answer!

No two balls can have the same number, so the interval $1\ldots 100$ is represented by the balls.  I now pick 20 balls at random, one by one without putting them back at any point. I am trying to find the probably of getting 4 certain numbers. The sequence of these 4 numbers does not matter.  Here is my solution: The first time I pick up a ball the probably is $1/100$. The next time it is $1/99$, etc.. So the total probably of getting the four desired numbers is $1/(100\cdot 99\cdot 98\cdot 97)$.  Is this correct?    probability  probability-theory     share | cite | improve this question     asked Jan 20 '14 at 18:43       BillyJean   185 3 13              add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  4  down vote  accepted      You have computed the probability that you get your target numbers, in the first $4$ choices, in a certain specified order. That is much smaller than the required probability.  There are $\binom{100}{20}$ equally likely ways to choose $20$ balls.  We find the number of ways to choose $20$ balls that include our $4$ target balls. So we must choose $16$ balls from the remaining $96$ to keep our $4$ target balls company. This can be done in $\binom{96}{16}$ ways.  Thus the required probability is $\dfrac{\binom{96}{16}}{\binom{100}{20}}$. This expression can be greatly simplified.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jan 20 '14 at 18:53       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779                  Thanks, but the probablity of picking the $4$ does not enter in the equation? – BillyJean  Jan 20 '14 at 19:01            Well, on top we could write $\binom{4}{4}\binom{96}{16}$ instead of $\binom{96}{6}$, and maybe I should have, but since $\binom{4}{4}=1$ it makes no difference. – André Nicolas  Jan 20 '14 at 19:03            But the balls are not supposed to be returned. Is $\binom{100}{20}$ correct? – Spock  Jan 20 '14 at 19:07        1      Yes. It is the number of ways of choosing a "hand" of $20$ cards from a collection of $100$ distinct cards. – André Nicolas  Jan 20 '14 at 19:10        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Your solution is not correct.  But, here's a hint on a different way to proceed:  Hint: You want to count all permutations (of length $20$) of distinct elements in $\{1,2,\ldots,100\}$, such that four fixed numbers (say $1,2,3,4$) are all contained in the permutation.  To do this: pick the $16$ numbers OTHER than the ones you are interested in which will be included; then, pick ANY arrangement of the set of $20$ numbers consisting of the four you want and the new sixteen.  This is the total number of sequences with the desired property; divide by the total number of sequences to get the desired result.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jan 20 '14 at 18:48       Nick Peterson   24.8k 2 34 55                  But I get to pick 20 balls, how does that information enter? – BillyJean  Jan 20 '14 at 18:49            Whoops, sorry; I missed that detail.

How to find the probability of matching 4 out of 5 numbers from a lottery with number 1 to 45  There are 5 numbers that match the winning set and 40 which don't

P(matching exactly 4 and mismatching 1)

The number of ways to choose the 4 matching ones is C(5,4) 

For each of those C(5,4) ways to choose the 4 matching ones,
there are C(40,1) ways of choosing the nonmatching one.

So there are C(5,4)*C(40,1) ways to choose exactly 4 matching ones
and exactly one non-matching one.

There are C(45,5) ways of choosing ANY 5

So the probability is

 C(5,4)*C(40,1)       5*40        200
---------------- = --------- = --------- = .0001636984053
    C(45,5)         1221759     1221759


Not too likely.  Studying math teaches you that gambling 
without using skill to put the probability of winning in 
your favor is never wise.

Edwin                              Permutations and
Combinations  Many problems in probability can be phrased in the
language of "how many ways can we pick r objects out of a group of N objects."
We now calculate the answer to this question.  If the order of the r objects is important, than
the "number of ways to pick r objects out of a group of N objects" is called:
the number of permutations of N objects taken r at a time, and denoted
by the symbol N P r .
What is the numerical value of N P r ?
For the 1st choice we can choose any one of N objects. For the 2nd choice
we can choose any one of the remaining N-1 objects. For the 3rd choice
we can choose any one of the remaining N-2 objects, and so on down until
for the rth choice we can pick any one of the remaining N-r+1 objects.
We therefore find  N P r = N x (N-1) x (N-2) x .... x (N-r+1)  Note that in this counting, the order in which
objects are picked is important. Assume the original objects are numbered
1, 2, 3, ..., N, and we are picking any three. In computing N P r the sequence 5, 3, 7, is counted separately from the sequence 3, 5, 7,
which is counted separately from the sequence 3, 7, 5, which is counted
separately from the sequence 5, 7, 3, and so on.  Often we do not wish to distinguish between sequences
which have the same objects in them, but in which the objects are ordered
differently. If the ordering is not important, then the number of unique
ways to pick r objects out of a group of N objects is called: the number
of combinations of N objects taken r at a time, and is denoted by
the symbol N C r ,
or also by the symbol . To
compute the numerical value of N C r ,
note that it is just equal to the number of permutations N P r divided by the number of ways to order the r objects chosen. To order the
r numbers chosen, we have r choices for the 1st object, r-1 choices for
the 2nd object, r-2 choices for the 3rd object, and so on down until there
is only 1 choice left for the last rth object. What we have described is
just the number of permutations of r objects taken r at a time, and is
equal to  r P r = r x (r-1) x (r-2) x ... x 2 x 1  This combination occurs so often, that it is given
a special name and times  r P r = r x (r-1) x (r-2) x ... x 2 x 1 = r!  and called "r factorial ". For example, 2!
= 2 x 1 = 1, 3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6,  4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24, and so on. We define 1!
= 1 and also 0! = 1.  Thus we conclude that the number of combinations
of N objects taken r at a time is  N C r = =  Now note that we can use the definition of N P r and
factorial to write  N P r x
(N-r)! = [N x (N-1) x .... x (N-r+1)] x [r x (r-1) x ... x 2 x 1] = N!  or equivalently, N P r =
N!/(N-r)!. We can then write N C r as,  N C r = =  Note from this result that = since N-(N-r) = r. This
result follows intuitively by noting that when we choose r objects from
a group of N objects, we leave N-r objects behind. If we regard these N-r
objects left behind as the "chosen" objects, we see that the number of
combinations of N objects taken r at a time is exactly equal to the number
of combinations of N objects taken N-r at a time.  To see how to use combinations in the context of
probability problems, consider the example we did earlier. If we flip four
coins, how many of the possible outcomes will have exactly two heads?  From the four coins, we want to choose two of them
to be heads - the remaining two must therefore be tails. The number of
ways to choose two heads for four coins is just:   Thus there are six outcomes with exactly two heads.
This is the same answer we found earlier.  More generally, if one flips N coins, the number
of possible outcomes with exactly r heads will be, N C r = = .
Since the number of all possible outcomes in N flips is 2 N ,
we have that the probability to flip exactly r heads in N flips is N C r /2 N .    Another example : If we roll four dice, how
many outcomes will have at least one "6" on top?  The possibilities consistent with at least one "6"
are: one "6", two "6"s, three "6"s, or four "6"s.  The number of ways to choose one "6" from four dice
is:   The remaining three dice can each land in one of
five possible ways, so the total number of outcomes with exactly one "6"
is 4x 5x 5x 5 = 500.  The number of ways to choose two "6"s from four dice
is:  The remaining two dice can each land in one of five
possible ways, so the total number of outcomes with exactly two "6"s is
6x 5x 5 = 150.  The number of ways to choose three "6"s from four
dice is:  The remaining one die can each land in one of five
possible ways, so the total number of outcomes with exactly three "6"s
is 4x 5 = 20.  The number of ways to choose four "6"s from four
dice is:   There are no remaining dice. So the total number
of outcomes with exactly four "6"s is 1.  Adding all together, there are 500 + 150 + 20 + 1
= 671 possible outcomes with at least one "6" showing. Since the number
of all possible outcomes is 6 4 = 1296, the probability
to role at least one 6 is then 671/1296.  This is the same answer that we found earlier by
the indirect method:  (prob at least one 6) = 1 - (prob no 6) = 1 - (5/6) 4 =
1 - (625/1296) = 671/1296.  Example from Text  5) Six balls numbered 1,2,3,4,5,6 are in a jar. Two
are chosen at random.  a) How many possible outcomes are there if the order
of the picking does not matter?  This is just the number of ways to choose 2 balls
from 6, where order does not matter, or 6 C 2 =  b) Think of the choice of the two balls as if it
were a lottery. Before the selection of the two balls, you independently
guessed two different numbers from 1 to 6.  i) What is the probability that you guessed both
balls correctly?  Of the 15 possible outcomes of the lottery, there
is only one which matches the two numbers you have guessed, so the probability
to have guessed both correctly is just 1/15.  ii) What is the probability that you guessed one
of the balls correctly but not the other?  We will solve this two ways. To help us think about
this, let us suppose that you have guessed the numbers #1 and #4.  Method one: Of the 15 possible outcomes of the lottery,
the number of outcomes which include the #1 but not the #4 is 4, since
one of the balls must be #1, and the second can be either #2, #3, #5, or
#6 (i.e. it may not be #4). Similarly, the number of outcomes which include
the #4 but not the #1 is also 4, since one ball must be #4, and the second
can be #2, #3, #5, or #6 (i.e. it may not be #1). So the total number of
outcomes in which one ball has been guessed correctly but not the other
is 4 + 4 = 8.  The total number of outcomes is 15, so the probability
to guess only one ball correctly is 8/15.  Method two: Again assuming that we have guessed #1
and #4, then the probability that the first ball picked in the lottery
is either #1 or #4 is 2/6; the probability that the second ball picked
will not be one we have guessed is then 4/5, since only 4 of the remaining
5 balls are different from the number we guessed. So the probability that
we guess the first ball correctly but not the second is (2/6)x(4/5)=4/15.
But we also have to consider the case where it is the second ball that
we guess correctly but not the first. The probability that the first ball
is different from either number we have guessed is 4/6; the probability
that the second ball is then equal to one of the numbers we have guessed
is then 2/5, since 2 of the remaining 5 balls agree with the numbers we
have guessed. So the probability that we guess correctly the second ball
but not the first is (4/6) x (2/5)=4/15. So the
probability that we guess only one ball correctly but not the other, is
the sum of the probability that we guessed the first but not the second,
plus the probability that we guessed the second but not the first, i.e.  (4/15) + (4/15) = 8/15.  iii) What is the probability that we have guessed
neither ball correctly?  The number of outcomes of the lottery that will have
no number in common with the two numbers we have guessed is just .  That is, the balls chosen in the lottery must be
any two from the four balls which are not the ones we guessed. The
number of ways to do this is just 4 C 2 .
So the probability to guess neither ball correctly is 6/15.  c) You can check that the probabilities of (i), (ii),
and (iii) in part (b) add up to unity, since these three cases cover all
possible outcomes.  1/15 + 8/15 + 6/15 = 15/15 = 1  Example This problem is just like the last,
but with the numbers adjusted to reflect a situation closer to a real state
lottery.  A jar is filled with 40 numbered balls, each with
a different number between 1 and 40. Six balls are randomly drawn out of
the jar, as in the lottery, i.e. we do not care about the order in which
the balls are drawn.  a) How many possible outcomes for the chosen 6 numbers
are there?  This is asking how many ways can we choose 6 balls
out of 40, with the order of selection being ignored. The answer is given
in terms of combinations:  40 C 6 = = N  b) If you win the lottery by guessing all the six
numbers which are randomly drawn, how likely is it that you will win with
one ticket?  If we guess 6 numbers on our lottery ticket, there
is only one of the N possible outcomes of the lottery that will match all
our 6 numbers. The probability this happens is therefore:   c) If a million people play, all choosing their numbers independently of one another, how likely is it that at least one person will win the
lottery?  The (prob at least one wins) = 1 - (prob no
one wins) ,  since these are mutually exclusive outcomes that
cover all possibilities, i.e. either no one wins, or at least one person
wins.  The probability that one person loses the lottery
in one play is, 1-p, i.e. one minus the probability to win. The probability
two people lose in two independent plays is therefore (1-p)x(1-p)=(1-p) 2 .
This is by our basic rule #2: the probability that two independent events
occur is the product of their probabilities. The probability that three
people lose in three independent plays is therefore (1-p)x(1-p)x(1-p)=(1-p) 3 ,
and so on, so that the probability that one million people all lose in
one million plays is: (1-p) 1,000,000 . So
the probability that at least one person wins in one million plays is:  1 - (1-p) 1,000,000 = 1 - (1 - 0.00000026) 1,000,000 = 1 - 0.77
= 0.23  So there is a 23% chance that some one will win.  Note that this is a different answer from the one
we would get if all million players coordinated their plays so that no
two people chose the same set of six numbers. Then, since each play is
a mutually exclusive outcome from all the other plays, the probability
that at least one person wins is the sum of probabilities that any one
choice of numbers wins, i.e. 1,000,000xp = 0.26. This is slightly larger
than what we found if all players chose their numbers independently. The
difference is because when the players choose numbers independently, there
is always some chance that two players will choose exactly the same set
of 6 numbers. By coordinating their efforts to choose different sets of
numbers, the million players can be sure to cover more possible outcomes.  d) If you get a lesser prize for choosing 5 of the
6 numbers correctly, what is your probability of winning?  Suppose you pick your 6 numbers on your lottery ticket.
Let's compute the number of possible outcomes of the lottery that will
have 5 numbers agreeing with numbers you chose, but with one number disagreeing.  Suppose that it is your first 5 numbers that agree
and it is the last 6th number that disagrees. The number of outcomes consistent
with this is just the number of ways the lottery can choose a ball that
does not match this last 6th number - this is 34, because it can only be
one of the 34 numbers you did not guess. Now suppose that it is
your last 5 numbers that agree and it is the first number that disagrees.
Again, the number of outcomes consistent with this is 34. Similarly, it
might be the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th of your numbers which is the one that
disagrees with the lottery result. In each case there are 34 outcomes of
the lottery which will agree with your five other numbers. So the total
number of lottery outcomes which will give you five and only five numbers
guessed correctly is:  34x6=204  where 34 is the number outcomes that match a particular
group of 5 out of your 6 numbers, and 6 is the number of ways to choose
the number which is not guessed correctly. The probability to guess exactly
5 numbers correctly is therefore  q =  The probability to win the lottery by guessing at
least 5 numbers, i.e. by guessing either only 5 or by guessing all 6 is
therefore,  q + p = 0.00005326    Let us find q by a second method. Imagine looking
at your lottery card with your 6 guessed numbers, as the lottery balls
are being drawn. The probability that the 1st ball drawn is one of your
numbers is 6/40. The probability the 2nd ball drawn is one of your remaining
5 numbers is 5/39, since only 39 balls are left. The probability that the
3rd ball drawn is one of your remaining 4 numbers is 4/38, and so on. So
the probability that the first 5 balls selected in the lottery agree with
5 of your numbers, but the 6th does not is:   where the last factor is 34/35 because if the last
ball is not one of your 6 numbers, it must be one of the 34 other numbers,
and there are now only 35 balls left to choose from.  This does not cover all the possibilities however.
It may be that the first ball drawn in the lottery is the one that does
not agree with any of your numbers, but the next 5 balls drawn will. The
probability for this to happen is:   Or it may be that the second ball drawn in the lottery
is the one that does not agree with any of your numbers, but the first
and the last four balls drawn do. The probability for this to happen is:   You can check, by multiplying the numerators and
denominators together, that all three terms above give exactly the same
value:  =  Similarly, you can check that if it is the 3rd ball,
or the 4th ball, or the 5th ball drawn in the lottery that is the one that
does not agree with any of our guessed numbers, the probability is again
34/N.  Since there are 6 ways to choose which ball drawn
in the lottery will not agree with any of your guessed numbers, and the
probability in each case is 34/N, the total probability that you guess
exactly 5 numbers correctly is 6x34/N = 204/3,838,380, which is the same
answer as we got by the first method.    e) Suppose it costs $1 to pay the lottery, and you
play each week for the nest 40 years for a total of 2000 times. Assume
that if you have at least 5 of the 6 numbers drawn in any given lottery
you will win more than the $2000 it will cost to play these games. What
is the probability that you come out winning more than you have spent?  This is the probability to win at least once in 2000
plays, where by "win" we mean to guess 5 or more numbers correctly. This
is similar to the question in part (c).  (prob to win at least once) = 1 - (prob never win)  The probability not to win in one play is 1-(p+q)  The probability not to win in two plays is [1-(p+q)] 2  The probability not to win in 2000 plays is [1-(p+q)] 2000  So the probability to win at least once is  1-[1-(p+q)] 2000 =
1-[1-0.00005326] 2000 = 1-0.99994674 2000 = 1-0.899 = 0.101  So you have only a 10% chance to win in 2000 plays.
This is larger than you may have thought, but still very few people would
bet $2000 with only a 10% chance to win.               Section 3.4  Combinatorics and 
      Probability              This section pulls together many of the ideas 
      we have seen from the last several sections. It is all about finding the 
      probabilities of events that are a little more complex than we've seen. 
      But, the terminology and notation is still the same. Let's look at an 
      example from a few sections ago to review the concepts.   Example:  Find the probability of getting exactly two boys in a 
      family with three children.  First, we need to find the sample space :  S = { BBB, BBG, BGB, GBB, BGG, GBG, GGB, 
      GGG }  These are all the different ways to have boys and girls in a family 
      with three children.  Second, find all the events that satisfy what we're looking for. 
      In this case, exactly two boys.  E = { BBG, BGB, GBB }  The probability of the event happening is given by:  p( E ) = n (events that satisfy the desired 
      condition) ÷ n (sample space)  Therefore, we have:  p(exactly two boys) = 3 ÷ 8 = 0.375  or a 37.5% of having exactly two boys.   Notice that the probability of not getting exactly two boys is 5 
      ÷ 8 = 0.625.   This is the compliment of the probability 
      that we just found.   Subtracting this from 1 will give the same 
      probability that we found in our example.  This gives us another 
      method to calculate probabilities when the number of elements in the 
      compliment is easier to find than the set itself:        Compliment Formulas  p( E ) = 1–p( E' )  and  p( E' ) = 
        1–p( E )  In the above example, finding the number of elements in the sample 
      space and the number of elements in the set that satisfied our conditions 
      was relatively easy.  But, suppose we wanted to find the probability 
      of having at least one boy in a family of 12 children.  I wouldn't 
      want to write down the sample space. ( How big is the sample 
      space? ).  In order to count these types of sets, we'll need to 
      use the three techniques developed earlier:  Fundamental Principle of Counting: (# of choices 
        of first item) × (# of choices for second item) Permutations (Order is important):   nPr Combinations (Order is not important):  nCr  To answer the above question about how big the sample space is for a 
      family of twelve children, we can think of 12 "slots", one slot per 
      child.  In each slot you have two choices: either a boy or a 
      girl.  There are also 2 options for the 2nd child, and so 
      forth.  The total number of combinations is  2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2 = 4096  On your calculator press 2 ^ 12 [ENTER]. The sample space 
      contains 4096 elements!  Way to many to write them all down.  
      But we don't have to.  We only need to know how many there are.   Example:  Find the probability of having exactly 4 boys in a 
      family of 12 children.  We already know that the sample space contains 4096 elements.  
      But, how many of those elements contain exactly four boys?  These are 
      all the elements that look like GGGBGBBGBGGG .   All 
      the different combinations of 4 boys and 8 girls.  This 
      means we can use combinations:  out of 12 children the number of ways 
      can you choose 4 of them to be boys is: 12 C 4 = 
      495.  Thus,    Figure 1  Figure 2   p(4 boys in a family of 12 children) = 495/4096  or about 12% probability.  See figure1 for 
      calculations.  The entire calculation can be done in one step.  
      That is,   Figure 2 shows these calculations.     Example:  Find the probability of being dealt a 5-card hand 
      consisting of 3 Queens and 2 Jacks from a standard deck of cards.  
      This is called a Queens-over-Jacks full house.  First we need to find how many different 5-card hands exist.  That 
      is, how many ways can you choose 5 cards from 52 cards: 52 C 5 = 2598960 different 5-card hands.  Next,  we need to choose the Queens and the 
      Jacks.  Since there are four of each kind, we have: 4 C 3 = 4 ways to choose 3 Queens, and 4 C 2 = 6 ways to choose 2 Jacks.  Using the 
      Fundamental Principle of Counting, there are 4 × 6 = 24 different ways to 
      choose 3 Queens and 2 Jacks.  The probability of being dealt 3 Queens 
      and 2 Jacks is:  p(3 Q and 2 J) = ( 4 C 3 × 4 C 2 ) ÷ 52 C 5 = 24 ÷ 2598960 = 
      0.0000092345    Figure 3  Not very likely!  See figure 3 for the 
      calculations.  Notice that the answer is in scientific notation.  It really means 
      9.234463016×10 -6 or, moving the decimal 6 places to the left , 0.0000092345 rounding up.   Another important note is 
      to notice that in the numerator we are choosing 3 cards, then choosing 2 
      cards for a total of 5 cards, and in the denominator we are also choosing 
      5 cards.  Always make sure that the number of cards chosen agree in 
      both the numerator and denominator.  But be careful!   Example: Find the probability of getting any kind of a full 
      house.  This is like our last example, except we first have to choose the two 
      denominations (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) for our 
      full house.  Once the two denominations are chosen, we can choose the 
      3-of-a-kind and the 2-of-a-kind.  The denominator will still be the 
      same as above.  First choose two denominations: 13 C 2 = 
        78  (i.e., the 4's and 9's). Choose the denomination for the 3-of-a-kind: 2 C 1 = 2  (i.e., the 4's). Choose the 3-of-a-kind: 4 C 3 = 4.  Here we 
        finally chose 3 cards. Choose the 2-of-a-kind: 4 C 2 = 6.  Here we 
        chose 2 more cards.  The probability for any full house is:     That means you have a little better than a 0.1% chance of being dealt a 
      full house. Notice that when you don't specify which full house you want 
      to get (as in the previous example), the probability increases 
      dramatically.  In the last example, we'll find the probability of winning the old Washington State Lottery "Lotto", and 
      the probability of getting the second place prize for this lottery.  
      The old Washington State Lottery "Lotto" is called a 6/49 lottery.  This means 
      you chose (or had the computer choose) 6 numbers from the integers 1 
      through 49 (no repeats).  If you correctly chose all 6 numbers, you
      won a million bucks.  If you only got 5 correct numbers you got the 
      second place prize of a couple hundred dollars.    Example:  Find the probability of getting all six numbers correct 
      in the old Washington State Lottery "Lotto"..  First, calculate the total number of ways to choose any six 
      numbers from 49 numbers:  49 C 6 = 13983816 total different ways 
      to choose six numbers.  Almost 14 million!  Next, calculate how many different ways you can choose six winning 
      numbers.  Note:   6 of the 49 numbers are winning numbers, which 
      means 43 numbers are not winning numbers.  The number of ways to 
      correctly get all 6 winning numbers is: 6 C 6 = 
      1. Therefore, the probability of wining the big prize is:  p(choosing 6 winning numbers) = 1 ÷ 13983816 = 
      0.0000000715  You have a better chance of getting hit by lightening, or dying in a 
      plane crash while being stuck in the bathroom!  Your chance of 
      winning is only about 1 in 14 million.   If you're wondering why the 
      ad says "chances of winning are 1 in 7 million", it's because you get two 
      games (or two chances) for every ticket, so your probability of winning 
      doubles from 1 in 14 million to 2 in 14 million, which reduces to 1 in 7 
      million.     Example:  Find the probability of getting the second place prize, 
      that is choosing five winning numbers.  We can solve this just like the last example, except we have to choose 
      5 out of 6 winning numbers, and also one of the 43 losing (non-winning) 
      numbers (remember, you still choose 6 numbers.)  First, choose the winning numbers: 6 C 5 = 
        6  Next, choose the non-winning number: 43 C 1 = 43  The number of ways to choose 5 winning numbers and 1 non-winning number 
      is  6×43 = 258.  The probability of winning the second place 
      prize is:  p(choosing 5 winning numbers) = 258 ÷ 13983816 = 
      0.0000184499   That's a little better, but still not good.  Calculate the 
      probability of getting:  a) 4 winning numbers (and 2 non-winning numbers)  b) 3 winning numbers (and 3 non-winning numbers)  Ask your classmates what kind of answers they get.  We'll use 
      these results in the next section.

As a mathematician, I have never purchased a lottery ticket. I find the odds depressing and have never had luck in winning anything from these kinds of games.  This hub is all about calculating lottery probability or odds. In order to make it more relevant to me, I decided to base it on the Grandlotto 6/55, the lottery game with the biggest prize money here in the Philippines. There will be two different cases discussed in the hub: the probability of winning the game with all six numbers matching, and the probability of having n numbers matching.   Rules of the Lottery Game It is always important to find out the rules of any game before participating in it. For the Grandlotto 6/55, in order to win the jackpot prize, you have to match six numbers from a pool of 55 numbers ranging from 1-55. The initial payout is a minimum of P20 (or around $0.47). It is also possible to win some money if you are able to match three, four, or five numbers of the winning combination. Note that the order of the winning combination here does not matter.  Here is a table for the prizes you can obtain:     No. of Matching Nos.

This is one of the basic concepts you learn in Probability Theory. The main difference being that permutations consider order to be important, while in combinations, order isn't important.  In a lottery ticket, permutation should be used if the numbers in your ticket have to match the order of the draw for the winning string of numbers. In the Grandlotto 6/55, order is not important because so long as you have the winning set of numbers, you can win the prize.  The next formulas only apply for numbers without repetition . This means that if the number x is drawn, it cannot be drawn again. If the number drawn from the set is returned before the next draw, then that has repetition.   This is the formula for Permutations, where order is important. | Source       This is the formula for Combinations, where order is not important. | Source   , where n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.  Note that based on the formulas given, C(n,k) is always less than or equal to P(n,k). You will see later on why it is important to make this distinction for calculating lottery odds or probability.   How to Calculate Lottery Probability for 6 Matching Numbers So now that we know the basic concepts of permutations and combinations, let us go back to the example of Grandlotto 6/55. For the game, n = 55, the total number of possible choices. k = 6, the number of choices we can make. Because order is not important, we will use the formula for combination:   Source   These are the odds or the total number of possible combinations for any 6-digit number to win the game. To find the probability, just divide 1 by the number above, and you will get: 0.0000000344 or 0.00000344%. See what I mean by depressing odds?  So what if we're talking about a different lottery game where order does matter. We will now use the permutation formula to get the following:   Source   Compare these two results and you will see that the odds for getting the winning combination where order matters has 3 additional zero's! It's going from about 28 million:1 odds to 20 billion:1 odds! The probability of winning for this case is 1 divided by the odds which equals to 0.0000000000479 or 0.00000000479%.  As you can see, because the permutation is always greater than or equal to the combination, the probability of winning a game where order matters is always less than or equal to the probability of winning a game where order does not matter. Because the risk is greater for games where order is required, this implies that the reward must also be higher.   How to Calculate Lottery Probability with Less Than 6 Matching Numbers Because you can also win prizes if you have less than 6 matching numbers, this section will show you how to calculate the probability if there are x matches to the winning set of numbers.  First, we need to find the number of way to choose x winning numbers from the set and multiply it by the number of ways to choose the losing numbers for the remaining 6-x numbers. Consider the number of ways to choose x winning numbers. Because there are only 6 possible winning numbers, in essence, we are only choosing x from a pool of 6. And so, because order does not matter, we get C(6, x).  Next, we consider the number of ways to choose the remaining 6-x balls from the pool of losing numbers. Because 6 are winning numbers, we have 55 - 6 = 49 balls to choose the losing numbers from. So, the number of possibilities for choosing a losing ball can be obtained from C(49, 6 - x). Again, order does not matter here.  So, in order to calculate the probability of winning with x matching numbers out of a possible 6, we need to divide the outcome from the previous two paragraphs by the total number of possibilities to win with all 6 matching numbers. We get:       Source   If we write this in a more general form, we get:   Source   , where n = total number of balls in the set, k = total number of balls in the winning combination for the jackpot prize, and x = total numbers of balls matching the winning set of numbers.  If we use this formula to calculate the probability (and the odds) of winning the Grandlotto 6/55 with only x matching numbers, we get the following:     x matches   Calculation   Probability   Odds (1/Probability)   0   C(6,0) * C(49,6)/C(55,6)   0.48237   2.07308   1   C(6,1) * C(49,5)/C(55,6)   0.39466   2.53777   2   C(6,2) * C(49,4)/C(55,6)   0.10963   9.12158   3   C(6,3) * C(49,3)/C(55,6)   0.01271   78.67367   4   C(6,4) * C(49,2)/C(55,6)   0.00060   1643.40561   5   C(6,5) * C(49,1)/C(55,6)   0.00001   98604.33673   6   C(6,6) * C(49,0)/C(55,6)   0.00000003   28989675      How to Choose the Winning Numbers in Lottery As you can see from the math in this hub, the probability of winning the lottery is the same for any 6-number combination available in the Grandlotto 6/55 game. This is also applicable for other lottery games out there.  As I was researching for this hub, I came across links that said never choose numbers that are sequential, like from 1-6 or some such nonsense. There is no such secret to winning the lottery! Each number is as equally likely to come up in the draw as the next number.  If you are willing to face the very little probability of winning the lottery, I say go choose any number you want. You can base it on your birthdays, special days, anniversaries, lucky numbers, etc. Just remember that with great risk comes great reward!

However there are also many factors(known and many unknown) which produces lottery results that happen to produce patterns, which may help in striking like few matching numbers but still ultra difficult in winning 6 matching numbers. It's still a combination of luck, for now i conclude it's combination of probability+luck (L.O.A or whatever u wanna call it)...cheers n good luck hehe  Author dezalyx 2 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Subs. From the definition of classical probability, every statistical outcome will contain elements that are equally likely to happen. This means that if you roll a 6-sided dice, it is equally probable that the outcome will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Or in the case of flipping a coin, the probability of heads will be equal to the probability of tails. No magic coins, no loaded dice, all equally probable to happen. When calculating the lottery probability in this article, this assumption is already used. This is usually the case when calculating probabilities theoretically. Having no affiliation to companies who hold the lottery, it would be difficult for me to assume that certain balls are more likely to surface because they are loaded. In my opinion, historical data does not have any bearing on lottery outcomes. Statistically speaking, working on other probability approaches will not work because of this. Just because the number N appears frequently in lottery drawings, does not mean that the ball is more likely to surface than the number N+1 in the next drawing.  Subs 2 months ago  Can the classical probability theory be used here? And please give an example  Subs 2 months ago  What other probability approaches can be used?  Author dezalyx 7 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Odds. Thanks for commenting. I did not say choosing one's birthday would contribute to one's luck. I just said you can choose any number you want if you're willing to face the fact that there's only a very small chance that you can win the jackpot prize. Heck, you could choose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 if you wanted to. The basis of this article is that the probability of each ball getting drawn is the same as any other ball in the lottery. While I kept getting comments on how likely certain numbers will get picked over other numbers, mathematically speaking, there is no such thing as having weighted balls for lottery drawings. While you might not have studied mathematics, you certainly were on point when you said that you should never try your luck in gambling. That's actually a mathematician's saying. Never gamble, because the house always wins.  ODDS 7 months ago  I didn't study mathematics, but you were wrong when you mentioned that the numbers of the player's birthday would contribute to his luck, rather it would add up to the improbability, because certainly the player would not live enough to wait his birthday's numbers to come up! And yeah you certainly can top up your chances even if mathematically every number may pop up randomly. If i were to buy a ticket, i would consider not selecting numbers that are altogether evens/odds, divisible by 5 altogether etc. If the order does not matter, you will get more chances! But you know what, never try your luck in gambling, it's made to steal your money and you end up depressed.  Author dezalyx 7 months ago  from Philippines Hi, jazer. I've been receiving a ton of comments lately asking for what the winning number will be for the next lottery draw, but the article is just about the probability of winning the lottery. I don't know about the specifics of the composition of lotto balls, since it probably differs for every company that makes them, but looking for trends when there is no factual basis will just result in you losing money. And given the odds of winning the lottery, you would be better off investing that money in something else with a higher chance of getting a profit. While I agree with the idea that maybe the composition of the balls would get it drawn more than the others, you can never bank on that, since it could be changed without you ever knowing about it (repainting the balls numbers, changing the balls entirely, having different sets of balls for different drawings, etc.).      jazer 8 months ago  Probability is probability. We cannot predict the future. But for the purpose of conversation, some people used they called a "trend". A history of past result. From trend you may "guess" which number can be with higher probability. Is this true in nature? Actually, this is only my opinion. My reasoning with the trend is somewhat related to the composition of the lotto balls e.g. weight, etc, that's why some numbers were drawn more that the others. What is your opinion on this? Thanks.  Kgomotso Comfort 9 months ago  I just want know how can I calculate the probabilities of 6/49  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines Edgard, it seems to me that your question is still about the gambler's fallacy. Just because a certain number comes out approximately 6 times out of x number of drawings will not change the probability of the number being drawn again in the future. Imagine changing the game into a simple heads or tails coin flip. The probability of getting either outcome is 1/2. Just because you get 6 heads in a row does not mean the next result would be a tail. Even if you get 100 heads in a row, the probability of getting either outcome is still going to be 1/2. There won't be any probability equations to predict what you are looking for. If there is, the people who have discovered such equations would already be taking advantage of the lottery system. The only thing you can do with the study is plot historical graphs on how many times a certain number has come out previously and marvel at how some numbers seem to appear more than others.  Edgard 11 months ago  Dear dezalix, We really appreciate your time and answers We are aware that there will always be an average for any set of numbers, also we can find a trend to explain any series of numbers, but these work outs are not a guaranty that we will get really meaningful results. Our previous questions came out from the following fact: We made a sequential review of winning numbers of 260 draws of a 6/45 lottery, to find out the number of times (frequency) that each of the 45 balls was drawn; we started with a 160 draws sample, and increased the sample with 10 draws data each time, until we got the last sample of 260 draws; with every sample of draws, we worked out the rate = [total draws of the sample / frequency of each ball in the sample] for every ball, then we worked out the average of this 45 ratios; the result clearly showed a steady trend for this average, which started at 6.63, for the 160 draws sample, to 6.55 for the 260 draws sample; of course we could work with more sample, but we just decided to stop at 260 draws sample. We initially thought this ratio means the average number of draws we expect to wait for a ball to be drawn; but, what would be the right mining of this average (6.55), if any?, why the average has a steady trend?, and is there any probability equation to predict this average? ratio ni = [N° draws/Freq ni] i = [1, 45] Samples	       Average N° Draws	of ratios      Min ratio  Max ratio 260	                6.55	      4.73            8.97 250	                6.56	      4.63	          8.93 240	                6.57	      4.44	          8.57 230	                6.59	      4.26	          8.85 220	                6.58	      4.31	          8.46 210	                6.59	      4.29	          9.13 200	                6.61	      4.17	          9.09 190	                6.61	      4.13	          8.64 180	                6.62	      3.91	          9.00 170	                6.62	      3.95	          8.95 160	                6.63	      3.81	          8.89 Regards Edgard  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines No. The law of large numbers indicate that given a large number of opportunities, we should expect a certain event to happen again, no matter how unlikely it may be. For example, a set of 6 lottery numbers can get picked 2 weeks in a row. But, just because it happened, doesn't mean you should go running to buy the same exact set of numbers in the hopes of getting lucky. Each lottery picking is still independent of each other. So the probability of picking the correct set of numbers will remain the same for each drawing. Saying that one number has the chance to be drawn every specific number of games is succumbing to gambler's fallacy (mistaken belief that just because something happens more frequently than normal during some period, it will happen less frequently in the future). Odds represent the ratio that allow you to calculate how much money you will win on your bet in comparison to your stake. So your $10 ticket can become $23.67 if one number gets drawn. That is why you will notice that the odds keep increasing as you get more matches, meaning you get more money the more matches you get. I hope this answers your question, Edgard.      Edgard 11 months ago  Dear dezalyx, Thanks again, Regarding the same game 6/45: As the probability of one match is  0.42417, then Odds (1/Probability) will be 2.3678. According to probability theory and the law of large numbers, is it right to say, at least theoretically, that every 2.3678 games we should expect one match; in other words, one number has the chance to be drawn every 2.3678 games?  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Edgar. Just replace the numbers in the formula (from 55 to 45, 49 to 39) then solve for the answer to your question. [0.4241]  Edgard 11 months ago  ¿What would be the probability of one single ball to be part of the winner combination in a game where we have to pick a 6 number combination out of 45 numbers?.

The lowest number you can choose is 1 The highest number you can choose is 45 A given number can only be chosen once per try (per lottery ticket, etc.)  When you select your 1 st number, you have 45 numbers to choose from, and... ...a 1 in 45 chance of picking the right one. (Mathematically, 1 in 45 is represented by the numerical fraction 1 / 45 or 0.022222.)   When you select your 2 nd number, you have 44 numbers to choose from, and... ...a 1 in 44 chance of picking the right one. (Mathematically, 1 in 44 is represented by the numerical fraction 1 / 44 or 0.022727.)   When you select your 3 rd number, you have 43 numbers to choose from, and... ...a 1 in 43 chance of picking the right one.

When you select your 4 th number, you have 42 numbers to choose from, and... ...a 1 in 42 chance of picking the right one. (Mathematically, 1 in 42 is represented by the numerical fraction 1 / 42 or 0.023810.)   When you select your 5 th number, you have 41 numbers to choose from, and... ...a 1 in 41 chance of picking the right one. (Mathematically, 1 in 41 is represented by the numerical fraction 1 / 41 or 0.024390.)   When you select your 6 th number, you have 40 numbers to choose from, and... ...a 1 in 40 chance of picking the right one. (Mathematically, 1 in 40 is represented by the numerical fraction 1 / 40 or 0.025000.)   In order to win, you have to pick the first number right AND the second number right AND the third number right, etc.  In the language of statistics, AND usually means to multiply . So, to figure out your odds of winning, multiply together all of the fractional odds of picking a given number correctly, as stated by the red fractions above. 1 / 45 × 1 / 44 × 1 / 43 × 1 / 42 × 1 / 41 × 1 / 40 = 1 / 5864443200 So, at this point, your odds of winning are 1 in 5864443200.  But, since you can choose your winning numbers in any order, your chances of winning are somewhat better than this.  Your chance betters by the number of different ways that a sequence of 6 numbers can be written down, which for 6 numbers is 6! (6 factorial) or 720.  Divide 5864443200 by 720 to account for this, to get 8145060. In other words, there are 720 different ways that the 6 numbers you choose can be filled out on your lottery ticket--if you choose your 6 numbers correctly, any of these ways will make a winning ticket. That's it!  You have a 1 in 8,145,060 chance of winning the lottery you described. ( How do I pronounce this number?) Here are some other odds for the sake of comparison: You have about a 1 in 2,000,000 chance of being struck by lightning. A pregnant woman has a 1 in 705,000 chance of giving birth to quadruplets. Someone eating an oyster has a 1 in 12,000 chance of finding a pearl inside of it. Good luck!  And sorry to say that the only way to increase your chances of winning is to buy more tickets! Choosing birthdays, your age, addresses, years, phone numbers, etc. does not help at all!

The North American lottery record was set in January 2016 when a Munford, TN couple split the $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot with two other winners. The previous record belonged to Mega Millions when its March 2012 jackpot reached $656 million. Right now, the next drawing is at an estimated $700 million--and that number could continue to rise. Which lottery numbers turn up the most?

In 2008 an analyst poured through the statistics. His research is below. ------- BATON ROUGE, LA (WAFB) - Millions of people try their luck on big lottery games like Powerball every week. Often, we wonder what the odds actually are that you'll choose the winning combinations. Now, experts can analyze past numbers to see which ones are most likely to help you strike it rich. "It's a form of entertainment, an escape, a way to dream," says Kimberly Chopin with Louisiana Lottery. For some, the games are much more. Everyone seems to have their own set system, a way to win. "I think if you play the same numbers, it increases the odds," says Steve Johnson. He is someone retailers would call a "regular." Whether pumping gas, picking up a snack or some smokes, Johnson is guaranteed to take a chance. As freely as these numbers roll, so do the odds that someone's lucky numerals will pop up. "The odd ratio is pretty small - 1 out of 146 million. It's almost impossible to win," says Dr. Min Su Kim. Dr. Kim teaches statistics at Southern University. This self-proclaimed realist says with the chances of a win so slim, Powerball is not the way to go for him. "I learned statistics and probability, so I'm a rational person (laughter)." Johnson says he's laughing all the way to the bank. He recently won $500 back-to-back, one week after the other. The Powerball drawing consists of five white balls and one red Powerball. Dr. Kim went back 10 years and found the top 5 numbers that have won millions of dollars for thousands of people. Dr. Kim says the most frequently drawn Powerball number for the past 10 years is number 20. It is followed by 37, 2, 31, and 35. As for those white balls, the most popular is number 42. It is closely followed by 16, 35, 26, and 19. "If you pick these numbers, there's probably more probability to win the grand prize," Dr. Kim says. Kimberly Chopin of the Louisiana Lottery warns that just because some numbers have won big bucks in the past for others, that does not mean they're going to do the same for you. "Every number has a equal chance of being drawn. No number more likely to come up," she says. There are still those who believe otherwise. "It works. It worked for me. I'm playing on Lotto money now," Johnson says. As for Dr. Kim who is deeply rooted in his Asian traditions, shelling out some cash for tickets would have to follow a dream about pigs. "A pig represents good fortune," he says. Copyright 2008 WAFB. All rights reserved.

(April 2011)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Lottery mathematics is used to calculate probabilities in a lottery game.     Contents    1  Choosing 6 from 49  2  Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49  3  Pick8-32 odds and calculations  4  Powerballs And Bonus Balls  5  Minimum number of tickets for a match  6  References  7  External links     Choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  In a typical 6/49 game, each player chooses six non-duplicate numbers from a range of 1-49. If the six numbers on a ticket match the numbers drawn by the lottery, the ticket holder is a jackpot winner—regardless of the order of the numbers. The probability of this happening is 1 in 13,983,816.  The chance of winning can be demonstrated as follows : The first number drawn has a 1 in 49 chance of matching . When the draw comes to the second number, there are now only 48 balls left in the bag (because the balls already drawn are not returned to the bag) so there is now a 1 in 48 chance of predicting this number.  Thus for each of the 49 ways of choosing the first number there are 48 different ways of choosing the second. This means that the probability of correctly predicting 2 numbers drawn from 49 in the correct order is calculated as 1 in 49 × 48. On drawing the third number there are only 47 ways of choosing the number; but of course we could have arrived at this point in any of 49 × 48 ways, so the chances of correctly predicting 3 numbers drawn from 49, again in the correct order, is 1 in 49 × 48 × 47. This continues until the sixth number has been drawn, giving the final calculation, 49 × 48 × 47 × 46 × 45 × 44, which can also be written as        49  !    (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over (49-6)!}}   or 49 factorial divided by 43 factorial. This works out to 10,068,347,520, which is much bigger than the ~14 million stated above.  However; the order of the 6 numbers is not significant. That is, if a ticket has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, it wins as long as all the numbers 1 through 6 are drawn, no matter what order they come out in. Accordingly, given any set of 6 numbers, there are 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ! or 720 orders in which they could be drawn. Dividing 10,068,347,520 by 720 gives 13,983,816, also written as        49  !    6  !  ∗  (  49  −  6  )  !       {\displaystyle {49! \over 6!*(49-6)!}}   , or more generally as          (    n  k    )     =     n  !    k  !  (  n  −  k  )  !       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={n! \over k!(n-k)!}}   , where n is the number of alternatives and k is the number of choices.   This function is called the combination function; in Microsoft Excel , this function is implemented as COMBIN( n , k ). For example, COMBIN(49, 6) (the calculation shown above), would return 13,983,816. For the rest of this article, we will use the notation        (    n  k    )       {\displaystyle {n \choose k}}   . "Combination" means the group of numbers selected, irrespective of the order in which they are drawn.  An alternative method of calculating the odds is to note that the probability of the first ball corresponding to one of the six chosen is 6/49; the probability of the second ball corresponding to one of the remaining five chosen is 5/48; and so on. This yields a final formula of          (    n  k    )     =     (    49  6    )     =    49  6    ∗    48  5    ∗    47  4    ∗    46  3    ∗    45  2    ∗    44  1      {\displaystyle {n \choose k}={49 \choose 6}={49 \over 6}*{48 \over 5}*{47 \over 4}*{46 \over 3}*{45 \over 2}*{44 \over 1}}     The range of possible combinations for a given lottery can be referred to as the "number space". "Coverage" is the percentage of a lottery's number space that is in play for a given drawing.  Odds of getting other possibilities in choosing 6 from 49 [ edit ]  One must divide the number of combinations producing the given result by the total number of possible combinations (for example,        (    49  6    )     =  13  ,  983  ,  816    {\displaystyle {49 \choose 6}=13,983,816}   ). The numerator equates to the number of ways to select the winning numbers multiplied by the number of ways to select the losing numbers.  For a score of n (for example, if 3 choices match three of the 6 balls drawn, then n = 3),        (    6  n    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}}   describes the odds of selecting n winning numbers from the 6 winning numbers. This means that there are 6 - n losing numbers, which are chosen from the 43 losing numbers in        (    43   6  −  n     )       {\displaystyle {43 \choose 6-n}}   ways. The total number of combinations giving that result is, as stated above, the first number multiplied by the second. The expression is therefore         (    6  n    )        (    43   6  −  n     )         (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose n}{43 \choose 6-n} \over {49 \choose 6}}   .  This can be written in a general form for all lotteries as:         (    K  B    )        (     N  −  K    K  −  B     )         (    N  K    )       {\displaystyle {K \choose B}{N-K \choose K-B} \over {N \choose K}}   , where     N    {\displaystyle N}   is the number of balls in lottery,     K    {\displaystyle K}   is the number of balls in a single ticket, and     B    {\displaystyle B}   is the number of matching balls for a winning ticket.  The generalisation of this formula is called the hypergeometric distribution .

The odds of a play ticket matching all 8 numbers is simple to calculate and is illustrated by the following math.         8  32    ∗    7  32    ∗    6  32    ∗    5  32    ∗    4  32    ∗    3  32    ∗    2  32    ∗    1  32    =    40320  1099511627776      {\displaystyle {8 \over 32}*{7 \over 32}*{6 \over 32}*{5 \over 32}*{4 \over 32}*{3 \over 32}*{2 \over 32}*{1 \over 32}={40320 \over 1099511627776}}     Which means there is a 1 in 27,269,633 chance of matching all 8 numbers. The Trillion Coins lottery is a pay-out-on-every-drawing lotto game. The odds are dependent on the total number of tickets that are played. The player who matches the most of the picked numbers wins.  Powerballs And Bonus Balls [ edit ]  Many lotteries have a powerball (or "bonus ball"). If the powerball is drawn from a pool of numbers different from the main lottery, the odds are multiplied by the number of powerballs. For example, in the 6 from 49 lottery, given 10 powerball numbers, then the odds of getting a score of 3 and the powerball would be 1 in 56.66 × 10, or 566.6 (the probability would be divided by 10, to give an exact value of 8815/4994220). Another example of such a game is Mega Millions , albeit with different jackpot odds.  Where more than 1 powerball is drawn from a separate pool of balls to the main lottery (for example, in the EuroMillions game), the odds of the different possible powerball matching scores are calculated using the method shown in the " other scores " section above (in other words, the powerballs are like a mini-lottery in their own right), and then multiplied by the odds of achieving the required main-lottery score.  If the powerball is drawn from the same pool of numbers as the main lottery, then, for a given target score, the number of winning combinations includes the powerball. For games based on the Canadian lottery (such as the lottery of the United Kingdom ), after the 6 main balls are drawn, an extra ball is drawn from the same pool of balls, and this becomes the powerball (or "bonus ball"). An extra prize is given for matching 5 balls and the bonus ball. As described in the " other scores " section above, the number of ways one can obtain a score of 5 from a single ticket is        (    6  5    )        (    43  1    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 5}{43 \choose 1}}   or 258. Since the number of remaining balls is 43, and the ticket has 1 unmatched number remaining, 1/43 of these 258 combinations will match the next ball drawn (the powerball), leaving 258/43 = 6 ways of achieving it. Therefore, the odds of getting a score of 5 and the powerball are       6       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {6} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1 in 2,330,636.  Of the 258 combinations that match 5 of the main 6 balls, in 42/43 of them the remaining number will not match the powerball, giving odds of       258  ⋅     42    43          (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {258\cdot {{42} \over {43}}} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 3/166,474 (approximately 55,491.33) for obtaining a score of 5 without matching the powerball.  Using the same principle, the odds of getting a score of 2 and the powerball are        (    6  2    )        (    43  4    )       {\displaystyle {6 \choose 2}{43 \choose 4}}   = 1,851,150 for the score of 2 multiplied by the probability of one of the remaining four numbers matching the bonus ball, which is 4/43. Since 1,851,150 × (4/43) = 172,200, the probability of obtaining the score of 2 and the bonus ball is       172  ,  200       (    49  6    )       {\displaystyle {172,200} \over {49 \choose 6}}   = 1025/83237. This gives approximate decimal odds of 1 in 81.2.

In the 5-from-90 lotto, the minimum number of tickets that can guarantee a ticket with at least 2 matches is 100. [3]  References [ edit ]     ^  Zabrocki, Mike (2003-03-01).

Of course, there's no perfect method for choosing winning lottery numbers, but there are several ways that you can do it. You can take a scientific or mathematical approach, gamble and choose randomly, follow your gut. Experiment with a few different ways. You never know. You might get lucky.         Steps    Method  1   Choosing Frequently Picked Numbers           1   Look up the frequency chart for previous lottery draws. Most state lottery programs offer charts showing how often each number has been drawn during a given time frame. For instance, it shows how often the number 1 was chosen as a Powerball number between 1997 and 2015. You can view a Powerball frequency chart via the Iowa State Lottery. here ). [1]   If you can look up the all-time frequencies, that's the best possible data set for you to analyze. It’s more comprehensive, and you should base your numbers on as large a time frame as possible.  There's no clear way to know if you should be looking up frequent winning numbers or numbers that come up less frequently. Look up both types of numbers and play sequences with a combo of both if you wish.  However, winning numbers that come up more frequently are likely to remain frequent winners. If you play a number that doesn't come up as frequently, then you simply may need to wait a while to see if it comes up when its "due" to win.  Make sure you're looking up the right frequency chart for the lottery game you plan to play. For instance, Powerball stats will differ from Mega Millions stats.            2   Choose your numbers based on the frequency chart. Review the numbers that are the most frequently chosen and the least frequently chosen. Review the odds for those as well as the numbers in between. [2] After you've looked over the odds, you have two options:  Select numbers that are drawn frequently. If you notice that a few numbers stand out for being drawn significantly more often than the others, consider including them in your pick. Be aware, though, that several other people will be trying this tactic; if you win with frequently picked numbers, you might be at a greater risk of having to share the prize with other winners.  Select numbers that are drawn less frequently. Choosing numbers that aren't picked very often might seem counterintuitive, but consider this: If everyone else is busy picking frequently drawn numbers and you win with your “long-shot” picks, you might not have to share the prize with as many other winners.           3   Acknowledge that each number still has an equal chance of being drawn. Looking at frequency charts might show you which numbers tend to be drawn, but keep in mind that when the actual lottery drawing comes around, each number still has an absolutely equal chance of being picked. It’s all in the luck of the draw. [3]               Score 0 / 0    Method 1 Quiz  Why should you pick numbers that are drawn less frequently?     Because you won't have to share the prize with as many people if you win.  Yes! Numbers that are drawn less frequently are also picked less frequently by players. Therefore, if you do win, you'll share the prize with less people. Read on for another quiz question.    Because they are due to hit soon.  Not exactly! Remember that each number has an equal chance to be drawn. Picking numbers that are not drawn frequently does not mean that they will come up sooner. Click on another answer to find the right one...    Because they yield a higher jackpot.  Nope! The jackpot is the same no matter which numbers you pick. Picking numbers that are drawn infrequently will not increase your winnings. Click on another answer to find the right one...              Method  2   Using the Delta System          1   Learn the Delta System. The Delta Lotto method is way to choose lottery numbers based on a statistical study of numbers that are next to each other. This information has been related back to winning lottery numbers, which has formed the basis for this method. In other words, the delta method is based on research, but keep in mind there’s no guarantee you’re going to win if you choose your numbers this way. [4]          2   Choose a very low number. The number should be between 1 and 5. For instance, the number 1 is a good number to choose because often, more than 60% of the time, the number 1 is part of the winning delta numbers included in the series. However, feel free to choose another low number that you feel good about such as 3 or 5 There is no exact science. Example: 1         3   Pick two numbers between 1 and 8. There are a number of combinations that you could choose from. For instance, you could choose 3 and 5. Or, 2 and 6 could be an option. You could also choose two consecutive numbers like 7 and 8. Example: 3 and 5 Sequence: 1-3-5         4   Pick a number very close to 8. It can be above the number 8 , such as the number 9. Or, it can be below, for instance, 7. For the fourth number, pick something pretty close to 8 ,either above or below it. Example:9 Sequence 1-3-5-9         5   Pick two numbers between 8 and 15. Choose two numbers a few numbers away from each other such as 11 and 13. Another option could be 14 and 9 or 10 and 14. Choose the numbers randomly or choose your favorite numbers between the given range. The smaller number doesn’t have to be listed first. Example: 11 and 13 Sequence: 1-3-5-9-11-13.         6   Write down your delta numbers. Once you have selected 6 numbers in the method described, you have created a six-digit lottery number sequence. Write it down in the order that you selected them. In our example, the numbers are 1-3-5-9-11-13         7   Add up the numbers. Make sure the sum of the numbers is not greater than the highest number allowed in the game you’re playing. For instance, if the highest lottery number you can play is 56, then our numbers are within the range because the total sum equals 42. 1 +3+5+9+11+13 = 42  If your is within about about 15 from the total but not greater than the total, then you have selected some good numbers.  If you need to select different numbers so that you sum is not greater than the highest lottery number, then do so.  It’s okay if numbers repeat themselves where applicable. For instance, you’re number close to 8 could be the number 9, and you could also select 9 for your number between 8 and 15. If you need to do this to make sure that your sum total is not greater, that is fine. Remember numbers sometimes repeat in winning lottery numbers.           8   Rearrange the delta numbers. Delta numbers aren’t usually in sequential order. So, change the numbers around a bit. Put the first number last and the last number first. Put the numbers in the middle at the end or beginning. Rearrange them so that they are in a different order. For example, our numbers rearranged could be 1-3-5-9-11-13 or it could be 5-3-11-9-1-13. There are a number of different variations that you could have. [5]          9   Write down the final delta number. For now, our delta series is 5-3-11-9-1-13. This is not your final lottery number. You will use these numbers to create your lottery number sequence.         10   Write down the first lottery number. The first delta number of the series becomes the first lottery number of your lottery sequence. It remains unchanged. However, the remainder of the numbers will be added together to create the lottery numbers. For example:, the first lottery number is 5. Example: 5         11   Add the first lottery number and the second delta number together. (5 +3 =8) This sum of these two become your second lottery number, the number 4. Repeat this for the rest of the delta numbers. Adding the sum of the numbers next to each other is how you create each number in the series to create your final lottery number sequence. If our delta numbers are 5-3-11-9-1-13, then our lottery numbers are created in the following way:  The first lottery number is 5. Example: 5-  The second lottery number is created by adding the first lottery number to the second delta number. For our example, we get 8 as the sum of 5 and 3. The number 8 is our second lottery number. For example, the number ares 5,8 so far. Example: 5-8-  Add the second lottery number to the third delta number. For example, the number 8 is our second lottery number. Our third delta number is 11. For instance, the number 8 plus 11 equals 19. ( 8+11 =19) So, nineteen is our third lottery number. For example, the lottery numbers are 5,8,19 so far. Example: 5-8-19-  Add the third lottery number and the fourth delta number. In our case, 19 is our third lottery number and 9 is our fourth delta number. For instance, 19 plus 9 equals 28. (19+9 = 28) Twenty-eight is our fourth lottery number. The numbers are 5,8,19 and 28 thus far. Example 5-8-19-28-  Add the fourth lottery number and the fifth delta number. For our example, 28 is our fourth lottery number and 1 is our fifth delta number. Twenty-eight plus 1 equals 29. (28 +1 = 29) So, Twenty-nine is our fifth lottery number. Thus far, the numbers are 5,8,19, 28 and 29. Example: 5-8-19-28-29-  Add the fifth lottery number and the sixth delta number. In this case, 29 is our fifth lottery number and 13 is our sixth delta number. 29 + 13 =42 . Forty-two is our sixth lottery number. The lottery numbers are 5,8,19,28,29 and 42 so far. Example: 5-8-19-28-29-42  Our final lottery numbers are 5-8-19-28-29-42. Now, your numbers are ready to play. Repeat the process again to create another delta number.           Score 0 / 0    Method 2 Quiz  When using the delta system, the first number you pick should fit what parameters?     It should be between 8 and 15.  Not exactly! You pick 2 numbers between 8 and 15 to complete the fifth and sixth numbers in your delta series. However, this is not how you select the first number. Try another answer...    It should be very close to 8.  Not quite! This is how you select the fourth, not the first, number in your delta series. Guess again!    It should be between 1 and 8.  Nope! This is how you choose the second 2 numbers in your delta series. You select the first in a different way. Try again...    It should be a very low number.  Nice! The number 1 is a good choice because it is 1 of the winning numbers (when using the delta system) more than 60 percent of time. Read on for another quiz question.              Method  3   Choosing Lucky Numbers          1   Choose numbers that are significant to you. If you believe in lucky numbers, they're probably digits that center around important dates or events in your life. Mix the numbers of significant numbers together. For instance, you might use your grandfather’s birthday month and year,10/1929 and your mother’s birth month and day, 3/21. Together you might come up with something like 10-19-3-21-29. Other examples of significant numbers might include::  Birthdays: Yours, your children's, your spouse's, and so on.  Anniversaries: This could be a wedding anniversary date, or the date of another significant event.  Ages: Using your age or the ages of your loved ones is also a common practice.  Addresses: The address of your childhood or current home is another tactic you can try.  Phone numbers: Try breaking down your phone number into a sequence of single- or double-digit lotto numbers.           2   Choose numbers you consider lucky. Some folks have a lucky number they use for everything. It isn't connected a birthday or anything like that, they just like the number. If this is the case for you, add your lucky number to your lottery number. You never know. You might get lucky!  If you're playing a lottery game such as Powerball, consider making your lucky number the Powerball pick.  Also if you’re lucky numbers are 7 and 11 lucky, keep in mind that those are really common lottery picks. If you win with these numbers on your ticket, you might end up sharing the prize with a lot of people.           3   Choose a lucky number and stick with it. Some people choose a number sequence that they consider lucky and play it over and over again until it comes up a winner -- if it ever does. For instance, if you’re favorite number sequence is your favorite number, combined with your birthday and your spouse’s lucky number and birthday (3-6-11-9-10-31), then you would play this number religiously every time you play the lottery. Then, you wait for your number to come up a winner. This could be considered making your own luck.         Score 0 / 0    Method 3 Quiz  What significant numbers can you use to play the lottery?     Birthdays  Try again! You can absolutely choose birthdays to play the lottery. Try yours, your children's, and your spouse's. But keep in mind that there are other significant numbers you can use to play the lottery. Pick another answer!    Anniversaries  You're partially right! Anniversaries are popular lucky numbers to play in the lottery. You can use a wedding anniversary or other significant event. But remember that there are other significant numbers you can use to play the lottery. Try another answer...    Addresses  Close! The address for your current or childhood home might be lucky to play in the lottery. You could include the zip code if you need more numbers. Still, there are other significant numbers you can use to play the lottery. There’s a better option out there!    Phone numbers  Almost! Break important phone numbers into single- and double-digit numbers to make your picks! However, there are other significant numbers you can use to play the lottery. There’s a better option out there!    All of the above  Correct! When choosing lucky numbers, birthdays, anniversaries, addresses, and phone numbers are all great options. Get creative, and go with your gut! Read on for another quiz question.              Method  4   Using Random Numbers          1   Find a random number generator.  Random.org has a number generator specifically designed for lottery picks. The advantage of using random draws is that winning lottery numbers are chosen randomly as well. So, it might be a lucky draw.  Choose how many tickets you want. Then, choose the country or state in which you’re playing.  Choose the lottery game that you’re playing such as Powerball, Nebraska-Pick 5, etc. You are able to choose specific games for each state.  Choose how many numbers are available in the draw. For instance, a five sequence number such as 5-10-14-2-6-7. Or, is it a six sequence number like 11-5-3-9-15-24.  Chose the highest number in the sequence. For instance, if any number up to 59 is available to play, the sequence 6-59-30-15-5 is a viable lottery number. The number 60-3-67-3-10-5-1 is not.Then, click pick tickets. The settings and the site will calculate a number for you. [6]            2   Use a random number generator for single numbers. If you still want to have a little control over your numbers, you could use a random number generator to choose individual numbers. For instance, you could choose the parameters such as a number between 1 and 30. Then, let the random number choose. Do that for each number.  You also could follow the steps of the delta method except instead of picking the numbers yourself, you could allow the random number generator to do it. You simply set the parameters for each step of the process. [7]            3   Use "lotto pick" computer generated numbers. Allow the lottery to choose randomly for you. You can request random picks when you purchase your lottery ticket. When the attendant asked you for the numbers, tell him or her that you want the system to choose the numbers for you. With the click of a few buttons, you’ll have your lottery numbers. If you're buying several tickets at one time, this is probably the way to go.         Score 0 / 0    Method 4 Quiz  What information do you need to input into a random number generator?     The jackpot amount.  Nope! The random number generator does not need to know the jackpot amount for the game you're playing. It selects numbers based on the type of game, how many numbers you can select, and the highest number available to play. Guess again!    Which lottery game you are playing.  Absolutely! Examples include Powerball or Pick 3, although the games may vary depending on your state. The random number generator needs this information so it can set parameters such as how many numbers you need to select and what numbers are available for selection. Read on for another quiz question.    The lowest number possible to play.  Not quite! The lowest possible number will always be 1. Instead, you will need to enter the highest number available to play. Click on another answer to find the right one...    The most frequently drawn numbers.  Not exactly! The random number generator does not take frequently drawn number into account. You do not need to enter this information. Choose another answer!

No two balls can have the same number, so the interval $1\ldots 100$ is represented by the balls.  I now pick 20 balls at random, one by one without putting them back at any point. I am trying to find the probably of getting 4 certain numbers. The sequence of these 4 numbers does not matter.  Here is my solution: The first time I pick up a ball the probably is $1/100$. The next time it is $1/99$, etc.. So the total probably of getting the four desired numbers is $1/(100\cdot 99\cdot 98\cdot 97)$.  Is this correct?    probability  probability-theory     share | cite | improve this question     asked Jan 20 '14 at 18:43       BillyJean   185 3 13              add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  4  down vote  accepted      You have computed the probability that you get your target numbers, in the first $4$ choices, in a certain specified order. That is much smaller than the required probability.  There are $\binom{100}{20}$ equally likely ways to choose $20$ balls.  We find the number of ways to choose $20$ balls that include our $4$ target balls. So we must choose $16$ balls from the remaining $96$ to keep our $4$ target balls company. This can be done in $\binom{96}{16}$ ways.  Thus the required probability is $\dfrac{\binom{96}{16}}{\binom{100}{20}}$. This expression can be greatly simplified.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jan 20 '14 at 18:53       André Nicolas   442k 35 401 779                  Thanks, but the probablity of picking the $4$ does not enter in the equation? – BillyJean  Jan 20 '14 at 19:01            Well, on top we could write $\binom{4}{4}\binom{96}{16}$ instead of $\binom{96}{6}$, and maybe I should have, but since $\binom{4}{4}=1$ it makes no difference. – André Nicolas  Jan 20 '14 at 19:03            But the balls are not supposed to be returned. Is $\binom{100}{20}$ correct? – Spock  Jan 20 '14 at 19:07        1      Yes. It is the number of ways of choosing a "hand" of $20$ cards from a collection of $100$ distinct cards. – André Nicolas  Jan 20 '14 at 19:10        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      Your solution is not correct.  But, here's a hint on a different way to proceed:  Hint: You want to count all permutations (of length $20$) of distinct elements in $\{1,2,\ldots,100\}$, such that four fixed numbers (say $1,2,3,4$) are all contained in the permutation.  To do this: pick the $16$ numbers OTHER than the ones you are interested in which will be included; then, pick ANY arrangement of the set of $20$ numbers consisting of the four you want and the new sixteen.  This is the total number of sequences with the desired property; divide by the total number of sequences to get the desired result.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Jan 20 '14 at 18:48       Nick Peterson   24.8k 2 34 55                  But I get to pick 20 balls, how does that information enter? – BillyJean  Jan 20 '14 at 18:49            Whoops, sorry; I missed that detail.

How to find the probability of matching 4 out of 5 numbers from a lottery with number 1 to 45  There are 5 numbers that match the winning set and 40 which don't

P(matching exactly 4 and mismatching 1)

The number of ways to choose the 4 matching ones is C(5,4) 

For each of those C(5,4) ways to choose the 4 matching ones,
there are C(40,1) ways of choosing the nonmatching one.

So there are C(5,4)*C(40,1) ways to choose exactly 4 matching ones
and exactly one non-matching one.

There are C(45,5) ways of choosing ANY 5

So the probability is

 C(5,4)*C(40,1)       5*40        200
---------------- = --------- = --------- = .0001636984053
    C(45,5)         1221759     1221759


Not too likely.  Studying math teaches you that gambling 
without using skill to put the probability of winning in 
your favor is never wise.

Edwin                              Permutations and
Combinations  Many problems in probability can be phrased in the
language of "how many ways can we pick r objects out of a group of N objects."
We now calculate the answer to this question.  If the order of the r objects is important, than
the "number of ways to pick r objects out of a group of N objects" is called:
the number of permutations of N objects taken r at a time, and denoted
by the symbol N P r .
What is the numerical value of N P r ?
For the 1st choice we can choose any one of N objects. For the 2nd choice
we can choose any one of the remaining N-1 objects. For the 3rd choice
we can choose any one of the remaining N-2 objects, and so on down until
for the rth choice we can pick any one of the remaining N-r+1 objects.
We therefore find  N P r = N x (N-1) x (N-2) x .... x (N-r+1)  Note that in this counting, the order in which
objects are picked is important. Assume the original objects are numbered
1, 2, 3, ..., N, and we are picking any three. In computing N P r the sequence 5, 3, 7, is counted separately from the sequence 3, 5, 7,
which is counted separately from the sequence 3, 7, 5, which is counted
separately from the sequence 5, 7, 3, and so on.  Often we do not wish to distinguish between sequences
which have the same objects in them, but in which the objects are ordered
differently. If the ordering is not important, then the number of unique
ways to pick r objects out of a group of N objects is called: the number
of combinations of N objects taken r at a time, and is denoted by
the symbol N C r ,
or also by the symbol . To
compute the numerical value of N C r ,
note that it is just equal to the number of permutations N P r divided by the number of ways to order the r objects chosen. To order the
r numbers chosen, we have r choices for the 1st object, r-1 choices for
the 2nd object, r-2 choices for the 3rd object, and so on down until there
is only 1 choice left for the last rth object. What we have described is
just the number of permutations of r objects taken r at a time, and is
equal to  r P r = r x (r-1) x (r-2) x ... x 2 x 1  This combination occurs so often, that it is given
a special name and times  r P r = r x (r-1) x (r-2) x ... x 2 x 1 = r!  and called "r factorial ". For example, 2!
= 2 x 1 = 1, 3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6,  4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24, and so on. We define 1!
= 1 and also 0! = 1.  Thus we conclude that the number of combinations
of N objects taken r at a time is  N C r = =  Now note that we can use the definition of N P r and
factorial to write  N P r x
(N-r)! = [N x (N-1) x .... x (N-r+1)] x [r x (r-1) x ... x 2 x 1] = N!  or equivalently, N P r =
N!/(N-r)!. We can then write N C r as,  N C r = =  Note from this result that = since N-(N-r) = r. This
result follows intuitively by noting that when we choose r objects from
a group of N objects, we leave N-r objects behind. If we regard these N-r
objects left behind as the "chosen" objects, we see that the number of
combinations of N objects taken r at a time is exactly equal to the number
of combinations of N objects taken N-r at a time.  To see how to use combinations in the context of
probability problems, consider the example we did earlier. If we flip four
coins, how many of the possible outcomes will have exactly two heads?  From the four coins, we want to choose two of them
to be heads - the remaining two must therefore be tails. The number of
ways to choose two heads for four coins is just:   Thus there are six outcomes with exactly two heads.
This is the same answer we found earlier.  More generally, if one flips N coins, the number
of possible outcomes with exactly r heads will be, N C r = = .
Since the number of all possible outcomes in N flips is 2 N ,
we have that the probability to flip exactly r heads in N flips is N C r /2 N .    Another example : If we roll four dice, how
many outcomes will have at least one "6" on top?  The possibilities consistent with at least one "6"
are: one "6", two "6"s, three "6"s, or four "6"s.  The number of ways to choose one "6" from four dice
is:   The remaining three dice can each land in one of
five possible ways, so the total number of outcomes with exactly one "6"
is 4x 5x 5x 5 = 500.  The number of ways to choose two "6"s from four dice
is:  The remaining two dice can each land in one of five
possible ways, so the total number of outcomes with exactly two "6"s is
6x 5x 5 = 150.  The number of ways to choose three "6"s from four
dice is:  The remaining one die can each land in one of five
possible ways, so the total number of outcomes with exactly three "6"s
is 4x 5 = 20.  The number of ways to choose four "6"s from four
dice is:   There are no remaining dice. So the total number
of outcomes with exactly four "6"s is 1.  Adding all together, there are 500 + 150 + 20 + 1
= 671 possible outcomes with at least one "6" showing. Since the number
of all possible outcomes is 6 4 = 1296, the probability
to role at least one 6 is then 671/1296.  This is the same answer that we found earlier by
the indirect method:  (prob at least one 6) = 1 - (prob no 6) = 1 - (5/6) 4 =
1 - (625/1296) = 671/1296.  Example from Text  5) Six balls numbered 1,2,3,4,5,6 are in a jar. Two
are chosen at random.  a) How many possible outcomes are there if the order
of the picking does not matter?  This is just the number of ways to choose 2 balls
from 6, where order does not matter, or 6 C 2 =  b) Think of the choice of the two balls as if it
were a lottery. Before the selection of the two balls, you independently
guessed two different numbers from 1 to 6.  i) What is the probability that you guessed both
balls correctly?  Of the 15 possible outcomes of the lottery, there
is only one which matches the two numbers you have guessed, so the probability
to have guessed both correctly is just 1/15.  ii) What is the probability that you guessed one
of the balls correctly but not the other?  We will solve this two ways. To help us think about
this, let us suppose that you have guessed the numbers #1 and #4.  Method one: Of the 15 possible outcomes of the lottery,
the number of outcomes which include the #1 but not the #4 is 4, since
one of the balls must be #1, and the second can be either #2, #3, #5, or
#6 (i.e. it may not be #4). Similarly, the number of outcomes which include
the #4 but not the #1 is also 4, since one ball must be #4, and the second
can be #2, #3, #5, or #6 (i.e. it may not be #1). So the total number of
outcomes in which one ball has been guessed correctly but not the other
is 4 + 4 = 8.  The total number of outcomes is 15, so the probability
to guess only one ball correctly is 8/15.  Method two: Again assuming that we have guessed #1
and #4, then the probability that the first ball picked in the lottery
is either #1 or #4 is 2/6; the probability that the second ball picked
will not be one we have guessed is then 4/5, since only 4 of the remaining
5 balls are different from the number we guessed. So the probability that
we guess the first ball correctly but not the second is (2/6)x(4/5)=4/15.
But we also have to consider the case where it is the second ball that
we guess correctly but not the first. The probability that the first ball
is different from either number we have guessed is 4/6; the probability
that the second ball is then equal to one of the numbers we have guessed
is then 2/5, since 2 of the remaining 5 balls agree with the numbers we
have guessed. So the probability that we guess correctly the second ball
but not the first is (4/6) x (2/5)=4/15. So the
probability that we guess only one ball correctly but not the other, is
the sum of the probability that we guessed the first but not the second,
plus the probability that we guessed the second but not the first, i.e.  (4/15) + (4/15) = 8/15.  iii) What is the probability that we have guessed
neither ball correctly?  The number of outcomes of the lottery that will have
no number in common with the two numbers we have guessed is just .  That is, the balls chosen in the lottery must be
any two from the four balls which are not the ones we guessed. The
number of ways to do this is just 4 C 2 .
So the probability to guess neither ball correctly is 6/15.  c) You can check that the probabilities of (i), (ii),
and (iii) in part (b) add up to unity, since these three cases cover all
possible outcomes.  1/15 + 8/15 + 6/15 = 15/15 = 1  Example This problem is just like the last,
but with the numbers adjusted to reflect a situation closer to a real state
lottery.  A jar is filled with 40 numbered balls, each with
a different number between 1 and 40. Six balls are randomly drawn out of
the jar, as in the lottery, i.e. we do not care about the order in which
the balls are drawn.  a) How many possible outcomes for the chosen 6 numbers
are there?  This is asking how many ways can we choose 6 balls
out of 40, with the order of selection being ignored. The answer is given
in terms of combinations:  40 C 6 = = N  b) If you win the lottery by guessing all the six
numbers which are randomly drawn, how likely is it that you will win with
one ticket?  If we guess 6 numbers on our lottery ticket, there
is only one of the N possible outcomes of the lottery that will match all
our 6 numbers. The probability this happens is therefore:   c) If a million people play, all choosing their numbers independently of one another, how likely is it that at least one person will win the
lottery?  The (prob at least one wins) = 1 - (prob no
one wins) ,  since these are mutually exclusive outcomes that
cover all possibilities, i.e. either no one wins, or at least one person
wins.  The probability that one person loses the lottery
in one play is, 1-p, i.e. one minus the probability to win. The probability
two people lose in two independent plays is therefore (1-p)x(1-p)=(1-p) 2 .
This is by our basic rule #2: the probability that two independent events
occur is the product of their probabilities. The probability that three
people lose in three independent plays is therefore (1-p)x(1-p)x(1-p)=(1-p) 3 ,
and so on, so that the probability that one million people all lose in
one million plays is: (1-p) 1,000,000 . So
the probability that at least one person wins in one million plays is:  1 - (1-p) 1,000,000 = 1 - (1 - 0.00000026) 1,000,000 = 1 - 0.77
= 0.23  So there is a 23% chance that some one will win.  Note that this is a different answer from the one
we would get if all million players coordinated their plays so that no
two people chose the same set of six numbers. Then, since each play is
a mutually exclusive outcome from all the other plays, the probability
that at least one person wins is the sum of probabilities that any one
choice of numbers wins, i.e. 1,000,000xp = 0.26. This is slightly larger
than what we found if all players chose their numbers independently. The
difference is because when the players choose numbers independently, there
is always some chance that two players will choose exactly the same set
of 6 numbers. By coordinating their efforts to choose different sets of
numbers, the million players can be sure to cover more possible outcomes.  d) If you get a lesser prize for choosing 5 of the
6 numbers correctly, what is your probability of winning?  Suppose you pick your 6 numbers on your lottery ticket.
Let's compute the number of possible outcomes of the lottery that will
have 5 numbers agreeing with numbers you chose, but with one number disagreeing.  Suppose that it is your first 5 numbers that agree
and it is the last 6th number that disagrees. The number of outcomes consistent
with this is just the number of ways the lottery can choose a ball that
does not match this last 6th number - this is 34, because it can only be
one of the 34 numbers you did not guess. Now suppose that it is
your last 5 numbers that agree and it is the first number that disagrees.
Again, the number of outcomes consistent with this is 34. Similarly, it
might be the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th of your numbers which is the one that
disagrees with the lottery result. In each case there are 34 outcomes of
the lottery which will agree with your five other numbers. So the total
number of lottery outcomes which will give you five and only five numbers
guessed correctly is:  34x6=204  where 34 is the number outcomes that match a particular
group of 5 out of your 6 numbers, and 6 is the number of ways to choose
the number which is not guessed correctly. The probability to guess exactly
5 numbers correctly is therefore  q =  The probability to win the lottery by guessing at
least 5 numbers, i.e. by guessing either only 5 or by guessing all 6 is
therefore,  q + p = 0.00005326    Let us find q by a second method. Imagine looking
at your lottery card with your 6 guessed numbers, as the lottery balls
are being drawn. The probability that the 1st ball drawn is one of your
numbers is 6/40. The probability the 2nd ball drawn is one of your remaining
5 numbers is 5/39, since only 39 balls are left. The probability that the
3rd ball drawn is one of your remaining 4 numbers is 4/38, and so on. So
the probability that the first 5 balls selected in the lottery agree with
5 of your numbers, but the 6th does not is:   where the last factor is 34/35 because if the last
ball is not one of your 6 numbers, it must be one of the 34 other numbers,
and there are now only 35 balls left to choose from.  This does not cover all the possibilities however.
It may be that the first ball drawn in the lottery is the one that does
not agree with any of your numbers, but the next 5 balls drawn will. The
probability for this to happen is:   Or it may be that the second ball drawn in the lottery
is the one that does not agree with any of your numbers, but the first
and the last four balls drawn do. The probability for this to happen is:   You can check, by multiplying the numerators and
denominators together, that all three terms above give exactly the same
value:  =  Similarly, you can check that if it is the 3rd ball,
or the 4th ball, or the 5th ball drawn in the lottery that is the one that
does not agree with any of our guessed numbers, the probability is again
34/N.  Since there are 6 ways to choose which ball drawn
in the lottery will not agree with any of your guessed numbers, and the
probability in each case is 34/N, the total probability that you guess
exactly 5 numbers correctly is 6x34/N = 204/3,838,380, which is the same
answer as we got by the first method.    e) Suppose it costs $1 to pay the lottery, and you
play each week for the nest 40 years for a total of 2000 times. Assume
that if you have at least 5 of the 6 numbers drawn in any given lottery
you will win more than the $2000 it will cost to play these games. What
is the probability that you come out winning more than you have spent?  This is the probability to win at least once in 2000
plays, where by "win" we mean to guess 5 or more numbers correctly. This
is similar to the question in part (c).  (prob to win at least once) = 1 - (prob never win)  The probability not to win in one play is 1-(p+q)  The probability not to win in two plays is [1-(p+q)] 2  The probability not to win in 2000 plays is [1-(p+q)] 2000  So the probability to win at least once is  1-[1-(p+q)] 2000 =
1-[1-0.00005326] 2000 = 1-0.99994674 2000 = 1-0.899 = 0.101  So you have only a 10% chance to win in 2000 plays.
This is larger than you may have thought, but still very few people would
bet $2000 with only a 10% chance to win.               Section 3.4  Combinatorics and 
      Probability              This section pulls together many of the ideas 
      we have seen from the last several sections. It is all about finding the 
      probabilities of events that are a little more complex than we've seen. 
      But, the terminology and notation is still the same. Let's look at an 
      example from a few sections ago to review the concepts.   Example:  Find the probability of getting exactly two boys in a 
      family with three children.  First, we need to find the sample space :  S = { BBB, BBG, BGB, GBB, BGG, GBG, GGB, 
      GGG }  These are all the different ways to have boys and girls in a family 
      with three children.  Second, find all the events that satisfy what we're looking for. 
      In this case, exactly two boys.  E = { BBG, BGB, GBB }  The probability of the event happening is given by:  p( E ) = n (events that satisfy the desired 
      condition) ÷ n (sample space)  Therefore, we have:  p(exactly two boys) = 3 ÷ 8 = 0.375  or a 37.5% of having exactly two boys.   Notice that the probability of not getting exactly two boys is 5 
      ÷ 8 = 0.625.   This is the compliment of the probability 
      that we just found.   Subtracting this from 1 will give the same 
      probability that we found in our example.  This gives us another 
      method to calculate probabilities when the number of elements in the 
      compliment is easier to find than the set itself:        Compliment Formulas  p( E ) = 1–p( E' )  and  p( E' ) = 
        1–p( E )  In the above example, finding the number of elements in the sample 
      space and the number of elements in the set that satisfied our conditions 
      was relatively easy.  But, suppose we wanted to find the probability 
      of having at least one boy in a family of 12 children.  I wouldn't 
      want to write down the sample space. ( How big is the sample 
      space? ).  In order to count these types of sets, we'll need to 
      use the three techniques developed earlier:  Fundamental Principle of Counting: (# of choices 
        of first item) × (# of choices for second item) Permutations (Order is important):   nPr Combinations (Order is not important):  nCr  To answer the above question about how big the sample space is for a 
      family of twelve children, we can think of 12 "slots", one slot per 
      child.  In each slot you have two choices: either a boy or a 
      girl.  There are also 2 options for the 2nd child, and so 
      forth.  The total number of combinations is  2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2×2 = 4096  On your calculator press 2 ^ 12 [ENTER]. The sample space 
      contains 4096 elements!  Way to many to write them all down.  
      But we don't have to.  We only need to know how many there are.   Example:  Find the probability of having exactly 4 boys in a 
      family of 12 children.  We already know that the sample space contains 4096 elements.  
      But, how many of those elements contain exactly four boys?  These are 
      all the elements that look like GGGBGBBGBGGG .   All 
      the different combinations of 4 boys and 8 girls.  This 
      means we can use combinations:  out of 12 children the number of ways 
      can you choose 4 of them to be boys is: 12 C 4 = 
      495.  Thus,    Figure 1  Figure 2   p(4 boys in a family of 12 children) = 495/4096  or about 12% probability.  See figure1 for 
      calculations.  The entire calculation can be done in one step.  
      That is,   Figure 2 shows these calculations.     Example:  Find the probability of being dealt a 5-card hand 
      consisting of 3 Queens and 2 Jacks from a standard deck of cards.  
      This is called a Queens-over-Jacks full house.  First we need to find how many different 5-card hands exist.  That 
      is, how many ways can you choose 5 cards from 52 cards: 52 C 5 = 2598960 different 5-card hands.  Next,  we need to choose the Queens and the 
      Jacks.  Since there are four of each kind, we have: 4 C 3 = 4 ways to choose 3 Queens, and 4 C 2 = 6 ways to choose 2 Jacks.  Using the 
      Fundamental Principle of Counting, there are 4 × 6 = 24 different ways to 
      choose 3 Queens and 2 Jacks.  The probability of being dealt 3 Queens 
      and 2 Jacks is:  p(3 Q and 2 J) = ( 4 C 3 × 4 C 2 ) ÷ 52 C 5 = 24 ÷ 2598960 = 
      0.0000092345    Figure 3  Not very likely!  See figure 3 for the 
      calculations.  Notice that the answer is in scientific notation.  It really means 
      9.234463016×10 -6 or, moving the decimal 6 places to the left , 0.0000092345 rounding up.   Another important note is 
      to notice that in the numerator we are choosing 3 cards, then choosing 2 
      cards for a total of 5 cards, and in the denominator we are also choosing 
      5 cards.  Always make sure that the number of cards chosen agree in 
      both the numerator and denominator.  But be careful!   Example: Find the probability of getting any kind of a full 
      house.  This is like our last example, except we first have to choose the two 
      denominations (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) for our 
      full house.  Once the two denominations are chosen, we can choose the 
      3-of-a-kind and the 2-of-a-kind.  The denominator will still be the 
      same as above.  First choose two denominations: 13 C 2 = 
        78  (i.e., the 4's and 9's). Choose the denomination for the 3-of-a-kind: 2 C 1 = 2  (i.e., the 4's). Choose the 3-of-a-kind: 4 C 3 = 4.  Here we 
        finally chose 3 cards. Choose the 2-of-a-kind: 4 C 2 = 6.  Here we 
        chose 2 more cards.  The probability for any full house is:     That means you have a little better than a 0.1% chance of being dealt a 
      full house. Notice that when you don't specify which full house you want 
      to get (as in the previous example), the probability increases 
      dramatically.  In the last example, we'll find the probability of winning the old Washington State Lottery "Lotto", and 
      the probability of getting the second place prize for this lottery.  
      The old Washington State Lottery "Lotto" is called a 6/49 lottery.  This means 
      you chose (or had the computer choose) 6 numbers from the integers 1 
      through 49 (no repeats).  If you correctly chose all 6 numbers, you
      won a million bucks.  If you only got 5 correct numbers you got the 
      second place prize of a couple hundred dollars.    Example:  Find the probability of getting all six numbers correct 
      in the old Washington State Lottery "Lotto"..  First, calculate the total number of ways to choose any six 
      numbers from 49 numbers:  49 C 6 = 13983816 total different ways 
      to choose six numbers.  Almost 14 million!  Next, calculate how many different ways you can choose six winning 
      numbers.  Note:   6 of the 49 numbers are winning numbers, which 
      means 43 numbers are not winning numbers.  The number of ways to 
      correctly get all 6 winning numbers is: 6 C 6 = 
      1. Therefore, the probability of wining the big prize is:  p(choosing 6 winning numbers) = 1 ÷ 13983816 = 
      0.0000000715  You have a better chance of getting hit by lightening, or dying in a 
      plane crash while being stuck in the bathroom!  Your chance of 
      winning is only about 1 in 14 million.   If you're wondering why the 
      ad says "chances of winning are 1 in 7 million", it's because you get two 
      games (or two chances) for every ticket, so your probability of winning 
      doubles from 1 in 14 million to 2 in 14 million, which reduces to 1 in 7 
      million.     Example:  Find the probability of getting the second place prize, 
      that is choosing five winning numbers.  We can solve this just like the last example, except we have to choose 
      5 out of 6 winning numbers, and also one of the 43 losing (non-winning) 
      numbers (remember, you still choose 6 numbers.)  First, choose the winning numbers: 6 C 5 = 
        6  Next, choose the non-winning number: 43 C 1 = 43  The number of ways to choose 5 winning numbers and 1 non-winning number 
      is  6×43 = 258.  The probability of winning the second place 
      prize is:  p(choosing 5 winning numbers) = 258 ÷ 13983816 = 
      0.0000184499   That's a little better, but still not good.  Calculate the 
      probability of getting:  a) 4 winning numbers (and 2 non-winning numbers)  b) 3 winning numbers (and 3 non-winning numbers)  Ask your classmates what kind of answers they get.  We'll use 
      these results in the next section.

As a mathematician, I have never purchased a lottery ticket. I find the odds depressing and have never had luck in winning anything from these kinds of games.  This hub is all about calculating lottery probability or odds. In order to make it more relevant to me, I decided to base it on the Grandlotto 6/55, the lottery game with the biggest prize money here in the Philippines. There will be two different cases discussed in the hub: the probability of winning the game with all six numbers matching, and the probability of having n numbers matching.   Rules of the Lottery Game It is always important to find out the rules of any game before participating in it. For the Grandlotto 6/55, in order to win the jackpot prize, you have to match six numbers from a pool of 55 numbers ranging from 1-55. The initial payout is a minimum of P20 (or around $0.47). It is also possible to win some money if you are able to match three, four, or five numbers of the winning combination. Note that the order of the winning combination here does not matter.  Here is a table for the prizes you can obtain:     No. of Matching Nos.

This is one of the basic concepts you learn in Probability Theory. The main difference being that permutations consider order to be important, while in combinations, order isn't important.  In a lottery ticket, permutation should be used if the numbers in your ticket have to match the order of the draw for the winning string of numbers. In the Grandlotto 6/55, order is not important because so long as you have the winning set of numbers, you can win the prize.  The next formulas only apply for numbers without repetition . This means that if the number x is drawn, it cannot be drawn again. If the number drawn from the set is returned before the next draw, then that has repetition.   This is the formula for Permutations, where order is important. | Source       This is the formula for Combinations, where order is not important. | Source   , where n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.  Note that based on the formulas given, C(n,k) is always less than or equal to P(n,k). You will see later on why it is important to make this distinction for calculating lottery odds or probability.   How to Calculate Lottery Probability for 6 Matching Numbers So now that we know the basic concepts of permutations and combinations, let us go back to the example of Grandlotto 6/55. For the game, n = 55, the total number of possible choices. k = 6, the number of choices we can make. Because order is not important, we will use the formula for combination:   Source   These are the odds or the total number of possible combinations for any 6-digit number to win the game. To find the probability, just divide 1 by the number above, and you will get: 0.0000000344 or 0.00000344%. See what I mean by depressing odds?  So what if we're talking about a different lottery game where order does matter. We will now use the permutation formula to get the following:   Source   Compare these two results and you will see that the odds for getting the winning combination where order matters has 3 additional zero's! It's going from about 28 million:1 odds to 20 billion:1 odds! The probability of winning for this case is 1 divided by the odds which equals to 0.0000000000479 or 0.00000000479%.  As you can see, because the permutation is always greater than or equal to the combination, the probability of winning a game where order matters is always less than or equal to the probability of winning a game where order does not matter. Because the risk is greater for games where order is required, this implies that the reward must also be higher.   How to Calculate Lottery Probability with Less Than 6 Matching Numbers Because you can also win prizes if you have less than 6 matching numbers, this section will show you how to calculate the probability if there are x matches to the winning set of numbers.  First, we need to find the number of way to choose x winning numbers from the set and multiply it by the number of ways to choose the losing numbers for the remaining 6-x numbers. Consider the number of ways to choose x winning numbers. Because there are only 6 possible winning numbers, in essence, we are only choosing x from a pool of 6. And so, because order does not matter, we get C(6, x).  Next, we consider the number of ways to choose the remaining 6-x balls from the pool of losing numbers. Because 6 are winning numbers, we have 55 - 6 = 49 balls to choose the losing numbers from. So, the number of possibilities for choosing a losing ball can be obtained from C(49, 6 - x). Again, order does not matter here.  So, in order to calculate the probability of winning with x matching numbers out of a possible 6, we need to divide the outcome from the previous two paragraphs by the total number of possibilities to win with all 6 matching numbers. We get:       Source   If we write this in a more general form, we get:   Source   , where n = total number of balls in the set, k = total number of balls in the winning combination for the jackpot prize, and x = total numbers of balls matching the winning set of numbers.  If we use this formula to calculate the probability (and the odds) of winning the Grandlotto 6/55 with only x matching numbers, we get the following:     x matches   Calculation   Probability   Odds (1/Probability)   0   C(6,0) * C(49,6)/C(55,6)   0.48237   2.07308   1   C(6,1) * C(49,5)/C(55,6)   0.39466   2.53777   2   C(6,2) * C(49,4)/C(55,6)   0.10963   9.12158   3   C(6,3) * C(49,3)/C(55,6)   0.01271   78.67367   4   C(6,4) * C(49,2)/C(55,6)   0.00060   1643.40561   5   C(6,5) * C(49,1)/C(55,6)   0.00001   98604.33673   6   C(6,6) * C(49,0)/C(55,6)   0.00000003   28989675      How to Choose the Winning Numbers in Lottery As you can see from the math in this hub, the probability of winning the lottery is the same for any 6-number combination available in the Grandlotto 6/55 game. This is also applicable for other lottery games out there.  As I was researching for this hub, I came across links that said never choose numbers that are sequential, like from 1-6 or some such nonsense. There is no such secret to winning the lottery! Each number is as equally likely to come up in the draw as the next number.  If you are willing to face the very little probability of winning the lottery, I say go choose any number you want. You can base it on your birthdays, special days, anniversaries, lucky numbers, etc. Just remember that with great risk comes great reward!

However there are also many factors(known and many unknown) which produces lottery results that happen to produce patterns, which may help in striking like few matching numbers but still ultra difficult in winning 6 matching numbers. It's still a combination of luck, for now i conclude it's combination of probability+luck (L.O.A or whatever u wanna call it)...cheers n good luck hehe  Author dezalyx 2 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Subs. From the definition of classical probability, every statistical outcome will contain elements that are equally likely to happen. This means that if you roll a 6-sided dice, it is equally probable that the outcome will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Or in the case of flipping a coin, the probability of heads will be equal to the probability of tails. No magic coins, no loaded dice, all equally probable to happen. When calculating the lottery probability in this article, this assumption is already used. This is usually the case when calculating probabilities theoretically. Having no affiliation to companies who hold the lottery, it would be difficult for me to assume that certain balls are more likely to surface because they are loaded. In my opinion, historical data does not have any bearing on lottery outcomes. Statistically speaking, working on other probability approaches will not work because of this. Just because the number N appears frequently in lottery drawings, does not mean that the ball is more likely to surface than the number N+1 in the next drawing.  Subs 2 months ago  Can the classical probability theory be used here? And please give an example  Subs 2 months ago  What other probability approaches can be used?  Author dezalyx 7 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Odds. Thanks for commenting. I did not say choosing one's birthday would contribute to one's luck. I just said you can choose any number you want if you're willing to face the fact that there's only a very small chance that you can win the jackpot prize. Heck, you could choose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 if you wanted to. The basis of this article is that the probability of each ball getting drawn is the same as any other ball in the lottery. While I kept getting comments on how likely certain numbers will get picked over other numbers, mathematically speaking, there is no such thing as having weighted balls for lottery drawings. While you might not have studied mathematics, you certainly were on point when you said that you should never try your luck in gambling. That's actually a mathematician's saying. Never gamble, because the house always wins.  ODDS 7 months ago  I didn't study mathematics, but you were wrong when you mentioned that the numbers of the player's birthday would contribute to his luck, rather it would add up to the improbability, because certainly the player would not live enough to wait his birthday's numbers to come up! And yeah you certainly can top up your chances even if mathematically every number may pop up randomly. If i were to buy a ticket, i would consider not selecting numbers that are altogether evens/odds, divisible by 5 altogether etc. If the order does not matter, you will get more chances! But you know what, never try your luck in gambling, it's made to steal your money and you end up depressed.  Author dezalyx 7 months ago  from Philippines Hi, jazer. I've been receiving a ton of comments lately asking for what the winning number will be for the next lottery draw, but the article is just about the probability of winning the lottery. I don't know about the specifics of the composition of lotto balls, since it probably differs for every company that makes them, but looking for trends when there is no factual basis will just result in you losing money. And given the odds of winning the lottery, you would be better off investing that money in something else with a higher chance of getting a profit. While I agree with the idea that maybe the composition of the balls would get it drawn more than the others, you can never bank on that, since it could be changed without you ever knowing about it (repainting the balls numbers, changing the balls entirely, having different sets of balls for different drawings, etc.).      jazer 8 months ago  Probability is probability. We cannot predict the future. But for the purpose of conversation, some people used they called a "trend". A history of past result. From trend you may "guess" which number can be with higher probability. Is this true in nature? Actually, this is only my opinion. My reasoning with the trend is somewhat related to the composition of the lotto balls e.g. weight, etc, that's why some numbers were drawn more that the others. What is your opinion on this? Thanks.  Kgomotso Comfort 9 months ago  I just want know how can I calculate the probabilities of 6/49  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines Edgard, it seems to me that your question is still about the gambler's fallacy. Just because a certain number comes out approximately 6 times out of x number of drawings will not change the probability of the number being drawn again in the future. Imagine changing the game into a simple heads or tails coin flip. The probability of getting either outcome is 1/2. Just because you get 6 heads in a row does not mean the next result would be a tail. Even if you get 100 heads in a row, the probability of getting either outcome is still going to be 1/2. There won't be any probability equations to predict what you are looking for. If there is, the people who have discovered such equations would already be taking advantage of the lottery system. The only thing you can do with the study is plot historical graphs on how many times a certain number has come out previously and marvel at how some numbers seem to appear more than others.  Edgard 11 months ago  Dear dezalix, We really appreciate your time and answers We are aware that there will always be an average for any set of numbers, also we can find a trend to explain any series of numbers, but these work outs are not a guaranty that we will get really meaningful results. Our previous questions came out from the following fact: We made a sequential review of winning numbers of 260 draws of a 6/45 lottery, to find out the number of times (frequency) that each of the 45 balls was drawn; we started with a 160 draws sample, and increased the sample with 10 draws data each time, until we got the last sample of 260 draws; with every sample of draws, we worked out the rate = [total draws of the sample / frequency of each ball in the sample] for every ball, then we worked out the average of this 45 ratios; the result clearly showed a steady trend for this average, which started at 6.63, for the 160 draws sample, to 6.55 for the 260 draws sample; of course we could work with more sample, but we just decided to stop at 260 draws sample. We initially thought this ratio means the average number of draws we expect to wait for a ball to be drawn; but, what would be the right mining of this average (6.55), if any?, why the average has a steady trend?, and is there any probability equation to predict this average? ratio ni = [N° draws/Freq ni] i = [1, 45] Samples	       Average N° Draws	of ratios      Min ratio  Max ratio 260	                6.55	      4.73            8.97 250	                6.56	      4.63	          8.93 240	                6.57	      4.44	          8.57 230	                6.59	      4.26	          8.85 220	                6.58	      4.31	          8.46 210	                6.59	      4.29	          9.13 200	                6.61	      4.17	          9.09 190	                6.61	      4.13	          8.64 180	                6.62	      3.91	          9.00 170	                6.62	      3.95	          8.95 160	                6.63	      3.81	          8.89 Regards Edgard  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines No. The law of large numbers indicate that given a large number of opportunities, we should expect a certain event to happen again, no matter how unlikely it may be. For example, a set of 6 lottery numbers can get picked 2 weeks in a row. But, just because it happened, doesn't mean you should go running to buy the same exact set of numbers in the hopes of getting lucky. Each lottery picking is still independent of each other. So the probability of picking the correct set of numbers will remain the same for each drawing. Saying that one number has the chance to be drawn every specific number of games is succumbing to gambler's fallacy (mistaken belief that just because something happens more frequently than normal during some period, it will happen less frequently in the future). Odds represent the ratio that allow you to calculate how much money you will win on your bet in comparison to your stake. So your $10 ticket can become $23.67 if one number gets drawn. That is why you will notice that the odds keep increasing as you get more matches, meaning you get more money the more matches you get. I hope this answers your question, Edgard.      Edgard 11 months ago  Dear dezalyx, Thanks again, Regarding the same game 6/45: As the probability of one match is  0.42417, then Odds (1/Probability) will be 2.3678. According to probability theory and the law of large numbers, is it right to say, at least theoretically, that every 2.3678 games we should expect one match; in other words, one number has the chance to be drawn every 2.3678 games?  Author dezalyx 11 months ago  from Philippines Hi, Edgar. Just replace the numbers in the formula (from 55 to 45, 49 to 39) then solve for the answer to your question. [0.4241]  Edgard 11 months ago  ¿What would be the probability of one single ball to be part of the winner combination in a game where we have to pick a 6 number combination out of 45 numbers?. Thanks in advance for your answer!  Steve Ho Ong 2 years ago  from Dumaguete City This article is very clear because it is a step by step procedure.

The lowest number you can choose is 1 The highest number you can choose is 45 A given number can only be chosen once per try (per lottery ticket, etc.)  When you select your 1 st number, you have 45 numbers to choose from, and... ...a 1 in 45 chance of picking the right one. (Mathematically, 1 in 45 is represented by the numerical fraction 1 / 45 or 0.022222.)   When you select your 2 nd number, you have 44 numbers to choose from, and... ...a 1 in 44 chance of picking the right one. (Mathematically, 1 in 44 is represented by the numerical fraction 1 / 44 or 0.022727.)   When you select your 3 rd number, you have 43 numbers to choose from, and... ...a 1 in 43 chance of picking the right one. (Mathematically, 1 in 43 is represented by the numerical fraction 1 / 43 or 0.023256.)   When you select your 4 th number, you have 42 numbers to choose from, and... ...a 1 in 42 chance of picking the right one. (Mathematically, 1 in 42 is represented by the numerical fraction 1 / 42 or 0.023810.)   When you select your 5 th number, you have 41 numbers to choose from, and... ...a 1 in 41 chance of picking the right one. (Mathematically, 1 in 41 is represented by the numerical fraction 1 / 41 or 0.024390.)   When you select your 6 th number, you have 40 numbers to choose from, and... ...a 1 in 40 chance of picking the right one. (Mathematically, 1 in 40 is represented by the numerical fraction 1 / 40 or 0.025000.)   In order to win, you have to pick the first number right AND the second number right AND the third number right, etc.  In the language of statistics, AND usually means to multiply . So, to figure out your odds of winning, multiply together all of the fractional odds of picking a given number correctly, as stated by the red fractions above. 1 / 45 × 1 / 44 × 1 / 43 × 1 / 42 × 1 / 41 × 1 / 40 = 1 / 5864443200 So, at this point, your odds of winning are 1 in 5864443200.  But, since you can choose your winning numbers in any order, your chances of winning are somewhat better than this.  Your chance betters by the number of different ways that a sequence of 6 numbers can be written down, which for 6 numbers is 6! (6 factorial) or 720.  Divide 5864443200 by 720 to account for this, to get 8145060. In other words, there are 720 different ways that the 6 numbers you choose can be filled out on your lottery ticket--if you choose your 6 numbers correctly, any of these ways will make a winning ticket. That's it!  You have a 1 in 8,145,060 chance of winning the lottery you described. ( How do I pronounce this number?) Here are some other odds for the sake of comparison: You have about a 1 in 2,000,000 chance of being struck by lightning. A pregnant woman has a 1 in 705,000 chance of giving birth to quadruplets. Someone eating an oyster has a 1 in 12,000 chance of finding a pearl inside of it. Good luck!  And sorry to say that the only way to increase your chances of winning is to buy more tickets! Choosing birthdays, your age, addresses, years, phone numbers, etc. does not help at all!
