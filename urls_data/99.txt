An IUD is a small, T-shaped device that is made from a flexible plastic and is used to prevent pregnancy. There are five kinds of IUDs, and all are more than 99% effective:  Mirena and Kyleena last 5 years and work by releasing progestin.  Paragard lasts10 years. It is a non-hormonal IUD that contains copper. It can be used as an emergency birth control if it is inserted within the first 5 days after unprotected sex.  Liletta and Skyla both last 3 years and work by releasing progestin.  Mirena and Paragard are offered at UHS.  How does it work?  IUDs are inserted in the uterus by a health care provider to prevent pregnancy.  IUDs may prevent pregnancy by:  Thickening cervical mucus  Affecting the way sperm move  Changing the lining of the uterus  Preventing ovulation  How effective is it?  IUDs are one of the most effective methods of contraception. Fewer than 1 out of 100 users will get pregnant each year.  What are the benefits?  While the initial cost may seem expensive, over time IUDs are the least expensive and longest lasting method of birth control.  You do not have to remember to take it every day/week/month or every time you have sex.  An IUD is a good option for users who cannot use estrogen or who are breastfeeding.  The ParaGard IUD (copper) does not affect your hormone levels.  Hormonal IUDs may reduce cramps and make your period lighter. Periods may stop altogether, which some users consider a benefit.  Your ability to become pregnant quickly returns after the IUD is removed.  What are the downsides?  Spotting between periods for the first 3-6 months.  Cramps and backache for the first month after the IUD is inserted. With time, these decrease in intensity and frequency.  With Paraguard, you may experience heavier periods and/or increased cramping.  IUDs do not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STI). Use male condoms or female condoms if you are at risk for STI.  The IUD may slip out of the uterus, either partially or completely; this is called expulsion. If it comes out even a little bit, it must be removed. If the IUD slips out, pregnancy can happen.  Perforation: When an IUD is inserted, it may push through the wall of the uterus, but this is uncommon (less than 1% of users).  Risk of infection that decreases after the first 20 days after IUD insertion.  How do I check my IUD?  You should check your IUD every month to make sure it has not slipped out. An IUD is most likely to slip out of place during your period. IUDs have strings attached to them. Between periods you can check for the strings by following these steps:  Wash your hands.  Sit or squat down.  Put your index or middle finger up into your vagina until you touch the cervix.  Feel for the string ends that should be coming through. If you find them, then the IUD is in place and working.  If the strings feel longer or shorter than before, or you feel the hard, plastic part of the IUD against your cervix, the IUD may have moved.  If the IUD has slipped out or moved, do not try to put it back in place on your own. Be sure to use a back-up method of birth control until you see your health care provider.  Where can I get it and what are costs?  IUDs (ParaGard and Mirena) are available at UHS. See Schedule an Appointment , and Cost, Insurance and Payment .  How to Prepare for Your IUD or Implant Insertion  Important tips:  During insertion, your clinician will:  Put a speculum into your vagina  Cleanse the area with antibacterial solution to minimize the chance of infection  Put an instrument on your cervix to stabilize it; this will cause cramping  Put an instrument into your uterus to measure its depth  Insert the IUD  You should not use an IUD if you:  Have or may have a current STI or other pelvic infection  Think you might be pregnant  Have cervical or uterine cancer  Have unexplained vaginal bleeding  Are or may be allergic to copper (ParaGard IUD only)  Personal experiences   I got the Mirena IUD inserted almost 4 years ago. Other than the initial cramping at insertion, I have had a great experience with it. I did have some initial spotting my first month but it's been smooth sailing since. I remember reading that some people gained weight; this never happened to me. I love this IUD and highly recommend it to anyone! (I have also tried Depo-Provera and birth control pills, neither of which were as stress-free as Mirena.)    I've had my Paragard IUD in for about 8 months now and I'm extremely satisfied with it. I experienced minor side effects of cramps and increased blood flow the first couple of months but after that everything went back to normal.  I would highly suggest it for others who need a long term birth control with minimal side effects and no hormones but at the same time would like to get pregnant in the future. It is so convenient not having to worry about birth control before every time I want to have sex.   Where can I get more information?  Talk to your health care provider.

Pregnancy With an IUD: Is It Possible?  Becoming pregnant when you have an IUD isn't common, but it can happen. Find out the symptoms and implications of an IUD pregnancy. By Elena Donovan Mauer  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         wavebreakmedia/ Shutterstock.com  An intrauterine device, or IUD, is one of the most popular and effective forms of birth control -- and it's rare to become pregnant while using one. "The IUD has a 99.7 percent efficacy rate," says Lanalee Araba Sam, M.D., an ob-gyn in Ft. Lauderdale. "Very, very few women with one will become pregnant. But I always tell my patients that someone on this planet is that one-in-a-million exception. There are instances where someone becomes pregnant with an IUD in place." If you're concerned that that could be you, it's completely understandable, since about 25 percent of women stop having their period while on Mirena, a type of IUD that uses the hormone progesterone to prevent pregnancy, says Cristina Perez, M.D., an ob-gyn at the Women's Specialists of Houston at Texas Children's Pavilion for Women. The other type of IUD, ParaGard, uses copper to prevent pregnancy. "ParaGard has no hormones," Dr. Perez explains, so if you're using it, you should still be getting your period as long as you're not pregnant. Wondering if you're pregnant? Take our quiz! Symptoms of an IUD pregnancy A pregnancy with an IUD in place typically has the same symptoms as any regular pregnancy -- including breast tenderness, nausea, and fatigue -- so if you're experiencing those symptoms and you have missed your period, call your doctor right away to find out if you're pregnant. It's important to catch such a pregnancy early. An at-home pregnancy test might not indicate a pregnancy as early as a blood test in the office would, so you'll want to be tested by a medical professional. Shop for at-home pregnancy tests IUD pregnancy risks Unfortunately, there are additional risks involved with an IUD pregnancy. "You're 50 percent more likely to miscarry if the IUD is left in place, so the recommendation is to let the pregnancy continue and remove the IUD," says Dr. Sam. But even then, Dr. Sam adds, you're 25 percent more likely to miscarry even if the IUD is removed. So your doctor will want to monitor an IUD pregnancy closely. There's also a higher risk of ectopic or tubal pregnancy, in which the fertilized egg stays in the fallopian tubes rather than in the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies almost always end in loss of the pregnancy, and need to be treated quickly to prevent permanent damage to the woman's reproductive system. If you are, in fact, pregnant, your doctor will likely test your blood once, and then again 48 hours later, to make sure the pregnancy hormone, hCG, steadily rises, so he can confirm that your pregnancy is progressing. If it does, it's not an ectopic pregnancy . Pregnancy after an IUD Although becoming pregnant with an IUD in place is rare, getting pregnant after having an IUD removed isn't. (That's good news if you want to conceive, and fair warning if you don't!) If you have decided to try to conceive, give your ob-gyn a call to have your IUD removed, and get busy trying. Some doctors recommend waiting three months after removal before you start trying to conceive, to give your body time to get back to its usual menstrual cycle. This helps you to understand when you're ovulating and most fertile. But according to Dr. Perez, there's no medical need to wait: "You can ovulate and get pregnant the next month!" Are You Pregnant?

Medically reviewed by Janet Brito, PhD, LCSW, CST on  July 10, 2017 — Written by Annette McDermott Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are popular and effective forms of birth control. Most IUDs stay in place after insertion, but some occasionally shift or fall out. This is known as expulsion. Learn about IUD insertion and expulsion, and find information on the types of IUDs and how they work.  The IUD insertion process  The IUD insertion process usually takes place at a doctor’s office. Your doctor should discuss the insertion procedure and its risks before insertion occurs. You may be advised to take an over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen an hour before your scheduled procedure .  The IUD insertion process consists of several steps:   Your doctor will insert a speculum into your vagina.  Your doctor will thoroughly clean your cervix and vaginal areas with an antiseptic.  You may be given numbing medication to lessen discomfort.  Your doctor will insert an instrument called a tenaculum into your cervix to stabilize it.  Your doctor will insert an instrument called a uterine sound into your uterus to measure the depth of your uterus.  Your doctor will insert an IUD through the cervix.   At some point during the procedure, you’ll be shown how to find the IUD strings. The strings hang into your vagina.  Most people resume normal activities after the insertion procedure. Some doctors advise avoiding vaginal sex, hot baths, or tampon use for a couple of days after insertion to reduce the risk of infection .  What to do if your IUD is expelled  Expulsion occurs when your IUD falls out of the uterus. It may fall out partially or completely. It’s not always clear why an IUD is expelled, but the risk of it happening is higher during your period. If an IUD is expelled to any degree, it must be removed.  Expulsion is more likely for women who:   have never been pregnant  are younger than 20 years old  have heavy or painful periods  have the IUD inserted after an abortion during the second trimester of pregnancy   You should check your IUD strings each month after your period to make sure the IUD is still in place. You should contact your doctor right away if any of the following events occur:   The strings seem shorter than usual.  The strings seem longer than usual.  You can’t locate the strings.  You’re able to feel your IUD.   Don’t attempt to push the IUD back in place or remove it on your own. You should also use an alternative method of birth control, such as a condom.  To check your IUD strings, follow these steps:   Wash your hands.  While you’re sitting or squatting, put your finger into your vagina until you touch your cervix.  Feel for the strings. They should be hanging through the cervix.   If your IUD has become partially dislodged or expelled completely, you may feel pain or discomfort. Other symptoms associated with expulsion include:   severe cramping  heavy or abnormal bleeding  an abnormal discharge  a fever, which may also be a symptom of an infection   About IUDs  An IUD is a small, T-shaped device that can prevent pregnancy. It’s made of flexible plastic and used for long-term pregnancy prevention or emergency birth control . Two thin strings are attached to help you make sure the IUD is in place and to assist your doctor with removal . There are two types of IUDs .  Hormonal IUDs , such as Mirena , Liletta, and Skyla brands, release the hormone progestin to prevent ovulation. They also help thicken cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and fertilize an egg. Hormonal IUDs work for three to five years.  A copper IUD called ParaGard has copper wrapped around its arms and stem. It releases copper to help prevent sperm from reaching an egg. It also helps change the lining of the uterus. This makes it harder for a fertilized egg to implant into the uterine wall. The ParaGard IUD works for up to 10 years.  Mirena vs. ParaGard vs. Skyla: Choosing the Right IUD    Cost of an IUD  Special considerations for IUD use  Common IUD side effects include spotting between periods, cramping, and back pain, especially for a few days after IUD insertion. Risk of pelvic infection increases for a few weeks after insertion. Less than 1 percent of IUD users experience uterine perforation, which is when the IUD pushes through the uterine wall.  In the case of ParaGard, your periods may be heavier than normal for several months after IUD insertion. Hormonal IUDs may cause periods to be lighter.  Some women shouldn’t get an IUD. Talk to your doctor if:   you have a pelvic infection or sexually transmitted infection  you might be pregnant  you have uterine or cervical cancer  you have unexplained vaginal bleeding  you have a history of ectopic pregnancy  you have a suppressed  immune system   Sometimes, specific IUDs aren’t recommended if you have certain conditions. Mirena and Skyla aren’t advised if you have acute liver disease or jaundice . ParaGard isn’t advised if you’re allergic to copper or have Wilson’s disease .  Choosing the right birth control  You may find the IUD to be a perfect fit for you . However, after trying it, you may realize that it’s not exactly what you want. Talk to your doctor about all of your options for birth control .  When sifting through your options, you should consider the following factors:   Do you want to have children in the future?  Are you at risk of contracting HIV or another sexually transmitted disease?  Will you remember to take birth control pills daily?  Do you smoke or are you over the age of 35?  Are there negative side effects?  Is it easily available and affordable?  Are you comfortable inserting a birth control device, if applicable?   The takeaway  An IUD is one of the most effective forms of birth control. In most cases, it stays in place and you can forget about it until it’s time to have it removed. If it does fall out, use backup birth control and call your doctor to determine if the IUD should be reinserted. If you try the IUD and don’t feel it’s the best choice for you, talk with your doctor about other birth control options available to you.

Posted on April 21, 2015, 14:31 GMT            Casey Gueren  BuzzFeed Staff             Share On facebook    Share        Share On vk    Share        Share On pinterest      Share On pinterest    Pin        Share On lineapp          Share On twitter    Share        Share On email    Email        Share On sms          Share On whatsapp          Share On more    More        Share On tumblr          Share On link          Share On copy    Copy Link                  Share On facebook    Share        Share On pinterest      Share On pinterest    Pin        Share On email    Email        Share On copy    Copy Link         Jenny Chang / BuzzFeed       Share On facebook    Share        Share On pinterest      Share On pinterest    Pin          1.  They’re one of the most effective methods of birth control.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    IUDs, or intrauterine devices, are more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy (they're tied for first with the contraceptive implant — when not including permanent birth control). And unlike other birth control options like the pill, the ring, or condoms, there isn't a risk for straight-up human error. Your doctor inserts the IUD and it just stays there. It's a set-it-and-forget-it thing. So if you're not the best at remembering to take pills or replace your Nuvaring, this might be a great option for you.         There are two main kinds: hormonal IUDs and copper IUDs.          Share On email    Email        Share On copy    Copy Link        Share On facebook    Share            Advertisement       2.  The hormonal IUD is a tiny plastic device that contains the hormone levonorgestrel, which is slowly released into the uterus.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    This hormone thickens the cervical mucus, making it a hostile environment for sperm, so they can't get up there to reach the egg, Dr. Mary Jane Minkin, clinical professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive science at Yale School of Medicine, tells BuzzFeed Life. It's also possible that the hormonal IUD sometimes works by stopping the release of an egg or by thinning the lining of the uterus, which would make it harder for a fertilized egg to attach, but these aren't the primary mechanisms. Most of the time, it just keeps sperm away from your uterus. There are currently three hormonal IUD options on the market in the U.S.: Mirena (which can stay in up to five years), Skyla (which is a bit smaller and can stay in up to three years), and Liletta (which was just approved by the Food and Drug Administration and can stay in up to three years).        3.  The copper IUD is a tiny device made of plastic and copper, and it’s totally free of hormones.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    It works similarly to the hormonal IUD, but instead of levonorgestrel, it's copper that's continuously being released into your uterus. The copper is actually toxic to sperm, making it pretty much impossible for the sperm to get to the egg and penetrate it, Dr. Jennifer Gunter, OB-GYN, tells BuzzFeed Life. Again, it's possible that the copper IUD could sometimes work by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting, but that's not the primary mechanism. There is currently one copper IUD on the market, Paragard, and it can stay in up to 10 years.        4.  They’re super popular among female doctors.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    Female family planning providers are more likely to use the IUD than any other form of birth control, according to a recent study in the journal Contraception .        5.  And they’ve been suggested as a safe and effective birth control method for teens.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    They're not just for women who have already given birth. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggested IUDs and implants as "first-line contraceptive choices for adolescents."           Advertisement       6.  IUDs got a bad rap after an earlier version caused serious health problems.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    Back in the 1970s, a previous version of the IUD called the Dalkon Shield was linked to a lot of horrible pelvic infections that reportedly led to infertility and even death. One of the biggest design flaws was that it had a braided, multifilament string that allowed bacteria to climb up into the uterus, Dr. Lisa Perriera, OB-GYN, tells BuzzFeed Life. This is unlike the IUDs we have today, which are actually designed to reduce the rate of infection. But all that bad press and the legal battles made people pretty hesitant about them for a while. Fortunately, we now have safe and effective methods on the market, and many more doctors have been properly trained in the benefits and insertion of IUDs.        7.  IUDs are good options for pretty much anyone who wants lasting pregnancy protection.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    The copper IUD is especially good for women who prefer hormone-free birth control, and the hormonal IUD is great for anyone who can't be on estrogen-containing birth control. The truth is, there are very few people are not good candidates for an IUD, says Minkin.        8.  But obviously, they’re not for everyone.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    There are some cases where you should not get the IUD, for instance: - If you're pregnant or think you might be pregnant. - If you have any uterine abnormalities that would make it hard for the IUD to stay in place (your doctor can check for this). - If you have acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or a history of PID. - If you have any unexplained genital or uterine bleeding. - If you've had postpartum endometritis or an infected abortion in the past three months. - If you have severe liver disease. - If you have breast cancer or a history of breast cancer, you should not get the hormonal IUD, but your doctor might suggest the copper IUD. - If you have any untreated pelvic infections (like chlamydia) or are prone to pelvic infections, you may not be a good candidate for either IUD. Talk to your doctor about this history before getting an IUD. - If you have Wilson's disease (a rare disorder where copper can accumulate in the body) you cannot get the copper IUD. This is not an exhaustive list, so make sure to go over a detailed medical history with your doctor before deciding on the IUD.         9.  They don’t actually stop you from ovulating.

Even the progestin in the hormonal IUD stays mostly in your uterus, with very little getting absorbed into your bloodstream. For some women, these hormones may impact ovulation a little bit in the first year or so, but that will balance out after a while, says Gunter. And if you're on the copper IUD, it won't affect ovulation at all.           Advertisement       10.  They start working pretty much immediately.

The hormonal IUD is also immediately effective if you insert it within seven days of the start of your period, but if you get it inserted any other time, doctors generally recommend using a backup birth control (like a condom) for a week, says Perriera.         11.

Some people report worse periods and cramps on the copper IUD.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    You may have heard that some people have nonstop periods or hellish cramps on the copper IUD. Here's the thing: Research does show that a small percentage of women will get heavier periods on this method, says Gunter. That said, it may also be the case that some women try the copper IUD after trying other hormonal birth control methods, and their periods just seem worse by comparison. Since the copper IUD has no hormones, it won't make your period lighter or your cramps less awful the way that the pill, the ring, or the hormonal IUD would, says Minkin. If you're someone who prefers those hormones to even out your cycle, the copper IUD probably wouldn't be the best fit.         13.  With the hormonal IUD, you may have little to no period.

For most people, this is the best benefit of all time, but others might actually miss that monthly reassurance that they're not pregnant.           Advertisement        14.

"Like, you're ruining a lot of underwear." But the good news is that the bleeding will gradually decrease over time. And remember that most people have lighter or nonexistent periods after the half-year point.        15.  Insertion is typically quick, but it can be uncomfortable for some and super painful for others.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    Most people feel cramping for a day or so, but it's typically not too bad. Studies show that most women feel mild discomfort, but about a third of women report pain scores of five or more, says Gunter. It might be more uncomfortable if you typically feel pain with pelvic exams or if you have never been pregnant or delivered a baby before, since your cervix might require more dilation. The best advice is to take some pain medication beforehand and not psyche yourself out about it, says Gunter. "If you're worried something is going to hurt, it's more likely to hurt," she says.         16.  Here’s what it’s actually like to get an IUD:              Share On facebook    Share        Share On pinterest      Share On pinterest    Pin        Share On email    Email        Share On copy    Copy Link         Keith Brofsky / Getty Images / Via thinkstockphotos.com        Share On facebook    Share        Share On pinterest      Share On pinterest    Pin      We asked Gunter and Minkin to give us a play-by-play so you know exactly what to expect. First your doctor will insert a speculum into your vagina (like when you get a Pap smear). Then they clean the cervix and examine your uterus to see how long it is and what direction it is. Then they load the IUD into a tiny tube like a straw (with the arms collapsed in), and push it through, so it releases into your uterus and the arms open up. Finally, they cut the strings that hang off the end of it, so that you and your partner can't feel them unless you really go looking for them. The whole process typically only takes a few minutes. Most doctors will schedule a follow-up visit after your next period so they can make sure everything's going well. "If something is going to happen, that would be the time frame where we would see it," says Minkin.         17.  Your doctor will explain how to check for the strings periodically — just to make sure it’s still in place.              Share On facebook    Share        Share On pinterest      Share On pinterest    Pin        Share On email    Email        Share On copy    Copy Link         Spike Mafford / Getty Images / Via thinkstockphotos.com        Share On facebook    Share        Share On pinterest      Share On pinterest    Pin      Talk to your doctor about how often to do a self-check and how exactly to do it. Minkin explains that feeling for the strings almost feels like using your finger to touch a string on the tip of your nose. It's very rare for the IUD to slip out of place, but if you don't feel the strings, you should still call your doctor to see what's up.           Advertisement       18.  You should get an STI test before you get the IUD.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    You've probably heard of the association between IUDs and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is most likely to occur around the time of insertion, and it's often the result of a sexually transmitted disease, says Minkin. That's because both chlamydia and gonorrhea can be completely symptomless, and if left untreated they can lead to PID. "If you have an IUD and you get exposed to gonorrhea or chlamydia, you might have a higher risk of an infection that spreads," says Gunter. For this reason, it's crucial to get tested for these infections before you get an IUD and any time you may be at risk while you have an IUD in. Your doctor may test you for chlamydia and gonorrhea right before she inserts the IUD, which is also fine as long as you treat the infections immediately if your test comes back positive, says Minkin. Remember: IUDs do not protect against HIV and STIs , so use a condom unless you're in a mutually monogamous relationship and you've both been tested recently. Here's everything you need to know about getting tested — including which tests you need and how often.         19.  There are a few other serious side effects associated with IUDs, but they’re very rare.              Share On facebook    Share        Share On pinterest      Share On pinterest    Pin        Share On email    Email        Share On copy    Copy Link          memegenerator.net        Share On facebook    Share        Share On pinterest      Share On pinterest    Pin      One risk is perforation, which is when the IUD attaches to or goes through the wall of the uterus. It's very rare, with studies showing it occurs in less than 1% of people with IUDs, says Gunter. It's slightly more common if you're breastfeeding, if you have an oddly shaped uterus, or if you just have an inexperienced provider. If you have severe pain during or after insertion, be sure to tell your doctor. Another risk is expulsion, where the IUD comes out partially or completely. Talk to your doctor if you think this has happened or if you're experiencing any pain. It's also possible to develop ovarian cysts with the hormonal IUD, but these typically disappear on their own. These side effects are all very uncommon, and they're explained in the prescribing information for your IUD. Even though they're rare, talk to your doctor about them at your appointment so you know if you're at risk and what to watch out for.        20.  If you can't take birth control pills for some reason, you might still be able to use an IUD.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    You doctor may have told you that you're not a good candidate for the birth control pill because you have a history of blood clots, have migraines with aura, have high blood pressure, are over 35 and smoke, or have other factors that may not mix well with hormonal birth control. If this is the case, you can probably still use one of the IUDs. That's because neither of these contain estrogen, which is the hormone to blame for these warnings. For this reason, lots of people who can't take the Pill are actually better off on the hormonal IUD. And if you really can't be on a hormonal method, the copper IUD would be a great alternative.        21.  Your insurance should cover IUDs, but it might not.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, your insurance company ~should~ cover all FDA–approved birth control methods — including the IUD — at no cost (unless you have a grandfathered plan or a plan through a company with an exemption). But without insurance, the IUD can be a very large upfront cost. Be sure to call your insurance company before your appointment so you know exactly what it will cost.         22.  If you get pregnant while you have an IUD (which is incredibly unlikely), it’s more likely to be ectopic.

If you do get pregnant with an IUD, it's more likely to be an ectopic pregnancy (one where the embryo implants outside the uterus, often in the fallopian tubes), says Gunter. However, it's important to note that having an IUD doesn't raise your risk of having an ectopic pregnancy in general. If you think you may be pregnant, contact your doctor immediately.        23.  IUDs have the highest satisfaction rate of all reversible birth control options.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    Obviously not every birth control method will be right for every person, but one thing to keep in mind if you're considering an IUD is that they have super-high satisfaction rates, says Gunter. In one study in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology , IUD users had the highest rate of continuation in the first year. Just remember: Every body is different and responds to medication differently. So talk to your doctor and listen to your body to find the best method of contraception for you.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest IMAGE POINT FR / BSIP All hail the IUD , one of the best options anyone with a uterus has in the way of reliable long-term contraception. The little T-shaped device fits right inside the uterus and comes in both hormonal and non-hormonal forms. The hormonal IUDs —Mirena, which last for five years, and Skyla and Liletta, which last for three—thicken cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to squirm their way over to an egg. They also thin the uterine lining so if an egg does get fertilized, it has trouble latching on to the uterus to receive nutrients. The non-hormonal IUD, ParaGard, lasts for a whopping 10 years and uses copper to create a toxic environment for sperm . IUDs may be small, but they're certainly effective, offering over 99 percent protection against pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . But as it says right in the name, intrauterine devices need to get implanted in the uterus. Just like any other medical procedure, that comes with potential complications, albeit small ones. Namely, there's a tiny chance the IUD will expel itself (aka fall out) or perforate your uterus (pierce one of the uterine walls). Ob/gyns want you to know the chance of either of these happening is so small, it absolutely shouldn’t deter you if you’re intrigued by everything IUDs have to offer. But if you’re going to get one, you might as well go into it fully prepared for anything. It’s totally understandable to worry that something in your uterus might make its way out of your uterus (via your vagina), but experts want to assure you: Expulsions are not at all common. "It does occur, but very rarely," Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale Medical School, tells SELF. Jamil Abdur-Rahman , M.D., board-certified ob/gyn and chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Vista East Medical Center in Waukegan, Illinois, agrees."In 15 years at my practice, I think I’ve seen it maybe three times," he tells SELF. Specifically, reported expulsion rates are around 3 to 5 percent, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists . Experts still aren't sure of the medical reason behind expulsion. It's more common during your period and also more likely to happen in the first few months after insertion. Minkin's even heard of it happening while people have "a tremendous bowel movement ." But basically, as she explains, for whatever reason, "your uterus says, 'I'm tired of having this in here' and spits it out." It might just be a factor of having a foreign body in there, says Abdur-Rahman. The main sign your IUD is expelling itself is an obvious one: You actually see it somewhere outside of your body. You might experience a little cramping beforehand as the uterus works to expel it, says Minkin, but otherwise, your IUD showing up in your underwear like, "surprise!!!" is the only real way to know for sure without the help of a doctor. And sometimes that doesn't even happen because the IUD expels itself partway into the vagina, but doesn't fully come out. Experiencing a perforated IUD is even less common than dealing with an expelled one. It only happens in 1 out of every 1,000 insertions, according to ACOG , and it's most common around the time of insertion. That's because perforation often happens due to improper placement, says Abdur-Rahman. Insertion is a "blind procedure," he explains, meaning doctors don't get to see what they're doing. "When you're inserting an IUD , you push it [past the cervix] through a tube that's like a narrow straw. It squirts out into the uterus and the arms pop open," says Minkin. The thing is, around one in four or one in five women has a retroverted, or tilted, uterus, says Abdur-Rahman. That's when the uterus is tipped backward instead of forward, meaning an IUD's wings can more easily wind up where they shouldn't. Unlike an expulsion, perforation usually causes major signs something is off. Since the uterus is mainly made of muscle, it reacts readily to things going wrong. "[The uterus] will involuntarily contract, so you might notice a lot of cramp-y pain and pain with intercourse ," says Abdur-Rahman. Keep in mind that cramping is normal during and after insertion, so he means severe cramping that lasts for weeks. You might also experience spotting . And if the IUD perforates the uterus enough, it might also affect the bladder or rectum (which both abut the uterus, so in an extreme situation, could be pierced by a runaway IUD). In that exceedingly rare case, you may notice pain or blood when using the bathroom, Abdur-Rahman explains. Expulsion and perforation are the few things that can make IUDs less effective. Two of the three patients Abdur-Rahman saw with expelled IUDs realized what happened because they got pregnant (yes, scary, but remember: highly unlikely!). Your fertility returns as soon as the IUD is gone, so an expelled one is pretty useless at keeping you baby-free. It's less black and white with perforations—sometimes they still offer some measure of protection, but that depends on the specific situation, says Abdur-Rahman. Either way, expulsion and perforation both warrant a trip to the doctor. There's one helpful way to get an idea of whether your IUD is acting up. Two weeks to a month after insertion, your doctor will have you go back so they can check the IUD's placement, either with a physical exam or ultrasound. Then they'll recommend you do so yourself once a month by inserting a finger or two into your vagina and feeling for the IUD's strings hanging out of your cervix (which, according to Minkin, feels a lot like a nose). "Imagine touching your nose and having threads coming out of it—that’s what your IUD feels like. If someone can't feel their strings, I have them come in," she says. Your cervix moves a bit based on your cycle, so it's key to do this at the same time each month so you factor that in, says Abdur-Rahman. "A lot of times if the IUD is moving down and close to being expelled, you'll notice the strings are longer," says Abdur-Rahman. "If it’s moving up and getting closer to perforating the uterus, the strings might seem shorter," he says. That's not always the case, but it's good to keep in mind. But if you don't feel the strings, don't panic! There could be a completely normal explanation. The longer you have your IUD , the more likely it is for the strings to soften or curl up behind your cervix, so you might not always feel them, and usually that's not a sign anything is wrong. But if you're worried, your doctor can examine you physically and break out an ultrasound machine if need be. And if it turns out you have experienced an expulsion or perforation, you can likely still get another IUD if you want. There's usually no reason not to give it another go after an expulsion, but a prior perforation may require insertion with an ultrasound so doctors can see exactly where they're placing it this time around, says Abdur-Rahman.

CNWN Collection     Newsletter What Should You Do If Your IUD Falls Out? Medically reviewed by Janet Brito, PhD, LCSW, CST on  July 10, 2017 — Written by Annette McDermott Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are popular and effective forms of birth control. Most IUDs stay in place after insertion, but some occasionally shift or fall out. This is known as expulsion. Learn about IUD insertion and expulsion, and find information on the types of IUDs and how they work.  The IUD insertion process  The IUD insertion process usually takes place at a doctor’s office. Your doctor should discuss the insertion procedure and its risks before insertion occurs. You may be advised to take an over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen an hour before your scheduled procedure .  The IUD insertion process consists of several steps:   Your doctor will insert a speculum into your vagina.  Your doctor will thoroughly clean your cervix and vaginal areas with an antiseptic.  You may be given numbing medication to lessen discomfort.  Your doctor will insert an instrument called a tenaculum into your cervix to stabilize it.  Your doctor will insert an instrument called a uterine sound into your uterus to measure the depth of your uterus.  Your doctor will insert an IUD through the cervix.   At some point during the procedure, you’ll be shown how to find the IUD strings. The strings hang into your vagina.  Most people resume normal activities after the insertion procedure. Some doctors advise avoiding vaginal sex, hot baths, or tampon use for a couple of days after insertion to reduce the risk of infection .  What to do if your IUD is expelled  Expulsion occurs when your IUD falls out of the uterus. It may fall out partially or completely. It’s not always clear why an IUD is expelled, but the risk of it happening is higher during your period. If an IUD is expelled to any degree, it must be removed.  Expulsion is more likely for women who:   have never been pregnant  are younger than 20 years old  have heavy or painful periods  have the IUD inserted after an abortion during the second trimester of pregnancy   You should check your IUD strings each month after your period to make sure the IUD is still in place. You should contact your doctor right away if any of the following events occur:   The strings seem shorter than usual.  The strings seem longer than usual.  You can’t locate the strings.  You’re able to feel your IUD.   Don’t attempt to push the IUD back in place or remove it on your own. You should also use an alternative method of birth control, such as a condom.  To check your IUD strings, follow these steps:   Wash your hands.  While you’re sitting or squatting, put your finger into your vagina until you touch your cervix.  Feel for the strings. They should be hanging through the cervix.   If your IUD has become partially dislodged or expelled completely, you may feel pain or discomfort. Other symptoms associated with expulsion include:   severe cramping  heavy or abnormal bleeding  an abnormal discharge  a fever, which may also be a symptom of an infection   About IUDs  An IUD is a small, T-shaped device that can prevent pregnancy. It’s made of flexible plastic and used for long-term pregnancy prevention or emergency birth control . Two thin strings are attached to help you make sure the IUD is in place and to assist your doctor with removal . There are two types of IUDs .  Hormonal IUDs , such as Mirena , Liletta, and Skyla brands, release the hormone progestin to prevent ovulation. They also help thicken cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and fertilize an egg. Hormonal IUDs work for three to five years.  A copper IUD called ParaGard has copper wrapped around its arms and stem. It releases copper to help prevent sperm from reaching an egg. It also helps change the lining of the uterus. This makes it harder for a fertilized egg to implant into the uterine wall. The ParaGard IUD works for up to 10 years.  Mirena vs. ParaGard vs. Skyla: Choosing the Right IUD    Cost of an IUD  Special considerations for IUD use  Common IUD side effects include spotting between periods, cramping, and back pain, especially for a few days after IUD insertion. Risk of pelvic infection increases for a few weeks after insertion. Less than 1 percent of IUD users experience uterine perforation, which is when the IUD pushes through the uterine wall.  In the case of ParaGard, your periods may be heavier than normal for several months after IUD insertion. Hormonal IUDs may cause periods to be lighter.  Some women shouldn’t get an IUD. Talk to your doctor if:   you have a pelvic infection or sexually transmitted infection  you might be pregnant  you have uterine or cervical cancer  you have unexplained vaginal bleeding  you have a history of ectopic pregnancy  you have a suppressed  immune system   Sometimes, specific IUDs aren’t recommended if you have certain conditions. Mirena and Skyla aren’t advised if you have acute liver disease or jaundice . ParaGard isn’t advised if you’re allergic to copper or have Wilson’s disease .  Choosing the right birth control  You may find the IUD to be a perfect fit for you . However, after trying it, you may realize that it’s not exactly what you want. Talk to your doctor about all of your options for birth control .  When sifting through your options, you should consider the following factors:   Do you want to have children in the future?  Are you at risk of contracting HIV or another sexually transmitted disease?  Will you remember to take birth control pills daily?  Do you smoke or are you over the age of 35?  Are there negative side effects?  Is it easily available and affordable?  Are you comfortable inserting a birth control device, if applicable?   The takeaway  An IUD is one of the most effective forms of birth control. In most cases, it stays in place and you can forget about it until it’s time to have it removed. If it does fall out, use backup birth control and call your doctor to determine if the IUD should be reinserted. If you try the IUD and don’t feel it’s the best choice for you, talk with your doctor about other birth control options available to you.

Caroline Praderio/INSIDER The INSIDER Summary: IUDs are a great way to prevent pregnancy. But it's possible for them to move out of place after insertion. Gynecologist Alyssa Dweck told INSIDER what warning signs to look for. Her advice: Check the strings, watch for excessive pain and bleeding, keep your follow-up appointment, and call your doctor if you suspect something's amiss. surging in popularity right now super effective, low-maintenance way to prevent pregnancy So INSIDER asked gynecologist Alyssa Dweck, MD , author of " The Complete A to Z for your V ," about the warning signs of wandering IUDs. Here's what you need to know. 1. Go to your follow-up appointment. Most doctors will ask you to come back about a month after insertion just to check that the IUD hasn't moved. Since complications are most likely to occur in the weeks just after insertion, it's important that you keep this appointment. 2. Check your strings. A copper IUD. Shutterstock At the end of every IUD there are two thin strings that the doctor will eventually use to pull the device out of your body. When the IUD is in place, the strings will hang down from your cervix into the very top of your vagina. Most doctors will advise you to reach up and feel the strings once a month, at home, just to make sure that the IUD is still in place. If you're unsure of how to reach them — or you just want to know what they feel like — ask your doctor to teach you right when you get the IUD inserted. Dweck said it's important to check your strings every month. Not being able to feel them doesn't always indicate a problem, but it could mean that your IUD has moved. "If you've always felt the strings and all of a sudden you don't, call your doctor and come in and get checked," Dweck said. 3. Check the toilet (seriously). You might find your IUD in here. Shutterstock It is possible for the IUD to be expelled from your uterus. But don't worry — it'd be really difficult to miss. "Normally you're going to have some pretty bad cramps, maybe some bleeding, and you're going to find your IUD either in your underwear, in your vagina, or in the toilet," Dweck said. If that happens, call your doctor. 4. Know about perforation. Perforation — when the IUD pushes through and out of your uterus — only happens in about 1 in 1,000 IUD insertions . But it is possible, and if it happens, you may need surgery to get the IUD removed. If the IUD has traveled outside your uterus, you'll probably have significant pain or discomfort . Women who've written accounts of their own IUD perforations usually say that the pain is incapacitating. Also, do a self-check on your strings. If you can't find them, it could indicate that your IUD isn't in place. When in doubt, trust your instinct and call your doctor. "I have to really make the plug for common sense," Dweck said. "If something doesn't feel right, just come in. We'd rather see." 5. Look out for abnormal pain or bleeding. You shouldn't need pain meds for more than a few days after insertion. Shutterstock After insertion, you should expect some amount of cramping and irregular bleeding , but excessive pain and bleeding could signal that something's amiss. "After a day or two [post-insertion], requiring medication for pain is not expected," Dweck said. If the pain is that bad, make an appointment to see your doctor. "Foul-smelling bleeding should be checked out, because that could be a kind of infection," she added. "Very heavy bleeding, where you're soaking or saturating a pad or two every hour — that's way too much and should be checked out." Have more questions about IUDs?

IUD expulsion isn't common, but it does happen. Here's what you should know about it.  by
Claire Tighe    published 2015-01-26T16:30:00Z     During the first few months of having my IUD, there were some moments of discomfort that made me wonder if the IUD was in the right place. When I went to my doctor for a follow-up exam, I talked about some of the pain I had been experiencing and my fear that the IUD had been expelled. “Oh no,” she said. “You would know.”  This would be true if it had been completely expelled, but it’s also possible for an IUD to be expelled and for its user not to be quite sure. That’s called a partial expulsion. As it turns out, the IUD can move inside the uterus depending on the time of the month. As Corinne Rocca says in her article about the Mirena IUD , “Expulsion is a fancy way of saying that an IUD has been pushed out of its ideal location at the top of the uterus. The uterus is one big muscle, so this sometimes happens.” (In fact, becoming familiar with the position of the cervix is one aspect of some fertility awareness methods .)  My follow-up visit turned out fine, but what if it hadn’t? The rates of IUD expulsion fall somewhere between .05% and 8%. There are a few different factors that can affect the possibility of expulsion , like your age and pregnancy history, how long it’s been since the IUD was inserted, and even how well your health care provider inserted the IUD in the first place. There’s a higher rate of expulsion during your period , so you’ll want to make sure to check your strings regularly . Expulsion is most likely to occur during the first three months that you have the IUD.  Think your IUD may have expelled? Here’s what to do.  1. Stay calm. It isn’t pleasant or convenient, but expulsion is a potential risk when you have an IUD inserted. If you are in a lot of pain or feeling confused, take a deep breath. Stressing out may make you feel worse and make it harder for you to stay calm enough to get the care you need.  2. Double check. Being able to feel your IUD strings is totally normal ( here’s a handy how-to ). But if you can feel the hard plastic protruding from your cervix, the IUD isn’t where it’s supposed to be . For some people , it may be less noticeable if the IUD has expelled. It’s definitely a good idea to make an appointment with your provider if you have any of the following symptoms: severe pain and cramping; heavy or abnormal bleeding; abnormal discharge; and/or fever. (This may also be a sign of infection.) Some discomfort in the first few days after insertion is normal, but if the pain intensifies or persists, it may be time to see your provider.  3. Take care. If you’re experiencing a lot of pain while the IUD is out of place, make sure to take extra care of yourself. Try to wait to have sex until you are able to meet with your provider. Plus, if the IUD isn’t where it’s supposed to be, you may not be protected from pregnancy. If you still want to go for it, make sure to use a back-up birth control method.  4. Call your provider. If you think your IUD is out of place, call your health care provider asap and ask for an appointment. You definitely want to talk to them if you have severe pain, cannot find your strings, notice the strings are shorter or longer than normal, or can feel the IUD poking out. Getting in to see your provider might not be the easiest or the most convenient, but even if you’re not totally sure your IUD has been expelled, it’s worth it to take care of your health and make sure you’re covered against accidental pregnancy. If you just had the IUD inserted, a routine check-up after six weeks is a good idea anyway to make sure everything is a-okay.  Wondering if you should try the IUD again?  For women who have had an expulsion, the chance of it happening again is a little higher , but if you think the IUD is the right method for you, it may be worth trying again. Talk with your provider about your options. You may want to try a different kind of IUD, try a different provider, or see if your provider can use extra tools to make sure the IUD is in the right place this time.  If you’ve expelled multiple times or just really aren’t up for trying again, it may be time to explore other options. Fortunately there are lots of birth control methods to choose from.

But what about finding solutions to those stressful sexual health situations that inevitably crop up when you’re getting down? Emma Kaywin, a Brooklyn-based sexual health writer and activist, is here to calm your nerves and answer your questions. No gender, sexual orientation, or question is off limits, and all questions remain anonymous. This week’s topic: how to tell if your IUD moved — or if something else is wrong with it . Because sometimes you're not imagining it — there really might be something going on with it. Q: I got a hormonal IUD placed two months ago and was super excited about it. I mean, super effective hormonal birth control I only have to think about every five years? Thank you modern medicine! And it wasn’t even that intense going in . I got some cramps for a couple days after and that was it! But now I’m feeling kinda off — I’m getting cramping between my periods and it hurts when I have sex , which has never happened to me before. Could something be wrong? Like, could my IUD have moved or could it be infected ? Should I go and see my doctor? And until then, should I stop having sex — maybe I'm not safe? A: The IUD is an excellent birth control option, particularly if you don’t want to do something every day but you still want to be extremely well-covered against pregnancy. Most people don’t have any trouble with their IUDs after their body gets used to them . However, some IUDs do end up getting displaced (which is when it moves from where it was placed to a different part of your uterus), embedded in the sides of your uterus, or even expelled . This is pretty rare — expulsion happens under 10 percent of the time, IUDs get embedded under one percent of the time, and perforation of the uterus walls due to an embedded IUD is even rarer. But if you think your IUD might have moved , you'll definitely want to contact your gynecologist right away to check; in rare cases displaced IUDs can puncture your uterus walls and mess with your other internal organs , which is dangerous and must be taken care of. Here are the ways to know if one of these might be happening to you, so you can go to your gynecologist to get it fixed. 1. Your Strings Are Longer Or Shorter Than Before (Or You Can't Feel Them At All) Your IUD has a string attached to the bottom of it, which makes it easy for you to get it taken out when you’re done with it. These strings come out of your uterus, through your cervix, and into your vagina. When your doctor placed your IUD, she cut the strings so you can still feel them, but not so long that they're annoying (or at least, she should have). It's good to know how long your strings are because they tell you if your IUD is still where it's supposed to be. Checking your IUD strings is super simple — with clean hands, put your index or middle finger up into your vagina until you get to your cervix. Your IUD strings should be coming through your cervix and you should be able to feel them there . If you suddenly notice that your strings are longer than they were before, this is a sign that your IUD might have slipped down from where it was placed. Alternately, if you can’t find your strings, this could mean that your IUD has moved further up into your uterus, dragging the strings along with it. If you notice changes in your strings, go visit your gynecologist so she can check you out. Sometimes the strings get tangled and just feel shorter, but other times you might need to get your IUD placed again. 2. You Can Feel The IUD In Your Cervix This one’s pretty obvious. Your IUD is supposed to be placed up inside your uterus ( here’s a picture of where it goes) . Up there, you shouldn't able to feel it. If you notice your IUD is coming out of your cervix or you feel the bottom of it in your cervix, that means it’s too low and is therefore displaced — and might even be in the process of coming out completely. Feeling an IUD in your cervix could mean literally being able to feel it with your fingers as you do a string check — or it could mean your cervix is starting to feel uncomfortable because there's a piece of plastic or metal coming out of it that shouldn't be there. 3. Your Lover Can Feel Something Up There Sometimes you might not notice that there’s something off with your IUD, but your partner will feel the tip of it when you have sex. If your partner notices something hard coming out of your cervix, go check it out at the doctor to make sure it hasn’t slipped. You can even tell your lovers to look out for this in advance — they may be excited for such a sexy way to help you monitor your own health! However, it's good to know that sex itself can't displace your IUD . The myth that a penis can "knock" your IUD out of place is just that: a myth. Don't worry! 4. It Hurts When You Have Sex Some people report that sex changes a bit after you get an IUD, with certain positions feeling a bit more painful . However, if suddenly sex starts hurting, that may be your body telling you that your IUD isn’t where it’s supposed to be . This makes sense — if your IUD has gotten itself displaced, it could have found itself in a place that can make sex more painful, such as poking out of your cervix, which is a tender spot for many folks, even without an IUD. 5. You’re Dealing With Abnormal Vaginal Discharge Vaginal discharge is your body’s totally normal way of cleaning your vagina . However, abnormal discharge can also be a sign that your IUD has slipped and is irritating your body. If you notice that your discharge is off in color, texture, or smell and it’s not a yeast infection or one of the other reasons your discharge can get messed up , contact your doctor to see if your IUD might be the culprit. 6. You’re Bleeding More Than Usual Your period will most likely change after you start your IUD — if you have the hormonal version, you’ll probably start experiencing lighter (or even no) periods once your body gets used to it. In contrast, the non-hormonal copper IUD often makes periods heavier , and lots of people experience some spotting for the first couple months after they get their IUDs. However, if you notice that your bleeding is more intense than usual or you’re spotting heavily between periods, that might be because your IUD is displaced. 7. You're Suddenly Getting Really Intense Cramps JAY DIRECTO/AFP/Getty Images Menstrual cramps are a normal part of having a period for many people. Many people experience cramps right after they get their IUD placed , and if you choose to get the copper (non-hormonal) IUD, this form of birth control can make your cramps more intense. However, unusual cramps and pain can be a sign that your IUD is being expelled — if you notice that your cramps are way stronger all of a sudden or are lasting a lot longer, go visit your doctor to make sure that your IUD isn't the problem. Expulsion happens most often during the first year you have an IUD, so pay particular attention to your cramping pain levels during this time. 8. You Feel Like You Might Be Pregnant If you have an IUD, it's extremely unlikely that you'll get pregnant. However, while an IUD definitely protects you from pregnancy (it's over 99 percent effective ) it also raises your risk of getting an ectopic pregnancy, if indeed you are the unlucky less-than-one-percent who does get pregnant. An ectopic pregnancy is extremely dangerous. In an ectopic pregnancy, your fertilized egg doesn't implant in your uterus where it's supposed to so it can be nourished and have room to grow into a full-blown tiny human. Instead, it gets waylaid in other parts of your body, like one of your fallopian tubes or ovaries, which have neither the food nor the space to grow a baby. Ectopic pregnancies won't make it to term — the egg won't be able to survive. This means you need to get medical treatment to get the fertilized egg removed. How do you know if you have this rare but serious situation on your hands? At first, your symptoms may be identical to the early signs of pregnancy — you might miss your period, you could start feeling nauseated, your breasts might start feeling tender. But then, you'll probably start to notice some spotting and pain in your pelvis or abdomen. Your pain can also end up in your shoulder if your baby is growing in one of your fallopian tubes (which are not in your shoulders but the pain gets referred there). If your fallopian tube ruptures because the egg is too large for it, this will be very painful and will come with heavy abdominal bleeding and lightheadedness or fainting . If you feel any of these symptoms, go to the clinic immediately to get the help you need. The Bottom Line Most people who get IUDs have no challenges . However, if you’re one of the unlucky few who does, don’t worry. Your doctor will help you out, moving your IUD back into place or giving you a new one if the first one is ejected. And then you can go back to living your life — however you choose to live it!

The chances of getting pg with it in are about 2% and the fact that the dr. couldn't see it makes me suspect it probably fell out but I am at a loss as to when or how exactly it came out.     --  Juliet DD 11/06 DS 08/08        See all comments from original poster (4)  Hide all comments from original poster (4)      Load more            Comment            Report this post        4          Comments (35)        / 4                i_like_cheese   Posted 11/09/2009      I was told that your body can expel it during a period, but that usually happens during the first few months of having it in.  I don't know that for sure though.

How long had you had it?  Were you checking the strings regularly?  i didn't check mine enough I realize.  If I get another, I plan to be more diligent with that.    --  - Diamond Princess Pea (11 yo) , Monster Man (8 yo) and  Froggy Boy (5 yo)             Reply            Report this comment       0                     story_girl · Original Poster    Posted 11/09/2009      It was put in last January and was supposed to stay in for a year. I checked the strings in mid-September. I tried to find them again 2 weeks ago and couldn't but put off doing anything about it because I got busy (I know that's a stupid excuse). However, if I'm right about when AF  (Aunt Flo - menstruation/period) last was 2 weeks ago wouldn't have helped.    --  Juliet DD 11/06 DS 08/08             Reply            Report this comment       0                      utmegs    Posted 11/09/2009      That's crazy (and as an IUD user, a little scary!).

I ended up (intentionally) getting pg 4 months later, and got another ParaGard after that birth (about a year ago).  I do check regularly to make sure it's still there, though!     --  We should love, esteem, respect, and serve one another, despite our deepest differences... religious, political, and cultural. - M.

So I went in to get it removed and get a d and c at the same time, and when I woke they told me the mirena was gone, It would of came out during my period, I was having huge clots so wouldnt even of noticed, So just want people to know mirena can fall out without you knowing, unreal wouldnt recommend it to anyone, the whole time I had mood swings and gained weight was more hassel than what its worth.

I got my Mirena 6 weeks pp on Nov 30 2010. I bled heavily until March. After that I had irregular heavy long lastin periods. I always check my strings after each cycle. September cycle was unusually light except for one big clot that I passed. I thought that maybe I was finally going to taper off my periods. I checked my strings and while hard to reach were still there. Last week, I could feel it poking and rubbing me inside. After experiencing nausea, headaches, backaches, bloating, pregnancy symptoms every month, moodiness, depression and anxiety I decided this was the last straw. I called he dr and made an appointment to get it removed. Friday morning about 5 am I woke up feeling like I was gushing. I ran to te bathroom and it looked like a crime scene. There was so much blood. I cleaned ip put on a Padang went bak to bed. Got up at 6:30 and was still gushing dark brownish red blood. I have a long drive to work so I used. Tampon and a pad. I got to work by 8 and felt horrible flooding I went to the bathroom, removed te tampon and changed my pad. I was going to my desk when I felt more gushing. I went back to the bathroom and sat down and plop Mirena is in he toilet The water looks like it is all blood in there and now clots are passing. I called my dr and the nurse said that happens sometimes. She calmed meadow. And said to take a hpt and thu will see me next week. I took he hpt and there was a very faint line. The tweakers were able to pull it. I continued to have blood pouring out all day. Saturday I was passing tissue blood clots and soaking pads every hour. I have had 2 pregnancy losses before. This was the same. I know there is no way to know for certain, by the time I get to the dr I am sure my counts will be too low. The tissue that I passed made me sure of what happened I am in disbelief. I had high hopes that this would work for me. I can't believe I lost another pregnancy. I obviously was not Ina position to have a baby right now but this is a horrible ordeal.  Please if anyone is considering the Mirena read my experience and do not choose it.

I read your story and feel so badly for what you went through.  I'm not sure if you'd ever consider another IUD given what happened, but I have had the paragard and no problems. I'm not sure if it's the IUD that just doesn't work for you or the hormones from the Mirena. Either way I am truly sorry for your loss.    --  Proud Mommy to David (6/24/07) & Abby (6/7/09)             Reply            Report this comment       0                     Mommy2Be46    Last edited 10/25/2011      I do not think that you have lost a pregnancy - this same thing happened to me - minus the IUD actually falling out.    Here is my story - Somehow last week - my IUD dislodged - around Thursday I started to spot - and since my mirena is always unexpected I didn't think much of it. By Saturday evening, I had a full blown period - HORRIBLE. I went to sleep - woke up in a puddle of blood in my bed around 4 am, assuming it was just a heavy period - and I put a tampon in. Within 40 minutes, that full tampon was drenched and falling out of me. This proceeded all day sunday, every 30-40 minutes. I honestly assumed I was having a miscarriage - and on Monday morning I woke up, incredibly nauseated - floaters in my eyes, I could barely move...So I called the advice nurse and went to ER. Ran a bunch of tests etc - I wasn't pregnant, but I lost so much blood I was in horrible shape. We Xrayed the mirena, and she looked in me - and said it dislodged - and it was "hanging on for dear life" the hormones caused my cervix to fully dialate - and this is why I was pouring blood & major blood clots out of me for 3 days. I almost bled to death!  They had to remove it - and here I am sitting here today still fully dialated, feeling like I gave birth yesterday. I am IN PAIN!    I have had my mirena for 2 years now, and never any problems, until this. Your situation sounds identical to mine - they need to check your cervix and uterus though to make sure it didn't puncture anything! This is a very serious matter - If I wouldn't of went into ER they told me it could of been deadly.    --  Mommy to Cameron Michael Born 12.05.09 - Punctual lil man who came on his due date! 7lb 9oz - 20 inches             Reply            Report this comment        2                     dizzy_whirled411 · Original Poster    Posted 10/27/2011     Wow I'm sorry for your experience My bleeding just stopped almost as quickly as it started by the following Wednesday. I went to my dr and he was not concerned about any punctures or issues. I wish I had read your story or I would have had him check. I feel great now that it's out. I just started nuvaring Sunday. So far I have lost 5 lbs and my acne is gone. My hair stopped falling out and I am a ball of energy.  I'm not happy about the way it happened but am so glad it's gone.    --  Come join the October 2010 Private group!

I have my period every month and I bleed a lot to where as soon as I take the tampon out to change it that blood drips out.(I know im sorry tmi) Anyways I don't have the insurance or money to have it taken out by doctor. I went to the ER this year back in Jan cause I was in tons of pain and the took x ray and said that the Mirena was in the right spot and that it hasn't moved. Idk im experience this if my Mirena is in the right spot. I wanna remove it myself but scared. Can anyone help? I would NEVER get the Mirena ever again!

Scared that in some weird way I am going to get pregnant. I just took a test. Then yesterday started bleeding really bad. I took a shower and couldn't feel the strings at all. Just a little nervous. I have a 7 month old right now so we definitely don't need another. If I get it taken out I don't have a way to pay for monthly birth control. So I'm in a predicament.

After her birth I had it put back in and four months after it came out, without pain. So I went to get it put back in two months after the first one came out and almost a week later I started to have contraction like cramps, that hurt. I looked and it came out again only this time with horrible bledding and cramps that made me curl up. I was told I had hemerging cysts and it will go away. After about a week it did but sex is almost unbearable at times and no doctor knows why. It's crazy because that never happen to me until this last incident..  I'll never do that again, but of course, the doctors recommend that I don't NOW.

My cycle started in December of 2015 and it is now November 2016.First I was given provera that didn't work at all. Then doctors have prescribed birth control pills. Take 5 at a time then 4 then 3 and so on . That made me really really really sick . It slowed the cycle down but it did not stop. I was advised by my doctor of the IUD. I bleed very heavy with huge blood clots. My doctor kept saying this IUD would straighten out the issue that had been caused by the Depo shot. I gotta tell you the doctors must get kickbacks for this thing. A waste of $1,000 down the drain. Not only did it make me bleed worse it came out in 2 months with a huge blood clot. DON'T DO IT . I never had a problem with my cycle while not being on birth control. They just kept experimenting about what was wrong. All the while I am bleeding to death and the doctors smiling saying I know its frustrating. If she knew what was going on in my mind!!!! The doctor also kept saying give it at least 3 months.  I finally went to a new doctor who advised me they would have to do a DNC because of how long I have been bleeding and look for other possible reasons for it. Go with your gutt feeling. If one form of birth control is giving you grief go see a SPECIALIST. It will save you time and money .

After 3 appts (long story) to finally get the thing inserted, the RN said it was her easiest insertion in 8 years. She uses ultra sound guidance so we knew it was placed properly. Yesterday I went in for my IUD check. They were just going to trim the strings and send me on my way. Well, upon inserting the speculum, my IUD was "staring her in the face.". Apparently it was sitting on my cervix and I didn't even know :(. Now, I gave wait a couple weeks for a pregnancy test and we'll try again if I want. I doubt I'm pregnant as I am EBF  (extended breastfeeding, exclusively breastfeeding) and ovulation is supressed.  Has this happened to any of you? Should I even bother? What if it happens again and I'm unaware?     --  Mama to 2 sweet girls.

I was told to self-check for the string once a month.  I didn't know that it could be inserted by a RN. My doc did say that he's never had issues with those that he's inserted himself, but he has to fix or deal with poor insertions by others. It might be worth having the insertion done by a OB considering what you've already gone through.

Ive had my iud for about 7 1/2 months and today my iud fell out and I didn't even notice it, I didn't feel a thing so with that said it didn't even hurt. But I was thinking maybe it was loose cause I could feel the strings when inserting a tampon and my fiance could feel it once in a while also. Is it possible that if it was loose that I could have gotten pregnant? I just got my period on monday and haven't had sex so am i ok? or like i said could i have gotten prego when it was loose?

For example: Cramping, falling out, headache, etopic pregnancy, spotting, excessive bleeding, weight gain, fibroids, infection, TSS etc, etc, etc. I too looked into having IUD, but after speaking with my Doctor and hearing the horror stories, it was not the best choice at that time for me. But the fact still remain, there are always exception to every rule.....Years later I see people are having wonderful experiences with IUD's. When I looking into it...No one I personally knew had anything nice to say. Therefore, I went with the most popular opinion at that time. But thats wonderful that many of you had great experiences. The risk was just to great for me...Especially for some birthcontrol. Now if it was something like a pacemaker, of course insert that foreign object in me and ill take that chance.                 a1allen1    Answered 6/13/11                5 found this helpful     i have the plastic little flimsy one, the merina or however you spell it. Honestly, Ive wondered if I have ever had a miscarage on the iud cause you cant tell. They say its the same feeling as if you just had your period and mine is still irregular. But they also say that you could bleed alot too, you might wanna get it checked out or even removed if thats the case. Alot of my friends had theirs removed due to complications, even one was hospitalized for a week. Im debating if I want to get new birth control or use the iud again. But how do i know for sure its not going to fall out again? And I cant use the pill cause thats how I got pregnant in the 1st place. But good luck to you, and hope all works out for you!                 veronica&joey;    Answered 6/9/11               3 found this helpful     I am 5 /12 months pregnant and i have the IUD. I didnt kno I was untill I was already 3 months.My dr. didnt tell me not to have sex right away and I thought all the side affects I was having was due to the IUD.so i think it got loose and i became pregnant. so yea I think is a good possability you could get pregnant if it fell out. If pregnancy is not what you want then its better to be safe then sorry.get to your dr.!!                 stacie-mama-of-5    Answered 6/23/11               3 found this helpful     i have mirena too!!!! ive wanted to get different bc at different times, but changed my mind, that really bothers me, i think i will make an appiontment, ive bled for just about a month now,           a BabyCenter member   Answered 6/9/11               3 found this helpful     Well I dont think its bad news at all, when my iud fell out i was actually sad haha, i enjoy it and have no problems with it at all. Honestly, now that it had fallen out, my cramps are worse and i feel tired and like crap. I miss my iud, but on tuesday I am going into the doctors office to either get a new iud (which i kinda want again) or I am going to get that implant in my arm. The implant kinda worries me cause i have heard great reviews and horrible reviews. But if anything, Im going back to the iud. And im not pregnant! good news i suppose :) I am too young to have another child and I just got accepted back into school. 

Has anyone here had the implant in the arm? If so, what did you think? or what other birth control is great? I cant use the pill cause, i got pregnant on the pill. thanks!                 veronica&joey;    Answered 6/10/11               2 found this helpful     I had the IUD for 5 1/2 years, it worked great! It expired and they told me it would be fine to keep in for a few months extra, so I did. Finally got it removed and three days after that got pregnant. Doctor said I wouldn't get prego until the next ovulation period, but he was wrong. I was a little suprised at how soon I got prego, but it must have been meant to be. Anyway, yes if it was loose, I'd say there is a chance you chould be prego.                 mistibergman    Answered 6/18/11               2 found this helpful     i cant answer your question, but i would like to know what iud you have, bc i also have one and think i could have had a miscarriage, bc of all the bleeding, ive had mine in almost 7 months           a BabyCenter member   Answered 6/9/11               2 found this helpful     IUD are bad news, so many women have problems with them. A friend of mines, had an IUD only for a very short time, but when she had a periods they were terrible. She felt as if she was pregnant.....Emotionanl issues, severe cramping, inability to lose weight. But once it was out, she went back to feeling normal. Its probably a good ideal to have it remove and look at other means of birth control. Also back in the 80's woman had major issues, lots of them suffered fertility issues behind IUD's and there were thousands of class action lawsuits. So just be careful......... 

I'd say it is worth a try removing it (or, rather, having the dr remove it! ) and seeing how things go.                 a1allen1    Answered 6/10/11               1 found this helpful     The IUD itself is not necessarily bad news. If it was put in wrong or fell out then yes, it can cause complications and you can still get pregnant. But the same goes for any bc that isn't taken properly. For some women it causes much more severe side effects, but again, the same goes for any bc. And it doesn't always effect fertility like someone said. Maybe it has in some women but everyone is different. I had an IUD for 2 1/2 years, no problems, no side effects and after the first 6 months or so, almost no periods. I had it taken out when we wanted to try for another baby. Month and a half later I was pregnant. Now we have a wonderful baby boy. Sorry, I know none of this really answers your questions, but I just had to speak to some of the chances that were being told as absolute truths.

This is the default welcome page used to test the correct 
                operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems.
                It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache
                packaging is derived.
                If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at

                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
                interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is fully documented in
                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz . Refer to this for the full
                documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
                found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc package was installed on this server.  The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows:  /etc/apache2/

                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.  Configuration files in the mods-enabled/ , conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain
                           particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
                           fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.  They are activated by symlinking available
                           configuration files from their respective
                           *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed

                           environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be
                           started/stopped with /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl . Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the
                           default configuration.     Document Roots   By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to any file apart of those located in /var/www , public_html directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web
                applications). If your site is using a web document root
                located elsewhere (such as in /srv ) you may need to whitelist your
                document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf .  The default Ubuntu document root is /var/www/html . You
                can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different
                to previous releases which provides better security out of the box.    Reporting Problems   Please use the ubuntu-bug tool to report bugs in the
                Apache2 package with Ubuntu. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug.  Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others)

                can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different
                to previous releases which provides better security out of the box.    Reporting Problems   Please use the ubuntu-bug tool to report bugs in the
                Apache2 package with Ubuntu. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug.  Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others)
                to respective packages, not to the web server itself.              Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page      It works!   This is the default welcome page used to test the correct 
                operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems.
                It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache
                packaging is derived.
                If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at
                this site is working properly. You should replace this file (located at /var/www/html/index.html ) before continuing to operate your HTTP server.  If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is
                about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to
                maintenance.
                If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator.    Configuration Overview   Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
                interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is fully documented in
                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz . Refer to this for the full
                documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
                found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc package was installed on this server.  The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows:  /etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       `--  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|       |-- *.load
|       `-- *.conf
|-- conf-enabled
|       `-- *.conf
|-- sites-enabled
|       `-- *.conf    apache2.conf is the main configuration
                           file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
                           files when starting up the web server.   ports.conf is always included from the
                           main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.  Configuration files in the mods-enabled/ , conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain
                           particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
                           fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.  They are activated by symlinking available
                           configuration files from their respective
                           *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed
                           by using our helpers a2enmod,
                                a2dismod,  a2ensite,
                                a2dissite, and a2enconf,
                                a2disconf . See their respective man pages for detailed information.  The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of
                           environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be
                           started/stopped with /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl . Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the
                           default configuration.     Document Roots   By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to any file apart of those located in /var/www , public_html directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web
                applications). If your site is using a web document root
                located elsewhere (such as in /srv ) you may need to whitelist your
                document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf .  The default Ubuntu document root is /var/www/html . You
                can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different
                to previous releases which provides better security out of the box.    Reporting Problems   Please use the ubuntu-bug tool to report bugs in the
                Apache2 package with Ubuntu. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug.  Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others)
                to respective packages, not to the web server itself.

An IUD is a small, T-shaped device that is made from a flexible plastic and is used to prevent pregnancy. There are five kinds of IUDs, and all are more than 99% effective:  Mirena and Kyleena last 5 years and work by releasing progestin.  Paragard lasts10 years. It is a non-hormonal IUD that contains copper. It can be used as an emergency birth control if it is inserted within the first 5 days after unprotected sex.  Liletta and Skyla both last 3 years and work by releasing progestin.  Mirena and Paragard are offered at UHS.  How does it work?  IUDs are inserted in the uterus by a health care provider to prevent pregnancy.  IUDs may prevent pregnancy by:  Thickening cervical mucus  Affecting the way sperm move  Changing the lining of the uterus  Preventing ovulation  How effective is it?  IUDs are one of the most effective methods of contraception. Fewer than 1 out of 100 users will get pregnant each year.  What are the benefits?  While the initial cost may seem expensive, over time IUDs are the least expensive and longest lasting method of birth control.  You do not have to remember to take it every day/week/month or every time you have sex.  An IUD is a good option for users who cannot use estrogen or who are breastfeeding.  The ParaGard IUD (copper) does not affect your hormone levels.  Hormonal IUDs may reduce cramps and make your period lighter. Periods may stop altogether, which some users consider a benefit.  Your ability to become pregnant quickly returns after the IUD is removed.  What are the downsides?  Spotting between periods for the first 3-6 months.  Cramps and backache for the first month after the IUD is inserted. With time, these decrease in intensity and frequency.  With Paraguard, you may experience heavier periods and/or increased cramping.  IUDs do not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STI). Use male condoms or female condoms if you are at risk for STI.  The IUD may slip out of the uterus, either partially or completely; this is called expulsion. If it comes out even a little bit, it must be removed. If the IUD slips out, pregnancy can happen.  Perforation: When an IUD is inserted, it may push through the wall of the uterus, but this is uncommon (less than 1% of users).  Risk of infection that decreases after the first 20 days after IUD insertion.  How do I check my IUD?  You should check your IUD every month to make sure it has not slipped out. An IUD is most likely to slip out of place during your period. IUDs have strings attached to them. Between periods you can check for the strings by following these steps:  Wash your hands.  Sit or squat down.  Put your index or middle finger up into your vagina until you touch the cervix.  Feel for the string ends that should be coming through. If you find them, then the IUD is in place and working.  If the strings feel longer or shorter than before, or you feel the hard, plastic part of the IUD against your cervix, the IUD may have moved.  If the IUD has slipped out or moved, do not try to put it back in place on your own. Be sure to use a back-up method of birth control until you see your health care provider.  Where can I get it and what are costs?  IUDs (ParaGard and Mirena) are available at UHS. See Schedule an Appointment , and Cost, Insurance and Payment .  How to Prepare for Your IUD or Implant Insertion  Important tips:  During insertion, your clinician will:  Put a speculum into your vagina  Cleanse the area with antibacterial solution to minimize the chance of infection  Put an instrument on your cervix to stabilize it; this will cause cramping  Put an instrument into your uterus to measure its depth  Insert the IUD  You should not use an IUD if you:  Have or may have a current STI or other pelvic infection  Think you might be pregnant  Have cervical or uterine cancer  Have unexplained vaginal bleeding  Are or may be allergic to copper (ParaGard IUD only)  Personal experiences   I got the Mirena IUD inserted almost 4 years ago. Other than the initial cramping at insertion, I have had a great experience with it. I did have some initial spotting my first month but it's been smooth sailing since. I remember reading that some people gained weight; this never happened to me. I love this IUD and highly recommend it to anyone! (I have also tried Depo-Provera and birth control pills, neither of which were as stress-free as Mirena.)    I've had my Paragard IUD in for about 8 months now and I'm extremely satisfied with it. I experienced minor side effects of cramps and increased blood flow the first couple of months but after that everything went back to normal.  I would highly suggest it for others who need a long term birth control with minimal side effects and no hormones but at the same time would like to get pregnant in the future. It is so convenient not having to worry about birth control before every time I want to have sex.   Where can I get more information?  Talk to your health care provider.

Pregnancy With an IUD: Is It Possible?  Becoming pregnant when you have an IUD isn't common, but it can happen. Find out the symptoms and implications of an IUD pregnancy. By Elena Donovan Mauer  Facebook  Pinterest  Twitter  Text  Email  Print         wavebreakmedia/ Shutterstock.com  An intrauterine device, or IUD, is one of the most popular and effective forms of birth control -- and it's rare to become pregnant while using one. "The IUD has a 99.7 percent efficacy rate," says Lanalee Araba Sam, M.D., an ob-gyn in Ft. Lauderdale. "Very, very few women with one will become pregnant. But I always tell my patients that someone on this planet is that one-in-a-million exception. There are instances where someone becomes pregnant with an IUD in place." If you're concerned that that could be you, it's completely understandable, since about 25 percent of women stop having their period while on Mirena, a type of IUD that uses the hormone progesterone to prevent pregnancy, says Cristina Perez, M.D., an ob-gyn at the Women's Specialists of Houston at Texas Children's Pavilion for Women. The other type of IUD, ParaGard, uses copper to prevent pregnancy. "ParaGard has no hormones," Dr. Perez explains, so if you're using it, you should still be getting your period as long as you're not pregnant. Wondering if you're pregnant? Take our quiz! Symptoms of an IUD pregnancy A pregnancy with an IUD in place typically has the same symptoms as any regular pregnancy -- including breast tenderness, nausea, and fatigue -- so if you're experiencing those symptoms and you have missed your period, call your doctor right away to find out if you're pregnant. It's important to catch such a pregnancy early. An at-home pregnancy test might not indicate a pregnancy as early as a blood test in the office would, so you'll want to be tested by a medical professional. Shop for at-home pregnancy tests IUD pregnancy risks Unfortunately, there are additional risks involved with an IUD pregnancy. "You're 50 percent more likely to miscarry if the IUD is left in place, so the recommendation is to let the pregnancy continue and remove the IUD," says Dr. Sam. But even then, Dr. Sam adds, you're 25 percent more likely to miscarry even if the IUD is removed. So your doctor will want to monitor an IUD pregnancy closely. There's also a higher risk of ectopic or tubal pregnancy, in which the fertilized egg stays in the fallopian tubes rather than in the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies almost always end in loss of the pregnancy, and need to be treated quickly to prevent permanent damage to the woman's reproductive system. If you are, in fact, pregnant, your doctor will likely test your blood once, and then again 48 hours later, to make sure the pregnancy hormone, hCG, steadily rises, so he can confirm that your pregnancy is progressing. If it does, it's not an ectopic pregnancy . Pregnancy after an IUD Although becoming pregnant with an IUD in place is rare, getting pregnant after having an IUD removed isn't. (That's good news if you want to conceive, and fair warning if you don't!) If you have decided to try to conceive, give your ob-gyn a call to have your IUD removed, and get busy trying. Some doctors recommend waiting three months after removal before you start trying to conceive, to give your body time to get back to its usual menstrual cycle. This helps you to understand when you're ovulating and most fertile. But according to Dr. Perez, there's no medical need to wait: "You can ovulate and get pregnant the next month!" Are You Pregnant?

Medically reviewed by Janet Brito, PhD, LCSW, CST on  July 10, 2017 — Written by Annette McDermott Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are popular and effective forms of birth control. Most IUDs stay in place after insertion, but some occasionally shift or fall out. This is known as expulsion. Learn about IUD insertion and expulsion, and find information on the types of IUDs and how they work.  The IUD insertion process  The IUD insertion process usually takes place at a doctor’s office. Your doctor should discuss the insertion procedure and its risks before insertion occurs. You may be advised to take an over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen an hour before your scheduled procedure .  The IUD insertion process consists of several steps:   Your doctor will insert a speculum into your vagina.  Your doctor will thoroughly clean your cervix and vaginal areas with an antiseptic.  You may be given numbing medication to lessen discomfort.  Your doctor will insert an instrument called a tenaculum into your cervix to stabilize it.  Your doctor will insert an instrument called a uterine sound into your uterus to measure the depth of your uterus.  Your doctor will insert an IUD through the cervix.   At some point during the procedure, you’ll be shown how to find the IUD strings. The strings hang into your vagina.  Most people resume normal activities after the insertion procedure. Some doctors advise avoiding vaginal sex, hot baths, or tampon use for a couple of days after insertion to reduce the risk of infection .  What to do if your IUD is expelled  Expulsion occurs when your IUD falls out of the uterus. It may fall out partially or completely. It’s not always clear why an IUD is expelled, but the risk of it happening is higher during your period. If an IUD is expelled to any degree, it must be removed.  Expulsion is more likely for women who:   have never been pregnant  are younger than 20 years old  have heavy or painful periods  have the IUD inserted after an abortion during the second trimester of pregnancy   You should check your IUD strings each month after your period to make sure the IUD is still in place. You should contact your doctor right away if any of the following events occur:   The strings seem shorter than usual.  The strings seem longer than usual.  You can’t locate the strings.  You’re able to feel your IUD.   Don’t attempt to push the IUD back in place or remove it on your own. You should also use an alternative method of birth control, such as a condom.  To check your IUD strings, follow these steps:   Wash your hands.  While you’re sitting or squatting, put your finger into your vagina until you touch your cervix.  Feel for the strings. They should be hanging through the cervix.   If your IUD has become partially dislodged or expelled completely, you may feel pain or discomfort. Other symptoms associated with expulsion include:   severe cramping  heavy or abnormal bleeding  an abnormal discharge  a fever, which may also be a symptom of an infection   About IUDs  An IUD is a small, T-shaped device that can prevent pregnancy. It’s made of flexible plastic and used for long-term pregnancy prevention or emergency birth control . Two thin strings are attached to help you make sure the IUD is in place and to assist your doctor with removal . There are two types of IUDs .  Hormonal IUDs , such as Mirena , Liletta, and Skyla brands, release the hormone progestin to prevent ovulation. They also help thicken cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and fertilize an egg. Hormonal IUDs work for three to five years.  A copper IUD called ParaGard has copper wrapped around its arms and stem. It releases copper to help prevent sperm from reaching an egg. It also helps change the lining of the uterus. This makes it harder for a fertilized egg to implant into the uterine wall. The ParaGard IUD works for up to 10 years.  Mirena vs. ParaGard vs. Skyla: Choosing the Right IUD    Cost of an IUD  Special considerations for IUD use  Common IUD side effects include spotting between periods, cramping, and back pain, especially for a few days after IUD insertion. Risk of pelvic infection increases for a few weeks after insertion. Less than 1 percent of IUD users experience uterine perforation, which is when the IUD pushes through the uterine wall.  In the case of ParaGard, your periods may be heavier than normal for several months after IUD insertion. Hormonal IUDs may cause periods to be lighter.  Some women shouldn’t get an IUD. Talk to your doctor if:   you have a pelvic infection or sexually transmitted infection  you might be pregnant  you have uterine or cervical cancer  you have unexplained vaginal bleeding  you have a history of ectopic pregnancy  you have a suppressed  immune system   Sometimes, specific IUDs aren’t recommended if you have certain conditions. Mirena and Skyla aren’t advised if you have acute liver disease or jaundice . ParaGard isn’t advised if you’re allergic to copper or have Wilson’s disease .  Choosing the right birth control  You may find the IUD to be a perfect fit for you . However, after trying it, you may realize that it’s not exactly what you want. Talk to your doctor about all of your options for birth control .  When sifting through your options, you should consider the following factors:   Do you want to have children in the future?  Are you at risk of contracting HIV or another sexually transmitted disease?  Will you remember to take birth control pills daily?  Do you smoke or are you over the age of 35?  Are there negative side effects?  Is it easily available and affordable?  Are you comfortable inserting a birth control device, if applicable?   The takeaway  An IUD is one of the most effective forms of birth control. In most cases, it stays in place and you can forget about it until it’s time to have it removed. If it does fall out, use backup birth control and call your doctor to determine if the IUD should be reinserted. If you try the IUD and don’t feel it’s the best choice for you, talk with your doctor about other birth control options available to you.

They’re one of the most effective methods of birth control.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    IUDs, or intrauterine devices, are more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy (they're tied for first with the contraceptive implant — when not including permanent birth control). And unlike other birth control options like the pill, the ring, or condoms, there isn't a risk for straight-up human error. Your doctor inserts the IUD and it just stays there. It's a set-it-and-forget-it thing. So if you're not the best at remembering to take pills or replace your Nuvaring, this might be a great option for you.         There are two main kinds: hormonal IUDs and copper IUDs.          Share On email    Email        Share On copy    Copy Link        Share On facebook    Share            Advertisement       2.  The hormonal IUD is a tiny plastic device that contains the hormone levonorgestrel, which is slowly released into the uterus.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    This hormone thickens the cervical mucus, making it a hostile environment for sperm, so they can't get up there to reach the egg, Dr. Mary Jane Minkin, clinical professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive science at Yale School of Medicine, tells BuzzFeed Life. It's also possible that the hormonal IUD sometimes works by stopping the release of an egg or by thinning the lining of the uterus, which would make it harder for a fertilized egg to attach, but these aren't the primary mechanisms. Most of the time, it just keeps sperm away from your uterus. There are currently three hormonal IUD options on the market in the U.S.: Mirena (which can stay in up to five years), Skyla (which is a bit smaller and can stay in up to three years), and Liletta (which was just approved by the Food and Drug Administration and can stay in up to three years).        3.  The copper IUD is a tiny device made of plastic and copper, and it’s totally free of hormones.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    It works similarly to the hormonal IUD, but instead of levonorgestrel, it's copper that's continuously being released into your uterus. The copper is actually toxic to sperm, making it pretty much impossible for the sperm to get to the egg and penetrate it, Dr. Jennifer Gunter, OB-GYN, tells BuzzFeed Life. Again, it's possible that the copper IUD could sometimes work by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting, but that's not the primary mechanism. There is currently one copper IUD on the market, Paragard, and it can stay in up to 10 years.        4.  They’re super popular among female doctors.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    Female family planning providers are more likely to use the IUD than any other form of birth control, according to a recent study in the journal Contraception .        5.  And they’ve been suggested as a safe and effective birth control method for teens.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    They're not just for women who have already given birth. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggested IUDs and implants as "first-line contraceptive choices for adolescents."           Advertisement       6.  IUDs got a bad rap after an earlier version caused serious health problems.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    Back in the 1970s, a previous version of the IUD called the Dalkon Shield was linked to a lot of horrible pelvic infections that reportedly led to infertility and even death. One of the biggest design flaws was that it had a braided, multifilament string that allowed bacteria to climb up into the uterus, Dr. Lisa Perriera, OB-GYN, tells BuzzFeed Life. This is unlike the IUDs we have today, which are actually designed to reduce the rate of infection. But all that bad press and the legal battles made people pretty hesitant about them for a while. Fortunately, we now have safe and effective methods on the market, and many more doctors have been properly trained in the benefits and insertion of IUDs.        7.  IUDs are good options for pretty much anyone who wants lasting pregnancy protection.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    The copper IUD is especially good for women who prefer hormone-free birth control, and the hormonal IUD is great for anyone who can't be on estrogen-containing birth control. The truth is, there are very few people are not good candidates for an IUD, says Minkin.        8.  But obviously, they’re not for everyone.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    There are some cases where you should not get the IUD, for instance: - If you're pregnant or think you might be pregnant. - If you have any uterine abnormalities that would make it hard for the IUD to stay in place (your doctor can check for this). - If you have acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or a history of PID. - If you have any unexplained genital or uterine bleeding. - If you've had postpartum endometritis or an infected abortion in the past three months. - If you have severe liver disease. - If you have breast cancer or a history of breast cancer, you should not get the hormonal IUD, but your doctor might suggest the copper IUD. - If you have any untreated pelvic infections (like chlamydia) or are prone to pelvic infections, you may not be a good candidate for either IUD. Talk to your doctor about this history before getting an IUD. - If you have Wilson's disease (a rare disorder where copper can accumulate in the body) you cannot get the copper IUD. This is not an exhaustive list, so make sure to go over a detailed medical history with your doctor before deciding on the IUD.         9.  They don’t actually stop you from ovulating.

Even the progestin in the hormonal IUD stays mostly in your uterus, with very little getting absorbed into your bloodstream. For some women, these hormones may impact ovulation a little bit in the first year or so, but that will balance out after a while, says Gunter. And if you're on the copper IUD, it won't affect ovulation at all.           Advertisement       10.  They start working pretty much immediately.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    The copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception, so it starts working as soon as it's in, says Gunter. The hormonal IUD is also immediately effective if you insert it within seven days of the start of your period, but if you get it inserted any other time, doctors generally recommend using a backup birth control (like a condom) for a week, says Perriera.         11.

Some people report worse periods and cramps on the copper IUD.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    You may have heard that some people have nonstop periods or hellish cramps on the copper IUD. Here's the thing: Research does show that a small percentage of women will get heavier periods on this method, says Gunter. That said, it may also be the case that some women try the copper IUD after trying other hormonal birth control methods, and their periods just seem worse by comparison. Since the copper IUD has no hormones, it won't make your period lighter or your cramps less awful the way that the pill, the ring, or the hormonal IUD would, says Minkin. If you're someone who prefers those hormones to even out your cycle, the copper IUD probably wouldn't be the best fit.         13.  With the hormonal IUD, you may have little to no period.

For most people, this is the best benefit of all time, but others might actually miss that monthly reassurance that they're not pregnant.           Advertisement        14.  But beware: You might bleed A LOT when you first get the hormonal IUD.

"Like, you're ruining a lot of underwear." But the good news is that the bleeding will gradually decrease over time. And remember that most people have lighter or nonexistent periods after the half-year point.        15.  Insertion is typically quick, but it can be uncomfortable for some and super painful for others.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    Most people feel cramping for a day or so, but it's typically not too bad. Studies show that most women feel mild discomfort, but about a third of women report pain scores of five or more, says Gunter. It might be more uncomfortable if you typically feel pain with pelvic exams or if you have never been pregnant or delivered a baby before, since your cervix might require more dilation. The best advice is to take some pain medication beforehand and not psyche yourself out about it, says Gunter. "If you're worried something is going to hurt, it's more likely to hurt," she says.         16.  Here’s what it’s actually like to get an IUD:              Share On facebook    Share        Share On pinterest      Share On pinterest    Pin        Share On email    Email        Share On copy    Copy Link         Keith Brofsky / Getty Images / Via thinkstockphotos.com        Share On facebook    Share        Share On pinterest      Share On pinterest    Pin      We asked Gunter and Minkin to give us a play-by-play so you know exactly what to expect. First your doctor will insert a speculum into your vagina (like when you get a Pap smear). Then they clean the cervix and examine your uterus to see how long it is and what direction it is. Then they load the IUD into a tiny tube like a straw (with the arms collapsed in), and push it through, so it releases into your uterus and the arms open up. Finally, they cut the strings that hang off the end of it, so that you and your partner can't feel them unless you really go looking for them. The whole process typically only takes a few minutes. Most doctors will schedule a follow-up visit after your next period so they can make sure everything's going well. "If something is going to happen, that would be the time frame where we would see it," says Minkin.         17.  Your doctor will explain how to check for the strings periodically — just to make sure it’s still in place.

Minkin explains that feeling for the strings almost feels like using your finger to touch a string on the tip of your nose. It's very rare for the IUD to slip out of place, but if you don't feel the strings, you should still call your doctor to see what's up.           Advertisement       18.  You should get an STI test before you get the IUD.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    You've probably heard of the association between IUDs and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is most likely to occur around the time of insertion, and it's often the result of a sexually transmitted disease, says Minkin. That's because both chlamydia and gonorrhea can be completely symptomless, and if left untreated they can lead to PID. "If you have an IUD and you get exposed to gonorrhea or chlamydia, you might have a higher risk of an infection that spreads," says Gunter. For this reason, it's crucial to get tested for these infections before you get an IUD and any time you may be at risk while you have an IUD in. Your doctor may test you for chlamydia and gonorrhea right before she inserts the IUD, which is also fine as long as you treat the infections immediately if your test comes back positive, says Minkin. Remember: IUDs do not protect against HIV and STIs , so use a condom unless you're in a mutually monogamous relationship and you've both been tested recently. Here's everything you need to know about getting tested — including which tests you need and how often.         19.  There are a few other serious side effects associated with IUDs, but they’re very rare.              Share On facebook    Share        Share On pinterest      Share On pinterest    Pin        Share On email    Email        Share On copy    Copy Link          memegenerator.net        Share On facebook    Share        Share On pinterest      Share On pinterest    Pin      One risk is perforation, which is when the IUD attaches to or goes through the wall of the uterus. It's very rare, with studies showing it occurs in less than 1% of people with IUDs, says Gunter. It's slightly more common if you're breastfeeding, if you have an oddly shaped uterus, or if you just have an inexperienced provider. If you have severe pain during or after insertion, be sure to tell your doctor. Another risk is expulsion, where the IUD comes out partially or completely. Talk to your doctor if you think this has happened or if you're experiencing any pain. It's also possible to develop ovarian cysts with the hormonal IUD, but these typically disappear on their own. These side effects are all very uncommon, and they're explained in the prescribing information for your IUD. Even though they're rare, talk to your doctor about them at your appointment so you know if you're at risk and what to watch out for.        20.  If you can't take birth control pills for some reason, you might still be able to use an IUD.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    You doctor may have told you that you're not a good candidate for the birth control pill because you have a history of blood clots, have migraines with aura, have high blood pressure, are over 35 and smoke, or have other factors that may not mix well with hormonal birth control. If this is the case, you can probably still use one of the IUDs. That's because neither of these contain estrogen, which is the hormone to blame for these warnings. For this reason, lots of people who can't take the Pill are actually better off on the hormonal IUD. And if you really can't be on a hormonal method, the copper IUD would be a great alternative.        21.  Your insurance should cover IUDs, but it might not.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, your insurance company ~should~ cover all FDA–approved birth control methods — including the IUD — at no cost (unless you have a grandfathered plan or a plan through a company with an exemption). But without insurance, the IUD can be a very large upfront cost. Be sure to call your insurance company before your appointment so you know exactly what it will cost.         22.  If you get pregnant while you have an IUD (which is incredibly unlikely), it’s more likely to be ectopic.

If you do get pregnant with an IUD, it's more likely to be an ectopic pregnancy (one where the embryo implants outside the uterus, often in the fallopian tubes), says Gunter. However, it's important to note that having an IUD doesn't raise your risk of having an ectopic pregnancy in general. If you think you may be pregnant, contact your doctor immediately.        23.  IUDs have the highest satisfaction rate of all reversible birth control options.        View this photo on Instagram       instagram.com    Obviously not every birth control method will be right for every person, but one thing to keep in mind if you're considering an IUD is that they have super-high satisfaction rates, says Gunter. In one study in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology , IUD users had the highest rate of continuation in the first year. Just remember: Every body is different and responds to medication differently. So talk to your doctor and listen to your body to find the best method of contraception for you.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest IMAGE POINT FR / BSIP All hail the IUD , one of the best options anyone with a uterus has in the way of reliable long-term contraception. The little T-shaped device fits right inside the uterus and comes in both hormonal and non-hormonal forms. The hormonal IUDs —Mirena, which last for five years, and Skyla and Liletta, which last for three—thicken cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to squirm their way over to an egg. They also thin the uterine lining so if an egg does get fertilized, it has trouble latching on to the uterus to receive nutrients. The non-hormonal IUD, ParaGard, lasts for a whopping 10 years and uses copper to create a toxic environment for sperm . IUDs may be small, but they're certainly effective, offering over 99 percent protection against pregnancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . But as it says right in the name, intrauterine devices need to get implanted in the uterus. Just like any other medical procedure, that comes with potential complications, albeit small ones. Namely, there's a tiny chance the IUD will expel itself (aka fall out) or perforate your uterus (pierce one of the uterine walls). Ob/gyns want you to know the chance of either of these happening is so small, it absolutely shouldn’t deter you if you’re intrigued by everything IUDs have to offer. But if you’re going to get one, you might as well go into it fully prepared for anything. It’s totally understandable to worry that something in your uterus might make its way out of your uterus (via your vagina), but experts want to assure you: Expulsions are not at all common. "It does occur, but very rarely," Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale Medical School, tells SELF. Jamil Abdur-Rahman , M.D., board-certified ob/gyn and chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Vista East Medical Center in Waukegan, Illinois, agrees."In 15 years at my practice, I think I’ve seen it maybe three times," he tells SELF. Specifically, reported expulsion rates are around 3 to 5 percent, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists . Experts still aren't sure of the medical reason behind expulsion. It's more common during your period and also more likely to happen in the first few months after insertion. Minkin's even heard of it happening while people have "a tremendous bowel movement ." But basically, as she explains, for whatever reason, "your uterus says, 'I'm tired of having this in here' and spits it out." It might just be a factor of having a foreign body in there, says Abdur-Rahman. The main sign your IUD is expelling itself is an obvious one: You actually see it somewhere outside of your body. You might experience a little cramping beforehand as the uterus works to expel it, says Minkin, but otherwise, your IUD showing up in your underwear like, "surprise!!!" is the only real way to know for sure without the help of a doctor. And sometimes that doesn't even happen because the IUD expels itself partway into the vagina, but doesn't fully come out. Experiencing a perforated IUD is even less common than dealing with an expelled one. It only happens in 1 out of every 1,000 insertions, according to ACOG , and it's most common around the time of insertion. That's because perforation often happens due to improper placement, says Abdur-Rahman. Insertion is a "blind procedure," he explains, meaning doctors don't get to see what they're doing. "When you're inserting an IUD , you push it [past the cervix] through a tube that's like a narrow straw. It squirts out into the uterus and the arms pop open," says Minkin. The thing is, around one in four or one in five women has a retroverted, or tilted, uterus, says Abdur-Rahman. That's when the uterus is tipped backward instead of forward, meaning an IUD's wings can more easily wind up where they shouldn't. Unlike an expulsion, perforation usually causes major signs something is off. Since the uterus is mainly made of muscle, it reacts readily to things going wrong. "[The uterus] will involuntarily contract, so you might notice a lot of cramp-y pain and pain with intercourse ," says Abdur-Rahman. Keep in mind that cramping is normal during and after insertion, so he means severe cramping that lasts for weeks. You might also experience spotting . And if the IUD perforates the uterus enough, it might also affect the bladder or rectum (which both abut the uterus, so in an extreme situation, could be pierced by a runaway IUD). In that exceedingly rare case, you may notice pain or blood when using the bathroom, Abdur-Rahman explains. Expulsion and perforation are the few things that can make IUDs less effective. Two of the three patients Abdur-Rahman saw with expelled IUDs realized what happened because they got pregnant (yes, scary, but remember: highly unlikely!). Your fertility returns as soon as the IUD is gone, so an expelled one is pretty useless at keeping you baby-free. It's less black and white with perforations—sometimes they still offer some measure of protection, but that depends on the specific situation, says Abdur-Rahman. Either way, expulsion and perforation both warrant a trip to the doctor. There's one helpful way to get an idea of whether your IUD is acting up. Two weeks to a month after insertion, your doctor will have you go back so they can check the IUD's placement, either with a physical exam or ultrasound. Then they'll recommend you do so yourself once a month by inserting a finger or two into your vagina and feeling for the IUD's strings hanging out of your cervix (which, according to Minkin, feels a lot like a nose). "Imagine touching your nose and having threads coming out of it—that’s what your IUD feels like. If someone can't feel their strings, I have them come in," she says. Your cervix moves a bit based on your cycle, so it's key to do this at the same time each month so you factor that in, says Abdur-Rahman. "A lot of times if the IUD is moving down and close to being expelled, you'll notice the strings are longer," says Abdur-Rahman. "If it’s moving up and getting closer to perforating the uterus, the strings might seem shorter," he says. That's not always the case, but it's good to keep in mind. But if you don't feel the strings, don't panic! There could be a completely normal explanation. The longer you have your IUD , the more likely it is for the strings to soften or curl up behind your cervix, so you might not always feel them, and usually that's not a sign anything is wrong. But if you're worried, your doctor can examine you physically and break out an ultrasound machine if need be. And if it turns out you have experienced an expulsion or perforation, you can likely still get another IUD if you want. There's usually no reason not to give it another go after an expulsion, but a prior perforation may require insertion with an ultrasound so doctors can see exactly where they're placing it this time around, says Abdur-Rahman.

CNWN Collection     Newsletter What Should You Do If Your IUD Falls Out? Medically reviewed by Janet Brito, PhD, LCSW, CST on  July 10, 2017 — Written by Annette McDermott Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are popular and effective forms of birth control. Most IUDs stay in place after insertion, but some occasionally shift or fall out. This is known as expulsion. Learn about IUD insertion and expulsion, and find information on the types of IUDs and how they work.  The IUD insertion process  The IUD insertion process usually takes place at a doctor’s office. Your doctor should discuss the insertion procedure and its risks before insertion occurs. You may be advised to take an over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen an hour before your scheduled procedure .  The IUD insertion process consists of several steps:   Your doctor will insert a speculum into your vagina.  Your doctor will thoroughly clean your cervix and vaginal areas with an antiseptic.  You may be given numbing medication to lessen discomfort.  Your doctor will insert an instrument called a tenaculum into your cervix to stabilize it.  Your doctor will insert an instrument called a uterine sound into your uterus to measure the depth of your uterus.  Your doctor will insert an IUD through the cervix.   At some point during the procedure, you’ll be shown how to find the IUD strings. The strings hang into your vagina.  Most people resume normal activities after the insertion procedure. Some doctors advise avoiding vaginal sex, hot baths, or tampon use for a couple of days after insertion to reduce the risk of infection .  What to do if your IUD is expelled  Expulsion occurs when your IUD falls out of the uterus. It may fall out partially or completely. It’s not always clear why an IUD is expelled, but the risk of it happening is higher during your period. If an IUD is expelled to any degree, it must be removed.  Expulsion is more likely for women who:   have never been pregnant  are younger than 20 years old  have heavy or painful periods  have the IUD inserted after an abortion during the second trimester of pregnancy   You should check your IUD strings each month after your period to make sure the IUD is still in place. You should contact your doctor right away if any of the following events occur:   The strings seem shorter than usual.  The strings seem longer than usual.  You can’t locate the strings.  You’re able to feel your IUD.   Don’t attempt to push the IUD back in place or remove it on your own. You should also use an alternative method of birth control, such as a condom.  To check your IUD strings, follow these steps:   Wash your hands.  While you’re sitting or squatting, put your finger into your vagina until you touch your cervix.  Feel for the strings. They should be hanging through the cervix.   If your IUD has become partially dislodged or expelled completely, you may feel pain or discomfort. Other symptoms associated with expulsion include:   severe cramping  heavy or abnormal bleeding  an abnormal discharge  a fever, which may also be a symptom of an infection   About IUDs  An IUD is a small, T-shaped device that can prevent pregnancy. It’s made of flexible plastic and used for long-term pregnancy prevention or emergency birth control . Two thin strings are attached to help you make sure the IUD is in place and to assist your doctor with removal . There are two types of IUDs .  Hormonal IUDs , such as Mirena , Liletta, and Skyla brands, release the hormone progestin to prevent ovulation. They also help thicken cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and fertilize an egg. Hormonal IUDs work for three to five years.  A copper IUD called ParaGard has copper wrapped around its arms and stem. It releases copper to help prevent sperm from reaching an egg. It also helps change the lining of the uterus. This makes it harder for a fertilized egg to implant into the uterine wall. The ParaGard IUD works for up to 10 years.  Mirena vs. ParaGard vs. Skyla: Choosing the Right IUD    Cost of an IUD  Special considerations for IUD use  Common IUD side effects include spotting between periods, cramping, and back pain, especially for a few days after IUD insertion. Risk of pelvic infection increases for a few weeks after insertion. Less than 1 percent of IUD users experience uterine perforation, which is when the IUD pushes through the uterine wall.  In the case of ParaGard, your periods may be heavier than normal for several months after IUD insertion. Hormonal IUDs may cause periods to be lighter.  Some women shouldn’t get an IUD. Talk to your doctor if:   you have a pelvic infection or sexually transmitted infection  you might be pregnant  you have uterine or cervical cancer  you have unexplained vaginal bleeding  you have a history of ectopic pregnancy  you have a suppressed  immune system   Sometimes, specific IUDs aren’t recommended if you have certain conditions. Mirena and Skyla aren’t advised if you have acute liver disease or jaundice . ParaGard isn’t advised if you’re allergic to copper or have Wilson’s disease .  Choosing the right birth control  You may find the IUD to be a perfect fit for you . However, after trying it, you may realize that it’s not exactly what you want. Talk to your doctor about all of your options for birth control .  When sifting through your options, you should consider the following factors:   Do you want to have children in the future?  Are you at risk of contracting HIV or another sexually transmitted disease?  Will you remember to take birth control pills daily?  Do you smoke or are you over the age of 35?  Are there negative side effects?  Is it easily available and affordable?  Are you comfortable inserting a birth control device, if applicable?   The takeaway  An IUD is one of the most effective forms of birth control. In most cases, it stays in place and you can forget about it until it’s time to have it removed. If it does fall out, use backup birth control and call your doctor to determine if the IUD should be reinserted. If you try the IUD and don’t feel it’s the best choice for you, talk with your doctor about other birth control options available to you.

Caroline Praderio/INSIDER The INSIDER Summary: IUDs are a great way to prevent pregnancy. But it's possible for them to move out of place after insertion. Gynecologist Alyssa Dweck told INSIDER what warning signs to look for. Her advice: Check the strings, watch for excessive pain and bleeding, keep your follow-up appointment, and call your doctor if you suspect something's amiss. surging in popularity right now super effective, low-maintenance way to prevent pregnancy So INSIDER asked gynecologist Alyssa Dweck, MD , author of " The Complete A to Z for your V ," about the warning signs of wandering IUDs. Here's what you need to know. 1. Go to your follow-up appointment. Most doctors will ask you to come back about a month after insertion just to check that the IUD hasn't moved. Since complications are most likely to occur in the weeks just after insertion, it's important that you keep this appointment. 2. Check your strings. A copper IUD. Shutterstock At the end of every IUD there are two thin strings that the doctor will eventually use to pull the device out of your body. When the IUD is in place, the strings will hang down from your cervix into the very top of your vagina. Most doctors will advise you to reach up and feel the strings once a month, at home, just to make sure that the IUD is still in place. If you're unsure of how to reach them — or you just want to know what they feel like — ask your doctor to teach you right when you get the IUD inserted. Dweck said it's important to check your strings every month. Not being able to feel them doesn't always indicate a problem, but it could mean that your IUD has moved. "If you've always felt the strings and all of a sudden you don't, call your doctor and come in and get checked," Dweck said. 3. Check the toilet (seriously). You might find your IUD in here. Shutterstock It is possible for the IUD to be expelled from your uterus. But don't worry — it'd be really difficult to miss. "Normally you're going to have some pretty bad cramps, maybe some bleeding, and you're going to find your IUD either in your underwear, in your vagina, or in the toilet," Dweck said. If that happens, call your doctor. 4. Know about perforation. Perforation — when the IUD pushes through and out of your uterus — only happens in about 1 in 1,000 IUD insertions . But it is possible, and if it happens, you may need surgery to get the IUD removed. If the IUD has traveled outside your uterus, you'll probably have significant pain or discomfort . Women who've written accounts of their own IUD perforations usually say that the pain is incapacitating. Also, do a self-check on your strings. If you can't find them, it could indicate that your IUD isn't in place. When in doubt, trust your instinct and call your doctor. "I have to really make the plug for common sense," Dweck said. "If something doesn't feel right, just come in. We'd rather see." 5. Look out for abnormal pain or bleeding. You shouldn't need pain meds for more than a few days after insertion. Shutterstock After insertion, you should expect some amount of cramping and irregular bleeding , but excessive pain and bleeding could signal that something's amiss. "After a day or two [post-insertion], requiring medication for pain is not expected," Dweck said. If the pain is that bad, make an appointment to see your doctor. "Foul-smelling bleeding should be checked out, because that could be a kind of infection," she added. "Very heavy bleeding, where you're soaking or saturating a pad or two every hour — that's way too much and should be checked out." Have more questions about IUDs?

IUD expulsion isn't common, but it does happen. Here's what you should know about it.  by
Claire Tighe    published 2015-01-26T16:30:00Z     During the first few months of having my IUD, there were some moments of discomfort that made me wonder if the IUD was in the right place. When I went to my doctor for a follow-up exam, I talked about some of the pain I had been experiencing and my fear that the IUD had been expelled. “Oh no,” she said. “You would know.”  This would be true if it had been completely expelled, but it’s also possible for an IUD to be expelled and for its user not to be quite sure. That’s called a partial expulsion. As it turns out, the IUD can move inside the uterus depending on the time of the month. As Corinne Rocca says in her article about the Mirena IUD , “Expulsion is a fancy way of saying that an IUD has been pushed out of its ideal location at the top of the uterus. The uterus is one big muscle, so this sometimes happens.” (In fact, becoming familiar with the position of the cervix is one aspect of some fertility awareness methods .)  My follow-up visit turned out fine, but what if it hadn’t? The rates of IUD expulsion fall somewhere between .05% and 8%. There are a few different factors that can affect the possibility of expulsion , like your age and pregnancy history, how long it’s been since the IUD was inserted, and even how well your health care provider inserted the IUD in the first place. There’s a higher rate of expulsion during your period , so you’ll want to make sure to check your strings regularly . Expulsion is most likely to occur during the first three months that you have the IUD.  Think your IUD may have expelled? Here’s what to do.  1. Stay calm. It isn’t pleasant or convenient, but expulsion is a potential risk when you have an IUD inserted. If you are in a lot of pain or feeling confused, take a deep breath. Stressing out may make you feel worse and make it harder for you to stay calm enough to get the care you need.  2. Double check. Being able to feel your IUD strings is totally normal ( here’s a handy how-to ). But if you can feel the hard plastic protruding from your cervix, the IUD isn’t where it’s supposed to be . For some people , it may be less noticeable if the IUD has expelled. It’s definitely a good idea to make an appointment with your provider if you have any of the following symptoms: severe pain and cramping; heavy or abnormal bleeding; abnormal discharge; and/or fever. (This may also be a sign of infection.) Some discomfort in the first few days after insertion is normal, but if the pain intensifies or persists, it may be time to see your provider.  3. Take care. If you’re experiencing a lot of pain while the IUD is out of place, make sure to take extra care of yourself. Try to wait to have sex until you are able to meet with your provider. Plus, if the IUD isn’t where it’s supposed to be, you may not be protected from pregnancy. If you still want to go for it, make sure to use a back-up birth control method.  4. Call your provider. If you think your IUD is out of place, call your health care provider asap and ask for an appointment. You definitely want to talk to them if you have severe pain, cannot find your strings, notice the strings are shorter or longer than normal, or can feel the IUD poking out. Getting in to see your provider might not be the easiest or the most convenient, but even if you’re not totally sure your IUD has been expelled, it’s worth it to take care of your health and make sure you’re covered against accidental pregnancy. If you just had the IUD inserted, a routine check-up after six weeks is a good idea anyway to make sure everything is a-okay.  Wondering if you should try the IUD again?  For women who have had an expulsion, the chance of it happening again is a little higher , but if you think the IUD is the right method for you, it may be worth trying again. Talk with your provider about your options. You may want to try a different kind of IUD, try a different provider, or see if your provider can use extra tools to make sure the IUD is in the right place this time.  If you’ve expelled multiple times or just really aren’t up for trying again, it may be time to explore other options. Fortunately there are lots of birth control methods to choose from.

But what about finding solutions to those stressful sexual health situations that inevitably crop up when you’re getting down? Emma Kaywin, a Brooklyn-based sexual health writer and activist, is here to calm your nerves and answer your questions. No gender, sexual orientation, or question is off limits, and all questions remain anonymous. This week’s topic: how to tell if your IUD moved — or if something else is wrong with it . Because sometimes you're not imagining it — there really might be something going on with it. Q: I got a hormonal IUD placed two months ago and was super excited about it. I mean, super effective hormonal birth control I only have to think about every five years? Thank you modern medicine! And it wasn’t even that intense going in . I got some cramps for a couple days after and that was it! But now I’m feeling kinda off — I’m getting cramping between my periods and it hurts when I have sex , which has never happened to me before. Could something be wrong? Like, could my IUD have moved or could it be infected ? Should I go and see my doctor? And until then, should I stop having sex — maybe I'm not safe? A: The IUD is an excellent birth control option, particularly if you don’t want to do something every day but you still want to be extremely well-covered against pregnancy. Most people don’t have any trouble with their IUDs after their body gets used to them . However, some IUDs do end up getting displaced (which is when it moves from where it was placed to a different part of your uterus), embedded in the sides of your uterus, or even expelled . This is pretty rare — expulsion happens under 10 percent of the time, IUDs get embedded under one percent of the time, and perforation of the uterus walls due to an embedded IUD is even rarer. But if you think your IUD might have moved , you'll definitely want to contact your gynecologist right away to check; in rare cases displaced IUDs can puncture your uterus walls and mess with your other internal organs , which is dangerous and must be taken care of. Here are the ways to know if one of these might be happening to you, so you can go to your gynecologist to get it fixed. 1. Your Strings Are Longer Or Shorter Than Before (Or You Can't Feel Them At All) Your IUD has a string attached to the bottom of it, which makes it easy for you to get it taken out when you’re done with it. These strings come out of your uterus, through your cervix, and into your vagina. When your doctor placed your IUD, she cut the strings so you can still feel them, but not so long that they're annoying (or at least, she should have). It's good to know how long your strings are because they tell you if your IUD is still where it's supposed to be. Checking your IUD strings is super simple — with clean hands, put your index or middle finger up into your vagina until you get to your cervix. Your IUD strings should be coming through your cervix and you should be able to feel them there . If you suddenly notice that your strings are longer than they were before, this is a sign that your IUD might have slipped down from where it was placed. Alternately, if you can’t find your strings, this could mean that your IUD has moved further up into your uterus, dragging the strings along with it. If you notice changes in your strings, go visit your gynecologist so she can check you out. Sometimes the strings get tangled and just feel shorter, but other times you might need to get your IUD placed again. 2. You Can Feel The IUD In Your Cervix This one’s pretty obvious. Your IUD is supposed to be placed up inside your uterus ( here’s a picture of where it goes) . Up there, you shouldn't able to feel it. If you notice your IUD is coming out of your cervix or you feel the bottom of it in your cervix, that means it’s too low and is therefore displaced — and might even be in the process of coming out completely. Feeling an IUD in your cervix could mean literally being able to feel it with your fingers as you do a string check — or it could mean your cervix is starting to feel uncomfortable because there's a piece of plastic or metal coming out of it that shouldn't be there. 3. Your Lover Can Feel Something Up There Sometimes you might not notice that there’s something off with your IUD, but your partner will feel the tip of it when you have sex. If your partner notices something hard coming out of your cervix, go check it out at the doctor to make sure it hasn’t slipped. You can even tell your lovers to look out for this in advance — they may be excited for such a sexy way to help you monitor your own health! However, it's good to know that sex itself can't displace your IUD . The myth that a penis can "knock" your IUD out of place is just that: a myth. Don't worry! 4. It Hurts When You Have Sex Some people report that sex changes a bit after you get an IUD, with certain positions feeling a bit more painful . However, if suddenly sex starts hurting, that may be your body telling you that your IUD isn’t where it’s supposed to be . This makes sense — if your IUD has gotten itself displaced, it could have found itself in a place that can make sex more painful, such as poking out of your cervix, which is a tender spot for many folks, even without an IUD. 5. You’re Dealing With Abnormal Vaginal Discharge Vaginal discharge is your body’s totally normal way of cleaning your vagina . However, abnormal discharge can also be a sign that your IUD has slipped and is irritating your body. If you notice that your discharge is off in color, texture, or smell and it’s not a yeast infection or one of the other reasons your discharge can get messed up , contact your doctor to see if your IUD might be the culprit. 6. You’re Bleeding More Than Usual Your period will most likely change after you start your IUD — if you have the hormonal version, you’ll probably start experiencing lighter (or even no) periods once your body gets used to it. In contrast, the non-hormonal copper IUD often makes periods heavier , and lots of people experience some spotting for the first couple months after they get their IUDs. However, if you notice that your bleeding is more intense than usual or you’re spotting heavily between periods, that might be because your IUD is displaced. 7. You're Suddenly Getting Really Intense Cramps JAY DIRECTO/AFP/Getty Images Menstrual cramps are a normal part of having a period for many people. Many people experience cramps right after they get their IUD placed , and if you choose to get the copper (non-hormonal) IUD, this form of birth control can make your cramps more intense. However, unusual cramps and pain can be a sign that your IUD is being expelled — if you notice that your cramps are way stronger all of a sudden or are lasting a lot longer, go visit your doctor to make sure that your IUD isn't the problem. Expulsion happens most often during the first year you have an IUD, so pay particular attention to your cramping pain levels during this time. 8. You Feel Like You Might Be Pregnant If you have an IUD, it's extremely unlikely that you'll get pregnant. However, while an IUD definitely protects you from pregnancy (it's over 99 percent effective ) it also raises your risk of getting an ectopic pregnancy, if indeed you are the unlucky less-than-one-percent who does get pregnant. An ectopic pregnancy is extremely dangerous. In an ectopic pregnancy, your fertilized egg doesn't implant in your uterus where it's supposed to so it can be nourished and have room to grow into a full-blown tiny human. Instead, it gets waylaid in other parts of your body, like one of your fallopian tubes or ovaries, which have neither the food nor the space to grow a baby. Ectopic pregnancies won't make it to term — the egg won't be able to survive. This means you need to get medical treatment to get the fertilized egg removed. How do you know if you have this rare but serious situation on your hands? At first, your symptoms may be identical to the early signs of pregnancy — you might miss your period, you could start feeling nauseated, your breasts might start feeling tender. But then, you'll probably start to notice some spotting and pain in your pelvis or abdomen. Your pain can also end up in your shoulder if your baby is growing in one of your fallopian tubes (which are not in your shoulders but the pain gets referred there). If your fallopian tube ruptures because the egg is too large for it, this will be very painful and will come with heavy abdominal bleeding and lightheadedness or fainting . If you feel any of these symptoms, go to the clinic immediately to get the help you need. The Bottom Line Most people who get IUDs have no challenges . However, if you’re one of the unlucky few who does, don’t worry. Your doctor will help you out, moving your IUD back into place or giving you a new one if the first one is ejected. And then you can go back to living your life — however you choose to live it!

I know they're not huge but they are big enough that you would think you'd notice it coming out of your body, kwim? I think mine came out though. The dr. confirmed today that I'm pregnant. He checked for the IUD and couldn't find it. So he's sending me for an ultrasound to find out if it's still there or not. The chances of getting pg with it in are about 2% and the fact that the dr. couldn't see it makes me suspect it probably fell out but I am at a loss as to when or how exactly it came out.     --  Juliet DD 11/06 DS 08/08        See all comments from original poster (4)  Hide all comments from original poster (4)      Load more            Comment            Report this post        4          Comments (35)        / 4                i_like_cheese   Posted 11/09/2009      I was told that your body can expel it during a period, but that usually happens during the first few months of having it in.  I don't know that for sure though.

I got my Mirena 6 weeks pp on Nov 30 2010. I bled heavily until March. After that I had irregular heavy long lastin periods. I always check my strings after each cycle. September cycle was unusually light except for one big clot that I passed. I thought that maybe I was finally going to taper off my periods. I checked my strings and while hard to reach were still there. Last week, I could feel it poking and rubbing me inside. After experiencing nausea, headaches, backaches, bloating, pregnancy symptoms every month, moodiness, depression and anxiety I decided this was the last straw. I called he dr and made an appointment to get it removed. Friday morning about 5 am I woke up feeling like I was gushing. I ran to te bathroom and it looked like a crime scene. There was so much blood. I cleaned ip put on a Padang went bak to bed. Got up at 6:30 and was still gushing dark brownish red blood. I have a long drive to work so I used. Tampon and a pad. I got to work by 8 and felt horrible flooding I went to the bathroom, removed te tampon and changed my pad. I was going to my desk when I felt more gushing. I went back to the bathroom and sat down and plop Mirena is in he toilet The water looks like it is all blood in there and now clots are passing. I called my dr and the nurse said that happens sometimes. She calmed meadow. And said to take a hpt and thu will see me next week. I took he hpt and there was a very faint line. The tweakers were able to pull it. I continued to have blood pouring out all day. Saturday I was passing tissue blood clots and soaking pads every hour. I have had 2 pregnancy losses before. This was the same. I know there is no way to know for certain, by the time I get to the dr I am sure my counts will be too low. The tissue that I passed made me sure of what happened I am in disbelief. I had high hopes that this would work for me. I can't believe I lost another pregnancy. I obviously was not Ina position to have a baby right now but this is a horrible ordeal.  Please if anyone is considering the Mirena read my experience and do not choose it.

I read your story and feel so badly for what you went through.  I'm not sure if you'd ever consider another IUD given what happened, but I have had the paragard and no problems. I'm not sure if it's the IUD that just doesn't work for you or the hormones from the Mirena. Either way I am truly sorry for your loss.    --  Proud Mommy to David (6/24/07) & Abby (6/7/09)             Reply            Report this comment       0                     Mommy2Be46    Last edited 10/25/2011      I do not think that you have lost a pregnancy - this same thing happened to me - minus the IUD actually falling out.    Here is my story - Somehow last week - my IUD dislodged - around Thursday I started to spot - and since my mirena is always unexpected I didn't think much of it. By Saturday evening, I had a full blown period - HORRIBLE. I went to sleep - woke up in a puddle of blood in my bed around 4 am, assuming it was just a heavy period - and I put a tampon in. Within 40 minutes, that full tampon was drenched and falling out of me. This proceeded all day sunday, every 30-40 minutes. I honestly assumed I was having a miscarriage - and on Monday morning I woke up, incredibly nauseated - floaters in my eyes, I could barely move...So I called the advice nurse and went to ER. Ran a bunch of tests etc - I wasn't pregnant, but I lost so much blood I was in horrible shape. We Xrayed the mirena, and she looked in me - and said it dislodged - and it was "hanging on for dear life" the hormones caused my cervix to fully dialate - and this is why I was pouring blood & major blood clots out of me for 3 days. I almost bled to death!  They had to remove it - and here I am sitting here today still fully dialated, feeling like I gave birth yesterday. I am IN PAIN!    I have had my mirena for 2 years now, and never any problems, until this. Your situation sounds identical to mine - they need to check your cervix and uterus though to make sure it didn't puncture anything! This is a very serious matter - If I wouldn't of went into ER they told me it could of been deadly.    --  Mommy to Cameron Michael Born 12.05.09 - Punctual lil man who came on his due date! 7lb 9oz - 20 inches             Reply            Report this comment        2                     dizzy_whirled411 · Original Poster    Posted 10/27/2011     Wow I'm sorry for your experience My bleeding just stopped almost as quickly as it started by the following Wednesday. I went to my dr and he was not concerned about any punctures or issues. I wish I had read your story or I would have had him check. I feel great now that it's out. I just started nuvaring Sunday. So far I have lost 5 lbs and my acne is gone. My hair stopped falling out and I am a ball of energy.  I'm not happy about the way it happened but am so glad it's gone.    --  Come join the October 2010 Private group!

I have my period every month and I bleed a lot to where as soon as I take the tampon out to change it that blood drips out.(I know im sorry tmi) Anyways I don't have the insurance or money to have it taken out by doctor. I went to the ER this year back in Jan cause I was in tons of pain and the took x ray and said that the Mirena was in the right spot and that it hasn't moved. Idk im experience this if my Mirena is in the right spot. I wanna remove it myself but scared. Can anyone help? I would NEVER get the Mirena ever again!

Scared that in some weird way I am going to get pregnant. I just took a test. Then yesterday started bleeding really bad. I took a shower and couldn't feel the strings at all. Just a little nervous. I have a 7 month old right now so we definitely don't need another. If I get it taken out I don't have a way to pay for monthly birth control. So I'm in a predicament.

After her birth I had it put back in and four months after it came out, without pain. So I went to get it put back in two months after the first one came out and almost a week later I started to have contraction like cramps, that hurt. I looked and it came out again only this time with horrible bledding and cramps that made me curl up. I was told I had hemerging cysts and it will go away. After about a week it did but sex is almost unbearable at times and no doctor knows why. It's crazy because that never happen to me until this last incident..  I'll never do that again, but of course, the doctors recommend that I don't NOW.

My cycle started in December of 2015 and it is now November 2016.First I was given provera that didn't work at all. Then doctors have prescribed birth control pills. Take 5 at a time then 4 then 3 and so on . That made me really really really sick . It slowed the cycle down but it did not stop. I was advised by my doctor of the IUD. I bleed very heavy with huge blood clots. My doctor kept saying this IUD would straighten out the issue that had been caused by the Depo shot. I gotta tell you the doctors must get kickbacks for this thing. A waste of $1,000 down the drain. Not only did it make me bleed worse it came out in 2 months with a huge blood clot. DON'T DO IT . I never had a problem with my cycle while not being on birth control. They just kept experimenting about what was wrong. All the while I am bleeding to death and the doctors smiling saying I know its frustrating. If she knew what was going on in my mind!!!! The doctor also kept saying give it at least 3 months.  I finally went to a new doctor who advised me they would have to do a DNC because of how long I have been bleeding and look for other possible reasons for it. Go with your gutt feeling. If one form of birth control is giving you grief go see a SPECIALIST. It will save you time and money .

After 3 appts (long story) to finally get the thing inserted, the RN said it was her easiest insertion in 8 years. She uses ultra sound guidance so we knew it was placed properly. Yesterday I went in for my IUD check. They were just going to trim the strings and send me on my way. Well, upon inserting the speculum, my IUD was "staring her in the face.". Apparently it was sitting on my cervix and I didn't even know :(. Now, I gave wait a couple weeks for a pregnancy test and we'll try again if I want. I doubt I'm pregnant as I am EBF  (extended breastfeeding, exclusively breastfeeding) and ovulation is supressed.  Has this happened to any of you? Should I even bother? What if it happens again and I'm unaware?     --  Mama to 2 sweet girls.

I was told to self-check for the string once a month.  I didn't know that it could be inserted by a RN. My doc did say that he's never had issues with those that he's inserted himself, but he has to fix or deal with poor insertions by others. It might be worth having the insertion done by a OB considering what you've already gone through.

Of course, to each her own, and I really am sorry this happened to you!  It may not be for everyone, but I loved mine.

Ive had my iud for about 7 1/2 months and today my iud fell out and I didn't even notice it, I didn't feel a thing so with that said it didn't even hurt. But I was thinking maybe it was loose cause I could feel the strings when inserting a tampon and my fiance could feel it once in a while also. Is it possible that if it was loose that I could have gotten pregnant? I just got my period on monday and haven't had sex so am i ok? or like i said could i have gotten prego when it was loose? Thanks                  veronica&joey;    Asked 6/9/11         Answer this question        Mom Answers ( 9 )   Best answers   Most recent      BEST ANSWER   Anytime you have a foreign object inserted in your body, you always run the risk of your body rejecting it. For example: Cramping, falling out, headache, etopic pregnancy, spotting, excessive bleeding, weight gain, fibroids, infection, TSS etc, etc, etc. I too looked into having IUD, but after speaking with my Doctor and hearing the horror stories, it was not the best choice at that time for me. But the fact still remain, there are always exception to every rule.....Years later I see people are having wonderful experiences with IUD's. When I looking into it...No one I personally knew had anything nice to say. Therefore, I went with the most popular opinion at that time. But thats wonderful that many of you had great experiences. The risk was just to great for me...Especially for some birthcontrol. Now if it was something like a pacemaker, of course insert that foreign object in me and ill take that chance.                 a1allen1    Answered 6/13/11                5 found this helpful     i have the plastic little flimsy one, the merina or however you spell it. Honestly, Ive wondered if I have ever had a miscarage on the iud cause you cant tell. They say its the same feeling as if you just had your period and mine is still irregular. But they also say that you could bleed alot too, you might wanna get it checked out or even removed if thats the case. Alot of my friends had theirs removed due to complications, even one was hospitalized for a week. Im debating if I want to get new birth control or use the iud again. But how do i know for sure its not going to fall out again? And I cant use the pill cause thats how I got pregnant in the 1st place. But good luck to you, and hope all works out for you!                 veronica&joey;    Answered 6/9/11               3 found this helpful     I am 5 /12 months pregnant and i have the IUD. I didnt kno I was untill I was already 3 months.My dr. didnt tell me not to have sex right away and I thought all the side affects I was having was due to the IUD.so i think it got loose and i became pregnant. so yea I think is a good possability you could get pregnant if it fell out. If pregnancy is not what you want then its better to be safe then sorry.get to your dr.!!                 stacie-mama-of-5    Answered 6/23/11               3 found this helpful     i have mirena too!!!! ive wanted to get different bc at different times, but changed my mind, that really bothers me, i think i will make an appiontment, ive bled for just about a month now,           a BabyCenter member   Answered 6/9/11               3 found this helpful     Well I dont think its bad news at all, when my iud fell out i was actually sad haha, i enjoy it and have no problems with it at all. Honestly, now that it had fallen out, my cramps are worse and i feel tired and like crap. I miss my iud, but on tuesday I am going into the doctors office to either get a new iud (which i kinda want again) or I am going to get that implant in my arm. The implant kinda worries me cause i have heard great reviews and horrible reviews. But if anything, Im going back to the iud. And im not pregnant! good news i suppose :) I am too young to have another child and I just got accepted back into school. 

Has anyone here had the implant in the arm? If so, what did you think? or what other birth control is great? I cant use the pill cause, i got pregnant on the pill. thanks!                 veronica&joey;    Answered 6/10/11               2 found this helpful     I had the IUD for 5 1/2 years, it worked great! It expired and they told me it would be fine to keep in for a few months extra, so I did. Finally got it removed and three days after that got pregnant. Doctor said I wouldn't get prego until the next ovulation period, but he was wrong. I was a little suprised at how soon I got prego, but it must have been meant to be. Anyway, yes if it was loose, I'd say there is a chance you chould be prego.                 mistibergman    Answered 6/18/11               2 found this helpful     i cant answer your question, but i would like to know what iud you have, bc i also have one and think i could have had a miscarriage, bc of all the bleeding, ive had mine in almost 7 months           a BabyCenter member   Answered 6/9/11               2 found this helpful     IUD are bad news, so many women have problems with them. A friend of mines, had an IUD only for a very short time, but when she had a periods they were terrible. She felt as if she was pregnant.....Emotionanl issues, severe cramping, inability to lose weight. But once it was out, she went back to feeling normal. Its probably a good ideal to have it remove and look at other means of birth control. Also back in the 80's woman had major issues, lots of them suffered fertility issues behind IUD's and there were thousands of class action lawsuits. So just be careful......... 

I'd say it is worth a try removing it (or, rather, having the dr remove it! ) and seeing how things go.                 a1allen1    Answered 6/10/11               1 found this helpful     The IUD itself is not necessarily bad news. If it was put in wrong or fell out then yes, it can cause complications and you can still get pregnant. But the same goes for any bc that isn't taken properly. For some women it causes much more severe side effects, but again, the same goes for any bc. And it doesn't always effect fertility like someone said. Maybe it has in some women but everyone is different. I had an IUD for 2 1/2 years, no problems, no side effects and after the first 6 months or so, almost no periods. I had it taken out when we wanted to try for another baby. Month and a half later I was pregnant. Now we have a wonderful baby boy. Sorry, I know none of this really answers your questions, but I just had to speak to some of the chances that were being told as absolute truths.

(rant)  ( self.birthcontrol ) submitted 3 years ago by ItsAZooOutThere Like it says in the title, my IUD fell out for the second time. Each time I had the IUD in, the procedure went smoothly, no pain or anything of the sort. I've had each IUD in a minimum of four months with no trouble. In between four and six months, I get my period (I have periods at regular intervals about 3-4 times a year) and my IUD falls out. No reason, no warning, it just does. Doesn't even hurt, I get twinges that feel exactly the same as period cramps so I can't even tell if it's the IUD or cramps. The last time, I was wiping in between when I noticed two thin plastic strings and panicked. I went to get a replacement IUD almost immediately. This time round, I was in the shower, bathing between my legs when I again noticed two thin plastic strings.  I'm just really annoyed at this. Is it possible for the cervix to open so wide during my period that my IUD just falls out? I'm annoyed because the copper IUD was my one shot at long-lasting non-hormonal BC, and my first choice method. I don't want short-term solutions, so I think at this point I'm going to have to look at getting the arm implant. This sucks because it costs so much more than the copper IUD where I live - the copper IUD is, at least, subsidised so it's not terribly expensive. I loved my copper IUDs while I had them, but it seems like the love isn't reciprocal...  Anyone else had something similar happen to them? Has anyone switched from the IUD to Nexplanon?   7 comments share save hide report all 7 comments sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion?

Maybe they are inserting it wrong?? I don't know, but I wouldn't go to people on the Internet for medical advice.  I have a Paragard and it's going well for me so I can't share any experience with the arm implant but I would say if you are fine with a hormonal method then you could consider it.   permalink embed save give gold [–] [deleted]  3 years ago  (1 child) [deleted]   [–] Jourdin Copper IUD  0 points 1 point 2 points  3 years ago  (0 children) Fair enough.   permalink embed save give gold [–] bananapajama Paragard since 2012, pills before that  6 points 7 points 8 points  3 years ago  (1 child) I agree that this is a question best suited for your doctor. However, the literature supports your experience: women who have their first IUD expel are more likely to have their second IUD expel.  If it were my decision, I would look into alternatives, and maybe try the IUD again only after pregnancy. (Supposedly women who have never been pregnant are more likely to expel the IUD.)  You could also ask your doctor if she provides other IUDs, ex: I think Skyla is one of the smallest ones out there and is designed for women who have never given birth before.

I just got a call yesterday and I'm scheduled to go in on Thursday to get my Implanon done. I'm a bit worried about the bruising and the compression bandage - my parents don't know I'm active and I live with them, so I'm gonna have to figure out a way to hide it from them for a while.  I've been on hormonal BC before - Diane 35, which surprisingly wasn't too bad for me. I actually found I had improved moods and the water retention I could deal with. I'm in the process of trying to lose weight now though so I'm not sure if getting Implanon might mess that up.  I don't have monthly periods, and a big draw of the copper IUD was being able to keep those thrice to four times yearly periods. Did your periods change at all on Implanon? I'm worried it may mess up my cycle and put me on more periods than I'm used to - I like my body not giving me one a month waaaaaaay too much!   permalink embed save give gold [–] imjustheretoday  1 point 2 points 3 points  3 years ago  (0 children) I'm so sorry that's happened to you - TWICE!

Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page      It works!   This is the default welcome page used to test the correct 
                operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems.
                It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache
                packaging is derived.
                If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at
                this site is working properly. You should replace this file (located at /var/www/html/index.html ) before continuing to operate your HTTP server.  If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is
                about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to
                maintenance.
                If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator.    Configuration Overview   Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
                interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is fully documented in
                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz . Refer to this for the full
                documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
                found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc package was installed on this server.  The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows:  /etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       `--  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|       |-- *.load
|       `-- *.conf
|-- conf-enabled
|       `-- *.conf
|-- sites-enabled
|       `-- *.conf    apache2.conf is the main configuration
                           file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
                           files when starting up the web server.   ports.conf is always included from the
                           main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.  Configuration files in the mods-enabled/ , conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain
                           particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
                           fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.  They are activated by symlinking available
                           configuration files from their respective
                           *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed
                           by using our helpers a2enmod,
                                a2dismod,  a2ensite,
                                a2dissite, and a2enconf,
                                a2disconf . See their respective man pages for detailed information.  The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of
                           environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be
                           started/stopped with /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl . Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the
                           default configuration.     Document Roots   By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to any file apart of those located in /var/www , public_html directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web
                applications). If your site is using a web document root
                located elsewhere (such as in /srv ) you may need to whitelist your
                document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf .  The default Ubuntu document root is /var/www/html . You
                can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different
                to previous releases which provides better security out of the box.    Reporting Problems   Please use the ubuntu-bug tool to report bugs in the
                Apache2 package with Ubuntu. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug.  Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others)
                to respective packages, not to the web server itself.              Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page      It works!   This is the default welcome page used to test the correct
