Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon Advertisement  Marc Weisskopf, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health, explains.  In most industrialized countries about 105 boys are born for every 100 girls, for a ratio of 1.05, known as the secondary sex ratio, or SSR; the primary sex ratio is the ratio at conception. This is often expressed as the percentage of boys among all births, or about 51.2 percent. Thus, the short answer to the question is: "On average, no." The percentage of males among all births is not fixed, however. Since the 1950s and 1960s the overall SSR has been declining in the U.S., Canada and several European countries, but some groups display different trends. In the U.S., the SSR is declining for whites, whereas among African-Americans and other races, the SSR has been increasing since the 1960s. Currently the SSR among African-Americans in the U.S. is only about 50.7 percent. There are also both personal and environmental factors that affect the average sex ratio. The chance of having a boy appears to decline with the mother's age, the father's age and the number of children the family already has. These effects are small. One study in Denmark found that the SSR of children born to fathers younger than 25 was 51.6 percent, which decreased to 51.0 percent among children of fathers at least 40 years of age. Therefore it is unlikely that the declining SSR in many countries results solely from large-scale changes in such personal factors. With regard to environmental factors, improved prenatal and obstetrical care during the first part of the 20th century is largely responsible for an increased SSR over this period in many countries. The male fetus is more susceptible to loss in the womb than is the female fetus, so with more conceptions reaching term, proportionally more males are born. It is difficult to discern how much of the decrease in sex ratio since the 1950s arises from contaminants in the environment. What is known is that drug use, high occupational exposures and environmental accidents can affect SSR. For example, hopeful mothers taking clomiphene citrate (Clomid) for infertility bore babies with an SSR of only 48.5 percent. Workers producing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), a chemical used to kill worms in agriculture, experienced even larger decreases in the number of male babies they welcomed into the world. Effects of DBCP on sperm quality were discovered incidentally when male workers found that they were unable to father children. After the exposure ended, male workers experienced some recovery of sperm quality and 36 children were born to 44 workers. Of these 36 children only 10 were boys--an SSR of just 27.8 percent. Decreases in the SSR of offspring from fathers exposed to dioxin and dioxinlike chemicals occurred following an explosion in an herbicide factory in Seveso, Italy, in 1976 and contamination of rice oil used for cooking in Yu-Cheng, Taiwan. The decreases were most extreme among the children of fathers who were exposed at earlier ages: an SSR of 38.2 percent was recorded for fathers exposed before age 19 in Seveso, and fathers exposed before age 20 in Yu-Cheng experienced an SSR of 45.8 percent. These dramatic changes resulting from extreme exposures raise the concern that chemicals in the environment at lower concentrations may also change the SSR by exposing people over longer periods of time. For example, there are reports that parental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury, each of which is widely distributed in the environment, can affect the sex ratio. Confirming such effects will take careful work on large populations, but the results may be quite important for other reasons as well. In the general population, sperm quality deteriorated and testicular cancer and abnormalities of male genitalia increased over the same period that SSR declined. Furthermore, for men who go on to develop testicular cancer, both their semen quality and the SSR of their children are significantly reduced, suggesting a possible biological link between these male reproductive characteristics. Thus, effects of environmental contaminants on the sex ratio may be only the tip of the iceberg.

The believe that the habits and diet of the man can also affect the ratio of male and female sperm cells he produces. They also said that certain couples are more likely to have children of one sex, and that it is more common to see families with several children of the same sex than would be expected if the odds for each child were 50/50. I've done some research and I'm not finding good evidence for any of this. Everything I'm finding indicates that meiosis in men always produces half male sperm, half female sperm, that there is no difference between them in morphology or behavior, and therefore the odds of having a boy or a girl really are 50/50. Am I right about this or is there something I am missing?        20th Apr 2010 14:55:15     Jonathan Max Berman    SUNY Buffalo  Posts: 68         Any proposed behavioral changes in parents do not have a have an affect on the gender of offspring. Families with large numbers of male or female offspring result from the "rule of large numbers." If you flip a coin enough times you  will eventually get heads five times in a row simply by chance. There are known ways of influencing the sex of a child. Female sperm are slightly heavier than male sperm due to the extra mass of the x chromosome and will tend to sink to the bottom of a test tube when centrifuged. This allows some parents using in vitro fertilization to select the sex of a child with greater accuracy than chance. Perhaps the most effective (and ethically dubious) method used by parents is selective abortion where only children of the desired gender are brought to term.        20th Apr 2010 15:43:51     Paolo Viscardi    Horniman Museum, London, UK  Posts: 1,105         Third time lucky (my other attempts have all failed to post). Males do indeed produce equal numbers of X and Y sperm. Your neighbour may be using a variant of the Shettles method that has been around since the 1970s, which works on the assumption that X and Y sperm travel at different speeds, have different longevity and are sensitive to different levels of acidity. There is little support for this theory. X and Y sperm swim at the same average speeds, although their behaviour is apparently different in variable flow conditions, probably due to the difference in mass ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6541168 ). There is some evidence that females with high energy (or possibly nutirent) intake prior to conception are slightly more likely to have male children ( http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/  /1661.full ). However, the difference is only a few percent and I can find no evidence to suggest that male nutrition or habits play any role at all.

As males have only one X chromosome, inheriting that chromosome will mean that they will be affected by the disease. Females however, have two X chromosomes and as haemophilia is a recessive disease, two defective X chromosomes would have to be inherited for a female to be affected. In this case, the father is unaffected, and as he has to pass on a healthy X chromosome to his daughters, the probability of female offspring being affected is 0, regardless of the genotype of the mother. Any male offspring will inherit a Y chromosome from their father and an X chromosome from their mother, but there is a possibility that the mother might be a carrier (if she has both a healthy and a defective X chromosome) even though she is unaffected. If the mother is a carrier (which we don’t know in this question), the probability of a son inheriting the defective X chromosome and being affected by haemophilia is 50%.

The 2012 (most recent available) data for England and Wales published by the UK's  Office for National Statistics shows a bias towards male births (51.3% of live births). I would expect the statistics for other regions to differ slightly from 50:50. – DMM  Mar 3 '14 at 11:49        12      @DMM Yes, of course. It could be that upon checking one single casino and a very fair, well-balanced die, the probability to get some number (say, 3) is slightly higher than $\;1/6\;$ (because of the hand throwing the dice, the table, the material the die is made of, etc.), but we usually assume some events to have "the usual, standard" probability to happen. – DonAntonio  Mar 3 '14 at 12:11        1      @DMM you could just as easily say that the probability is $50\%$ and it there was an experimental error of $2.6\%$ ;) – Guy  Mar 3 '14 at 18:47         2      @DonAntonio Except that every measurement everywhere shows that more males are born than females.

Each time you have a boy or a girl, in the next generation you can have a boy or a girl also, so the number of possibilities is doubled each generation.  In terms of your problem, when you have a boy, that represents a checkmark against "at least one of them is a boy", so I've crossed the box concerned. However all the subsequent generations after this boy are also families in which there is at least one boy, so I've crossed those out too. You can see that the chance of having at least one boy is $1/2$ in the first generation, $3/4$ in the second, and $7/8$ in the third. This generalizes to $(2^n-1)/2^n$ in the nth generation.  Conversely the chance of having no boys is $1/2$ in the first generation, $1/4$ in the second, and $1/8$ in the third. This generalizes to $1/2^n$ in the nth generation.  (Essentially I've drawn a probability tree diagram here, which generalizes to much more complicated problems).     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 4 '14 at 18:41             answered Mar 3 '14 at 14:51       TooTone   4,930 1 14 39                  Should your second-last sentence be "the chance of not having at least one boy"? – Andrew Leach  Mar 4 '14 at 18:37            @AndrewLeach thankyou, brain dzzzzt – TooTone  Mar 4 '14 at 18:39        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      I’m adding an answer since I’m not reputable enough to add a comment to “lab bhattacharjee”’s answer.

Tuesday, November 08, 2016  Are large families of the same gender a statistical fluke? Mother of four sons, Gwen Loughman goes behind the myths In 1970’s Ireland, families with six or more children were the norm. CSO figures almost five decades later however, sees numbers for such families drop from 15,000 to a mere 3,000. Having four children in 21st century Ireland is considered a large family but to have more, and for those children to be all of the same gender, is a rarity and an attraction in itself.  Myths about how to conceive a girl or boy child have been around for centuries. During the reign of King Henry VIII it was widely believed the responsibility to produce the desired male gender fell to the female. Science has since proven otherwise.  Therese Murphy, lecturer in Medical Sciences, University of Exeter clears up just who determines the baby’s gender. “A baby’s genetic sex is determined by the man’s sperm as the sperm cell will contain either an X or a Y chromosome. It is the Y chromosome that is essential for the development of the male reproductive organs. When a Y chromosome is not present an embryo will develop into a female.”  Sex ratio  Carmel Kennedy, Ballyphehane, Cork with her eight sons. Carmel Kennedy from Ballyphehane, Cork with eight sons aged 37 to 20 is no stranger to people passing comments about her brood over the years. “I could talk for hours about some of the things people said. I did have girls but did not go to term with them. I always wanted a large family; I’m one of six girls and four boys and we had a beautiful childhood. Now I have eight healthy, respectful sons and lovely grand-daughters of my own,” she says. Professor Louise Kenny from Cork University Maternity Hospital Perinatal Medicine says in general, worldwide, slightly more boys are born than girls. “If left to nature there will be about 105 boys born for every 100 girls. However, 2011 data from the World Bank show the global sex ratio at birth is now 107 boys born for every 100 girls, largely driven by the skewed ratio caused by sex selection prior to birth in China, where about 118 boys are born for every 100 girls.” Statistical coincidence? Michelle Masterson Power and husband David have four daughters aged eight to 14. Their sons are six and four. “Because we were used to being parents of just girls, it meant we didn’t know any differently. David grew up with five sisters and one brother so he was very comfortable being a father of daughters. But once the boys came along, we learned the truth in that old saying, boys wreck the house. That one is so true! “ Michelle says her house was a very different one before the boys arrived. “It was very girly. Civilised, I’d say.” Michelle Masterson Power and Cillian, Orlagh, Ciarán, Eimear, Aoife, Ailbhe, Masterson Power. Naturally, there was great excitement when Cillian arrived, creating a particular interest in nappy changes! “The girls each took turns holding him and I had to time them! They were amazed when he wee’d all over me one day.” The odds of having a girl or a boy are the same with a one in two chance of it being one or the other. 50/50 if you like. However, what about bigger families of the same gender; are they a statistical coincidence? Dr Murphy again: “The probability of having a boy or a girl from a genetics point of view, remain the same each time a baby is conceived. However, there is some epidemiological evidence to suggest other factors may influence sex determination in humans. There is an argument about the motility and/ or survival of Y-carrying sperm and X-carrying sperm and timing of ovulation but it’s important to note that there are no robust ‘biological’ explanations for their observations to date.” There are various techniques and methods that allegedly improve the chances of conceiving a girl or a boy such as The Shettles Method and The Whelan Methods. Not forgetting particular diets and the slightly even more dubious practice of female douching. All have their believers and sceptics. Professor Louise Kenny has this to say. “In a nutshell there is no evidence that timing of intercourse affects sex ratio. There are several scientific studies that have disproven this. Furthermore, there is evidence that limiting intercourse within the fertile time will reduce your chances of getting pregnant at all. So my advice to couples would be to accept that at every conception there is approximately a 50:50 chance of conceiving a child of either sex and there’s very little than can be done to materially alter this,” she says. Historically speaking, there were massive gender divides. Concerns such as providing dowries for daughters and the birth of a male heir guaranteeing property retention saw one gender being preferred over the other. Thankfully, times have changed and when it comes to large families, issues like privacy and parental support are more relevant. Gwen Loughman with her sons Liam, Conor, Brendan, and Iarla. Carmel Kennedy had her own alternative support system in place when her boys were younger. “My sisters and I were there for each other and my sons had lots of friends and were always out playing so we mums would all stand at our gates and keep an eye on the kids. My coffee mornings were a cup of tea at the gate! And at night we called to each other’s houses.” She would agree being surrounded by menfolk meant privacy was limited. “I didn’t have any, I suppose. It’s only in the last seven years I have had my own bedroom space really as I always had a child or two asleep in my room. When they were babies and I was trying to shower, they used to scream at the door till I finished,” she says. Konrad, 26, is Carmel’s sixth-born and says life with seven brothers was for him just normal but, “for an outsider looking in it must have looked mental. It was never a silent house. We were all into music so it was loud and with eight boys comes a tonne of friends so people were always in and out. My mother was very relaxed. I think she likes the noise. I think we all turned out fairly well. We know now it was tough for my mother. But she never let it show,” he says. The teenage years are on the horizon for the Masterson Power family but Michelle is a woman of little or no fear. She feels can handle the mood swings and teenage dramas thanks to her daughters. “The girls are great with their brothers. They are very much the bosses but are also quite tolerable as the boys are much more demanding physically.

For example, if you flip a coin, it will come up either heads or tails.         What are the chances that it will come up heads? Well, since there are         2 sides to a coin (heads and tails), there is one chance out of two that         the coin will come up heads. We can state this probability as a fraction         (1/2) or as a percent (50%) or even as a ratio (50:50).  Activity: Try this yourself. Flip a coin 10 times, keeping track of how many         heads and tails you get. Make sure they add up to 10. How close did you         get to a 50% chance of heads (5/10) and a 50% chance of tails (5/10)?         Now try it again with 50 tosses of the coin. Keep track again of the number         of heads and tails. Are you closer to a 50:50 ratio of heads:tails? Try         it one more time with 100 tosses. How does your ratio look now? With a larger sample size, we get closer to the most accurate probability.         Each individual toss is a separate entity and is not influenced by any         earlier tosses. Another example - What are the chances that a baby will be born a male?         Since there are 2 sexes (male and female), there is a one chance out of         two that the child will be a male. What are the chances that a baby will         be born a female? Does this sound anything like the coin toss? Each baby has a 50:50 chance         of being either a male or a female. It doesn't matter how many other brothers         or sisters are already in the family. Each baby is a separate entity and         its sex is not influenced by the sexes of earlier children. You can try         this either by tossing a coin with the head side representing a girl and         the tail side representing a boy. Another way to predict is to do a Punnett square showing a cross between         a male (XY) and a female (XX). What are your results? Does the Punnett         square show that in a family of 4 children, 2 will be male and 2 will         be female? Or is it showing that each child has a 50:50 chance of being         male or female?  Think about it! If a family already has         5 girls, what are the chances that the next baby will be a boy? We use probabilities to predict possible results of genetic crosses.         Punnett squares are an easy way to determine the probabilities of certain         types of offspring occurring from a specific cross. The genotypes and phenotypes of parents or offspring may also be written         as like other probabilities as: fractions, decimals, or ratios.

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email Print Share via Google+ Stumble Upon Advertisement  Marc Weisskopf, a research associate at the Harvard School of Public Health, explains.  In most industrialized countries about 105 boys are born for every 100 girls, for a ratio of 1.05, known as the secondary sex ratio, or SSR; the primary sex ratio is the ratio at conception. This is often expressed as the percentage of boys among all births, or about 51.2 percent. Thus, the short answer to the question is: "On average, no." The percentage of males among all births is not fixed, however. Since the 1950s and 1960s the overall SSR has been declining in the U.S., Canada and several European countries, but some groups display different trends. In the U.S., the SSR is declining for whites, whereas among African-Americans and other races, the SSR has been increasing since the 1960s. Currently the SSR among African-Americans in the U.S. is only about 50.7 percent. There are also both personal and environmental factors that affect the average sex ratio. The chance of having a boy appears to decline with the mother's age, the father's age and the number of children the family already has. These effects are small. One study in Denmark found that the SSR of children born to fathers younger than 25 was 51.6 percent, which decreased to 51.0 percent among children of fathers at least 40 years of age. Therefore it is unlikely that the declining SSR in many countries results solely from large-scale changes in such personal factors. With regard to environmental factors, improved prenatal and obstetrical care during the first part of the 20th century is largely responsible for an increased SSR over this period in many countries. The male fetus is more susceptible to loss in the womb than is the female fetus, so with more conceptions reaching term, proportionally more males are born. It is difficult to discern how much of the decrease in sex ratio since the 1950s arises from contaminants in the environment. What is known is that drug use, high occupational exposures and environmental accidents can affect SSR. For example, hopeful mothers taking clomiphene citrate (Clomid) for infertility bore babies with an SSR of only 48.5 percent. Workers producing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), a chemical used to kill worms in agriculture, experienced even larger decreases in the number of male babies they welcomed into the world. Effects of DBCP on sperm quality were discovered incidentally when male workers found that they were unable to father children. After the exposure ended, male workers experienced some recovery of sperm quality and 36 children were born to 44 workers. Of these 36 children only 10 were boys--an SSR of just 27.8 percent. Decreases in the SSR of offspring from fathers exposed to dioxin and dioxinlike chemicals occurred following an explosion in an herbicide factory in Seveso, Italy, in 1976 and contamination of rice oil used for cooking in Yu-Cheng, Taiwan. The decreases were most extreme among the children of fathers who were exposed at earlier ages: an SSR of 38.2 percent was recorded for fathers exposed before age 19 in Seveso, and fathers exposed before age 20 in Yu-Cheng experienced an SSR of 45.8 percent. These dramatic changes resulting from extreme exposures raise the concern that chemicals in the environment at lower concentrations may also change the SSR by exposing people over longer periods of time. For example, there are reports that parental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury, each of which is widely distributed in the environment, can affect the sex ratio. Confirming such effects will take careful work on large populations, but the results may be quite important for other reasons as well. In the general population, sperm quality deteriorated and testicular cancer and abnormalities of male genitalia increased over the same period that SSR declined. Furthermore, for men who go on to develop testicular cancer, both their semen quality and the SSR of their children are significantly reduced, suggesting a possible biological link between these male reproductive characteristics. Thus, effects of environmental contaminants on the sex ratio may be only the tip of the iceberg.

The believe that the habits and diet of the man can also affect the ratio of male and female sperm cells he produces. They also said that certain couples are more likely to have children of one sex, and that it is more common to see families with several children of the same sex than would be expected if the odds for each child were 50/50. I've done some research and I'm not finding good evidence for any of this. Everything I'm finding indicates that meiosis in men always produces half male sperm, half female sperm, that there is no difference between them in morphology or behavior, and therefore the odds of having a boy or a girl really are 50/50. Am I right about this or is there something I am missing?        20th Apr 2010 14:55:15     Jonathan Max Berman    SUNY Buffalo  Posts: 68         Any proposed behavioral changes in parents do not have a have an affect on the gender of offspring. Families with large numbers of male or female offspring result from the "rule of large numbers." If you flip a coin enough times you  will eventually get heads five times in a row simply by chance. There are known ways of influencing the sex of a child. Female sperm are slightly heavier than male sperm due to the extra mass of the x chromosome and will tend to sink to the bottom of a test tube when centrifuged. This allows some parents using in vitro fertilization to select the sex of a child with greater accuracy than chance. Perhaps the most effective (and ethically dubious) method used by parents is selective abortion where only children of the desired gender are brought to term.        20th Apr 2010 15:43:51     Paolo Viscardi    Horniman Museum, London, UK  Posts: 1,105         Third time lucky (my other attempts have all failed to post). Males do indeed produce equal numbers of X and Y sperm. Your neighbour may be using a variant of the Shettles method that has been around since the 1970s, which works on the assumption that X and Y sperm travel at different speeds, have different longevity and are sensitive to different levels of acidity. There is little support for this theory. X and Y sperm swim at the same average speeds, although their behaviour is apparently different in variable flow conditions, probably due to the difference in mass ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6541168 ). There is some evidence that females with high energy (or possibly nutirent) intake prior to conception are slightly more likely to have male children ( http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/  /1661.full ). However, the difference is only a few percent and I can find no evidence to suggest that male nutrition or habits play any role at all.

Chromosomes          Back to Chromosomes           English   Español       Which parent decides whether a baby will be a boy or a girl?        -A curious adult from Great Britain    April 5, 2012     Neither parent gets to decide.  Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl.    What we can say is that dad's sperm determines whether a baby will be a boy or a girl.   About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.  The sex of the baby depends on which sperm gets to the egg first.    In a perfect world, it would all be up to chance.  Both types of sperm would have an equal chance of reaching the egg first.  And once fertilized, each type of egg would have an equal chance of developing fully into a baby.    But as you know, the world is not perfect.  Certain factors can influence the sex of the child.  As you'll see below, there is much more evidence of this happening in the animal world but it happens in people too.    For example, more boys are born each year than girls.  One theory for this has to do with the Y (or male) sex chromosome being so much smaller than the X (or female) one.  The idea is that sperm that carry a Y are slightly speedier and so are a bit more likely to make it to the egg first.    How mom or dad lives can affect the sex of their baby too.  A number of studies have suggested that factors like nutrition, wealth, and even where the parents live can affect the odds of having a boy or a girl.  But none of these effects is very large.    For example, moms that ate cereal every morning had a boy 59% of the time while moms that rarely ate cereal had boys only 43% of the time.  However, this doesn't mean that you should change your diet to increase your odds either way.    We don't know for certain that cereal is the cause of the difference. Perhaps women who tend to eat cereal have other shared qualities and it's one of these that affects whether they'll have a boy or not.  And as you can see, whatever the reason the effect is tiny.    This is true of most outside factors like this in people.  For us the sex of the child is mostly determined by which of dad's sperm makes it to the egg first.    Let's look a little closer at how the X and Y chromosomes determine sex. Then we'll explore why we see differences in the numbers of girls and boys in many families.      X (or Y) Marks the Gender    Both men and women have sex chromosomes.  Men usually have one X and one Y chromosome, while women have two X's.    When an egg or sperm is made, it only gets one of the sex chromosomes from the parent. This means that women can only make eggs with an X chromosome.  But men can make either X or Y sperm.    During fertilization, the sperm cells race toward the mother-to-be's egg cell.  If a sperm with a Y beats all others, then the fetus will be XY. The pregnancy will result in a boy.    However, if a sperm with an X wins the race to the egg, then the fetus will be XX.  The parents will have a baby girl.    Nearly everyone's chances are around 50% for having a boy and 50% for having a girl.  And yet, we all know families that are all boys or all girls.     Too Many Brothers (or Sisters)     Having all boys or all girls is almost always due to simple chance.  It is only rarely that parents have one sex more often than another for some underlying biological reason.    You've probably flipped a coin to make a decision between two things before.  When you flip a coin, you have a 50% chance for heads and a 50% chance for tails.  These are about the same odds as having a boy or a girl.    What if you flip a coin ten times and get heads every time?  What are the odds for heads on the next coin flip?  Still 50%.    In a coin flip, it doesn't matter what came before.   This is because the coin can't remember what was previously flipped.    The same thing is true in having a boy or a girl.  Mom's body can't remember what sex the previous child was.  So the chance of one child being a boy or girl is independent of any other child’s gender in the family.    It's just a matter of which type of sperm happens to reach the egg first.  In families that have all boys or all girls, it turned out to be the same one each time.  And if they decide to have another child, the chances are 50-50 that the baby will be a girl versus a boy.    In the real world, though, more than chance is involved.  As we talked about earlier, other factors can affect which sperm makes it to the egg and whether the fertilized egg goes on to be a healthy baby.    Most factors in people are thought to be very small though.  Remember how we said that more boys are born than girls because of the speedier boy sperm?  Well the difference is actually not that big...51% of all newborns in the U.S. are boys.    However, the animal world is a whole different story.  All sorts of things can happen so that more boys are born than girls and vice versa.   Animals with Wacky Sex Ratios  Based on a number of factors, some animals alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Buffalo in Africa have mostly sons when it rains and more daughters when the climate is dry.  This might be because there's more to eat in the rainy season and sons need more food to grow, so it's better to have girls when there's less food.    Many reptiles also have sex ratios that depend on the environment.  For alligators, sex depends on the temperature at which the eggs incubate.    If it's cooler, then all girls are hatched.  But if it's warmer, then all boys are hatched.  Since most alligator eggs are hatched at cooler temperatures, the natural ratio is 1 male to 5 females!    Some birds can influence whether they hatch a male or female chick.  Peafowl can vary the percentage of girls anywhere from 25 to 87%.    And it only gets weirder.  One fish called the bluestreak cleaner wrasse hangs out in groups of about 8 females and 1 male.  If the male dies, then the strongest female turns into a male!  It just so happens that the same thing occurs with clownfish like Nemo.    There are many more examples of this in nature, and a lot of it depends on survival of the species.  For humans, our best ratio seems to be equal numbers of males and females.

As males have only one X chromosome, inheriting that chromosome will mean that they will be affected by the disease. Females however, have two X chromosomes and as haemophilia is a recessive disease, two defective X chromosomes would have to be inherited for a female to be affected. In this case, the father is unaffected, and as he has to pass on a healthy X chromosome to his daughters, the probability of female offspring being affected is 0, regardless of the genotype of the mother. Any male offspring will inherit a Y chromosome from their father and an X chromosome from their mother, but there is a possibility that the mother might be a carrier (if she has both a healthy and a defective X chromosome) even though she is unaffected. If the mother is a carrier (which we don’t know in this question), the probability of a son inheriting the defective X chromosome and being affected by haemophilia is 50%.

It seems the answers all seem to assume that P(B)=P(G)=½.  This assumption is only approximately correct. – gerrit  Mar 3 '14 at 15:45         6      @Niharika: To understand why your logic is incorrect, imagine applying it to purchasing a lottery ticket: there are two outcomes and one is favorable, so your odds of winning would be 1/2. This is intuitively not true for the same reason your logic is not. – Andrew Coonce  Mar 3 '14 at 16:44        4      @gerrit Can you cite any research that supports your claim that a mother who has given birth to two boys is statistically more likely to give birth to another boy? – David Richerby  Mar 3 '14 at 20:41        |  show 14 more comments          6 Answers 6     active  oldest  votes            up vote  94  down vote  accepted      The complement of at least one boy is all three girls  So, $P($ at least one boy$)=1-P(GGG)$  $=\displaystyle1-\left(\frac12\right)^3$  This is the de facto way of solving problems of Probability of at least one in case of Binomial Distribution like tossing a coin etc.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 3 '14 at 14:56             answered Mar 3 '14 at 9:11       lab bhattacharjee   210k 14 148 260              5      It is usually easy to think in terms of the complement in these type of problems.

The 2012 (most recent available) data for England and Wales published by the UK's  Office for National Statistics shows a bias towards male births (51.3% of live births). I would expect the statistics for other regions to differ slightly from 50:50. – DMM  Mar 3 '14 at 11:49        12      @DMM Yes, of course. It could be that upon checking one single casino and a very fair, well-balanced die, the probability to get some number (say, 3) is slightly higher than $\;1/6\;$ (because of the hand throwing the dice, the table, the material the die is made of, etc.), but we usually assume some events to have "the usual, standard" probability to happen. – DonAntonio  Mar 3 '14 at 12:11        1      @DMM you could just as easily say that the probability is $50\%$ and it there was an experimental error of $2.6\%$ ;) – Guy  Mar 3 '14 at 18:47         2      @DonAntonio Except that every measurement everywhere shows that more males are born than females.

Each time you have a boy or a girl, in the next generation you can have a boy or a girl also, so the number of possibilities is doubled each generation.  In terms of your problem, when you have a boy, that represents a checkmark against "at least one of them is a boy", so I've crossed the box concerned. However all the subsequent generations after this boy are also families in which there is at least one boy, so I've crossed those out too. You can see that the chance of having at least one boy is $1/2$ in the first generation, $3/4$ in the second, and $7/8$ in the third. This generalizes to $(2^n-1)/2^n$ in the nth generation.  Conversely the chance of having no boys is $1/2$ in the first generation, $1/4$ in the second, and $1/8$ in the third. This generalizes to $1/2^n$ in the nth generation.  (Essentially I've drawn a probability tree diagram here, which generalizes to much more complicated problems).     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Mar 4 '14 at 18:41             answered Mar 3 '14 at 14:51       TooTone   4,930 1 14 39                  Should your second-last sentence be "the chance of not having at least one boy"? – Andrew Leach  Mar 4 '14 at 18:37            @AndrewLeach thankyou, brain dzzzzt – TooTone  Mar 4 '14 at 18:39        add a comment |             up vote  1  down vote      I’m adding an answer since I’m not reputable enough to add a comment to “lab bhattacharjee”’s answer.

Tuesday, November 08, 2016  Are large families of the same gender a statistical fluke? Mother of four sons, Gwen Loughman goes behind the myths In 1970’s Ireland, families with six or more children were the norm. CSO figures almost five decades later however, sees numbers for such families drop from 15,000 to a mere 3,000. Having four children in 21st century Ireland is considered a large family but to have more, and for those children to be all of the same gender, is a rarity and an attraction in itself.  Myths about how to conceive a girl or boy child have been around for centuries. During the reign of King Henry VIII it was widely believed the responsibility to produce the desired male gender fell to the female. Science has since proven otherwise.  Therese Murphy, lecturer in Medical Sciences, University of Exeter clears up just who determines the baby’s gender. “A baby’s genetic sex is determined by the man’s sperm as the sperm cell will contain either an X or a Y chromosome. It is the Y chromosome that is essential for the development of the male reproductive organs. When a Y chromosome is not present an embryo will develop into a female.”  Sex ratio  Carmel Kennedy, Ballyphehane, Cork with her eight sons. Carmel Kennedy from Ballyphehane, Cork with eight sons aged 37 to 20 is no stranger to people passing comments about her brood over the years. “I could talk for hours about some of the things people said. I did have girls but did not go to term with them. I always wanted a large family; I’m one of six girls and four boys and we had a beautiful childhood. Now I have eight healthy, respectful sons and lovely grand-daughters of my own,” she says. Professor Louise Kenny from Cork University Maternity Hospital Perinatal Medicine says in general, worldwide, slightly more boys are born than girls. “If left to nature there will be about 105 boys born for every 100 girls. However, 2011 data from the World Bank show the global sex ratio at birth is now 107 boys born for every 100 girls, largely driven by the skewed ratio caused by sex selection prior to birth in China, where about 118 boys are born for every 100 girls.” Statistical coincidence? Michelle Masterson Power and husband David have four daughters aged eight to 14. Their sons are six and four. “Because we were used to being parents of just girls, it meant we didn’t know any differently. David grew up with five sisters and one brother so he was very comfortable being a father of daughters. But once the boys came along, we learned the truth in that old saying, boys wreck the house. That one is so true! “ Michelle says her house was a very different one before the boys arrived. “It was very girly. Civilised, I’d say.” Michelle Masterson Power and Cillian, Orlagh, Ciarán, Eimear, Aoife, Ailbhe, Masterson Power. Naturally, there was great excitement when Cillian arrived, creating a particular interest in nappy changes! “The girls each took turns holding him and I had to time them! They were amazed when he wee’d all over me one day.” The odds of having a girl or a boy are the same with a one in two chance of it being one or the other. 50/50 if you like. However, what about bigger families of the same gender; are they a statistical coincidence? Dr Murphy again: “The probability of having a boy or a girl from a genetics point of view, remain the same each time a baby is conceived. However, there is some epidemiological evidence to suggest other factors may influence sex determination in humans. There is an argument about the motility and/ or survival of Y-carrying sperm and X-carrying sperm and timing of ovulation but it’s important to note that there are no robust ‘biological’ explanations for their observations to date.” There are various techniques and methods that allegedly improve the chances of conceiving a girl or a boy such as The Shettles Method and The Whelan Methods. Not forgetting particular diets and the slightly even more dubious practice of female douching. All have their believers and sceptics. Professor Louise Kenny has this to say. “In a nutshell there is no evidence that timing of intercourse affects sex ratio. There are several scientific studies that have disproven this. Furthermore, there is evidence that limiting intercourse within the fertile time will reduce your chances of getting pregnant at all. So my advice to couples would be to accept that at every conception there is approximately a 50:50 chance of conceiving a child of either sex and there’s very little than can be done to materially alter this,” she says. Historically speaking, there were massive gender divides. Concerns such as providing dowries for daughters and the birth of a male heir guaranteeing property retention saw one gender being preferred over the other. Thankfully, times have changed and when it comes to large families, issues like privacy and parental support are more relevant. Gwen Loughman with her sons Liam, Conor, Brendan, and Iarla. Carmel Kennedy had her own alternative support system in place when her boys were younger. “My sisters and I were there for each other and my sons had lots of friends and were always out playing so we mums would all stand at our gates and keep an eye on the kids. My coffee mornings were a cup of tea at the gate! And at night we called to each other’s houses.” She would agree being surrounded by menfolk meant privacy was limited. “I didn’t have any, I suppose. It’s only in the last seven years I have had my own bedroom space really as I always had a child or two asleep in my room. When they were babies and I was trying to shower, they used to scream at the door till I finished,” she says. Konrad, 26, is Carmel’s sixth-born and says life with seven brothers was for him just normal but, “for an outsider looking in it must have looked mental. It was never a silent house. We were all into music so it was loud and with eight boys comes a tonne of friends so people were always in and out. My mother was very relaxed. I think she likes the noise. I think we all turned out fairly well. We know now it was tough for my mother. But she never let it show,” he says. The teenage years are on the horizon for the Masterson Power family but Michelle is a woman of little or no fear. She feels can handle the mood swings and teenage dramas thanks to her daughters. “The girls are great with their brothers. They are very much the bosses but are also quite tolerable as the boys are much more demanding physically. Their dad grew up with sisters and has a great understanding of girls particularly in the teenage years, I think the boys will be the same.” Michelle and David encourage their children to have the same values as their parents when they grow up. “I tell the girls to find a man like their dad.”   © Irish Examiner Ltd.

For example, if you flip a coin, it will come up either heads or tails.         What are the chances that it will come up heads? Well, since there are         2 sides to a coin (heads and tails), there is one chance out of two that         the coin will come up heads. We can state this probability as a fraction         (1/2) or as a percent (50%) or even as a ratio (50:50).  Activity: Try this yourself. Flip a coin 10 times, keeping track of how many         heads and tails you get. Make sure they add up to 10. How close did you         get to a 50% chance of heads (5/10) and a 50% chance of tails (5/10)?         Now try it again with 50 tosses of the coin. Keep track again of the number         of heads and tails. Are you closer to a 50:50 ratio of heads:tails? Try         it one more time with 100 tosses. How does your ratio look now? With a larger sample size, we get closer to the most accurate probability.         Each individual toss is a separate entity and is not influenced by any         earlier tosses. Another example - What are the chances that a baby will be born a male?         Since there are 2 sexes (male and female), there is a one chance out of         two that the child will be a male. What are the chances that a baby will         be born a female? Does this sound anything like the coin toss? Each baby has a 50:50 chance         of being either a male or a female. It doesn't matter how many other brothers         or sisters are already in the family. Each baby is a separate entity and         its sex is not influenced by the sexes of earlier children. You can try         this either by tossing a coin with the head side representing a girl and         the tail side representing a boy. Another way to predict is to do a Punnett square showing a cross between         a male (XY) and a female (XX). What are your results? Does the Punnett         square show that in a family of 4 children, 2 will be male and 2 will         be female? Or is it showing that each child has a 50:50 chance of being         male or female?  Think about it! If a family already has         5 girls, what are the chances that the next baby will be a boy? We use probabilities to predict possible results of genetic crosses.         Punnett squares are an easy way to determine the probabilities of certain         types of offspring occurring from a specific cross. The genotypes and phenotypes of parents or offspring may also be written         as like other probabilities as: fractions, decimals, or ratios.
