Undo Answer Wiki 7 Answers   Leah Hawkins Bressler , Reproductive epidemiology researcher, ObGyn Sub-intern Answered Jul 29, 2012 There are two kinds of twinning that can result from IVF: (1) dizygotic (fraternal, two babies from two eggs) (2) monozygotic (identical, two babies from one egg). The risk of dizygotic twinning and higher order multiple gestations depends on the number of embryos transferred during the IVF cycle. The current Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) national summary shows: (1) -When one embryo is transferred, 98.1% of births are singletons 1.9% are twins <0.01% are higher order multiple gestations (HOMG = 3 or more) -When two embryos transferred: 65.2% of births are singletons 33.9% twins 0.8% HOMG -When three+ embryos transferred: 68.3-73.2% of births are singletons 24.1-27.7% twins 2.5-3.9% HOMG [Figure from CDC, ASRM 2009. ART Success Rates Report. US Dept HHS (1)] Thus, the risk of multiples increases with number of embryos transferred. However, the likelihood of live birth also increases up to a point (24.5% of IVF cycles result in live birth after one embryo transferred, 44% result in LB after 2 ET and 23.1-33.2% result in LB after 3+ embryos transferred) (1). To maximize chance of success (single live birth) and minimize risk of adverse outcomes, including multiple gestations, ASRM/SART regularly release embryo transfer guidelines to guide practice (2-3). [Figure from ASRM Practice Committee. Fert Steril . 2009;92:1518-1519] Yet, even when one embryo is transferred women can experience monozygotic twinning (MZT), as was Janice's experience. In natural conception, the rate of MZT is about 0.4% (4). In ART (including IVF), the rate of MZT is 2-12 times higher, ranging from 0.8-4.8% (4-5).  This increased rate of MZT is not entirely understood but has been attributed to culturing of embryos and to a technique known as Assisted Hatching (5). Assisted Hatching (AH) is when a defect is created in the shell of the fertilized egg (the Zona Pellucida) to facilitate implantation. The proposed mechanism for an increased risk of MZT is that when the embryo squeezes out of the egg, it assumes an hourglass shape that makes it vulnerable to halving in two (dividing one embryo into two identical embryos). In summary, even in cases of single embryo transfer, IVF confers at least a slight increase in risk of multiples as compared to natural conception. *Though the question doesn’t ask for comparisons to other ART techniques, it should be noted that when ART/SART guidelines for ET are followed, IVF offers lower risk of multiples than ovulation induction via Clomid or gonadotropins (6).

Why do some women fantasize about having twin babies? Do multiple rounds of IVF increase the risk of cancer? Can I have twins or triplets through IVF? Will IVF increase the chances of one having twins/triplets? How many babies can a woman have? Ask New Question Quora User , Waiting Adoptive Parent Updated Jun 26, 2012 · Author has 535 answers and 761.5k answer views When a woman does IVF she and her doctor have the choice of how many embryos to transfer into the uterus during one cycle. So the answer to this question is completely in control of the woman doing the IVF.   If she chooses to  transfer only one embryo, their chances of a multiple birth pregnancy are the same as a natural pregnancy.  But the success rate of achieving pregnancy at all with only one embryo is lower than if you have implanted multiple which is why some women opt to implant more than one at a time. The doctors I have seen have recommended 2-3 embryos to be  transferred during one month.  The risks of multiple birth pregnancies they have quoted me given an aggregate 2.5 embryos transferred is a 25% likelihood of twins and a .4% likelihood of triplets.  This is a significant difference seeing as how the percentage of twin births in the general population is 3% and 1/10th of 1% for triplets and above. transferring 2 or fewer embryos drastically reduces the possibility of a high-order multiple pregnancy (triplets or above). Reputable clinics would not allow a woman to transfer much more than 3 embryos at a time unless she was having extreme difficulty achieving a pregnancy or the embryo quality were poor.  That is why my mind boggles at stories like the octomom - I have to think, why did her clinic allow her to do that? (Edit:  The Octomom's fertility doctor is having his licence revoked for implanting 12 embryos into her. "The Beverly Hills fertility doctor has acknowledged implanting 12 embryos into Suleman, then 33, prior to the pregnancy that produced her octuplets. It was six times the norm for a woman her age." http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4324...

We transferred one embryo (as rec by our San Fran clinic) and now have identical twins. The quality of this embryo was BETTER than it would have been naturally as the very best one was chosen from the batch. It was not naturally self selecting. The age of the egg is the major contributing factor. If the age of the egg is very young think hard about transferring multiple embryos. Look at complications with even twin pregnancies and cases where selective reduction is recommended. You need to go into a multiple embryo transfer knowing the risks. 4.5k Views · View Upvoters   Pratiksha Goyal , Working with Hospitals Answered Feb 23, 2018 · Author has 173 answers and 30.8k answer views In IVF procedure its yours and the doctors decision to determine that how many embryos will be transferred in the uterus. It is possible to have a single embryo transferred this will decrease the chances of getting a twin or triple but at the same time it will decrease the chances of getting pregnant also. Also there is no guarantee your embryo will be successful. The women who are unable to afford two or more cycles opt to have more than one embryo transferred at a time. The chances of birth from multiple embryo is high as compared with a single embryo transfer. With all this age, physical health of the couples plays a very important part in the success of IVF cycles. If you are willing to get IVF treatment and are worried about multiple chance of birth than you need to be careful to the IVF success rate of the clinic which you are going to opt for. One of the best hospital for IVF is Currae Hospital . The surgeons are experienced and qualified, the success rate of IVF treatment is more than 70%. This is located in thane - mumbai.

I just like to add couple points to it. Long story short, the odds of having twins is directly correlated with the avg. number of transferred embryos. While pregnancy with twins and triples sounds like great news, it’s actually very risky as it increases chance of premature births, developmental scars such cerebral palsy and serious risks to the health of a mother. Therefore, we advise patients to select only clinics which transfer less then 3–4 embryos for any age groups less then 40 years old.

In Vitro Fertilization Gives Two Sets of Identical Twins to Couple     By Mikaela Conley  Close   Follow on Twitter   More from Mikaela   April 12, 2011   0 Shares               Email      Star     Play J Kent Photography WATCH 2 Sets of Twins for North Carolina Couple  0 Shares               Email      "Babies, babies, babies." That's how Miranda and Josh Crawford now describe a typical day after their two sets of identical twins -- quadruplets in all -- joined their two-year-old sister in February. After trying to get pregnant for more than a year, Miranda, 34, and Josh, 28, of Charlotte, N.C., turned to artificial insemination, and then in vitro fertilization, to have their first daughter. Doctors transferred two embryos into Miranda's uterus, and one survived. On March 17, 2009, Miranda gave birth to Baby Joslyn. But Miranda, 34, and Josh, 28, both registered nurses, hoped to eventually expand their family over time to three or four children. A year later, the couple sought out in vitro fertilization for a second time. Again, doctors transferred two embryos into Miranda's uterus, and, just six weeks into the pregnancy, doctors told the couple that they would be having twins. But the ultrasound was fuzzy, and both the doctor and Miranda wanted to confirm how many babies were growing in her belly. She returned to the hospital four days later. This time, the ultrasound was clear -- there were four hearts beating on the screen, not two. "I was shocked, the doctor was shocked," Miranda said. "Never had that happened in his entire career." Typically one or two embryos are inserted into a woman's uterus during one round of IVF. Even then, the patient has about a 60 percent chance of getting pregnant at all. But both embryos had split in Miranda's uterus to create two sets of identical twins. "For a woman who is less than 35 years old, it is recommended that one or two embryos be transferred into the uterus during a fresh IVF cycle," said Dr. Jani Jensen, a physician in the department of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Mayo Clinic. "In this case, it appears that the guidelines were correctly followed, but that lightning struck twice." After shock, Miranda said fear stepped in. The couple was aware of the risk and complications that come with multiple births.  A Risky Pregnancy  "The whole pregnancy was scary," Miranda said. "I wasn't sure if I was going to have a miscarriage, and I was always thinking that I could go into preterm labor at any moment." "We took it day by day," said Josh.  Rare Situation Surprises IVF Experts  "This is certainly an unusual outcome," Jensen said. "I've never seen it happen quite like this." Jensen said she has rarely seen embryos split, but doctors estimate that it can happen in a little more than 1 percent of IVF cycles, and slightly more if the embryos are transferred as blastocysts, or embryos that have developed longer outside the body. "The math here is mind-boggling: the patient likely only had about a 60 percent chance of getting pregnant at all, and with that, we expect that at least half of the time when two embryos are placed in the uterus, only one will continue to develop, so even twins are more of the exception, not the rule," Jensen said. "To have both embryos implant and both undergo the rare phenomenon of splitting is extremely unusual," Jensen continued. "There are a few reports of this happening worldwide, but overall, it's a rarity." Only 2 percent of all pregnancies result in one set of identical twins. Dr. James Grifo, director of the NYU Fertility Center, broke down the math. "Embryo splitting occurs approximately in one out of 100 embryo transfers," Grifo said. "The chance of this outcome is approximately one in 10,000. This could also occur in a natural conception, but the chance of that is much [rarer]. "We have done around 20,000 IVF cycles and have fortunately not seen this outcome," he said. "It represents a very risky obstetrical situation, but it sounds like they were fortunate and had a good outcome." "This is so rare, it is almost a record," said Dr. Michelle Warren, medical director for the Center for Menopause, Hormonal Disorders and Women's Health in New York. "However there is a view that only one embryo should be implanted at a time, particularly in patients with proven success. The issue is cost and if IVF wasn't so expensive, this would undoubtedly be standard of care."  One, No More Than Two Embryos  Warren said many European countries do not allow more than one embryo at a time because of the high risk and cost of multiple pregnancies, along with health problems with the babies. Identical twins following IVF tend to share a placenta and one of the pregnancy membranes, which makes the twin pregnancy riskier in terms of harsh growth conditions and death in the womb for one of the twins. The risk of preterm labor and delivery is very high with any sort of multiple births. Babies born premature are at an increased risk for many health complications, including learning disabilities, lung problems, cerebral palsy, blindness and deafness. Because the pregnancy was so high-risk, doctors gave the Crawfords several options, including reduction, where one or some of the fetuses are aborted for the safety of the mother and the other growing babies. The Crawfords said they never considered reduction.  Overall Healthy Pregnancy  Miranda developed gestational diabetes during the pregnancy, which she managed by controlling and restricting her diet. "My sugars were very low, but it only lasted a little while," she said. "It worked itself out before the babies came." She was also hospitalized twice in December when doctors feared she might go into preterm labor. But for the circumstance, the couple said the pregnancy went very well, considering the risk. Doctors put Miranda on strict bed rest in December. By the time she was ready to give birth, she had gained 60 pounds and her midsection measured in at five feet around. "Even at 20 weeks, I looked like I was nine months pregnant," said Miranda. "I was huge."  Babies, Babies, Babies  Mia, Madison, Jackson and James were born on Feb. 4, 2010, 34 weeks into Miranda's pregnancy. "They were all healthy, between four and a half and five and one-half pounds," Josh said. The babies spent three weeks in the neonatal ICU so doctors could monitor their feeding toleration. By Feb. 28, the brood arrived at home, expanding the family of three to seven.  Five Babies: Teamwork  Miranda and Josh said that it's all about the teamwork when caring for the babies, and keeping the infants on the same eat-sleep rotation is key. "They've gained the weight they've needed to gain, and now they can sleep as long as they want at night," Miranda said. Usually, the babies are up every three to four hours. After their morning feeding, Miranda said she bathes them, gets them dressed, gives a second feeding, changes them for the afternoon and puts them in their sleepers at night. Miranda breastfeeds two at a time while Josh bottle-feeds the other two babies. After having eight weeks off from work to care for the babies, Josh is back to work for the first time this week. "I might not get a bath or get dressed, but the babies do," Miranda said. "This case shows that nature is always ready to show doctors that we can't control everything," said Dr. Richard Paulson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine. "As much as we try to avoid high-order multiple gestations by replacing fewer and fewer embryos, every once in a while, nature reminds us that we are not in charge."        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

The Claim: Twins Always Skip a Generation   By ANAHAD O’CONNOR OCT. 2, 2007     Continue reading the main story  Share This Page   Continue reading the main story           THE FACTS People with twins in their extended families may wonder whether a crib for two is in their future, too. According to conventional wisdom, twins not only run in families, but they also — for some strange reason — always skip at least one generation. It is a claim that is widely repeated, but only partly true.  Photo         Credit Leif Parsons    Scientists have known for some time that there is a gene that can predispose women to hyperovulation, or releasing two or more eggs in a single menstrual cycle. When both eggs are fertilized, the resulting siblings are fraternal twins.  Because this gene can be passed on, the tendency to have fraternal twins can in fact run in families. Identical twins, on the other hand, result from one fertilized egg randomly splitting in two, creating two siblings with identical DNA. Because there is no known gene that influences this process, it is considered a mere coincidence when one extended family has multiple sets of identical twins. The notion that twins always skip a generation is also a myth. The illusion may have arisen because men who inherit the gene from their mothers are unaffected by it ( they do not ovulate), but can still pass it on to their daughters, who, in turn, will have an increased likelihood of conceiving twins. THE BOTTOM LINE Twins can run in families, but do not necessarily bypass generations.   scitimes@nytimes.com  A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F5 of the New York edition with the headline: Twins always skip a generation.

You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Published on March 14, 2017 by SCRC Contributor   Share this on social media:                         From the moment Beyonce Knowles announced that she and her husband were expecting twins, the media began speculating whether her multiple pregnancy may be the result of IVF. The couple has never commented on whether they sought assistance from fertility experts when they decided to grow their family, and their privacy is to be respected. Beyond the realm of celebrity gossip, however, the rumours have created an opportunity to discuss common misunderstandings about IVF and multiple births.   Does IVF cause twins?  The short answer to this question is no. The process of IVF , in and of itself, does not necessarily lead to a substantially higher risk of multiple pregnancy. In practice, the answer is slightly more nuanced. Statistically, women who undergo IVF have multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, or higher-order multiples) at a higher rate than women who conceived naturally: According to statistics published in 2013, around 40% of all IVF pregnancies in the US resulted in multiple births. That is a concerning percentage, especially when compared to the natural occurrence rate of 2% in the general population.  The main reason for this is the practice of transferring more than one embryo at a time in an IVF cycle. Until recently, most fertility doctors routinely transferred multiple embryos in the hope of achieving a better chance of success. The reason for this is that many embryos have chromosomal abnormalities which mean they are not actually viable. This is true whether the embryos are conceived naturally or through IVF. Because egg quality tends to decline over the years, the proportion of abnormal embryos generally goes up as a woman ages. Placing two or more embryos into the uterus at a time was thought to increase pregnancy rates, with the hope that at least one would survive. Quite often, more than one embryo will successfully implant, resulting in a multiple pregnancy.  What are the risks of multiple pregnancy and birth?  Twins or triplets are often a cause for joy, especially if you have waited a long time for a baby. The dream of "two for the price of one" may be extremely attractive as you face the physical, emotional, and financial investment of undergoing IVF. The reality, however, is that a multiple pregnancy carries considerably higher risks for both mother and babies. Pregnancy complications occur at a significantly higher rate in multiple pregnancies, including:   Preeclampsia  Gestational diabetes  Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)  Placental abruption  Fetal demise/loss   The birth itself can also present dangers such as:   Higher rates of Cesarean birth  Preterm labor/deliver  Low birth weights   The long-term health complications for preemies and low birthweight babies can be serious, and in some cases, life-altering. Most multiple pregnancies can be safely managed with close monitoring by your medical team, but doctors take these additional health risks seriously, and generally prefer to do what they can to make it less likely that an IVF cycle will result in a multiple pregnancy.  How can I minimize my risk of having twins?  Most leading fertility experts now consider elective single embryo transfer (eSET) to be best practice for most IVF cycles. You may have produced a large number of eggs during the ovarian stimulation process, and may have a number of viable embryos available, and your doctor may still suggest that you transfer only one (freezing the rest for any future IVF cycles.) There are several reasons for this:   Technology has made it easier to select a high quality embryo for transfer.   New developments in embryology have made it possible for experts to identify which embryos have the highest likelihood of success. This is reassuring to many patients. The ability to choose a high quality embryo takes away a little of the emotional pressure you may feel at the thought of transferring "only one."   Genetic testing.   Sophisticated genetic tests such as preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) mean that the lab can pinpoint the type of genetic abnormalities that often cause miscarriage. These tests are quite safe and can be performed with minimal risk to the embryo. PGS screens for aneuploidies, which are missing or translocated ("scrambled") chromosomes. PGD allows embryologists to get a complete picture of an embryo's chromosomal makeup, and is often used to ensure that the embryos are free of specific serious genetic conditions such as Tay Sachs Disease or cystic fibrosis.   Time lapse-photography   The Embryoscope is a cutting-edge incubator which makes it much easier for the lab to choose the healthiest available embryo for transfer. It does this in a few ways. First, a time-lapse camera takes photographs of the culturing embryos every five minutes, combining them together into mini movies for the expert to watch. This allows the lab to monitor the growth and development of the embryos without ever removing them from the ideal environment of the incubator. This cuts down on any potential exposure to harmful substances in the air or changes of light and temperature which could be a risk to a developing embryo.  The other benefit of this close monitoring is the ability to compare an embryo's rate of development to an enormous database. Machine-learning algorithms are combing through the data, and can point out the timing of crucial moments in development (such as cell splitting) which correlate to a positive or negative outcome. This is another way for the lab to discover which embryos have the best chance of resulting in a healthy pregnancy.   Blastocyst transfer.   Standard IVF practice has been to transfer embryos after about 3 days culture in the lab, but increasingly doctors and patients are opting for blastocyst transfer instead. A blastocyst is an embryo which has been incubated in the lab to the "blastocyst stage" which occurs 5 to 6 days after fertilization. Advances in lab technology, such as better culture mediums, have now made it possible to keep embryos healthy in the lab for that long. This has some unique benefits which are likely to contribute to a higher success rate.   The extra time allows the lab to identify the unhealthy embryos which are unable to reach the blastocyst stage, making it less likely that an unhealthy embryo will be implanted.  In natural conception, a 3 day old embryo would still be in the environment of the fallopian tube, not the uterus. Waiting until it is 5 to 6 days old allows the transfer to be performed in "perfect timing," as this is the stage at which the embryo is ready to implant in the lining of the uterus.    Transferring one embryo is as likely to result in pregnancy as a multiple transfer.   A recent study took a look at whether the number of embryos transferred in an IVF cycle had an effect on the live birth rate. Their analysis showed  "little to no effect on clinic-level live birth rates with increasing rates of eSET." The percentage of multiple births dropped with eSET, but the percentage of live births did not.   IVF may actually have a higher chance of success with just one embryo.   Another study discovered that transferring two embryos can reduce a patient's chance of pregnancy by almost a quarter, if one of the embryos was of lower quality. This is a particularly important point. Before transfer, all the available 3 day embryos which resulted from the IVF cycle are graded according to quality, ranging from 1 (the best, with all cells of equal size and no sign of fragmentation) down to 5 (the least promising grade, where cells may be uneven in size and there may be moderate to heavy fragmentation.) Generally, the higher an embryo's grade, the better its chances of implantation. When doctors transfer multiple embryos, they generally select the highest-quality available, but this may mean a variety of grades. What the study found was that instead of increasing the likelihood of pregnancy, the poorer-quality embryo may actually compromise the pregnancy. The results of the study revealed that when compared to eSET, a two embryo transfer with one good quality embryo and one poor quality embryo resulted in a 27% lower pregnancy rate. The researchers suspect that the poor quality embryo may cause the body to reject the pregnancy at the expense of the healthy embryo.   Every IVF cycle is unique, and there is no one answer that is right for everyone. You and your doctor will be able to assess the risks and weigh the benefits of eSET vs multiple transfer in your case. There are some cases where fertility doctors may still choose to transfer more than one embryo,often in cases where a patient is older and has had multiple failed attempts. If that does result in a multiple pregnancy, a good Los Angeles fertility clinic can keep a close eye on you during your early weeks and help you transfer your care to an obstetrician with experience handling higher-risk care such as multiples. No matter what, the end goal is always a healthy mother and a healthy baby (or two) at the end of your pregnancy.

Blog          Does IVF Significantly Increase the Chances of Twins or Triplets?  December 04, 2014. By CFA.    One of the first questions we’re asked by couples looking into in vitro fertilization (IVF) is, “Won’t IVF increase our chances of having twins or triplets?” The answer to this is, “that all depends.” According to The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology :  Multiple births are much more common today than they were in the past. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, the twin birth rate has increased by over 75% since 1980, and triplet, quadruplet, and high-order multiple births have increased at an even higher rate. There are more multiple births today in part because more women are receiving infertility treatment…  With IVF, you and your doctor determine how many embryos will be transferred into your uterus . If you choose to have a single embryo transferred, then it would be rare for you to have twins or triplets. There is the possibility that the embryo could split resulting in twins. However, there is no guarantee your embryo will successfully implant into the uterine lining the first time around. This is why many women, especially those who are unable to afford two or more cycles, often opt to have more than one embryo transferred. Interestingly, the chances of a live birth from multiple embryo transfers increase only slightly compared with a single embryo transfer, although your chances of a multiple birth increase significantly. Age, physical health and embryo viability play a large part in the success of IVF cycles.  Multiple Births Are Higher Risk for Both Mothers and Babies  There are several reasons why pregnancies involving multiples post a higher risk for mothers and babies. It is harder on a female’s body to carry more than one baby so women who are pregnant with twins, triplets or higher numbers of multiples are at greater risk for preeclampsia, placental issues and diabetes. Also, multiple babies are rarely born full-term, which means your baby is at higher risk for the health complications associated with premature birth.  Consider the following statistics regarding multiple births and their average gestation (full-term singleton babies are typically born between 37 – 42 weeks and weigh 7.3 lbs).   Twins: 35 weeks              1 lbs  Triplets: 32 weeks              7 lbs.  Quadruplets: 30 weeks              9 lbs.   Premature babies are 50% more likely to experience respiratory distress. Additional complications like brain damage, cerebral palsy, and other disabilities are more likely for babies who are part of a set of twins, triplets or quadruplets. While we don’t share this information to scare you, it is important that you realize the risks involved when you opt to transfer multiple embryos.  To prevent parents from feeling pressure to implant multiple embryos in an attempt to have a live birth from their first IVF cycle, the March of Dimes Foundation has recently published an encouraging article in the Fertility and Sterility. The article advocates for systemic changes across the board, from the political and medical arenas on down to insurance funding and financing options for infertile couples so they feel less pressured to attempt multiple transfers.  If you are interested in IVF treatments and are worried about the chance of multiples, pay careful attention to the IVF success rates and statistics of the clinics you are considering. Also, remember that you are the one in control . You should never feel pressured to transfer more than one embryo is that isn’t what you want.

Maya  says:   August 30, 2016 at 8:15 pm   “If you choose to have a single embryo transferred, then it would be impossible for you to have twins or triplets. ”  Uh…no.  You can still have identical twins if the embryo splits or in a super rare instance identical triplets.  Unlikely? Yes.  Impossible? No.    Reply         Eva  says:   September 28, 2016 at 4:05 pm   @ maya, I was thinking the same thing lol    Reply         LUKE "THE TEST TUBE BABY" O'MALLEY  says:   November 4, 2016 at 1:16 pm   I AM AN IVF BABY LOLLLLLLL BUT NO TWIN SO DW GUYS THERES STILL A CHANCE YOU WON’T HAVE A TWIN    Reply         Famatta boimah  says:   March 1, 2017 at 5:46 pm   I will like to meet with the doctor for more question thanks.

Odds of Conceiving Twins Naturally or With Fertility Treatment    By Rachel Gurevich  | Reviewed by Anita Sadaty, MD    Updated February 25, 2018            Share       Pin       Email      Print                  Niki Mareschal / Photographer's Choice / Getty Images       More in Getting Pregnant        Trying to Conceive       Fertility Challenges     Are You Pregnant?        What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

So if you're taking Clomid (clomiphene) you may be nervous (or excited) about the prospect of having two or more babies at once. However, those newsworthy high-order multiple stories are more likely with injectable fertility drugs that are used during intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments.         For every 20 pregnancies conceived with Clomid, which is a pill taken by mouth to induce ovulation, the drug causes twin pregnancies between 5 and 8 percent of the time. That's fewer than one in 10 pregnancies or approximately one in 20 pregnancies. Your odds of conceiving triplets (or more) on Clomid is less than one percent. That's less than one in 100 pregnancies. Why Clomid May Increase the Chance of Multiples A woman's ovaries contain hundreds of thousands of follicles each containing immature egg cells . Once every month, several follicles begin a process of development. Usually, only one follicle fully develops and releases an egg. This is because once a follicle becomes mature enough on its own, the follicle releases hormones into the bloodstream that signal the body to slow down production of egg-stimulating hormones. Clomid works by tricking the body into bumping up egg-stimulating hormones, causing the follicles in the ovaries to continue to mature, increasing the likelihood that more than one egg will develop to maturity and be released during ovulation.   Most twins conceived with Clomid will not be identical. During clinical trials of twin pregnancies, one in five were identical twins, while 80 percent of the twin pregnancies were fraternal twins (not identical). Why aren't they identical? Clomid increases your odds of conceiving twins because your ovaries may ovulate more than one eggs: Identical twins come from one egg, not two.         Other Factors That Up the Odds Having Twins Fertility drugs aren't the only cause of multiple pregnancies. Even without Clomid, your odds of getting pregnant with more than one baby increase depending on factors such as your age, height, weight, and family history. Using a higher dosage than necessary also may increase the risk of having twins. Ironically, using a higher dosage of Clomid than necessary also may lower the chances you'll get pregnant at all because it can cause cervical mucus to be thicker and harder for sperm to travel through. For that reason, when a doctor prescribes Clomid, she will start with the lowest dose. Only if that dosage doesn't trigger ovulation will she increase it. Women taking Clomid who do not have trouble ovulating or getting pregnant, as well as women younger than 25, may have an increased risk of getting pregnant with twins while taking Clomid . How Will I Know If I Got Pregnant With Twins While Taking Clomid? Symptoms of early pregnancy are no different with twin. Nor are an early positive result on a pregnancy test or having high levels of hCG on a blood test reliable indicators of a twin pregnancy. This means you won't know if you conceived twins until you have an ultrasound.         Depending on your health history, your doctor may order one at the six-week mark (two weeks after you miss your period), but this may be too early to detect twins. However, by the eighth week, a twin pregnancy should be visible. If you get pregnant with twins after taking Clomid, don't panic. Good prenatal care can reduce the odds of complications, and support from friends and family can help you make the most of this double blessing . Sources: American Society of Reproductive Medicine .

These drugs are used to stimulate ovulation. Brand names that may be familiar to you include Gonal-F, Follistim, Ovidrel, Menopur, and Luveris. (More names below.) Gonadotropins are known informally as injectables. They are administered by injection only. (This is different from fertility drugs like Clomid and letrozole , which are pills you take by mouth.)         The naturally occurring hormones in the body FSH and LH are also known as gonadotropins. They play a pivotal role in ovulation . How Do They Work? To better understand how gonadotropins work, you should first understand how the female reproductive system works. Read an easy to understand, step-by-step explanation of the female reproductive cycle here. If you don't have time for that, here's a super quick recap! Normally, your pituitary gland produces FSH and LH at the beginning of your menstrual cycle. The FSH is sent out into the body. LH is stored in the pituitary gland until just before ovulation. FSH tells the follicles in your ovaries to wake up and grow. FSH stands for "follicle stimulating hormone." Makes perfect sense, given it stimulates the follicles ! Gonadotropin fertility drugs, that are FSH or FSH along with LH, act similarly. They tell the follicles on your ovaries to grow and develop.   LH typically peaks just before ovulation during a natural cycle and helps any mature eggs to go through one last growth spurt and release. In other words, ovulate! During treatment with gonadotropins, you may be given either an injection of rLH or, more commonly, hCG . This acts like the natural LH spike and will trigger ovulation.         What to Expect Gonadotropins may be used on their own. They may also be used as part of an IUI treatment or IVF treatment cycle. Below is an explanation of how they may be used on their own. When you get your next period, you'll call your doctor. You'll then have some blood work and an ultrasound. This is to make sure there are no complications or reasons you can't be treated in this cycle. (For example, to ensure you aren't pregnant and don't have a benign ovarian cyst .) Your doctor will likely start you off with 75 to 150 IU of the gonadotropin medication. Depending on which gonadotropin is prescribed, you'll need to give yourself injections just below the skin (subcutaneously) or into the muscle (intramuscularly). Ask your doctor or nurse to demonstrate how to safely perform the injections. They will likely do this without you asking. How to Give Yourself a Subcutaneous Injection How to Give Yourself an IM Injection Over the next several days, your hormone levels, specifically estradiol , and the follicles on your ovaries will be closely monitored. This monitoring happens via blood work and ultrasound every few days. How often? That will depend on your doctor's protocol, how you're responding to the drugs, and how close you are to ovulation.         Your medications may be adjusted up or down depending on the ultrasound and hormone results. The goal is to stimulate the ovaries enough to produce one good egg, but not to overstimulate them. Other stimulation can increase your risks of a multiple pregnancy or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). When your hormone levels and follicle size indicate ovulation is close, your doctor may order an injection of hCG. This is also known as the " trigger shot ." It triggers ovulation to occur approximately 36 hours later. Your doctor should also tell you which days to have intercourse, so you can"catch" the egg and get pregnant!  How to Cope with Doctor Prescribed Conception Sex During Treatment Once ovulation occurs, you may then start taking progesterone . Not everyone will need this, however. Your hormone levels will continue to be monitored, though less frequently. You'll take a pregnancy test at the end of the cycle to determine if treatment was successful. Sometimes, treatment may be canceled in the middle. This may occur before the trigger shot or even earlier. The most common reason for cycle cancellation is your doctor suspects the ovaries have been hyperstimulated. Stopping the medications can avoid a serious case of OHSS and high-order multiples. Your doctor may also tell you to refrain from intercourse. As difficult as it is to hear this, it's very important you follow your doctor's instructions. Pregnancy can increase the chances of a high-order pregnancy, which puts you and your babies at risk. Also, if you develop OHSS, pregnancy can complicate your recovery. Different Types There are two basic types of gonadotropins: recombinant gonadotropins and urinary-extracted gonadotropins. Recombinant gonadotropins are created in a laboratory using recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant FSH gonadotropins on the market include Gonal-F and Follistim. Currently, Luveris is the only recombinant LH gonadotropin available. Urinary-extracted gonadotropins are extracted and purified from the urine of postmenopausal women. (Their urine is naturally high in FSH.) They include human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG), purified FSH and highly purified FSH. Purified urine-extracted FSH gonadotropins include Bravelle and Fertinex. Human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) contains FSH and LH. It includes medications like Humegon, Menogon, Pergonal and Repronex. Menopur is a highly purified hMG. A related drug, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is often part of fertility treatment with gonadotropin injections . You may know hCG as the pregnancy hormone , but it also happens to be molecularly similar to LH. In a natural cycle, LH triggers ovulation . As part of fertility treatment , an injection of hCG may be used to trigger ovulation. Ovidrel, Novarel, Pregnyl and Profasi are brand names for hCG injectables. Associated Risks Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a potentially serious complication of gonadotropin therapy. Mild OHSS occurs in 10% to 20% of women taking gonadotropins. Serious OHSS occurs 1% of the time. Serious OHSS can be deadly if ignored or not treated properly. It's important you are familiar with the symptoms. OHSS Symptoms and Treatment Another possible risk factor of gonadotropin therapy is a multiple pregnancy. Some studies have found that up to 30% of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins are twins or more. (This is compared to just 1% to 2% of naturally conceived pregnancies.) Most multiple pregnancies with gonadotropins are twins. Up to 5% are triplets or more. Multiple pregnancies , including twin pregnancies , are risky for the mother and the babies. Close monitoring of a treatment cycle can help prevent a multiple pregnancy. Many doctors will cancel if more than three follicles develop or if estradiol levels are very high. Some studies have been able to get the rate of multiples pregnancies as low as 5%. They have done this by starting at a low dose, using slow increases only when necessary and close monitoring. Twin Pregnancy Risks Should I Get Pregnant with Twins on Purpose? Quiz: Are Your Odds of Conceiving Twins Higher Than Most? The risk of ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage is higher with gonadotropin-conceived pregnancies. Less than 1% of women taking gonadotropins will experience adnexal torsion, or ovarian twisting. This is when the ovary twists on itself and cuts off its own blood supply. Surgery is necessary to untwist or possibly remove the affected ovary. Your risk of pregnancy complications -- like pregnancy-induced high blood pressure and placental abruption -- may be slightly increased as compared to a naturally conceived pregnancy. Whether this is caused by the gonadotropins or the infertility is unclear. Because gonadotropins are injectable medications, you may also experience soreness near the injection sites. If you suspect an infection, be sure to alert your doctor right away. Side Effects and Risks of Gonadotropins What Are the Success Rates? Your potential for pregnancy success with gonadotropins will depend on a variety of factors, including your age and the cause of infertility. A 2011 study by The Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine looked at 1,400 gonadotropin treatment cycles. The overall pregnancy rate was 12%, with the live birth rate about 7.7%. Younger patients had higher live birth rates. In this study, by canceling the cycle if three or more dominant follicles developed or estradiol levels were higher than 1500 pg/ml, they were able to keep the multiple pregnancy rate a low 2.6%. Older studies have found higher pregnancy rates with gonadotropins than this one. However, it's possible the higher success rate came at the expense of higher risk for OHSS and multiple pregnancy. Cost of Treatment Gonadotropin treatment that is not an IUI or IVF cycle can cost anywhere between $500 to $5,000. The higher price takes into account blood work and ultrasound monitoring. Also, the price varies because different women will need different amounts of drugs. Your insurance company may pay for part of treatment. Or, they may pay for all of it... or none of it. You may need to pay your fertility clinic in full first. Then, you may need to file for a refund from your insurance yourself, or the clinic may handle the insurance claims for you. Be sure to clarify all of this with your fertility clinic before you start treatment. You don't want to be surprised by a high bill at the end.

You may feel excited and happy, especially if you've gone through a long journey to get to this point. It's also normal to feel nervous, scared, or even sad. There are risks to a multiple pregnancy. You may be worrying about losing the babies or wondering if you'll be able to handle caring for them when they arrive. You may also feel angry - getting pregnant was difficult for you, and now you face a potentially difficult pregnancy and birth.         It's true there are risks to multiples . You do need to be informed of the risks so you can be aware of troublesome symptoms and make informed choices. However, there are also many positive aspects to carrying and raising more than one baby at a time. Denial isn't good, but focusing on only the negative isn't great either. Here are some positive thoughts on twins and multiples. Two (or Three or Four) Heartbeats Remember when you hoped to see any heartbeat on the ultrasound screen? The first time the ultrasound tech detects not just one but more than one heartbeat, you may be thrilled and scared. But over time, as you slowly come to accept the multiple pregnancy, seeing more than one blip on the screen will warm your heart. Earlier (and More!) Sensations of Fetal Movement Mothers of multiples may pick up fetal movement weeks before mothers of singletons. When the first movements begin, you may need to be very quiet and still.   The sensations may be light, like butterflies. As the pregnancy continues, the movements will become more noticeable. Near the end, people sitting next to you may be able to see the bumps and squirms! Double the Baby Bliss As the mother of multiples, you'll get to enjoy double (or triple or quadruple!) the baby bliss.         Moms of one may baby may gaze upon their one sleeping child and smile with joy. But you'll get to gaze on one face, and then another adorable face, and maybe another! You'll also get to go through the thrill of the first smile, the first giggle, the first word, the first step, and so on, more than once. The joy isn't less for the next baby. Each big moment is precious. Fascination of Watching Multiple Children Grow Together You may begin to feel like you're witnessing a research study in your own home, as you watch your children develop at different rates and in different ways. We all know that each person is an individual. That said, we don't often get to see babies or children at the exact same age, raised in the same environment, grow together. For example, your babies may not only start walking at different times but also reach that milestone in different ways. One may scoot and then crawl and then walk. Another may coast around the room and never do much crawling. If you have identical twins, you may wonder at the things they do that are similar compared to the things they do that are so very unique. If you have a boy and a girl, you may find it interesting how they play or develop in different (or similar!) ways.         Automatic Playmates Twins may not always become the best of playmates, just like any pair of siblings. But in the younger years especially, they will be their first playmates to each other. The idea of life without their twin won't even occur to them. As they get older, some twins remain close playmates. They may have an especially close sibling relationship as adults as well. Automatic Family If you have twins, and they are your first, you already have the average American family size of two children. Automatic family! Get the Diapers and Sleepless Nights Out of the Way Of course, if you plan on having more, this may not be quite a big advantage.  However, if you think these will be your last babies, you'll be able to go through diaper days and sleepless nights all at once, instead of over a period of four to five years. Your diaper changing and lack of sleep will be more intense than those caring for one baby. Not everyone will agree this is the easiest path. On the other hand, if you're going to focus on the positives, might as well celebrate the multiples boot camp path - overwhelming but over faster! Impress Friends and Strangers at Parties If you've been dealing with infertility for awhile, you've probably listened to your share of parents complain about their kids. You may have even heard the infuriating comment , "Consider yourself lucky you don't have kids! They just take over your life!" Well, now, you can one-up those people. When they start complaining about their one baby or one young child, you can say, "I have twins." (Or triplets, or quads, whatever you've got.) For best effect, say it nonchalantly. With a glass of wine in hand. They are likely to respond, "Oh, I could never handle twins!" That's when you, again, in a totally calm blissed-out voice, "You're probably right. Personally, I'm in heaven." And if they declare you super mom or dad, accept that title with pride. (I feel the need to say if you don't feel you're handling the twins or triplets well, that's totally normal, too. Ask for help from those that can offer you positive support. But at the party, go ahead and fib a little about how competent you're feeling!) Focus on the Positive Side of Statistics Yes, twin and multiple births come with risks. But those risks come with a positive side as well. For example, if 10% of twin mothers experience gestational diabetes , 90% of twin moms don't. If one in four mothers of twins face pregnancy hypertension, three in four do not have problems with high blood pressure. If 10% of identical twins sharing one placenta experience twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) , 90% do not. Sixty percent of twins are born prematurely . But 40% are born on time. Of those twins born after 35 weeks, about half are born vaginally. Be careful not to use the positive side of statistics to ignore symptoms or blow off doctor's orders. Balance your optimism with reasonable caution, and you're more likely to have a healthier and happier twin pregnancy.

They may think; "we want kids, and all this treatment is expensive and unpleasant, so let's just have 2 kids and get it over with". When they are fully aware of the risks to the children if delivery is premature, some couples no longer prefer a multiple pregnancy. However, after full disclosure of the risks, many couples still hope for twins. Of course, they are also hoping that their children will be perfectly healthy. The psychological, social, and economic stresses involved with caring for twins is substantial, but patients often say they would welcome facing those stresses if they were so blessed. The risks of a multiple pregnancy are high. These expectant mothers face an increased risk for developing complications of pregnancy such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, preterm labor, hemorrhage, and other complications. The risks to the fetuses and children are mostly related to premature delivery and can be very severe. Compared to a singleton, a twin is about five times more likely to die in the first year of life. For a triplet, this risk is about 13 times that of a singleton. The risk of having a lifelong handicap (e.g., cerebral palsy, mental retardation) is increased about 10 times for twins compared to singles, and these risks are substantially higher for triplets. Quadruplet and other high-order pregnancies are much riskier. Fortunately, with current embryo transfer policies, pregnancies beyond triplets are rare with IVF.      Statistics about the number of embryos transferred and multiple pregnancies  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) gather, tabulate, and publish annual national summaries and clinic-specific reports of IVF statistics.   These reports cover live birth rates, twin and triplet rates, the average number of embryos transferred per patient and other variables   The report for IVF cycles in 2015 is currently available  on the SART website, the CDC report lags behind the SART report - 2015 preliminary data is the most recent available from CDC.   Links to the SART and CDC reports   These annual reports show the trend in the United States toward transferring fewer embryos.   In 1997, the average number of embryos transferred to women under 35 was 3.7  By 2000, it was down to 2.9  Over the same time period, there was a significant increase in the overall live birth rates for IVF procedures  At the same time, the percentage of births that were triplets or more dropped from about 14% to about 9%  However, over the same period of time, no progress was made with regard to reducing the rate of twin pregnancies, which remained at about 32% of births.  Over that 4-year period, US IVF centers transferred less embryos, resulting in higher success rates, a lower percentage of triplets, but no change in the percentage of twins.   In general, European infertility clinics are transferring fewer embryos as compared to American IVF centers. On average, they have lower pregnancy rates and a lower percentage of multiple births than clinics in the United States. There are several factors involved in this difference. In some European countries, physicians are restricted by law so that they cannot transfer more than two embryos. Also, IVF is more commonly paid for by insurance or socialized medical systems in Europe. In the United States, couples with insurance coverage for IVF services are more likely to prefer fewer embryos for transfer. By comparison, couples who must pay out of pocket for IVF often request that more embryos be transferred. They tend to be fearful of failure because of the high financial costs associated with repeating the IVF process.       What is the appropriate number of embryos to transfer?   In 2017, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and SART published revised guidelines regarding the appropriate maximum number of embryos to transfer. The ASRM guidelines suggest a maximum number of embryos to transfer based on the day of transfer (cleavage stage vs. blast), "prognosis category" (favorable vs. all others), whether preimplantation genetic screening was done to screen out chromosomally abnormal embryos, and female age .   Current ASRM - SART guidelines on maximum number of embryos to transfer (updated 2017)     Maximum Number of Embryos to Transfer  Cleavage-stage Embryos (day 2 or day 3 ET)      Age < 35  Age 35-37  Age 38-40  Age 41-42    Favorable Prognosis  1  1  3  4    All others  2  3  4  5    Euploid  1  1  1  1       Maximum Number of Embryos to Transfer  Blastocyst Embryos (day 5 or day 6 ET)      Age < 35  Age 35-37  Age 38-40  Age 41-42    Favorable Prognosis  1  1  2  3    All others  2  2  3  3    Euploid  1  1  1  1     The ASRM identifies the following characteristics as being associated with a "more favorable prognosis":   First cycle of IVF  Good embryo quality by morphology grading criteria  Excess embryos available for freezing  Having a previous successful IVF cycle    These guidelines have been helpful in limiting the number of embryos transferred, particularly in patients with the most favorable prognosis. However, many couples in the other categories who choose to have more than two transferred could still be at high risk for multiples, including triplets. Also, patients with embryos that have a high potential for implantation might have a high risk of twins if they have two transferred. Couples with a very high chance for pregnancy can be identified on the day of embryo transfer and can be offered the option of transferring one or two embryos. When a couple has high-quality embryos available for transfer on day 5 and they are offered the options of transferring one embryo with a 50% expectation for pregnancy (almost all singles) or two embryos with an 75% expectation for pregnancy (about 38% twins, 60% single, and 2% triplets), most couples choose to transfer two embryos. This is  after counseling them about the medical risks involved for mother and babies with multiple pregnancies. They want the higher chance for pregnancy and are accepting (sometimes even welcoming) the risks that are involved with a multiple pregnancy. Those who choose to have a single embryo transferred usually have insurance coverage for IVF or have at least one child already.      What is blastocyst culture and transfer?  A blastocyst is an embryo that has developed for 5 to 7 days after fertilization and has just started to differentiate. It has developed two different cell types and a central cavity. One group of cells will become the placenta, and the other group will become the fetus. A healthy blastocyst will begin hatching from its outer shell by the sixth or seventh day. Shortly after hatching from the shell, it should begin to implant into the lining of the mother's uterus. In past years, the majority of embryo transfers were done on day 3 (after the egg retrieval) at the "cleavage stage" when the embryos have four to eight cells. One problem with this is that day 3 embryos normally are found in the fallopian tubes, not in the uterus. The embryo first moves into the uterus at about 80 hours after ovulation. The embryo implantation process begins about 3 days later, after blastocyst formation and hatching have occurred. The other problem with transferring on day 3 is that many embryos at that stage do not have the capacity to continue development and become high-quality blastocysts. We do not have reliable methods to determine which of the day 3 embryos will be viable long-term. Therefore, the tendency has been to transfer more embryos on day 3 in an attempt to achieve good pregnancy rates. When embryos are cultured from day 3 to day 5, some will stop developing and others (usually 25% to 60%) will continue to become blastocysts. Therefore, by choosing the best blastocysts for transfer on day 5, we can choose much more reliably those with the best potential for implanting and making a baby. In the past it was difficult to get good numbers of high-quality blastocysts with in vitro culture systems. However, advanced culture media have been developed that provide the proper balance of nutrients at the various stages of early embryo development. Proper culture techniques with these new media formulations yield excellent blastocyst formation rates. This makes blastocyst transfer a viable option for some couples with infertility. Some programs are doing all IVF cases with day 5 transfers. One of the issues with this is that a small proportion of couples will have embryos that are growing on day 3, but by day 5, all of their embryos have stopped developing. These patients could have had a day 3 embryo transfer, but because their embryos were kept in culture and arrested after day 3, they will not have an embryo transfer at all. This has been reported to occur in about 5% of cases if all patient's embryos are cultured for 5 days. The ultimate outcome of the cycle might be exactly the same either way (a failed cycle), but many couples would  prefer to have an embryo transfer and then not be pregnant as opposed to being called and told that their embryos have stopped developing and therefore they will not have an embryo transfer procedure. Our IVF program and many others perform blastocyst transfers in selected cases. Most IVF centers (including ours) that perform day 5 transfers have selection criteria for deciding which cases are transferred on day 3 versus day 5. The criteria often involve a minimum number of fertilized eggs or a minimum number of embryos that are still developing on day 3. In our IVF program, we (currently - 2017) usually perform day 3 transfers for couples (female age under 37) with less than 3 day 3 embryos, and do day 5 transfers for couples with 3 or more  day 3 embryos. This has been working well for us with rare cases having no embryos available for transfer on day 5. Individual factors are often important in making this decision, such as:   Age of the female partner  Information from previous IVF cycles  The planned number of embryos to be transferred to the uterus (1, 2 or 3)  Whether preimplantation genetic screening is desired by the couple         Do blastocyst transfers correlate with higher pregnancy rates than day 3 transfers?   Yes, in most published studies, and in the experience of many IVF programs, pregnancy rates are higher with blastocyst transfers when a given number of embryos are transferred (e.g. two). This is because of the higher potential for implantation of the blastocyst. However, the issue is complicated because some IVF centers have seen no improvement or even lower pregnancy rates with blastocyst transfers. This is because blastocyst culture and transfer is technically more complicated and difficult as compared to day 3 transfer. Some laboratories are not able to maintain the stable and exacting culture environment for 5 days that allows the optimal development of the embryos. Therefore, it is not surprising that extended culture and transfer of two embryos on day 5 can show excellent pregnancy rates in some centers and significantly lower results in others. This concept is well-understood in the embryology world, but it is not widely discussed in public forums.      How can blastocyst transfer benefit couples needing IVF?  Because blastocysts have a significantly higher implantation potential than day 3 embryos, the physician can transfer only two embryos and keep pregnancy rates high (over 50% per egg retrieval procedure in some programs for women under age 40) and triplet pregnancy rates down in the 2% to 4% range (one of the two embryos can split into identical twins to make triplets). Transferring only two embryos on day 3 results (on average) in an even lower rate of twin and triplet pregnancies (a good thing), but this happens at the cost of a lower overall pregnancy rate. Because of the high implantation potential of blastocyst embryos, we should be cautious about the high potential for twins. Transfer of two good looking blastocysts can result in twin pregnancy rates as high as 50%. Therefore, transferring only one should be considered in young women (or in egg donation cycles) with high-quality blastocysts. Pregnancy rates with single embryo transfer (SET) in these patients can be in the 40-60% range in good IVF programs with a very low risk of twins (about 2% due to embryo splitting - identical twins).  How can PGS testing benefit couples needing IVF?   When we screen embryos prior to the transfer with preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) we see excellent pregnancy and live birth success rates after transfer of a single embryo when it has normal PGS results. We now have years of experience with doing this for couples that choose to have it.   Conclusions  Blastocyst culture and transfer of one or two embryos in IVF centers that are proficient with this technique currently offers the best balance between the chances of having any pregnancy and the risks of  multiple pregnancy.  The decision to transfer one or 2 (or more) should be based on the age of the female , the morphology grading of the blastocysts and the history of their previous IVF treatments.  Doing PGS screening on blastocysts and then transferring a single embryo is currently the state of the art for IVF. It provides a high probability for a healthy outcome for mother and baby and reduces miscarriage risk.

Undo Answer Wiki 7 Answers   Leah Hawkins Bressler , Reproductive epidemiology researcher, ObGyn Sub-intern Answered Jul 29, 2012 There are two kinds of twinning that can result from IVF: (1) dizygotic (fraternal, two babies from two eggs) (2) monozygotic (identical, two babies from one egg). The risk of dizygotic twinning and higher order multiple gestations depends on the number of embryos transferred during the IVF cycle. The current Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) national summary shows: (1) -When one embryo is transferred, 98.1% of births are singletons 1.9% are twins <0.01% are higher order multiple gestations (HOMG = 3 or more) -When two embryos transferred: 65.2% of births are singletons 33.9% twins 0.8% HOMG -When three+ embryos transferred: 68.3-73.2% of births are singletons 24.1-27.7% twins 2.5-3.9% HOMG [Figure from CDC, ASRM 2009. ART Success Rates Report. US Dept HHS (1)] Thus, the risk of multiples increases with number of embryos transferred. However, the likelihood of live birth also increases up to a point (24.5% of IVF cycles result in live birth after one embryo transferred, 44% result in LB after 2 ET and 23.1-33.2% result in LB after 3+ embryos transferred) (1). To maximize chance of success (single live birth) and minimize risk of adverse outcomes, including multiple gestations, ASRM/SART regularly release embryo transfer guidelines to guide practice (2-3). [Figure from ASRM Practice Committee. Fert Steril . 2009;92:1518-1519] Yet, even when one embryo is transferred women can experience monozygotic twinning (MZT), as was Janice's experience. In natural conception, the rate of MZT is about 0.4% (4). In ART (including IVF), the rate of MZT is 2-12 times higher, ranging from 0.8-4.8% (4-5).  This increased rate of MZT is not entirely understood but has been attributed to culturing of embryos and to a technique known as Assisted Hatching (5). Assisted Hatching (AH) is when a defect is created in the shell of the fertilized egg (the Zona Pellucida) to facilitate implantation. The proposed mechanism for an increased risk of MZT is that when the embryo squeezes out of the egg, it assumes an hourglass shape that makes it vulnerable to halving in two (dividing one embryo into two identical embryos). In summary, even in cases of single embryo transfer, IVF confers at least a slight increase in risk of multiples as compared to natural conception. *Though the question doesn’t ask for comparisons to other ART techniques, it should be noted that when ART/SART guidelines for ET are followed, IVF offers lower risk of multiples than ovulation induction via Clomid or gonadotropins (6).

Why do some women fantasize about having twin babies? Do multiple rounds of IVF increase the risk of cancer? Can I have twins or triplets through IVF? Will IVF increase the chances of one having twins/triplets? How many babies can a woman have? Ask New Question Quora User , Waiting Adoptive Parent Updated Jun 26, 2012 · Author has 535 answers and 761.5k answer views When a woman does IVF she and her doctor have the choice of how many embryos to transfer into the uterus during one cycle. So the answer to this question is completely in control of the woman doing the IVF.   If she chooses to  transfer only one embryo, their chances of a multiple birth pregnancy are the same as a natural pregnancy.  But the success rate of achieving pregnancy at all with only one embryo is lower than if you have implanted multiple which is why some women opt to implant more than one at a time. The doctors I have seen have recommended 2-3 embryos to be  transferred during one month.  The risks of multiple birth pregnancies they have quoted me given an aggregate 2.5 embryos transferred is a 25% likelihood of twins and a .4% likelihood of triplets.  This is a significant difference seeing as how the percentage of twin births in the general population is 3% and 1/10th of 1% for triplets and above. transferring 2 or fewer embryos drastically reduces the possibility of a high-order multiple pregnancy (triplets or above). Reputable clinics would not allow a woman to transfer much more than 3 embryos at a time unless she was having extreme difficulty achieving a pregnancy or the embryo quality were poor.  That is why my mind boggles at stories like the octomom - I have to think, why did her clinic allow her to do that? (Edit:  The Octomom's fertility doctor is having his licence revoked for implanting 12 embryos into her. "The Beverly Hills fertility doctor has acknowledged implanting 12 embryos into Suleman, then 33, prior to the pregnancy that produced her octuplets. It was six times the norm for a woman her age." http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4324...

The quality of this embryo was BETTER than it would have been naturally as the very best one was chosen from the batch. It was not naturally self selecting. The age of the egg is the major contributing factor. If the age of the egg is very young think hard about transferring multiple embryos. Look at complications with even twin pregnancies and cases where selective reduction is recommended.

It is possible to have a single embryo transferred this will decrease the chances of getting a twin or triple but at the same time it will decrease the chances of getting pregnant also. Also there is no guarantee your embryo will be successful. The women who are unable to afford two or more cycles opt to have more than one embryo transferred at a time. The chances of birth from multiple embryo is high as compared with a single embryo transfer. With all this age, physical health of the couples plays a very important part in the success of IVF cycles.

Undo Answer Wiki 7 Answers Quora User , Emergency Nurse, Clinical Nurse Educator Answered Dec 9, 2011 · Author has 2.2k answers and 12.9m answer views Multiple births are a recognised 'problem' in ivf pregnancies. Although in vitro fertilisation (IVF) births account for only a small percentage (1.3%) of all births nationally, over 20% of all multiple births are IVF births. This means that IVF births contribute a disproportionately large number of multiple births to the overall rate. At present, about 1 in 4 IVF pregnancies result in multiples: this is around 20 times higher than the rate after natural conception. The reasons for this are usually due to the number of embryos's transferred as the following illustrates:- How does IVF affect the risk of multiple birth? Multiple birth is the single biggest risk to the health and welfare of children born after IVF. See Risks to the mother and Risks to the child. Currently, after IVF and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) around 24% of pregnancies are multiple, compared with only 1 – 2% after natural conception. This can be directly related to the fact that IVF normally involves the transferring of 2 or 3 embryos to the womb. At present, according to HFEA guidance, the number of embryos that can be transferred is no more than 2 for women under 40 (or for those receiving donated eggs as donors are under 35) or no more than 3 for women over 40. If two separate embryos implant in the womb, the mother will be pregnant with non-identical twins. The chance of a single embryo dividing and resulting in identical twins is also higher after IVF though it is not yet known why this happens. So it is possible to end up with twins from a single transferred embryo, or triplets from 2 embryos. Most of the triplets born after IVF are the result of double embryo transfer. Data from the UK (2005) shows that almost 46% of babies born as a result of IVF to women under 35 (using fresh eggs) are multiple births. ( www.oneatatime.org ) There are many risks inherent to both the mother and the babies born in a multiple birth pregnancy:- Risks to the mother For mothers, risks arising from multiple pregnancies range from the less serious to the life-threatening. Pregnancy complications A number of pregnancy complications (hypertension, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes etc) may mean an early admission to hospital for the last weeks of pregnancy and that the birth may have to be induced early. Higher rates of miscarriage. 20% of women pregnant with twins suffer from pregnancy induced hypertension, compared to around 1–5% of women pregnant with a singleton. Research in the UK found that the risk of pre-eclampsia was up to 30% for twin pregnancies compared to 2–10% in singleton pregnancies. The risk of gestational diabetes is up to 12% in twin pregnancies compared to around 4% for singleton pregnancies. Higher chance of intervention in delivery. Elective and emergency caesarean section rates are higher for mothers of twins. Maternal mortality There is a 1/25,000 risk of maternal mortality during singleton pregnancy or birth versus 2/25,000 risk of maternal mortality during twin pregnancy or birth. Risks to the child For children, the highest risk from being one of a number of multiples is prematurity, with all its attendant problems. Premature birth The greatest risk associated with multiple pregnancies is premature birth: Research in the UK found that twins were born on average at 35.8 weeks, compared to the 40 week average for singletons. A study in the US found that at least half of all twins were born prematurely (before 37 weeks) and at low birth weight. An American study reported that 11.8% of twins compared to 1.6% of singletons are born before 32 weeks of gestation. International research concluded that, as a rough estimate, in vitro fertilisation (IVF) twins are born with an average gestational age 3 weeks earlier than IVF singletons and with a mean birth weight ranging between 800g and 1000g less. An Australian study found that 48.4% of twins had low and very low birth weight compared with 8.2% of singletons. Perinatal mortality Twins are 6 times more likely to die in the first year of life than singletons (24.1/1000 compared with 4.4/1000). In 2003, had all IVF babies born in the UK been singletons, the deaths of an estimated 126 babies could have been avoided. Neonatal care Between 40-60% of IVF twins are transferred to neonatal care units when they are born, compared with 20% of IVF singletons.  In a Belgian study, intensive care stays of more than four weeks were endured by 11.7% of IVF twins, but only 1.6% of IVF singletons. The risk of delivery before 28 weeks is 1.2% for twins compared to 0.2% for singletons. Research in the UK and Ireland found that 75% of babies born before 26 weeks died very soon after birth and before admission to neonatal care. Those admitted had a 39% chance of survival. 62% of those that survived had significant brain damage, retinopathy of prematurity, and/or ongoing oxygen dependence at their predicted due date. Respiratory distress In a Belgian study, 8% of twins required assisted ventilation and 6% suffered from respiratory distress syndrome compared to 1.5% and 0.8% for singletons respectively. Cerebral palsy Several studies have shown that twins are between 4 and 6 times more likely to suffer from cerebral palsy than singletons. 12.6/1000 twins had cerebral palsy, compared with 2.3/1000 singletons. A European multi-centre study reported that cerebral palsy risk was increased by low gestational age and birth weight. Delay in language acquisition: Twins have more problems with language development. Research in Denmark found that 6.4% of IVF twins needed speech therapy compared with 3.2% of IVF singletons. Disability A Japanese study reported that in 7.4% of twin pregnancies at least one child had a disability. I have a friend who was Godmother to triplets born after ivf, it would be no exaggeration to say that the first few years of life for the mother and the triplets was extremely hard and it is for reasons like those outlined that the numbers of embryo's transferred in the UK is now limited. 10k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Yearning for a child in this world is absolutely normal and to be specific, children are a special gift from God. Meanwhile, this remarkable ambition in life is threatened by what is scientifically termed as infertility. Infertility is a two-way matter, meaning that it affects both males and females. For that matter, couples result to Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) with the hope of achieving parenthood. The commonly attained ART treatment is IVF (In Vitro Fertilization), a form of assisted reproduction where the male sperms and the eggs are combined in a petri dish for fertilization. Once fertilization occurs, the embryo/s is cultured for a few days after which it is transferred back to the woman’s uterus with the hope of conception. To increase the chances of conception, fertility experts may transfer a number of embryos, which may result in multiple pregnancies. Multiple pregnancies in IVF simply mean the possibility or the occurrence of having more than one baby which was unintended. Most couples end up with twins, triplets, and even quadruplets after an IVF treatment. How do Multiple Pregnancies Occur? Naturally, a woman releases one egg per month and this egg will be fertilized to attain pregnancy. This results in the birth of one child, and when both ovaries release an egg at the same time, these two eggs will be fertilized which results in twins. This is commonly normal through natural births In IVF, multiple pregnancies occur when the patient asks or the fertility expert decides to transfer more than two embryos into the woman’s uterus. This act is associated with a number of risks and in most cases, women will require specialized care and monitoring at our  IVF centre in India to prevent complications. What are the associated risks; Premature Birth Preeclampsia Low Birth Weight Twin-to-Twin Transfusion 	Syndrome (TTTS) Intrauterine Growth 	Restriction (IUGR) Gestational Diabetes Placental Abruption Cesarean Hectic pregnancy periods Infections Whereas the above-mentioned risks can be approached with a fertility provider’s help, other hardships such basic needs, maternal help, food, clothing, and medical attention will be addressed by the couple itself. Possible Solutions Multiple pregnancies were hardly escaped in the past, but modern technology provides various options to prevent or even control multiple pregnancies; Assisted Laser Hatching This is a technical procedure that requires high expertise. In this, the embryologist will make a gap in the “zona” of an embryo that enables the embryo to hatch out easily once it is transferred into the uterus for implantation.

Also, if women are having fertility problems due to decreasing fertility with age, the more times IVF fails, the older the woman will be. There is only one opportunity for implantation per menstrual cycle! In order to have a high success rate, IVF procedure involves insertion of several embryos into the potential mother- the guidelines for the actual number vary in each country- in the UK, according to wikipedia, 1-3 embryos are transferred. Some factors affecting number of embryos inserted include: number viable embryos available, age of the woman, state of her health. The more embryos transferred, the higher chance of a singleton pregnancy (in the majority of IVF pregnancies), but this results in an increased chance of multiple births (minority of IVF pregnancies). If more than one embryo is transferred, sometimes more than one of these embryos  implants in the uterus and thus one or more embryos may be carried to term, aka multiple birth. This would result in dizygotic (non-identical) twins. Sometimes if only one embryo implants it may split in two, resulting in monozygotic (identical) twins. This is due to IVF technique, which may cause insult to the embryo due to sub-optimal culture conditions which can cause disruption of communication between blastomeres (cells making up the early embryo), resulting in independent formation of two blastocysts. The embryo may be damaged due to intra-cytoplastmic sperm injection or assisted hatching resulting in splitting of the embryo. Maternal age has been reported to increase the likelihood of monozygotic twins, but this is contradicted in some studies. Monozygotic twins are currently not as common as dizygotic twins in IVF though. Potentially, both these mechanisms could occur, resulting in 2 identical and 1 non-identical triplets- triplet pregnancies can be dangerous for mother and embryos/fetuses/babies.

Identical twins are a genetic “accident” so to speak (a really cool one), and there is no way to increase your chances there. From what I understand, several factors can increase the likelihood of having fraternal twins, including: Fertility treatments. Mom’s age -older women have more chances, and also more chances of other flukes, like genetic disorders :( History of twins on the expecting mother’s side -fraternal twins are not genetic, it’s all about two eggs being released at once.

None of these factors were involved for my twin sister and me. We were surprises! Haha. One of us more than the other. It is known that twin births are becoming more common.

Do my chances of having twins increase? Ask New Question   M. T. Owens , Answered Feb 9, 2012 · Author has 343 answers and 1.4m answer views The probability of bearing fraternal twins is thought to be heritable, since it involves how many eggs a woman sheds at a time, which is a trait that is biologically based and might be subject to biological regulation. As you might expect from this hypothesis, some ethnic groups are known to have a higher probability of bearing fraternal twins than others. On the other hand, the probability of bearing identical twins is thought to not be heritable. Identical twins arise from rare, random "twinning" events early in embryological development. Therefore, if you are a woman and a fraternal twin, you *might* have inherited genes from your family that increase your chances of ovulating more than one egg at the same time, which would increase your chances of having twins. However, if you are an identical twin, you probably don't have an increased chance of having twins. 34.1k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

That picture in your head includes one baby, not two or three, right? Thought so. Still, there are factors that can increase your likelihood of conceiving twins or multiples. ‘Identical twins, which make up around a third of twin pregnancies, come from one egg and are basically a fluke of nature – there’s no known common factor in those,’ says David Davies, consultant obstetrician at Portsmouth’s Queen Alexandra Hospital. ‘But with non-identical twins or triplets, which come from different eggs, there are several shared influences.’ From what you eat to the size of your family, get clued up on the likelihood that you’re going to need a bigger buggy. Your family history Yes, that’s your history, not his. In fact, even if your partner has twins in his family, it makes no difference. ‘It’s all about the woman because you’re the one producing the eggs, so if you or your mum are twins, or perhaps your sister has multiple babies, then you’ll be more likely to conceive more than one,’ says David. Your lifestyle Women who have a low-fat diet, especially vegans and vegetarians, are less likely to have multiples than someone who goes for the whole milk and tucks into steak every Friday. ‘The possible causes of this are subtle hormonal changes in people with these different diets, as well as perhaps someone with a higher fat diet having a higher body mass index (BMI) – that’s a measure for checking how healthy your weight is in relation to your height,’ says David. Number of children you have Chances are this is just a case of odds – the more children you’ve had, the more likely at some stage you’ll conceive multiples. The more children you’ve had, the more likely at some stage you’ll conceive multiples You’re simply giving yourself more opportunities to strike lucky. ‘There’s also the possibility that if you’ve always become pregnant easily in the past, you’re basically a good ovulator , so to speak’ says David. Maternal age Naturally conceived twins and triplets are more common in women in their 30s and 40s. ‘This is about the way your ovaries work and how their function changes with age, so you may release more than one egg each month,’ says David. Where you’re from Western Europe sees around one in 60 twin pregnancies, while they’re much more rare in South East Asia. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, twins make up one in every 20 or 30 pregnancies. ‘There are no real theories I’m aware of that would account for this, but interestingly if you’re Nigerian and living in another country, you’re less likely to conceive multiples than if you’re based in Nigeria – so perhaps it’s to do with diet or climate,’ says David. Fertility treatment One of the biggies that can boost your likelihood of having more than one child is having fertility treatment, such as IVF. ‘When IVF started to get really affective in the US during the 1970s and 1980s, twin rates pretty much doubled,’ says David. ‘It’s down to your body being given drugs to stimulate it to ovulate and produce eggs.’ 7.7k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by SunJour Healthcare Corporation UMOOZE is an all-natural dietary supplement for men with BPH.

All natural.  All but one set were intentional, by women who wanted to have the joy of having twins.  All 3 of his brothers also have at least 2 fraternal twins(so far!)   Some men are really more likely to have twins. Most women have multiple follicles maturing at the same time. One becomes dominant and the other dies out. But if the sperm are able to fertilize 2 eggs-before the non-dominant follicle dies out, then the woman may have conceived twins- and 9 months later may become a proud mama of twins. Some men have 30X the "typical" sperms.  Birth Control Pills do not work that well for these men. Their sperm lasts  9 days or so, and enter the uterus, even if the pill is supposed to stop them. The top 1% of the men have sperm quality that is 30X the "typical median" man.  The have more sperms, sperms with better morphology -  and more semen volume- even better Ph levels. My ex-boyfriend and his brothers are very healthy- they are of normal BMI- 32/33 inch waistline, no butter, beef or read meat  - no steroid use to bulk up. Probably explains their advantage over the red meat eating American- some of the American guys cannot even have sex in missionary position- So gross- and so likely to lead to infertility.

What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

It’s advice that couples tend to ignore when talking to their fertility doctor about the number of embryos to transfer during IVF. Because the cost of fertility treatment is high and is usually not covered by insurance, they hedge their bets and gamble that transferring multiple embryos will increase the chances of getting pregnant. And while stricter guidelines for embryo transfer have been successful at reducing higher order multiples (triplets or more), "the next hurdle is how do we reduce the twin rate while maintaining the same pregnancy rate?" says R. Stan Williams, MD, president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART), and professor and chair of the Department of OB-GYN at the University of Florida.  Patients, however, tend to not see the risks of being pregnant with two. Michael A. Feinman, MD, Medical Director of HRC Fertility in Southern California, says some couples strongly want to transfer two embryos or actually desire twins. "Some couples think twins are 'cute,' because they do not see the ones who experience the problems of prematurity or see how difficult it is for parents to handle them.”  The Risks of Multiples  Fertility doctors and patient advocates are working to educate patients about the serious health risks and high costs of having more than one baby at the same time.  “We have to do a better job educating patients about the health risks — they are not getting these messages,” says Barbara Collura, executive director of the infertility patient advocacy group RESOLVE. “They are being told it by their doctor as part of the informed consent process. But reproductive endocrinologists — you can ask any single one of them if they ever get pressure from the patients to transfer more than the required guidelines state, and they will tell you ‘yes, every day.’”  Even though there seem to be twins everywhere these days (between 1980 and 2004, the rate of multiple births increased by 70 percent), the risks to the health and well-being of the mother and babies — and the costs to society — are quite high.  “It has been shown that twin pregnancies cost society billions of dollars each year,” Dr. Feinman says. “These costs are due to increased maternal hospitalizations to prevent prematurity, increased intensive care for the babies from prematurity, and increased rates of lifelong disabilities like cerebral palsy in twins.”  Women who are pregnant with twins are at much higher risk for pregnancy complications, including: Premature birth: About 60 percent of twins are born prematurely at an average of 35 weeks. Low birthweight: More than half of twins are born at less than 5 ½ pounds. Low birthweight babies, especially those born before 32 weeks and/or weighing less than 3 1/3 pounds, are at increased risk of health problems during the newborn period, as well as lasting disabilities such as mental retardation , cerebral palsy , and vision and hearing loss . Cesarean section: Women who carry multiples may be more likely to need Caesarean sections, which may require a longer period of recovery and at times can increase the risk of hemorrhage during and after delivery. Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS): About 10 percent of identical twins who share a placenta develop TTTS, which occurs when a connection between the two babies' blood vessels in the placenta causes one baby to get too much blood flow and the other too little. Pre-eclampsia: Women expecting twins are more than twice as likely to develop pre-eclampsia, which is a combination of high blood pressure, protein in the urine and generalized swelling that can be dangerous for mother and baby. Gestational diabetes: This pregnancy-related form of diabetes can cause the baby to grow especially large, increasing the risk of injuries to mother and baby during vaginal birth. Babies may also have breathing and other problems during the newborn period. Single Pregnancy Is Safer  Being pregnant with one child is safer, with the greatest chances for an optimal outcome.  A recent study published in BMJ (British Medical Journal) found that women who undergo IVF are almost five times more likely to give birth to a single healthy baby following a single embryo transfer (SET) when compared with women who choose to have two embryos transferred. In addition, the SET appeared to significantly increase the chances of carrying the baby to full term (37 weeks).  With medical advances, assisted reproductive technology (ART) has come a long way from the early days of transferring six embryos in the hopes of getting just one to implant. Newer techniques such as blastocyst stage culture and transfer are maximizing pregnancy rates and minimizing the risk of a multiple pregnancy. By growing embryos for five days in the laboratory and enabling them to reach the blastocyst stage of development, fertility doctors can better determine which embryos have the greatest likelihood of implantation.  Research has shown that success rates for single embryo transfer vs. double embryo transfer are similar in certain circumstances. "In a favorable patient who is having a blastocyst (Day 5 embryo) transfer, one blastocyst is an equivalent pregnancy rate to two," Dr. Williams says.  But some couples have difficulty accepting these studies, according to Dr. Feinman. "They intuitively feel that the second embryo must hedge their bet. Also, input from friends and former patients often affects their feelings.”  The most recent 2009 guidelines on embryo transfer from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and SART are very individualized. For example, for a woman under age 35 who is in the favorable category, the recommendation is to transfer one embryo if it is a Day 5 (blastocyst), and one to two embryos if it is a Day 3.  "The big advantage of the American system is we can look at shades of gray," Dr. Williams explains. "Depending on the patient’s age, the prognosis of the patient, and the stage of the embryo development, we can develop guidelines that are more flexible to meet the needs of the patient while trying to reduce the potential for multiples."  Every Fertility Story Is Different  In addition to fertility problems such as blocked tubes, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and her husband’s low sperm count, Petra, a former fertility patient, now 51 and the mom of 5-year-old twins, had experienced a brain abscess and surgery to repair a congenital heart defect in her early 20s. After trying to get pregnant for 15 years, she and her husband tried in vitro fertilization (IVF).  “Once we got into the surgery room the embryologist told us that we had three blastocysts,” she says. “One of them was hatching, which was excellent news. The other one also looked wonderful. However, the last one was fragmented and would not survive the freeze. We had to make the decision to either transfer the last one or discard it. Desperate for a child, we decided to transfer all three.”  With her heart problems, however, Petra could not have endured a triplet pregnancy. “In my eighth week, I had a vanishing triplet, but I always wonder: What if that had not been the case? I would have been faced with some terrible decisions that women who undergo fertility treatments do not want to make. If we had to do it again, I would have ‘discarded’ the third embryo, and I wish I would have been more informed — even fragmented blastocysts can make it."  Dr. Feinman says that when discussing how many embryos to transfer, his fertility clinic usually abides by the ASRM guidelines. However, “personal issues and embryo quality will also affect our advice. For instance, if multi-fetal reduction is not an option, we might transfer one less embryo. Conversely, if embryo quality is poor, we might discuss transferring more than the recommended number. In ideal cases, such as egg donation, single embryo transfer should be strongly considered. Most clinics doing this show very little decrease in pregnancy rates, compared to transferring two embryos. Even a small decrease in success will be balanced by the higher pregnancy loss rates and prematurity associated with twins."  Ultimately, however, the decision-making rests with the fertility patient.  Educating Fertility Patients  The high cost of fertility treatment and the lack of insurance coverage are key reasons why fertility patients tend to turn a deaf ear to the risks involved with having multiples.  According to Petra, she and her husband were advised of the medical risks, but chose to have the three embryos transferred anyway. “I couldn’t wrap my head around having one baby ... especially since I knew I would not have a chance to do another IVF. I probably would have felt different if we had fertility coverage. I know our decision to transfer more than one embryo was, unfortunately, made with our finances in mind and not based on medical facts and studies.”  One of the biggest obstacles in patient care is cost, says Collura. “We also know that patients tend to feel more pressure to transfer more embryos when they have pressures on cost — if somebody does not have insurance, and they only have $15,000, they may say, ‘Look, I only have this one shot. Transfer as many as you can.’”  Dr. Feinman has seen this many times. “Some [patients] think [having twins] is cost-effective if they are paying for their care: ‘Two for the price of one,’” he explains. “Sometimes it is hard to convince them that this is not true, since twins tend to cost much more than a frozen embryo transfer.  “In Canada and much of Europe, the government will only cover IVF if the clinic performs single embryo transfers,” he continues. “In some countries, if a non-identical twin occurs, the clinics have to pay back the government. In the U.S., insurance companies have abdicated their moral right to affect the situation by refusing to cover IVF. Ironically, they spend a lot more money on the multiple births created by IVF than they would if they covered it and helped regulate it. If our government or insurance companies ever wake up and realize this fact, there might be a move toward increased coverage with increased restrictions accompanying this coverage.”  Collura says that patients make better health care decisions when the cost pressure recedes. “There’s a lot of data out there about insurance coverage in mandated states and the reduction of multiple births in those states.”  A new study by Yale School of Medicine researchers and published in Fertility and Sterility has found that the 15 states that provide insurance coverage for infertility saw significantly lower multiple birth rates. In 2005, it was estimated that the economic impact of preterm birth was $26.2 billion nationally.  RESOLVE has worked with Shady Grove Fertility, a Maryland fertility clinic, to produce a patient education video about the risks of multiples. The video is based on a true patient story and a letter the patient wrote to Shady Grove after she had twins born at 25 weeks, specifically asking Shady Grove if they could use her story to help educate others about the risks of premature birth. The video describes how one twin had intestinal surgery and how both spent approximately seven months in a hospital.  “I am hoping that hearing a person’s story about her own experience and providing some data is going to be effective,” Collura says. “Our idea is for this to be available to any fertility clinic, anywhere in the United States. "Whatever I can do to help that patient know more and be better educated, I'm going to do that."  SART developed a national consent form for fertility clinics to use that gives very detailed risks for pregnancy with multiples.  In addition, ASRM is in the early stages of developing a video about the risks of multiples, according to Dr. Williams. "We are very interested in reducing multiple pregnancies."

Photo: EPA              By Rebecca Smith , Medical Editor   7:15AM GMT 09 Feb 2012   Follow        The fertility clinic regulator has set a new target in an attempt to reduce the number of multiple pregnancies, which is the single biggest risk associated with IVF treatment.        Embryonic stem cell extraction: The study will mark a new chapter in the contentious history of embryonic stem cell research in the United States       The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has lowered the target to 10 per cent from the current 15 per cent for each clinic. The new target will come into effect in October and fertility clinics will have to carefully judge which couples should be counselled to have only one embryo transferred to the womb at a time to minimise the chances of a multiple pregnancy. Currently, across the whole country the multiple pregnancy rate following IVF treatment is around 20 per cent. It will be up to the clinic to judge which couples are suited to single embryo transfer and older women or those with complex problems still be allowed to have two embryos transferred so their chances of having a child are not affected.

Multiple pregnancies are more likely to lead to birth defects, premature birth and low birthweight which put the babies at greater risk of disability and death and the mother is more likely to suffer complications also. Rachel Cutting, Chairman of Association of Clinical Embryologists said: “We are very pleased that the HFEA has lowered its multiple birth target to 10 per cent. "Just three years ago, there was a one in four chance of having twins following IVF, but we have reduced this figure by developing improved ways to select the best quality embryo a patient has. "This in turn allows us to replace just one embryo per IVF cycle without affecting a woman’s chance of falling pregnant. By continuing to understand more about embryo development and using new technologies we can maintain these excellent success rates. “Ultimately, ensuring the health of both the mother and her baby is our top priority. And as multiple births pose greater health risks, we believe it is essential that we continue to find ways to reduce the chances of having twins, which is why we are so committed to the use of single embryo transfer.”               Health News       News »    Rebecca Smith »           In Health News            Weird X-rays              Life begins at 70              Living proof: the secret of healthy ageing              Why olive oil should be kept out of the frying pan              Ebola outbreak in pictures                        Top news galleries       Woody Allen's 30 best one-liners          Comedy    Martin Chilton selects 30 great one-liners from the comedian and film

Undo Answer Wiki 7 Answers   Leah Hawkins Bressler , Reproductive epidemiology researcher, ObGyn Sub-intern Answered Jul 29, 2012 There are two kinds of twinning that can result from IVF: (1) dizygotic (fraternal, two babies from two eggs) (2) monozygotic (identical, two babies from one egg). The risk of dizygotic twinning and higher order multiple gestations depends on the number of embryos transferred during the IVF cycle. The current Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) national summary shows: (1) -When one embryo is transferred, 98.1% of births are singletons 1.9% are twins <0.01% are higher order multiple gestations (HOMG = 3 or more) -When two embryos transferred: 65.2% of births are singletons 33.9% twins 0.8% HOMG -When three+ embryos transferred: 68.3-73.2% of births are singletons 24.1-27.7% twins 2.5-3.9% HOMG [Figure from CDC, ASRM 2009. ART Success Rates Report. US Dept HHS (1)] Thus, the risk of multiples increases with number of embryos transferred. However, the likelihood of live birth also increases up to a point (24.5% of IVF cycles result in live birth after one embryo transferred, 44% result in LB after 2 ET and 23.1-33.2% result in LB after 3+ embryos transferred) (1). To maximize chance of success (single live birth) and minimize risk of adverse outcomes, including multiple gestations, ASRM/SART regularly release embryo transfer guidelines to guide practice (2-3). [Figure from ASRM Practice Committee. Fert Steril . 2009;92:1518-1519] Yet, even when one embryo is transferred women can experience monozygotic twinning (MZT), as was Janice's experience. In natural conception, the rate of MZT is about 0.4% (4). In ART (including IVF), the rate of MZT is 2-12 times higher, ranging from 0.8-4.8% (4-5).  This increased rate of MZT is not entirely understood but has been attributed to culturing of embryos and to a technique known as Assisted Hatching (5). Assisted Hatching (AH) is when a defect is created in the shell of the fertilized egg (the Zona Pellucida) to facilitate implantation. The proposed mechanism for an increased risk of MZT is that when the embryo squeezes out of the egg, it assumes an hourglass shape that makes it vulnerable to halving in two (dividing one embryo into two identical embryos). In summary, even in cases of single embryo transfer, IVF confers at least a slight increase in risk of multiples as compared to natural conception. *Though the question doesn’t ask for comparisons to other ART techniques, it should be noted that when ART/SART guidelines for ET are followed, IVF offers lower risk of multiples than ovulation induction via Clomid or gonadotropins (6).

Why do some women fantasize about having twin babies? Do multiple rounds of IVF increase the risk of cancer? Can I have twins or triplets through IVF? Will IVF increase the chances of one having twins/triplets? How many babies can a woman have? Ask New Question Quora User , Waiting Adoptive Parent Updated Jun 26, 2012 · Author has 535 answers and 761.5k answer views When a woman does IVF she and her doctor have the choice of how many embryos to transfer into the uterus during one cycle. So the answer to this question is completely in control of the woman doing the IVF.   If she chooses to  transfer only one embryo, their chances of a multiple birth pregnancy are the same as a natural pregnancy.  But the success rate of achieving pregnancy at all with only one embryo is lower than if you have implanted multiple which is why some women opt to implant more than one at a time. The doctors I have seen have recommended 2-3 embryos to be  transferred during one month.  The risks of multiple birth pregnancies they have quoted me given an aggregate 2.5 embryos transferred is a 25% likelihood of twins and a .4% likelihood of triplets.  This is a significant difference seeing as how the percentage of twin births in the general population is 3% and 1/10th of 1% for triplets and above. transferring 2 or fewer embryos drastically reduces the possibility of a high-order multiple pregnancy (triplets or above). Reputable clinics would not allow a woman to transfer much more than 3 embryos at a time unless she was having extreme difficulty achieving a pregnancy or the embryo quality were poor.  That is why my mind boggles at stories like the octomom - I have to think, why did her clinic allow her to do that? (Edit:  The Octomom's fertility doctor is having his licence revoked for implanting 12 embryos into her. "The Beverly Hills fertility doctor has acknowledged implanting 12 embryos into Suleman, then 33, prior to the pregnancy that produced her octuplets. It was six times the norm for a woman her age." http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4324...

We transferred one embryo (as rec by our San Fran clinic) and now have identical twins. The quality of this embryo was BETTER than it would have been naturally as the very best one was chosen from the batch. It was not naturally self selecting. The age of the egg is the major contributing factor. If the age of the egg is very young think hard about transferring multiple embryos. Look at complications with even twin pregnancies and cases where selective reduction is recommended. You need to go into a multiple embryo transfer knowing the risks. 4.5k Views · View Upvoters   Pratiksha Goyal , Working with Hospitals Answered Feb 23, 2018 · Author has 173 answers and 30.8k answer views In IVF procedure its yours and the doctors decision to determine that how many embryos will be transferred in the uterus. It is possible to have a single embryo transferred this will decrease the chances of getting a twin or triple but at the same time it will decrease the chances of getting pregnant also. Also there is no guarantee your embryo will be successful. The women who are unable to afford two or more cycles opt to have more than one embryo transferred at a time. The chances of birth from multiple embryo is high as compared with a single embryo transfer. With all this age, physical health of the couples plays a very important part in the success of IVF cycles. If you are willing to get IVF treatment and are worried about multiple chance of birth than you need to be careful to the IVF success rate of the clinic which you are going to opt for.

I just like to add couple points to it. Long story short, the odds of having twins is directly correlated with the avg. number of transferred embryos. While pregnancy with twins and triples sounds like great news, it’s actually very risky as it increases chance of premature births, developmental scars such cerebral palsy and serious risks to the health of a mother. Therefore, we advise patients to select only clinics which transfer less then 3–4 embryos for any age groups less then 40 years old.

That's how Miranda and Josh Crawford now describe a typical day after their two sets of identical twins -- quadruplets in all -- joined their two-year-old sister in February. After trying to get pregnant for more than a year, Miranda, 34, and Josh, 28, of Charlotte, N.C., turned to artificial insemination, and then in vitro fertilization, to have their first daughter. Doctors transferred two embryos into Miranda's uterus, and one survived. On March 17, 2009, Miranda gave birth to Baby Joslyn. But Miranda, 34, and Josh, 28, both registered nurses, hoped to eventually expand their family over time to three or four children. A year later, the couple sought out in vitro fertilization for a second time. Again, doctors transferred two embryos into Miranda's uterus, and, just six weeks into the pregnancy, doctors told the couple that they would be having twins. But the ultrasound was fuzzy, and both the doctor and Miranda wanted to confirm how many babies were growing in her belly. She returned to the hospital four days later. This time, the ultrasound was clear -- there were four hearts beating on the screen, not two. "I was shocked, the doctor was shocked," Miranda said. "Never had that happened in his entire career." Typically one or two embryos are inserted into a woman's uterus during one round of IVF. Even then, the patient has about a 60 percent chance of getting pregnant at all. But both embryos had split in Miranda's uterus to create two sets of identical twins. "For a woman who is less than 35 years old, it is recommended that one or two embryos be transferred into the uterus during a fresh IVF cycle," said Dr. Jani Jensen, a physician in the department of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Mayo Clinic. "In this case, it appears that the guidelines were correctly followed, but that lightning struck twice." After shock, Miranda said fear stepped in. The couple was aware of the risk and complications that come with multiple births.  A Risky Pregnancy  "The whole pregnancy was scary," Miranda said. "I wasn't sure if I was going to have a miscarriage, and I was always thinking that I could go into preterm labor at any moment." "We took it day by day," said Josh.  Rare Situation Surprises IVF Experts  "This is certainly an unusual outcome," Jensen said. "I've never seen it happen quite like this." Jensen said she has rarely seen embryos split, but doctors estimate that it can happen in a little more than 1 percent of IVF cycles, and slightly more if the embryos are transferred as blastocysts, or embryos that have developed longer outside the body. "The math here is mind-boggling: the patient likely only had about a 60 percent chance of getting pregnant at all, and with that, we expect that at least half of the time when two embryos are placed in the uterus, only one will continue to develop, so even twins are more of the exception, not the rule," Jensen said. "To have both embryos implant and both undergo the rare phenomenon of splitting is extremely unusual," Jensen continued. "There are a few reports of this happening worldwide, but overall, it's a rarity." Only 2 percent of all pregnancies result in one set of identical twins. Dr. James Grifo, director of the NYU Fertility Center, broke down the math. "Embryo splitting occurs approximately in one out of 100 embryo transfers," Grifo said. "The chance of this outcome is approximately one in 10,000. This could also occur in a natural conception, but the chance of that is much [rarer]. "We have done around 20,000 IVF cycles and have fortunately not seen this outcome," he said. "It represents a very risky obstetrical situation, but it sounds like they were fortunate and had a good outcome." "This is so rare, it is almost a record," said Dr. Michelle Warren, medical director for the Center for Menopause, Hormonal Disorders and Women's Health in New York. "However there is a view that only one embryo should be implanted at a time, particularly in patients with proven success. The issue is cost and if IVF wasn't so expensive, this would undoubtedly be standard of care."  One, No More Than Two Embryos  Warren said many European countries do not allow more than one embryo at a time because of the high risk and cost of multiple pregnancies, along with health problems with the babies. Identical twins following IVF tend to share a placenta and one of the pregnancy membranes, which makes the twin pregnancy riskier in terms of harsh growth conditions and death in the womb for one of the twins. The risk of preterm labor and delivery is very high with any sort of multiple births. Babies born premature are at an increased risk for many health complications, including learning disabilities, lung problems, cerebral palsy, blindness and deafness. Because the pregnancy was so high-risk, doctors gave the Crawfords several options, including reduction, where one or some of the fetuses are aborted for the safety of the mother and the other growing babies. The Crawfords said they never considered reduction.  Overall Healthy Pregnancy  Miranda developed gestational diabetes during the pregnancy, which she managed by controlling and restricting her diet. "My sugars were very low, but it only lasted a little while," she said. "It worked itself out before the babies came." She was also hospitalized twice in December when doctors feared she might go into preterm labor. But for the circumstance, the couple said the pregnancy went very well, considering the risk. Doctors put Miranda on strict bed rest in December. By the time she was ready to give birth, she had gained 60 pounds and her midsection measured in at five feet around. "Even at 20 weeks, I looked like I was nine months pregnant," said Miranda. "I was huge."  Babies, Babies, Babies  Mia, Madison, Jackson and James were born on Feb. 4, 2010, 34 weeks into Miranda's pregnancy. "They were all healthy, between four and a half and five and one-half pounds," Josh said. The babies spent three weeks in the neonatal ICU so doctors could monitor their feeding toleration. By Feb. 28, the brood arrived at home, expanding the family of three to seven.  Five Babies: Teamwork  Miranda and Josh said that it's all about the teamwork when caring for the babies, and keeping the infants on the same eat-sleep rotation is key. "They've gained the weight they've needed to gain, and now they can sleep as long as they want at night," Miranda said. Usually, the babies are up every three to four hours. After their morning feeding, Miranda said she bathes them, gets them dressed, gives a second feeding, changes them for the afternoon and puts them in their sleepers at night. Miranda breastfeeds two at a time while Josh bottle-feeds the other two babies. After having eight weeks off from work to care for the babies, Josh is back to work for the first time this week. "I might not get a bath or get dressed, but the babies do," Miranda said. "This case shows that nature is always ready to show doctors that we can't control everything," said Dr. Richard Paulson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine. "As much as we try to avoid high-order multiple gestations by replacing fewer and fewer embryos, every once in a while, nature reminds us that we are not in charge."        0 Shares               Email      Star      Comments     Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

According to conventional wisdom, twins not only run in families, but they also — for some strange reason — always skip at least one generation. It is a claim that is widely repeated, but only partly true.  Photo         Credit Leif Parsons    Scientists have known for some time that there is a gene that can predispose women to hyperovulation, or releasing two or more eggs in a single menstrual cycle. When both eggs are fertilized, the resulting siblings are fraternal twins.  Because this gene can be passed on, the tendency to have fraternal twins can in fact run in families. Identical twins, on the other hand, result from one fertilized egg randomly splitting in two, creating two siblings with identical DNA. Because there is no known gene that influences this process, it is considered a mere coincidence when one extended family has multiple sets of identical twins. The notion that twins always skip a generation is also a myth. The illusion may have arisen because men who inherit the gene from their mothers are unaffected by it ( they do not ovulate), but can still pass it on to their daughters, who, in turn, will have an increased likelihood of conceiving twins. THE BOTTOM LINE Twins can run in families, but do not necessarily bypass generations.   scitimes@nytimes.com  A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F5 of the New York edition with the headline: Twins always skip a generation.

Home  Shop  Basket  Twins Tips          Resources Centre / Twins Tips Introduction / Twins Tips / What are the chances of having Twins.Triplets or Quads ?        You may be wondering what are the chances of conceiving twins. triplets or more and can you increase the odds ?   The odds of having multiples are influenced by many factors. and twinning rates have changed throughout the years due to some of those factors. It's interesting to analyze the statistics and to consider you odds for winning the multiples lottery. So. are you a candidate for twins. triplets. quads or even quints ?   General Statistics About Multiples  Among the UK population. the chances of having twins in the 21st century are about 1.5 in 100. or about 1.5%. Your chances are better than ever; researchers have recorded an increase of nearly 50% since the early 1980s. The most recent statistics in 2004 show that twins. triplets and quads represented 14.87 of every 1.000 births or 1 in 67 pregnancies was a multiple birth (or 1 in every 34 children is a twin/triplet).   Increase or Decrease Your Chances of Having Twins/Multiples   You'll increase your odds of having twins/multiples if....   Maternal Age : You (the mother) are over age 35. The chances of having twins increases with age; in the 2004 UK statistics. the twinning rate of mothers over the age of 35 is 21.7 per 1000 maternities and becoming a mother after age 45 boosts your odds considerably to 56.7 per 1000 !   Assisted Conception : You take fertility drugs or undergo other fertility treatments. No one can deny that the availability of fertility enhancements has increased the multiple birth rate and on average the chances of having a multiple birth after fertility enhancing treatment is around 25% although you need to account for the fact that some fertility treatments have odds of only 20% chance of becoming pregnant.   Maternal History : You. your mother. or her mother's mother is a fraternal twin. These women may carry a gene for hyperovulation. which means they release more than one egg during an ovulation cycle. increasing their ability to conceive fraternal twins. The chances may increase if the mother is a fraternal twin herself.   Previous Pregancies : You've already had one set of fraternal twins. For mothers who have already had one set of fraternal twins. their chances of conceiving another set are five times greater than the average woman. or about 1 in 14 ! Women who have had more than four previous pregnancies are also more likely to conceive twins.   Race : You're Nigerian. This African country purportedly has the highest twinning rate in the world. estimated at around 1 in 20. Some sources attribute it to their consumption of large quantities of yams. (It's worth a try if you really want to have multiples!)   You're overweight or tall. A recent 2005 study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported a significant increase in fraternal twin births to mothers who had a BMI of 30 or higher. or who were in the top 25th percentile for height.   You'll decrease your odds of having twins/multiples if...   Race : You (the mother) are Asian. Among worldwide populations. the Asian countries of Japan and China have the lowest twinning rates. estimated at 1 in 150 and 1 in 300. respectively.   Age : You (the mother) are under age 25. The chance that a woman would bear twins before her 25th birthday are is less than half of what it would be after age 35. The Uk 2004 statistics showed the twinning rate to be only 6.3 per 1000 for the under 20s compared to the average of 14.87 for the total population.   Zygosity : You're looking for identical multiples. The rate for identical. or monozygotic. multiples is random and universal; it's the same in all populations regardless of race. heredity or other factors. and it has remained constant over time. The chances of having identical twins is about 1 in 285.   Odds of Triplets. Quadruplets &; Higher Order Multiples  The statistics for higher order multiples in the UK have shown a dramatic decrease in recent years. The odds of conceiving triplets is about 1 in 4.400. In the UK. there has been a substantial decrease in the rate of triplet births over the last few years. (Triplet births peaked in 1998 with 297 sets born in the UK). primarily due to the HFEA regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be transplanted since 2001.   The odds of having quads is currently 1 in 142.000 (latest statistics show there& ;were 5 sets born in the UK in 2004) but for spontaneous quadruplets (non-assisted) the chances are predicted to be 1 in 729.000.   There have been no sets of quintuplets born in the UK since 2002 where there were 2 sets born and the last set of sextuplets that was born was in 1993.   It is estimated that 60% of triplets are the result of fertility enhancing treatments; while 90% of quadruplets are due to reproductive technology.

Published on March 14, 2017 by SCRC Contributor   Share this on social media:                         From the moment Beyonce Knowles announced that she and her husband were expecting twins, the media began speculating whether her multiple pregnancy may be the result of IVF. The couple has never commented on whether they sought assistance from fertility experts when they decided to grow their family, and their privacy is to be respected. Beyond the realm of celebrity gossip, however, the rumours have created an opportunity to discuss common misunderstandings about IVF and multiple births.   Does IVF cause twins?  The short answer to this question is no. The process of IVF , in and of itself, does not necessarily lead to a substantially higher risk of multiple pregnancy. In practice, the answer is slightly more nuanced. Statistically, women who undergo IVF have multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, or higher-order multiples) at a higher rate than women who conceived naturally: According to statistics published in 2013, around 40% of all IVF pregnancies in the US resulted in multiple births. That is a concerning percentage, especially when compared to the natural occurrence rate of 2% in the general population.  The main reason for this is the practice of transferring more than one embryo at a time in an IVF cycle. Until recently, most fertility doctors routinely transferred multiple embryos in the hope of achieving a better chance of success. The reason for this is that many embryos have chromosomal abnormalities which mean they are not actually viable. This is true whether the embryos are conceived naturally or through IVF. Because egg quality tends to decline over the years, the proportion of abnormal embryos generally goes up as a woman ages. Placing two or more embryos into the uterus at a time was thought to increase pregnancy rates, with the hope that at least one would survive. Quite often, more than one embryo will successfully implant, resulting in a multiple pregnancy.  What are the risks of multiple pregnancy and birth?  Twins or triplets are often a cause for joy, especially if you have waited a long time for a baby. The dream of "two for the price of one" may be extremely attractive as you face the physical, emotional, and financial investment of undergoing IVF. The reality, however, is that a multiple pregnancy carries considerably higher risks for both mother and babies. Pregnancy complications occur at a significantly higher rate in multiple pregnancies, including:   Preeclampsia  Gestational diabetes  Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)  Placental abruption  Fetal demise/loss   The birth itself can also present dangers such as:   Higher rates of Cesarean birth  Preterm labor/deliver  Low birth weights   The long-term health complications for preemies and low birthweight babies can be serious, and in some cases, life-altering. Most multiple pregnancies can be safely managed with close monitoring by your medical team, but doctors take these additional health risks seriously, and generally prefer to do what they can to make it less likely that an IVF cycle will result in a multiple pregnancy.  How can I minimize my risk of having twins?  Most leading fertility experts now consider elective single embryo transfer (eSET) to be best practice for most IVF cycles. You may have produced a large number of eggs during the ovarian stimulation process, and may have a number of viable embryos available, and your doctor may still suggest that you transfer only one (freezing the rest for any future IVF cycles.) There are several reasons for this:   Technology has made it easier to select a high quality embryo for transfer.   New developments in embryology have made it possible for experts to identify which embryos have the highest likelihood of success. This is reassuring to many patients. The ability to choose a high quality embryo takes away a little of the emotional pressure you may feel at the thought of transferring "only one."   Genetic testing.   Sophisticated genetic tests such as preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) mean that the lab can pinpoint the type of genetic abnormalities that often cause miscarriage. These tests are quite safe and can be performed with minimal risk to the embryo. PGS screens for aneuploidies, which are missing or translocated ("scrambled") chromosomes. PGD allows embryologists to get a complete picture of an embryo's chromosomal makeup, and is often used to ensure that the embryos are free of specific serious genetic conditions such as Tay Sachs Disease or cystic fibrosis.   Time lapse-photography   The Embryoscope is a cutting-edge incubator which makes it much easier for the lab to choose the healthiest available embryo for transfer. It does this in a few ways. First, a time-lapse camera takes photographs of the culturing embryos every five minutes, combining them together into mini movies for the expert to watch. This allows the lab to monitor the growth and development of the embryos without ever removing them from the ideal environment of the incubator. This cuts down on any potential exposure to harmful substances in the air or changes of light and temperature which could be a risk to a developing embryo.  The other benefit of this close monitoring is the ability to compare an embryo's rate of development to an enormous database. Machine-learning algorithms are combing through the data, and can point out the timing of crucial moments in development (such as cell splitting) which correlate to a positive or negative outcome. This is another way for the lab to discover which embryos have the best chance of resulting in a healthy pregnancy.   Blastocyst transfer.   Standard IVF practice has been to transfer embryos after about 3 days culture in the lab, but increasingly doctors and patients are opting for blastocyst transfer instead. A blastocyst is an embryo which has been incubated in the lab to the "blastocyst stage" which occurs 5 to 6 days after fertilization. Advances in lab technology, such as better culture mediums, have now made it possible to keep embryos healthy in the lab for that long. This has some unique benefits which are likely to contribute to a higher success rate.   The extra time allows the lab to identify the unhealthy embryos which are unable to reach the blastocyst stage, making it less likely that an unhealthy embryo will be implanted.  In natural conception, a 3 day old embryo would still be in the environment of the fallopian tube, not the uterus. Waiting until it is 5 to 6 days old allows the transfer to be performed in "perfect timing," as this is the stage at which the embryo is ready to implant in the lining of the uterus.    Transferring one embryo is as likely to result in pregnancy as a multiple transfer.   A recent study took a look at whether the number of embryos transferred in an IVF cycle had an effect on the live birth rate. Their analysis showed  "little to no effect on clinic-level live birth rates with increasing rates of eSET." The percentage of multiple births dropped with eSET, but the percentage of live births did not.   IVF may actually have a higher chance of success with just one embryo.   Another study discovered that transferring two embryos can reduce a patient's chance of pregnancy by almost a quarter, if one of the embryos was of lower quality. This is a particularly important point. Before transfer, all the available 3 day embryos which resulted from the IVF cycle are graded according to quality, ranging from 1 (the best, with all cells of equal size and no sign of fragmentation) down to 5 (the least promising grade, where cells may be uneven in size and there may be moderate to heavy fragmentation.) Generally, the higher an embryo's grade, the better its chances of implantation. When doctors transfer multiple embryos, they generally select the highest-quality available, but this may mean a variety of grades. What the study found was that instead of increasing the likelihood of pregnancy, the poorer-quality embryo may actually compromise the pregnancy. The results of the study revealed that when compared to eSET, a two embryo transfer with one good quality embryo and one poor quality embryo resulted in a 27% lower pregnancy rate. The researchers suspect that the poor quality embryo may cause the body to reject the pregnancy at the expense of the healthy embryo.   Every IVF cycle is unique, and there is no one answer that is right for everyone. You and your doctor will be able to assess the risks and weigh the benefits of eSET vs multiple transfer in your case. There are some cases where fertility doctors may still choose to transfer more than one embryo,often in cases where a patient is older and has had multiple failed attempts. If that does result in a multiple pregnancy, a good Los Angeles fertility clinic can keep a close eye on you during your early weeks and help you transfer your care to an obstetrician with experience handling higher-risk care such as multiples. No matter what, the end goal is always a healthy mother and a healthy baby (or two) at the end of your pregnancy.

One of the first questions we’re asked by couples looking into in vitro fertilization (IVF) is, “Won’t IVF increase our chances of having twins or triplets?” The answer to this is, “that all depends.” According to The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology :  Multiple births are much more common today than they were in the past. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, the twin birth rate has increased by over 75% since 1980, and triplet, quadruplet, and high-order multiple births have increased at an even higher rate. There are more multiple births today in part because more women are receiving infertility treatment…  With IVF, you and your doctor determine how many embryos will be transferred into your uterus . If you choose to have a single embryo transferred, then it would be rare for you to have twins or triplets. There is the possibility that the embryo could split resulting in twins. However, there is no guarantee your embryo will successfully implant into the uterine lining the first time around. This is why many women, especially those who are unable to afford two or more cycles, often opt to have more than one embryo transferred. Interestingly, the chances of a live birth from multiple embryo transfers increase only slightly compared with a single embryo transfer, although your chances of a multiple birth increase significantly. Age, physical health and embryo viability play a large part in the success of IVF cycles.  Multiple Births Are Higher Risk for Both Mothers and Babies  There are several reasons why pregnancies involving multiples post a higher risk for mothers and babies. It is harder on a female’s body to carry more than one baby so women who are pregnant with twins, triplets or higher numbers of multiples are at greater risk for preeclampsia, placental issues and diabetes. Also, multiple babies are rarely born full-term, which means your baby is at higher risk for the health complications associated with premature birth.  Consider the following statistics regarding multiple births and their average gestation (full-term singleton babies are typically born between 37 – 42 weeks and weigh 7.3 lbs).   Twins: 35 weeks              1 lbs  Triplets: 32 weeks              7 lbs.  Quadruplets: 30 weeks              9 lbs.   Premature babies are 50% more likely to experience respiratory distress. Additional complications like brain damage, cerebral palsy, and other disabilities are more likely for babies who are part of a set of twins, triplets or quadruplets. While we don’t share this information to scare you, it is important that you realize the risks involved when you opt to transfer multiple embryos.  To prevent parents from feeling pressure to implant multiple embryos in an attempt to have a live birth from their first IVF cycle, the March of Dimes Foundation has recently published an encouraging article in the Fertility and Sterility. The article advocates for systemic changes across the board, from the political and medical arenas on down to insurance funding and financing options for infertile couples so they feel less pressured to attempt multiple transfers.  If you are interested in IVF treatments and are worried about the chance of multiples, pay careful attention to the IVF success rates and statistics of the clinics you are considering. Also, remember that you are the one in control . You should never feel pressured to transfer more than one embryo is that isn’t what you want.

Maya  says:   August 30, 2016 at 8:15 pm   “If you choose to have a single embryo transferred, then it would be impossible for you to have twins or triplets. ”  Uh…no.  You can still have identical twins if the embryo splits or in a super rare instance identical triplets.  Unlikely? Yes.  Impossible? No.    Reply         Eva  says:   September 28, 2016 at 4:05 pm   @ maya, I was thinking the same thing lol    Reply         LUKE "THE TEST TUBE BABY" O'MALLEY  says:   November 4, 2016 at 1:16 pm   I AM AN IVF BABY LOLLLLLLL BUT NO TWIN SO DW GUYS THERES STILL A CHANCE YOU WON’T HAVE A TWIN    Reply         Famatta boimah  says:   March 1, 2017 at 5:46 pm   I will like to meet with the doctor for more question thanks.

What boosts your odds of having twins? Fertility treatments like Clomid , Gonal-F, and Follistim make it more likely you'll conceive multiples, but also, your height, age, and even family history can increase your odds of birthing more than one. Causes of Twins Without Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments are not the only reason for twins. Other factors that increase your chances of getting pregnant with multiples include...         Age Women over 30 are more likely to conceive twins. This is because the hormone FSH rises as a woman gets older. FSH, or follicle stimulating hormone, is responsible for the development of eggs in the ovaries before they are released. Higher levels of FSH are needed as a woman ages because the eggs require more stimulation to grow than in a younger woman. This is somewhat ironic, given that increased FSH is also due to lowering fertility. But sometimes, the follicles overreact to the higher FSH levels , and two or more eggs are released, resulting in a twin pregnancy. Family History A family history of identical twins does not make it more likely you'll have multiples. However, if you have fraternal twins (non-identical) in your family, your chances of conceiving twins rise. If there are fraternal twins on both the mother and father's side, your odds for twins goes up even higher. A history of twins on the female side of the family indicates a higher likelihood of ovulating more than one egg per cycle, and a history of fraternal twins on the male side indicates a higher likelihood of the man producing enough sperm to fertilize more than one egg.   Weight Women who are obese—with a BMI over 30—are more likely to conceive twins than women with a healthier BMI. This is an ironic situation since overweight women are also more likely to have difficulty conceiving . Extra fat leads to increased levels of of estrogen. The higher levels of estrogen can lead to over stimulation of the ovaries.         Instead of releasing just one egg at ovulation , the ovaries may release two or more. Height Women who are taller than average are more likely to have twins. One study found that women averaging 164.8 cm in height (about 5' 4.8") were more likely to conceive twins than women averaging 161.8 cm (about 5' 3.7"). Why this happens isn't clear, but one theory is that better nutrition (which may lead to more height) is partially behind the increased rate of twins. Number of Children Twins are more common in women who have carried many pregnancies and have large families. Race African-Americans are more likely to conceive twins than Caucasian women. Asian women are the least likely to conceive twins. Breastfeeding Women who conceive while breastfeeding are more likely to conceive twins than women who are not. It's true that breastfeeding can also suppress fertility and prevent pregnancy, specifically during a baby's first six months if the baby is exclusively breastfed. However, it is possible to get pregnant when breastfeeding—and with twins! One study found the rate of twins to be 11.4 percent among breastfeeding women, as compared to just 1.1 percent in non-breastfeeding women. Diet While research is still ongoing, some studies have found that women who eat a lot of dairy products are more likely to conceive twins.         One theory is that the growth hormones given to cows affect the hormone levels in humans. Chances of Having Twins With Fertility Treatments Fertility treatments that boost ovulation can lead to twins, triplets, or higher order multiples. Conceiving multiples is a possible risk of fertility treatments , one that can be decreased with careful monitoring, single embryo transfer (for IVF treatment), and the lowest possible effective dosage (when treating with gonadotropins.) You may wonder why conceiving multiples is considered a "risk" and not a possible benefit to fertility treatments. After all, especially if you've been struggling to get pregnant, wouldn't a double or triple blessing be a good thing?  The fact of the matter is that multiple pregnancies come with risks to the mother and babies. Your doctor's goal is for you to conceive and give birth to one healthy baby at a time. Not all treatments for infertility increase your odds of twins, but most do. Fertility drugs and treatments that may lead to twins include... Clomid Femera Gonadotropins (also known as injectables) like Gonal-F and Follistim IUI treatment , when used along with fertility drugs IVF treatment Clomid and Femera have the lowest rate of twins, ranging from 5 to 12 percent. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples is under 1 percent. Gonadotropins, whether used with or without IUI treatment, have the highest rate of twins. According to some studies, up to 30 percent of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins lead to multiples. Most of these pregnancies are twin pregnancies, but up to 5 percent are triplet or higher order pregnancies. Contrary to popular belief, IVF treatment is not the main source of triplet and higher order pregnancies. Data collected by the CDC indicates that the rate of IVF-conceived triplets in 2014 was 1.5 pregnancies (but only 0.9 percent of live births, lower due to pregnancy loss.) IVF twins are relatively common, with the twin rate highest for women younger than 35, at 12.1 percent per transfer in 2014. The IVF twin rate is lower for women over age 35—9.1 percent for women aged 35 to 37 and 5.3 for women ages 38 to 40—likely due to the overall decreased success rate as a woman ages. How Common Are Twin Pregnancies? According to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control , there were 133,155 twins born in the United States in 2015. That's 33.5 per 1,000 live births, or put another way, about 3.35 percent of live births. There were 3,871 triplet births, 228 quadruplet births, and 24 quintuplet or higher order births. These numbers include naturally occurring multiples, along with those conceived with fertility treatment . The rate of multiple births increased and peaked during the 1990s, but has been declining over the past decade. The percentage of triplet and higher order pregnancies has dropped 36 percent since 2004. Chances of Having Identical Twins In the general population, identical twin pregnancies occur 0.45 percent of the time, or 1 in 250 births. While most multiple pregnancies conceived with fertility treatments are fraternal twins, the use of fertility treatment does increase your risk of having identical twins. According to one study, identical twins made up 0.95 percent of the pregnancies conceived with treatment. That's double the general population's risk. It's unclear why fertility treatment leads to more identical twins. One theory is that the culture embryos are placed in during IVF increases the risk of identical twinning. Another theory is that treatments using gonadotropins lead to the increased risk of identical twins. A Word From Verywell Your chances of having twins will depend not just on your use of fertility drugs, but also your family history, race, age, and many other factors. These factors do work together. In other words, a tall woman with a family history of fraternal twins is more likely to conceive twins during fertility treatments than a short woman without any family history of twins. Your chances of conceiving twins will also be affected by your particular cause of infertility. A young woman with healthier eggs is more likely to conceive twins than a woman over 40, whose egg quality is poor. The twin and multiple rates also vary from fertility clinic to clinic. Twin rates differ based on how carefully they track ovulation stimulation during fertility drug use and how many embryos they transfer during IVF. While having twins may sound like the kind of two-for-one deal any couple would love to have after infertility, it really is best to aim for one healthy baby. Your doctor can reduce the odds of multiples with careful monitoring and single-embryo transfer during IVF. However, if you do conceive twins or more, know that good prenatal care can reduce your risk of complications. There are also many positive benefits to having twins .

So if you're taking Clomid (clomiphene) you may be nervous (or excited) about the prospect of having two or more babies at once. However, those newsworthy high-order multiple stories are more likely with injectable fertility drugs that are used during intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments.         For every 20 pregnancies conceived with Clomid, which is a pill taken by mouth to induce ovulation, the drug causes twin pregnancies between 5 and 8 percent of the time. That's fewer than one in 10 pregnancies or approximately one in 20 pregnancies. Your odds of conceiving triplets (or more) on Clomid is less than one percent. That's less than one in 100 pregnancies. Why Clomid May Increase the Chance of Multiples A woman's ovaries contain hundreds of thousands of follicles each containing immature egg cells . Once every month, several follicles begin a process of development. Usually, only one follicle fully develops and releases an egg. This is because once a follicle becomes mature enough on its own, the follicle releases hormones into the bloodstream that signal the body to slow down production of egg-stimulating hormones. Clomid works by tricking the body into bumping up egg-stimulating hormones, causing the follicles in the ovaries to continue to mature, increasing the likelihood that more than one egg will develop to maturity and be released during ovulation.   Most twins conceived with Clomid will not be identical. During clinical trials of twin pregnancies, one in five were identical twins, while 80 percent of the twin pregnancies were fraternal twins (not identical). Why aren't they identical? Clomid increases your odds of conceiving twins because your ovaries may ovulate more than one eggs: Identical twins come from one egg, not two.         Other Factors That Up the Odds Having Twins Fertility drugs aren't the only cause of multiple pregnancies. Even without Clomid, your odds of getting pregnant with more than one baby increase depending on factors such as your age, height, weight, and family history. Using a higher dosage than necessary also may increase the risk of having twins. Ironically, using a higher dosage of Clomid than necessary also may lower the chances you'll get pregnant at all because it can cause cervical mucus to be thicker and harder for sperm to travel through. For that reason, when a doctor prescribes Clomid, she will start with the lowest dose. Only if that dosage doesn't trigger ovulation will she increase it. Women taking Clomid who do not have trouble ovulating or getting pregnant, as well as women younger than 25, may have an increased risk of getting pregnant with twins while taking Clomid . How Will I Know If I Got Pregnant With Twins While Taking Clomid? Symptoms of early pregnancy are no different with twin. Nor are an early positive result on a pregnancy test or having high levels of hCG on a blood test reliable indicators of a twin pregnancy. This means you won't know if you conceived twins until you have an ultrasound.         Depending on your health history, your doctor may order one at the six-week mark (two weeks after you miss your period), but this may be too early to detect twins. However, by the eighth week, a twin pregnancy should be visible. If you get pregnant with twins after taking Clomid, don't panic. Good prenatal care can reduce the odds of complications, and support from friends and family can help you make the most of this double blessing . Sources: American Society of Reproductive Medicine .

These drugs are used to stimulate ovulation. Brand names that may be familiar to you include Gonal-F, Follistim, Ovidrel, Menopur, and Luveris. (More names below.) Gonadotropins are known informally as injectables. They are administered by injection only. (This is different from fertility drugs like Clomid and letrozole , which are pills you take by mouth.)         The naturally occurring hormones in the body FSH and LH are also known as gonadotropins. They play a pivotal role in ovulation . How Do They Work? To better understand how gonadotropins work, you should first understand how the female reproductive system works. Read an easy to understand, step-by-step explanation of the female reproductive cycle here. If you don't have time for that, here's a super quick recap! Normally, your pituitary gland produces FSH and LH at the beginning of your menstrual cycle. The FSH is sent out into the body. LH is stored in the pituitary gland until just before ovulation. FSH tells the follicles in your ovaries to wake up and grow. FSH stands for "follicle stimulating hormone." Makes perfect sense, given it stimulates the follicles ! Gonadotropin fertility drugs, that are FSH or FSH along with LH, act similarly. They tell the follicles on your ovaries to grow and develop.   LH typically peaks just before ovulation during a natural cycle and helps any mature eggs to go through one last growth spurt and release. In other words, ovulate! During treatment with gonadotropins, you may be given either an injection of rLH or, more commonly, hCG . This acts like the natural LH spike and will trigger ovulation.         What to Expect Gonadotropins may be used on their own. They may also be used as part of an IUI treatment or IVF treatment cycle. Below is an explanation of how they may be used on their own. When you get your next period, you'll call your doctor. You'll then have some blood work and an ultrasound. This is to make sure there are no complications or reasons you can't be treated in this cycle. (For example, to ensure you aren't pregnant and don't have a benign ovarian cyst .) Your doctor will likely start you off with 75 to 150 IU of the gonadotropin medication. Depending on which gonadotropin is prescribed, you'll need to give yourself injections just below the skin (subcutaneously) or into the muscle (intramuscularly). Ask your doctor or nurse to demonstrate how to safely perform the injections. They will likely do this without you asking. How to Give Yourself a Subcutaneous Injection How to Give Yourself an IM Injection Over the next several days, your hormone levels, specifically estradiol , and the follicles on your ovaries will be closely monitored. This monitoring happens via blood work and ultrasound every few days. How often? That will depend on your doctor's protocol, how you're responding to the drugs, and how close you are to ovulation.         Your medications may be adjusted up or down depending on the ultrasound and hormone results. The goal is to stimulate the ovaries enough to produce one good egg, but not to overstimulate them. Other stimulation can increase your risks of a multiple pregnancy or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). When your hormone levels and follicle size indicate ovulation is close, your doctor may order an injection of hCG. This is also known as the " trigger shot ." It triggers ovulation to occur approximately 36 hours later. Your doctor should also tell you which days to have intercourse, so you can"catch" the egg and get pregnant!  How to Cope with Doctor Prescribed Conception Sex During Treatment Once ovulation occurs, you may then start taking progesterone . Not everyone will need this, however. Your hormone levels will continue to be monitored, though less frequently. You'll take a pregnancy test at the end of the cycle to determine if treatment was successful. Sometimes, treatment may be canceled in the middle. This may occur before the trigger shot or even earlier. The most common reason for cycle cancellation is your doctor suspects the ovaries have been hyperstimulated. Stopping the medications can avoid a serious case of OHSS and high-order multiples. Your doctor may also tell you to refrain from intercourse. As difficult as it is to hear this, it's very important you follow your doctor's instructions. Pregnancy can increase the chances of a high-order pregnancy, which puts you and your babies at risk. Also, if you develop OHSS, pregnancy can complicate your recovery. Different Types There are two basic types of gonadotropins: recombinant gonadotropins and urinary-extracted gonadotropins. Recombinant gonadotropins are created in a laboratory using recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant FSH gonadotropins on the market include Gonal-F and Follistim. Currently, Luveris is the only recombinant LH gonadotropin available. Urinary-extracted gonadotropins are extracted and purified from the urine of postmenopausal women. (Their urine is naturally high in FSH.) They include human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG), purified FSH and highly purified FSH. Purified urine-extracted FSH gonadotropins include Bravelle and Fertinex. Human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) contains FSH and LH. It includes medications like Humegon, Menogon, Pergonal and Repronex. Menopur is a highly purified hMG. A related drug, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is often part of fertility treatment with gonadotropin injections . You may know hCG as the pregnancy hormone , but it also happens to be molecularly similar to LH. In a natural cycle, LH triggers ovulation . As part of fertility treatment , an injection of hCG may be used to trigger ovulation. Ovidrel, Novarel, Pregnyl and Profasi are brand names for hCG injectables. Associated Risks Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a potentially serious complication of gonadotropin therapy. Mild OHSS occurs in 10% to 20% of women taking gonadotropins. Serious OHSS occurs 1% of the time. Serious OHSS can be deadly if ignored or not treated properly. It's important you are familiar with the symptoms. OHSS Symptoms and Treatment Another possible risk factor of gonadotropin therapy is a multiple pregnancy. Some studies have found that up to 30% of pregnancies conceived with gonadotropins are twins or more. (This is compared to just 1% to 2% of naturally conceived pregnancies.) Most multiple pregnancies with gonadotropins are twins. Up to 5% are triplets or more. Multiple pregnancies , including twin pregnancies , are risky for the mother and the babies. Close monitoring of a treatment cycle can help prevent a multiple pregnancy. Many doctors will cancel if more than three follicles develop or if estradiol levels are very high. Some studies have been able to get the rate of multiples pregnancies as low as 5%. They have done this by starting at a low dose, using slow increases only when necessary and close monitoring. Twin Pregnancy Risks Should I Get Pregnant with Twins on Purpose? Quiz: Are Your Odds of Conceiving Twins Higher Than Most? The risk of ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage is higher with gonadotropin-conceived pregnancies. Less than 1% of women taking gonadotropins will experience adnexal torsion, or ovarian twisting. This is when the ovary twists on itself and cuts off its own blood supply. Surgery is necessary to untwist or possibly remove the affected ovary. Your risk of pregnancy complications -- like pregnancy-induced high blood pressure and placental abruption -- may be slightly increased as compared to a naturally conceived pregnancy. Whether this is caused by the gonadotropins or the infertility is unclear. Because gonadotropins are injectable medications, you may also experience soreness near the injection sites. If you suspect an infection, be sure to alert your doctor right away. Side Effects and Risks of Gonadotropins What Are the Success Rates? Your potential for pregnancy success with gonadotropins will depend on a variety of factors, including your age and the cause of infertility. A 2011 study by The Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine looked at 1,400 gonadotropin treatment cycles. The overall pregnancy rate was 12%, with the live birth rate about 7.7%. Younger patients had higher live birth rates. In this study, by canceling the cycle if three or more dominant follicles developed or estradiol levels were higher than 1500 pg/ml, they were able to keep the multiple pregnancy rate a low 2.6%. Older studies have found higher pregnancy rates with gonadotropins than this one. However, it's possible the higher success rate came at the expense of higher risk for OHSS and multiple pregnancy. Cost of Treatment Gonadotropin treatment that is not an IUI or IVF cycle can cost anywhere between $500 to $5,000. The higher price takes into account blood work and ultrasound monitoring. Also, the price varies because different women will need different amounts of drugs. Your insurance company may pay for part of treatment. Or, they may pay for all of it... or none of it. You may need to pay your fertility clinic in full first. Then, you may need to file for a refund from your insurance yourself, or the clinic may handle the insurance claims for you. Be sure to clarify all of this with your fertility clinic before you start treatment. You don't want to be surprised by a high bill at the end.

You may feel excited and happy, especially if you've gone through a long journey to get to this point. It's also normal to feel nervous, scared, or even sad. There are risks to a multiple pregnancy. You may be worrying about losing the babies or wondering if you'll be able to handle caring for them when they arrive.         You may also feel angry - getting pregnant was difficult for you, and now you face a potentially difficult pregnancy and birth. It's true there are risks to multiples . You do need to be informed of the risks so you can be aware of troublesome symptoms and make informed choices. However, there are also many positive aspects to carrying and raising more than one baby at a time. Denial isn't good, but focusing on only the negative isn't great either. Here are some positive thoughts on twins and multiples. Two (or Three or Four) Heartbeats Remember when you hoped to see any heartbeat on the ultrasound screen? The first time the ultrasound tech detects not just one but more than one heartbeat, you may be thrilled and scared. But over time, as you slowly come to accept the multiple pregnancy, seeing more than one blip on the screen will warm your heart. Earlier (and More!) Sensations of Fetal Movement Mothers of multiples may pick up fetal movement weeks before mothers of singletons.   When the first movements begin, you may need to be very quiet and still. The sensations may be light, like butterflies. As the pregnancy continues, the movements will become more noticeable. Near the end, people sitting next to you may be able to see the bumps and squirms! Double the Baby Bliss As the mother of multiples, you'll get to enjoy double (or triple or quadruple!) the baby bliss.         Moms of one may baby may gaze upon their one sleeping child and smile with joy. But you'll get to gaze on one face, and then another adorable face, and maybe another! You'll also get to go through the thrill of the first smile, the first giggle, the first word, the first step, and so on, more than once. The joy isn't less for the next baby. Each big moment is precious. Fascination of Watching Multiple Children Grow Together You may begin to feel like you're witnessing a research study in your own home, as you watch your children develop at different rates and in different ways. We all know that each person is an individual. That said, we don't often get to see babies or children at the exact same age, raised in the same environment, grow together. For example, your babies may not only start walking at different times but also reach that milestone in different ways. One may scoot and then crawl and then walk. Another may coast around the room and never do much crawling. If you have identical twins, you may wonder at the things they do that are similar compared to the things they do that are so very unique. If you have a boy and a girl, you may find it interesting how they play or develop in different (or similar!) ways.         Automatic Playmates Twins may not always become the best of playmates, just like any pair of siblings. But in the younger years especially, they will be their first playmates to each other. The idea of life without their twin won't even occur to them. As they get older, some twins remain close playmates. They may have an especially close sibling relationship as adults as well. Automatic Family If you have twins, and they are your first, you already have the average American family size of two children. Automatic family! Get the Diapers and Sleepless Nights Out of the Way Of course, if you plan on having more, this may not be quite a big advantage.  However, if you think these will be your last babies, you'll be able to go through diaper days and sleepless nights all at once, instead of over a period of four to five years. Your diaper changing and lack of sleep will be more intense than those caring for one baby. Not everyone will agree this is the easiest path. On the other hand, if you're going to focus on the positives, might as well celebrate the multiples boot camp path - overwhelming but over faster! Impress Friends and Strangers at Parties If you've been dealing with infertility for awhile, you've probably listened to your share of parents complain about their kids. You may have even heard the infuriating comment , "Consider yourself lucky you don't have kids! They just take over your life!" Well, now, you can one-up those people. When they start complaining about their one baby or one young child, you can say, "I have twins." (Or triplets, or quads, whatever you've got.) For best effect, say it nonchalantly. With a glass of wine in hand. They are likely to respond, "Oh, I could never handle twins!" That's when you, again, in a totally calm blissed-out voice, "You're probably right. Personally, I'm in heaven." And if they declare you super mom or dad, accept that title with pride. (I feel the need to say if you don't feel you're handling the twins or triplets well, that's totally normal, too. Ask for help from those that can offer you positive support. But at the party, go ahead and fib a little about how competent you're feeling!) Focus on the Positive Side of Statistics Yes, twin and multiple births come with risks. But those risks come with a positive side as well. For example, if 10% of twin mothers experience gestational diabetes , 90% of twin moms don't. If one in four mothers of twins face pregnancy hypertension, three in four do not have problems with high blood pressure. If 10% of identical twins sharing one placenta experience twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) , 90% do not. Sixty percent of twins are born prematurely . But 40% are born on time. Of those twins born after 35 weeks, about half are born vaginally. Be careful not to use the positive side of statistics to ignore symptoms or blow off doctor's orders. Balance your optimism with reasonable caution, and you're more likely to have a healthier and happier twin pregnancy.

They may think; "we want kids, and all this treatment is expensive and unpleasant, so let's just have 2 kids and get it over with". When they are fully aware of the risks to the children if delivery is premature, some couples no longer prefer a multiple pregnancy. However, after full disclosure of the risks, many couples still hope for twins. Of course, they are also hoping that their children will be perfectly healthy. The psychological, social, and economic stresses involved with caring for twins is substantial, but patients often say they would welcome facing those stresses if they were so blessed. The risks of a multiple pregnancy are high. These expectant mothers face an increased risk for developing complications of pregnancy such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, preterm labor, hemorrhage, and other complications. The risks to the fetuses and children are mostly related to premature delivery and can be very severe. Compared to a singleton, a twin is about five times more likely to die in the first year of life. For a triplet, this risk is about 13 times that of a singleton. The risk of having a lifelong handicap (e.g., cerebral palsy, mental retardation) is increased about 10 times for twins compared to singles, and these risks are substantially higher for triplets. Quadruplet and other high-order pregnancies are much riskier. Fortunately, with current embryo transfer policies, pregnancies beyond triplets are rare with IVF.      Statistics about the number of embryos transferred and multiple pregnancies  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) gather, tabulate, and publish annual national summaries and clinic-specific reports of IVF statistics.   These reports cover live birth rates, twin and triplet rates, the average number of embryos transferred per patient and other variables   The report for IVF cycles in 2015 is currently available  on the SART website, the CDC report lags behind the SART report - 2015 preliminary data is the most recent available from CDC.   Links to the SART and CDC reports   These annual reports show the trend in the United States toward transferring fewer embryos.   In 1997, the average number of embryos transferred to women under 35 was 3.7  By 2000, it was down to 2.9  Over the same time period, there was a significant increase in the overall live birth rates for IVF procedures  At the same time, the percentage of births that were triplets or more dropped from about 14% to about 9%  However, over the same period of time, no progress was made with regard to reducing the rate of twin pregnancies, which remained at about 32% of births.  Over that 4-year period, US IVF centers transferred less embryos, resulting in higher success rates, a lower percentage of triplets, but no change in the percentage of twins.   In general, European infertility clinics are transferring fewer embryos as compared to American IVF centers. On average, they have lower pregnancy rates and a lower percentage of multiple births than clinics in the United States. There are several factors involved in this difference. In some European countries, physicians are restricted by law so that they cannot transfer more than two embryos. Also, IVF is more commonly paid for by insurance or socialized medical systems in Europe. In the United States, couples with insurance coverage for IVF services are more likely to prefer fewer embryos for transfer. By comparison, couples who must pay out of pocket for IVF often request that more embryos be transferred. They tend to be fearful of failure because of the high financial costs associated with repeating the IVF process.       What is the appropriate number of embryos to transfer?   In 2017, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and SART published revised guidelines regarding the appropriate maximum number of embryos to transfer. The ASRM guidelines suggest a maximum number of embryos to transfer based on the day of transfer (cleavage stage vs. blast), "prognosis category" (favorable vs. all others), whether preimplantation genetic screening was done to screen out chromosomally abnormal embryos, and female age .   Current ASRM - SART guidelines on maximum number of embryos to transfer (updated 2017)     Maximum Number of Embryos to Transfer  Cleavage-stage Embryos (day 2 or day 3 ET)      Age < 35  Age 35-37  Age 38-40  Age 41-42    Favorable Prognosis  1  1  3  4    All others  2  3  4  5    Euploid  1  1  1  1       Maximum Number of Embryos to Transfer  Blastocyst Embryos (day 5 or day 6 ET)      Age < 35  Age 35-37  Age 38-40  Age 41-42    Favorable Prognosis  1  1  2  3    All others  2  2  3  3    Euploid  1  1  1  1     The ASRM identifies the following characteristics as being associated with a "more favorable prognosis":   First cycle of IVF  Good embryo quality by morphology grading criteria  Excess embryos available for freezing  Having a previous successful IVF cycle    These guidelines have been helpful in limiting the number of embryos transferred, particularly in patients with the most favorable prognosis. However, many couples in the other categories who choose to have more than two transferred could still be at high risk for multiples, including triplets. Also, patients with embryos that have a high potential for implantation might have a high risk of twins if they have two transferred. Couples with a very high chance for pregnancy can be identified on the day of embryo transfer and can be offered the option of transferring one or two embryos. When a couple has high-quality embryos available for transfer on day 5 and they are offered the options of transferring one embryo with a 50% expectation for pregnancy (almost all singles) or two embryos with an 75% expectation for pregnancy (about 38% twins, 60% single, and 2% triplets), most couples choose to transfer two embryos. This is  after counseling them about the medical risks involved for mother and babies with multiple pregnancies. They want the higher chance for pregnancy and are accepting (sometimes even welcoming) the risks that are involved with a multiple pregnancy. Those who choose to have a single embryo transferred usually have insurance coverage for IVF or have at least one child already.      What is blastocyst culture and transfer?  A blastocyst is an embryo that has developed for 5 to 7 days after fertilization and has just started to differentiate. It has developed two different cell types and a central cavity. One group of cells will become the placenta, and the other group will become the fetus. A healthy blastocyst will begin hatching from its outer shell by the sixth or seventh day. Shortly after hatching from the shell, it should begin to implant into the lining of the mother's uterus. In past years, the majority of embryo transfers were done on day 3 (after the egg retrieval) at the "cleavage stage" when the embryos have four to eight cells. One problem with this is that day 3 embryos normally are found in the fallopian tubes, not in the uterus. The embryo first moves into the uterus at about 80 hours after ovulation. The embryo implantation process begins about 3 days later, after blastocyst formation and hatching have occurred. The other problem with transferring on day 3 is that many embryos at that stage do not have the capacity to continue development and become high-quality blastocysts. We do not have reliable methods to determine which of the day 3 embryos will be viable long-term. Therefore, the tendency has been to transfer more embryos on day 3 in an attempt to achieve good pregnancy rates. When embryos are cultured from day 3 to day 5, some will stop developing and others (usually 25% to 60%) will continue to become blastocysts. Therefore, by choosing the best blastocysts for transfer on day 5, we can choose much more reliably those with the best potential for implanting and making a baby. In the past it was difficult to get good numbers of high-quality blastocysts with in vitro culture systems. However, advanced culture media have been developed that provide the proper balance of nutrients at the various stages of early embryo development. Proper culture techniques with these new media formulations yield excellent blastocyst formation rates. This makes blastocyst transfer a viable option for some couples with infertility. Some programs are doing all IVF cases with day 5 transfers. One of the issues with this is that a small proportion of couples will have embryos that are growing on day 3, but by day 5, all of their embryos have stopped developing. These patients could have had a day 3 embryo transfer, but because their embryos were kept in culture and arrested after day 3, they will not have an embryo transfer at all. This has been reported to occur in about 5% of cases if all patient's embryos are cultured for 5 days. The ultimate outcome of the cycle might be exactly the same either way (a failed cycle), but many couples would  prefer to have an embryo transfer and then not be pregnant as opposed to being called and told that their embryos have stopped developing and therefore they will not have an embryo transfer procedure. Our IVF program and many others perform blastocyst transfers in selected cases. Most IVF centers (including ours) that perform day 5 transfers have selection criteria for deciding which cases are transferred on day 3 versus day 5. The criteria often involve a minimum number of fertilized eggs or a minimum number of embryos that are still developing on day 3. In our IVF program, we (currently - 2017) usually perform day 3 transfers for couples (female age under 37) with less than 3 day 3 embryos, and do day 5 transfers for couples with 3 or more  day 3 embryos. This has been working well for us with rare cases having no embryos available for transfer on day 5. Individual factors are often important in making this decision, such as:   Age of the female partner  Information from previous IVF cycles  The planned number of embryos to be transferred to the uterus (1, 2 or 3)  Whether preimplantation genetic screening is desired by the couple         Do blastocyst transfers correlate with higher pregnancy rates than day 3 transfers?   Yes, in most published studies, and in the experience of many IVF programs, pregnancy rates are higher with blastocyst transfers when a given number of embryos are transferred (e.g. two). This is because of the higher potential for implantation of the blastocyst. However, the issue is complicated because some IVF centers have seen no improvement or even lower pregnancy rates with blastocyst transfers. This is because blastocyst culture and transfer is technically more complicated and difficult as compared to day 3 transfer. Some laboratories are not able to maintain the stable and exacting culture environment for 5 days that allows the optimal development of the embryos. Therefore, it is not surprising that extended culture and transfer of two embryos on day 5 can show excellent pregnancy rates in some centers and significantly lower results in others. This concept is well-understood in the embryology world, but it is not widely discussed in public forums.      How can blastocyst transfer benefit couples needing IVF?  Because blastocysts have a significantly higher implantation potential than day 3 embryos, the physician can transfer only two embryos and keep pregnancy rates high (over 50% per egg retrieval procedure in some programs for women under age 40) and triplet pregnancy rates down in the 2% to 4% range (one of the two embryos can split into identical twins to make triplets). Transferring only two embryos on day 3 results (on average) in an even lower rate of twin and triplet pregnancies (a good thing), but this happens at the cost of a lower overall pregnancy rate. Because of the high implantation potential of blastocyst embryos, we should be cautious about the high potential for twins. Transfer of two good looking blastocysts can result in twin pregnancy rates as high as 50%. Therefore, transferring only one should be considered in young women (or in egg donation cycles) with high-quality blastocysts. Pregnancy rates with single embryo transfer (SET) in these patients can be in the 40-60% range in good IVF programs with a very low risk of twins (about 2% due to embryo splitting - identical twins).  How can PGS testing benefit couples needing IVF?   When we screen embryos prior to the transfer with preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) we see excellent pregnancy and live birth success rates after transfer of a single embryo when it has normal PGS results. We now have years of experience with doing this for couples that choose to have it.   Conclusions  Blastocyst culture and transfer of one or two embryos in IVF centers that are proficient with this technique currently offers the best balance between the chances of having any pregnancy and the risks of  multiple pregnancy.  The decision to transfer one or 2 (or more) should be based on the age of the female , the morphology grading of the blastocysts and the history of their previous IVF treatments.  Doing PGS screening on blastocysts and then transferring a single embryo is currently the state of the art for IVF. It provides a high probability for a healthy outcome for mother and baby and reduces miscarriage risk.

Undo Answer Wiki 7 Answers   Leah Hawkins Bressler , Reproductive epidemiology researcher, ObGyn Sub-intern Answered Jul 29, 2012 There are two kinds of twinning that can result from IVF: (1) dizygotic (fraternal, two babies from two eggs) (2) monozygotic (identical, two babies from one egg). The risk of dizygotic twinning and higher order multiple gestations depends on the number of embryos transferred during the IVF cycle. The current Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) national summary shows: (1) -When one embryo is transferred, 98.1% of births are singletons 1.9% are twins <0.01% are higher order multiple gestations (HOMG = 3 or more) -When two embryos transferred: 65.2% of births are singletons 33.9% twins 0.8% HOMG -When three+ embryos transferred: 68.3-73.2% of births are singletons 24.1-27.7% twins 2.5-3.9% HOMG [Figure from CDC, ASRM 2009. ART Success Rates Report. US Dept HHS (1)] Thus, the risk of multiples increases with number of embryos transferred. However, the likelihood of live birth also increases up to a point (24.5% of IVF cycles result in live birth after one embryo transferred, 44% result in LB after 2 ET and 23.1-33.2% result in LB after 3+ embryos transferred) (1). To maximize chance of success (single live birth) and minimize risk of adverse outcomes, including multiple gestations, ASRM/SART regularly release embryo transfer guidelines to guide practice (2-3). [Figure from ASRM Practice Committee. Fert Steril . 2009;92:1518-1519] Yet, even when one embryo is transferred women can experience monozygotic twinning (MZT), as was Janice's experience. In natural conception, the rate of MZT is about 0.4% (4). In ART (including IVF), the rate of MZT is 2-12 times higher, ranging from 0.8-4.8% (4-5).  This increased rate of MZT is not entirely understood but has been attributed to culturing of embryos and to a technique known as Assisted Hatching (5). Assisted Hatching (AH) is when a defect is created in the shell of the fertilized egg (the Zona Pellucida) to facilitate implantation. The proposed mechanism for an increased risk of MZT is that when the embryo squeezes out of the egg, it assumes an hourglass shape that makes it vulnerable to halving in two (dividing one embryo into two identical embryos). In summary, even in cases of single embryo transfer, IVF confers at least a slight increase in risk of multiples as compared to natural conception. *Though the question doesn’t ask for comparisons to other ART techniques, it should be noted that when ART/SART guidelines for ET are followed, IVF offers lower risk of multiples than ovulation induction via Clomid or gonadotropins (6).

Why do some women fantasize about having twin babies? Do multiple rounds of IVF increase the risk of cancer? Can I have twins or triplets through IVF? Will IVF increase the chances of one having twins/triplets? How many babies can a woman have? Ask New Question Quora User , Waiting Adoptive Parent Updated Jun 26, 2012 · Author has 535 answers and 761.5k answer views When a woman does IVF she and her doctor have the choice of how many embryos to transfer into the uterus during one cycle. So the answer to this question is completely in control of the woman doing the IVF.   If she chooses to  transfer only one embryo, their chances of a multiple birth pregnancy are the same as a natural pregnancy.  But the success rate of achieving pregnancy at all with only one embryo is lower than if you have implanted multiple which is why some women opt to implant more than one at a time. The doctors I have seen have recommended 2-3 embryos to be  transferred during one month.  The risks of multiple birth pregnancies they have quoted me given an aggregate 2.5 embryos transferred is a 25% likelihood of twins and a .4% likelihood of triplets.  This is a significant difference seeing as how the percentage of twin births in the general population is 3% and 1/10th of 1% for triplets and above. transferring 2 or fewer embryos drastically reduces the possibility of a high-order multiple pregnancy (triplets or above). Reputable clinics would not allow a woman to transfer much more than 3 embryos at a time unless she was having extreme difficulty achieving a pregnancy or the embryo quality were poor.  That is why my mind boggles at stories like the octomom - I have to think, why did her clinic allow her to do that? (Edit:  The Octomom's fertility doctor is having his licence revoked for implanting 12 embryos into her. "The Beverly Hills fertility doctor has acknowledged implanting 12 embryos into Suleman, then 33, prior to the pregnancy that produced her octuplets. It was six times the norm for a woman her age." http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4324...

We transferred one embryo (as rec by our San Fran clinic) and now have identical twins. The quality of this embryo was BETTER than it would have been naturally as the very best one was chosen from the batch. It was not naturally self selecting. The age of the egg is the major contributing factor. If the age of the egg is very young think hard about transferring multiple embryos.

It is possible to have a single embryo transferred this will decrease the chances of getting a twin or triple but at the same time it will decrease the chances of getting pregnant also.

Undo Answer Wiki 7 Answers Quora User , Emergency Nurse, Clinical Nurse Educator Answered Dec 9, 2011 · Author has 2.2k answers and 12.9m answer views Multiple births are a recognised 'problem' in ivf pregnancies. Although in vitro fertilisation (IVF) births account for only a small percentage (1.3%) of all births nationally, over 20% of all multiple births are IVF births. This means that IVF births contribute a disproportionately large number of multiple births to the overall rate. At present, about 1 in 4 IVF pregnancies result in multiples: this is around 20 times higher than the rate after natural conception. The reasons for this are usually due to the number of embryos's transferred as the following illustrates:- How does IVF affect the risk of multiple birth? Multiple birth is the single biggest risk to the health and welfare of children born after IVF. See Risks to the mother and Risks to the child. Currently, after IVF and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) around 24% of pregnancies are multiple, compared with only 1 – 2% after natural conception. This can be directly related to the fact that IVF normally involves the transferring of 2 or 3 embryos to the womb. At present, according to HFEA guidance, the number of embryos that can be transferred is no more than 2 for women under 40 (or for those receiving donated eggs as donors are under 35) or no more than 3 for women over 40. If two separate embryos implant in the womb, the mother will be pregnant with non-identical twins. The chance of a single embryo dividing and resulting in identical twins is also higher after IVF though it is not yet known why this happens. So it is possible to end up with twins from a single transferred embryo, or triplets from 2 embryos. Most of the triplets born after IVF are the result of double embryo transfer. Data from the UK (2005) shows that almost 46% of babies born as a result of IVF to women under 35 (using fresh eggs) are multiple births. ( www.oneatatime.org ) There are many risks inherent to both the mother and the babies born in a multiple birth pregnancy:- Risks to the mother For mothers, risks arising from multiple pregnancies range from the less serious to the life-threatening. Pregnancy complications A number of pregnancy complications (hypertension, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes etc) may mean an early admission to hospital for the last weeks of pregnancy and that the birth may have to be induced early. Higher rates of miscarriage. 20% of women pregnant with twins suffer from pregnancy induced hypertension, compared to around 1–5% of women pregnant with a singleton. Research in the UK found that the risk of pre-eclampsia was up to 30% for twin pregnancies compared to 2–10% in singleton pregnancies. The risk of gestational diabetes is up to 12% in twin pregnancies compared to around 4% for singleton pregnancies. Higher chance of intervention in delivery. Elective and emergency caesarean section rates are higher for mothers of twins. Maternal mortality There is a 1/25,000 risk of maternal mortality during singleton pregnancy or birth versus 2/25,000 risk of maternal mortality during twin pregnancy or birth. Risks to the child For children, the highest risk from being one of a number of multiples is prematurity, with all its attendant problems. Premature birth The greatest risk associated with multiple pregnancies is premature birth: Research in the UK found that twins were born on average at 35.8 weeks, compared to the 40 week average for singletons. A study in the US found that at least half of all twins were born prematurely (before 37 weeks) and at low birth weight. An American study reported that 11.8% of twins compared to 1.6% of singletons are born before 32 weeks of gestation. International research concluded that, as a rough estimate, in vitro fertilisation (IVF) twins are born with an average gestational age 3 weeks earlier than IVF singletons and with a mean birth weight ranging between 800g and 1000g less. An Australian study found that 48.4% of twins had low and very low birth weight compared with 8.2% of singletons. Perinatal mortality Twins are 6 times more likely to die in the first year of life than singletons (24.1/1000 compared with 4.4/1000). In 2003, had all IVF babies born in the UK been singletons, the deaths of an estimated 126 babies could have been avoided. Neonatal care Between 40-60% of IVF twins are transferred to neonatal care units when they are born, compared with 20% of IVF singletons.  In a Belgian study, intensive care stays of more than four weeks were endured by 11.7% of IVF twins, but only 1.6% of IVF singletons. The risk of delivery before 28 weeks is 1.2% for twins compared to 0.2% for singletons. Research in the UK and Ireland found that 75% of babies born before 26 weeks died very soon after birth and before admission to neonatal care. Those admitted had a 39% chance of survival. 62% of those that survived had significant brain damage, retinopathy of prematurity, and/or ongoing oxygen dependence at their predicted due date. Respiratory distress In a Belgian study, 8% of twins required assisted ventilation and 6% suffered from respiratory distress syndrome compared to 1.5% and 0.8% for singletons respectively. Cerebral palsy Several studies have shown that twins are between 4 and 6 times more likely to suffer from cerebral palsy than singletons. 12.6/1000 twins had cerebral palsy, compared with 2.3/1000 singletons. A European multi-centre study reported that cerebral palsy risk was increased by low gestational age and birth weight. Delay in language acquisition: Twins have more problems with language development. Research in Denmark found that 6.4% of IVF twins needed speech therapy compared with 3.2% of IVF singletons. Disability A Japanese study reported that in 7.4% of twin pregnancies at least one child had a disability. I have a friend who was Godmother to triplets born after ivf, it would be no exaggeration to say that the first few years of life for the mother and the triplets was extremely hard and it is for reasons like those outlined that the numbers of embryo's transferred in the UK is now limited. 10k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback!

Yearning for a child in this world is absolutely normal and to be specific, children are a special gift from God. Meanwhile, this remarkable ambition in life is threatened by what is scientifically termed as infertility. Infertility is a two-way matter, meaning that it affects both males and females. For that matter, couples result to Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) with the hope of achieving parenthood. The commonly attained ART treatment is IVF (In Vitro Fertilization), a form of assisted reproduction where the male sperms and the eggs are combined in a petri dish for fertilization. Once fertilization occurs, the embryo/s is cultured for a few days after which it is transferred back to the woman’s uterus with the hope of conception. To increase the chances of conception, fertility experts may transfer a number of embryos, which may result in multiple pregnancies. Multiple pregnancies in IVF simply mean the possibility or the occurrence of having more than one baby which was unintended. Most couples end up with twins, triplets, and even quadruplets after an IVF treatment. How do Multiple Pregnancies Occur? Naturally, a woman releases one egg per month and this egg will be fertilized to attain pregnancy. This results in the birth of one child, and when both ovaries release an egg at the same time, these two eggs will be fertilized which results in twins. This is commonly normal through natural births In IVF, multiple pregnancies occur when the patient asks or the fertility expert decides to transfer more than two embryos into the woman’s uterus. This act is associated with a number of risks and in most cases, women will require specialized care and monitoring at our  IVF centre in India to prevent complications. What are the associated risks; Premature Birth Preeclampsia Low Birth Weight Twin-to-Twin Transfusion 	Syndrome (TTTS) Intrauterine Growth 	Restriction (IUGR) Gestational Diabetes Placental Abruption Cesarean Hectic pregnancy periods Infections Whereas the above-mentioned risks can be approached with a fertility provider’s help, other hardships such basic needs, maternal help, food, clothing, and medical attention will be addressed by the couple itself. Possible Solutions Multiple pregnancies were hardly escaped in the past, but modern technology provides various options to prevent or even control multiple pregnancies; Assisted Laser Hatching This is a technical procedure that requires high expertise.

Also, if women are having fertility problems due to decreasing fertility with age, the more times IVF fails, the older the woman will be. There is only one opportunity for implantation per menstrual cycle! In order to have a high success rate, IVF procedure involves insertion of several embryos into the potential mother- the guidelines for the actual number vary in each country- in the UK, according to wikipedia, 1-3 embryos are transferred. Some factors affecting number of embryos inserted include: number viable embryos available, age of the woman, state of her health. The more embryos transferred, the higher chance of a singleton pregnancy (in the majority of IVF pregnancies), but this results in an increased chance of multiple births (minority of IVF pregnancies). If more than one embryo is transferred, sometimes more than one of these embryos  implants in the uterus and thus one or more embryos may be carried to term, aka multiple birth. This would result in dizygotic (non-identical) twins. Sometimes if only one embryo implants it may split in two, resulting in monozygotic (identical) twins. This is due to IVF technique, which may cause insult to the embryo due to sub-optimal culture conditions which can cause disruption of communication between blastomeres (cells making up the early embryo), resulting in independent formation of two blastocysts. The embryo may be damaged due to intra-cytoplastmic sperm injection or assisted hatching resulting in splitting of the embryo. Maternal age has been reported to increase the likelihood of monozygotic twins, but this is contradicted in some studies. Monozygotic twins are currently not as common as dizygotic twins in IVF though. Potentially, both these mechanisms could occur, resulting in 2 identical and 1 non-identical triplets- triplet pregnancies can be dangerous for mother and embryos/fetuses/babies.

Identical twins are a genetic “accident” so to speak (a really cool one), and there is no way to increase your chances there. From what I understand, several factors can increase the likelihood of having fraternal twins, including: Fertility treatments. Mom’s age -older women have more chances, and also more chances of other flukes, like genetic disorders :( History of twins on the expecting mother’s side -fraternal twins are not genetic, it’s all about two eggs being released at once. I’ve seen shirts that say “Real men make twins!” LOL if you have fraternal twins, you had nothing to do with it, buddy -not more than with any other baby, anyway. None of these factors were involved for my twin sister and me. We were surprises! Haha. One of us more than the other. It is known that twin births are becoming more common. My guess is it’s due to the increased effectiveness of fertility treatments, and the fact that in many cultures (like here in the U.S.) women are starting their families later, so there are more older women having kids. 2.8k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Nancy Dutton Bankston Related Questions More Answers Below What factors increase the chances of having fraternal twins?

Do my chances of having twins increase? Ask New Question   M. T. Owens , Answered Feb 9, 2012 · Author has 343 answers and 1.4m answer views The probability of bearing fraternal twins is thought to be heritable, since it involves how many eggs a woman sheds at a time, which is a trait that is biologically based and might be subject to biological regulation. As you might expect from this hypothesis, some ethnic groups are known to have a higher probability of bearing fraternal twins than others. On the other hand, the probability of bearing identical twins is thought to not be heritable. Identical twins arise from rare, random "twinning" events early in embryological development. Therefore, if you are a woman and a fraternal twin, you *might* have inherited genes from your family that increase your chances of ovulating more than one egg at the same time, which would increase your chances of having twins. However, if you are an identical twin, you probably don't have an increased chance of having twins. 34.1k Views · View Upvoters Thank you for your feedback! Your response is private.

That picture in your head includes one baby, not two or three, right? Thought so. Still, there are factors that can increase your likelihood of conceiving twins or multiples. ‘Identical twins, which make up around a third of twin pregnancies, come from one egg and are basically a fluke of nature – there’s no known common factor in those,’ says David Davies, consultant obstetrician at Portsmouth’s Queen Alexandra Hospital. ‘But with non-identical twins or triplets, which come from different eggs, there are several shared influences.’ From what you eat to the size of your family, get clued up on the likelihood that you’re going to need a bigger buggy. Your family history Yes, that’s your history, not his. In fact, even if your partner has twins in his family, it makes no difference. ‘It’s all about the woman because you’re the one producing the eggs, so if you or your mum are twins, or perhaps your sister has multiple babies, then you’ll be more likely to conceive more than one,’ says David. Your lifestyle Women who have a low-fat diet, especially vegans and vegetarians, are less likely to have multiples than someone who goes for the whole milk and tucks into steak every Friday. ‘The possible causes of this are subtle hormonal changes in people with these different diets, as well as perhaps someone with a higher fat diet having a higher body mass index (BMI) – that’s a measure for checking how healthy your weight is in relation to your height,’ says David. Number of children you have Chances are this is just a case of odds – the more children you’ve had, the more likely at some stage you’ll conceive multiples. The more children you’ve had, the more likely at some stage you’ll conceive multiples You’re simply giving yourself more opportunities to strike lucky. ‘There’s also the possibility that if you’ve always become pregnant easily in the past, you’re basically a good ovulator , so to speak’ says David. Maternal age Naturally conceived twins and triplets are more common in women in their 30s and 40s. ‘This is about the way your ovaries work and how their function changes with age, so you may release more than one egg each month,’ says David. Where you’re from Western Europe sees around one in 60 twin pregnancies, while they’re much more rare in South East Asia. Meanwhile, in Nigeria, twins make up one in every 20 or 30 pregnancies. ‘There are no real theories I’m aware of that would account for this, but interestingly if you’re Nigerian and living in another country, you’re less likely to conceive multiples than if you’re based in Nigeria – so perhaps it’s to do with diet or climate,’ says David. Fertility treatment One of the biggies that can boost your likelihood of having more than one child is having fertility treatment, such as IVF. ‘When IVF started to get really affective in the US during the 1970s and 1980s, twin rates pretty much doubled,’ says David. ‘It’s down to your body being given drugs to stimulate it to ovulate and produce eggs.’ 7.7k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by SunJour Healthcare Corporation UMOOZE is an all-natural dietary supplement for men with BPH.

Undo Anonymous Answered Aug 22, 2014 I have had 2 sets of Fraternal Twins, with the same father- so I know the textbook analysis is bunk  My ex-boyfried has fathered a total of 5 fraternal twins with 3 different women. All natural.  All but one set were intentional, by women who wanted to have the joy of having twins.  All 3 of his brothers also have at least 2 fraternal twins(so far!)   Some men are really more likely to have twins. Most women have multiple follicles maturing at the same time. One becomes dominant and the other dies out. But if the sperm are able to fertilize 2 eggs-before the non-dominant follicle dies out, then the woman may have conceived twins- and 9 months later may become a proud mama of twins. Some men have 30X the "typical" sperms.  Birth Control Pills do not work that well for these men. Their sperm lasts  9 days or so, and enter the uterus, even if the pill is supposed to stop them. The top 1% of the men have sperm quality that is 30X the "typical median" man.  The have more sperms, sperms with better morphology -  and more semen volume- even better Ph levels. My ex-boyfriend and his brothers are very healthy- they are of normal BMI- 32/33 inch waistline, no butter, beef or read meat  - no steroid use to bulk up. Probably explains their advantage over the red meat eating American- some of the American guys cannot even have sex in missionary position- So gross- and so likely to lead to infertility. Both my sets of twins were planned, and "I conceived in the first cycle of trying to concieve for both. First one was concieved at age 36 and the next one at age 42. I just felt it would be simpler to have 2 babies at once. I am financially independent- so having twins was a luxury I could afford. But many women who are not that financially strong also seem to want twins. I am surprised. 6.6k Views   Jeremy Miles , Father of MZ twins Answered Feb 10, 2012 · Author has 3.4k answers and 8.6m answer views To add a little to M. T. Owens 's answer, fraternal twins are inherited down the maternal line, so if you are female and your mother was a fraternal twin, you have a higher probability of producing fraternal twins. For identical twins, there have been a couple of cases where identical twins seemed to be passed down the patenal line - these families (in Denmark) were associated with male infertility as well. But it's usually the case that identical twinning is a random event (as far as anyone can tell). 8.5k Views · View Upvoters   Bruce Feldman , Twinless identical twin.

The incidence of identical twins is not hereditary so the likelihood of identical twins to have twins would be the same as everybody else. 1.2k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by  Neha Om Related Questions How do I conceive for having twins?

What caused the increase in multiples?  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby?  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby?       Reviewed by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board   Last updated: January 2016     How common are twins and other multiple births? As of 2013, twins accounted for about 3 in 100 births in the United States. And 1 in 837 births were triplets or higher order multiples. Between 1980 and 2009, the birth rate for twins rose by about 76 percent and has remained about the same since then. The rate of triplets and higher order multiples quadrupled from 1980 to 1998 but has since dropped by more than one-third. It's possible that the birth rate of fraternal twins, which happens when two eggs are fertilized by two different sperm, has slowed because of counseling by fertility doctors about the health risks of having twins or more . (The likelihood of having identical twins, which happens when one fertilized egg divides in half, is holding steady at about 3 to 5 in 1000 births. This rate hasn't changed over the decades and is remarkably constant all over the world.)  What caused the increase in multiples? It was partly due to more women waiting longer to have a baby. Hormonal changes as you age make it more likely that your body will release more than one egg at a time – and more than one fertilized egg often means more than one baby. But the rise in multiple births was mostly due to women using fertility drugs and assisted reproductive technology (ART) to help them conceive. These drugs and certain treatment decisions greatly increase the odds of having twins or higher order multiples. Inside pregnancy: Fertilization Sperm make an impressive journey through a woman's body, and one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. See all videos  If I'm undergoing fertility treatment, how likely am I to have more than one baby? It depends on the type of fertility treatment. Fertility drugs stimulate your ovaries, increasing the odds that you'll release several eggs at the same time. If you have in vitro fertilization (IVF) , your chances of having more than one child vary depending on your age, how many embryos are placed in your uterus, and other factors. According to national data, the percentage of IVF treatments resulting in twins or more were as follows: 29.1 percent for women younger than 35 26.5 percent for women age 35 to 37 20.9 percent for women age 38 to 40 13.6 percent for women age 41 to 42 8.8 percent for women age 43 and above On its own, IUI (intrauterine insemination) , the procedure in which sperm are placed into the uterus with a syringe, is the only fertility treatment that doesn't increase the chances of conceiving multiples. But most women who undergo IUI also take a fertility drug, which does.  What other factors affect the chances that I'll have more than one baby? Although conceiving identical twins almost always happens by sheer chance, several factors can influence the probability that you'll have fraternal twins. Heredity: If you're a twin, or if there are twins in your family, you're slightly more likely to have a set yourself. Age: The older you are, the higher your chances of having fraternal twins or higher order multiples. Women age 35 or older produce more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) than younger women. FSH is also the hormone that causes an egg to mature in preparation for ovulation each month, and women with extra FSH may release more than one egg in a single cycle. So older women are statistically less likely to get pregnant, but they're more likely to have twins if they do. History of twins: Once you have a set of fraternal twins, you're twice as likely to have another set in future pregnancies. Number of pregnancies: The more pregnancies you've had, the greater your chances of having twins. Race: Twins are more common than average among white and African American people and less common amon Hispanic and Asian people. Body type: Fraternal twins are more common in large and tall women than in small women.

It’s advice that couples tend to ignore when talking to their fertility doctor about the number of embryos to transfer during IVF. Because the cost of fertility treatment is high and is usually not covered by insurance, they hedge their bets and gamble that transferring multiple embryos will increase the chances of getting pregnant. And while stricter guidelines for embryo transfer have been successful at reducing higher order multiples (triplets or more), "the next hurdle is how do we reduce the twin rate while maintaining the same pregnancy rate?" says R. Stan Williams, MD, president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART), and professor and chair of the Department of OB-GYN at the University of Florida.  Patients, however, tend to not see the risks of being pregnant with two. Michael A. Feinman, MD, Medical Director of HRC Fertility in Southern California, says some couples strongly want to transfer two embryos or actually desire twins. "Some couples think twins are 'cute,' because they do not see the ones who experience the problems of prematurity or see how difficult it is for parents to handle them.”  The Risks of Multiples  Fertility doctors and patient advocates are working to educate patients about the serious health risks and high costs of having more than one baby at the same time.  “We have to do a better job educating patients about the health risks — they are not getting these messages,” says Barbara Collura, executive director of the infertility patient advocacy group RESOLVE. “They are being told it by their doctor as part of the informed consent process. But reproductive endocrinologists — you can ask any single one of them if they ever get pressure from the patients to transfer more than the required guidelines state, and they will tell you ‘yes, every day.’”  Even though there seem to be twins everywhere these days (between 1980 and 2004, the rate of multiple births increased by 70 percent), the risks to the health and well-being of the mother and babies — and the costs to society — are quite high.  “It has been shown that twin pregnancies cost society billions of dollars each year,” Dr. Feinman says. “These costs are due to increased maternal hospitalizations to prevent prematurity, increased intensive care for the babies from prematurity, and increased rates of lifelong disabilities like cerebral palsy in twins.”  Women who are pregnant with twins are at much higher risk for pregnancy complications, including: Premature birth: About 60 percent of twins are born prematurely at an average of 35 weeks. Low birthweight: More than half of twins are born at less than 5 ½ pounds. Low birthweight babies, especially those born before 32 weeks and/or weighing less than 3 1/3 pounds, are at increased risk of health problems during the newborn period, as well as lasting disabilities such as mental retardation , cerebral palsy , and vision and hearing loss . Cesarean section: Women who carry multiples may be more likely to need Caesarean sections, which may require a longer period of recovery and at times can increase the risk of hemorrhage during and after delivery. Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS): About 10 percent of identical twins who share a placenta develop TTTS, which occurs when a connection between the two babies' blood vessels in the placenta causes one baby to get too much blood flow and the other too little. Pre-eclampsia: Women expecting twins are more than twice as likely to develop pre-eclampsia, which is a combination of high blood pressure, protein in the urine and generalized swelling that can be dangerous for mother and baby. Gestational diabetes: This pregnancy-related form of diabetes can cause the baby to grow especially large, increasing the risk of injuries to mother and baby during vaginal birth. Babies may also have breathing and other problems during the newborn period. Single Pregnancy Is Safer  Being pregnant with one child is safer, with the greatest chances for an optimal outcome.  A recent study published in BMJ (British Medical Journal) found that women who undergo IVF are almost five times more likely to give birth to a single healthy baby following a single embryo transfer (SET) when compared with women who choose to have two embryos transferred. In addition, the SET appeared to significantly increase the chances of carrying the baby to full term (37 weeks).  With medical advances, assisted reproductive technology (ART) has come a long way from the early days of transferring six embryos in the hopes of getting just one to implant. Newer techniques such as blastocyst stage culture and transfer are maximizing pregnancy rates and minimizing the risk of a multiple pregnancy. By growing embryos for five days in the laboratory and enabling them to reach the blastocyst stage of development, fertility doctors can better determine which embryos have the greatest likelihood of implantation.  Research has shown that success rates for single embryo transfer vs. double embryo transfer are similar in certain circumstances. "In a favorable patient who is having a blastocyst (Day 5 embryo) transfer, one blastocyst is an equivalent pregnancy rate to two," Dr. Williams says.  But some couples have difficulty accepting these studies, according to Dr. Feinman. "They intuitively feel that the second embryo must hedge their bet. Also, input from friends and former patients often affects their feelings.”  The most recent 2009 guidelines on embryo transfer from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and SART are very individualized. For example, for a woman under age 35 who is in the favorable category, the recommendation is to transfer one embryo if it is a Day 5 (blastocyst), and one to two embryos if it is a Day 3.  "The big advantage of the American system is we can look at shades of gray," Dr. Williams explains. "Depending on the patient’s age, the prognosis of the patient, and the stage of the embryo development, we can develop guidelines that are more flexible to meet the needs of the patient while trying to reduce the potential for multiples."  Every Fertility Story Is Different  In addition to fertility problems such as blocked tubes, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and her husband’s low sperm count, Petra, a former fertility patient, now 51 and the mom of 5-year-old twins, had experienced a brain abscess and surgery to repair a congenital heart defect in her early 20s. After trying to get pregnant for 15 years, she and her husband tried in vitro fertilization (IVF).  “Once we got into the surgery room the embryologist told us that we had three blastocysts,” she says. “One of them was hatching, which was excellent news. The other one also looked wonderful. However, the last one was fragmented and would not survive the freeze. We had to make the decision to either transfer the last one or discard it. Desperate for a child, we decided to transfer all three.”  With her heart problems, however, Petra could not have endured a triplet pregnancy. “In my eighth week, I had a vanishing triplet, but I always wonder: What if that had not been the case? I would have been faced with some terrible decisions that women who undergo fertility treatments do not want to make. If we had to do it again, I would have ‘discarded’ the third embryo, and I wish I would have been more informed — even fragmented blastocysts can make it."  Dr. Feinman says that when discussing how many embryos to transfer, his fertility clinic usually abides by the ASRM guidelines. However, “personal issues and embryo quality will also affect our advice. For instance, if multi-fetal reduction is not an option, we might transfer one less embryo. Conversely, if embryo quality is poor, we might discuss transferring more than the recommended number. In ideal cases, such as egg donation, single embryo transfer should be strongly considered. Most clinics doing this show very little decrease in pregnancy rates, compared to transferring two embryos. Even a small decrease in success will be balanced by the higher pregnancy loss rates and prematurity associated with twins."  Ultimately, however, the decision-making rests with the fertility patient.  Educating Fertility Patients  The high cost of fertility treatment and the lack of insurance coverage are key reasons why fertility patients tend to turn a deaf ear to the risks involved with having multiples.  According to Petra, she and her husband were advised of the medical risks, but chose to have the three embryos transferred anyway. “I couldn’t wrap my head around having one baby ... especially since I knew I would not have a chance to do another IVF. I probably would have felt different if we had fertility coverage. I know our decision to transfer more than one embryo was, unfortunately, made with our finances in mind and not based on medical facts and studies.”  One of the biggest obstacles in patient care is cost, says Collura. “We also know that patients tend to feel more pressure to transfer more embryos when they have pressures on cost — if somebody does not have insurance, and they only have $15,000, they may say, ‘Look, I only have this one shot. Transfer as many as you can.’”  Dr. Feinman has seen this many times. “Some [patients] think [having twins] is cost-effective if they are paying for their care: ‘Two for the price of one,’” he explains. “Sometimes it is hard to convince them that this is not true, since twins tend to cost much more than a frozen embryo transfer.  “In Canada and much of Europe, the government will only cover IVF if the clinic performs single embryo transfers,” he continues. “In some countries, if a non-identical twin occurs, the clinics have to pay back the government. In the U.S., insurance companies have abdicated their moral right to affect the situation by refusing to cover IVF. Ironically, they spend a lot more money on the multiple births created by IVF than they would if they covered it and helped regulate it. If our government or insurance companies ever wake up and realize this fact, there might be a move toward increased coverage with increased restrictions accompanying this coverage.”  Collura says that patients make better health care decisions when the cost pressure recedes. “There’s a lot of data out there about insurance coverage in mandated states and the reduction of multiple births in those states.”  A new study by Yale School of Medicine researchers and published in Fertility and Sterility has found that the 15 states that provide insurance coverage for infertility saw significantly lower multiple birth rates. In 2005, it was estimated that the economic impact of preterm birth was $26.2 billion nationally.  RESOLVE has worked with Shady Grove Fertility, a Maryland fertility clinic, to produce a patient education video about the risks of multiples. The video is based on a true patient story and a letter the patient wrote to Shady Grove after she had twins born at 25 weeks, specifically asking Shady Grove if they could use her story to help educate others about the risks of premature birth. The video describes how one twin had intestinal surgery and how both spent approximately seven months in a hospital.  “I am hoping that hearing a person’s story about her own experience and providing some data is going to be effective,” Collura says. “Our idea is for this to be available to any fertility clinic, anywhere in the United States. "Whatever I can do to help that patient know more and be better educated, I'm going to do that."  SART developed a national consent form for fertility clinics to use that gives very detailed risks for pregnancy with multiples.  In addition, ASRM is in the early stages of developing a video about the risks of multiples, according to Dr. Williams. "We are very interested in reducing multiple pregnancies."

Photo: EPA              By Rebecca Smith , Medical Editor   7:15AM GMT 09 Feb 2012   Follow        The fertility clinic regulator has set a new target in an attempt to reduce the number of multiple pregnancies, which is the single biggest risk associated with IVF treatment.        Embryonic stem cell extraction: The study will mark a new chapter in the contentious history of embryonic stem cell research in the United States       The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has lowered the target to 10 per cent from the current 15 per cent for each clinic. The new target will come into effect in October and fertility clinics will have to carefully judge which couples should be counselled to have only one embryo transferred to the womb at a time to minimise the chances of a multiple pregnancy. Currently, across the whole country the multiple pregnancy rate following IVF treatment is around 20 per cent. It will be up to the clinic to judge which couples are suited to single embryo transfer and older women or those with complex problems still be allowed to have two embryos transferred so their chances of having a child are not affected.

Multiple pregnancies are more likely to lead to birth defects, premature birth and low birthweight which put the babies at greater risk of disability and death and the mother is more likely to suffer complications also. Rachel Cutting, Chairman of Association of Clinical Embryologists said: “We are very pleased that the HFEA has lowered its multiple birth target to 10 per cent. "Just three years ago, there was a one in four chance of having twins following IVF, but we have reduced this figure by developing improved ways to select the best quality embryo a patient has. "This in turn allows us to replace just one embryo per IVF cycle without affecting a woman’s chance of falling pregnant. By continuing to understand more about embryo development and using new technologies we can maintain these excellent success rates. “Ultimately, ensuring the health of both the mother and her baby is our top priority. And as multiple births pose greater health risks, we believe it is essential that we continue to find ways to reduce the chances of having twins, which is why we are so committed to the use of single embryo transfer.”               Health News       News »    Rebecca Smith »           In Health News            Weird X-rays              Life begins at 70              Living proof: the secret of healthy ageing              Why olive oil should be kept out of the frying pan              Ebola outbreak in pictures                        Top news galleries       Woody Allen's 30 best one-liners          Comedy    Martin Chilton selects 30 great one-liners from the comedian and film
