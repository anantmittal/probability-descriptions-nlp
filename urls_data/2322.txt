Spencer Platt / Getty   Share         U.S.  Donald Trump  Impeachment  Gambling  Republicans President Donald Trump may not want to look at betting odds on his impeachment if he wants to get 2018 off to a positive start. The odds would likely leave the president on the brink of his first tweetstorm of the new year. Related: Support for Donald Trump's impeachment is higher than his re-election chances The Ireland-based gambling website Paddy Power thinks it's highly unlikely Trump lasts his first term in office without being impeached. The odds are currently 4-7 that the president is impeached before Inauguration Day 2021. To put that in perspective, oddsmakers at Paddy Power think it's nearly twice as likely Trump will be impeached as it is that he will serve four years in office. Paddy Power has additional ominous betting odds for the White House. Of the three years Trump has remaining in his presidency, the betting site has impeachment most likely in 2018. The odds that Trump is impeached in 2018 are nearly even at 5-4. For a sitting president, that doesn't paint a particularly rosy picture. The odds get exponentially better for Trump if he emerges from 2018 unscathed, as the site puts the odds at 7-1 that Trump is impeached in 2019 and 50-1 in 2020.

On the topic of Trump being impeached in his first term, the market is a bit more bullish on the president's survival. The site, which does its betting differently than Paddy Power, allows for a 35-cent bet on Trump's impeachment and a 65-cent bet on Trump completing the entirety of his term. That would put the odds at approximately 2-1. The House of Representatives, which has the sole power to impeach a president, got started in 2017 as Democratic Texas Representative Al Green introduced and forced a vote on articles of impeachment against the president. The vote failed overwhelmingly, but it did garner the support of 58 Democrats. The odds of the president being impeached are likely dependent on two factors: The first major factor is the FBI investigation, led by special counsel Robert Mueller, into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Should the investigation yield bombshell revelations against the president or his close confidantes, a bipartisan coalition of representatives could see fit to reintroduce impeachment with a broader base of support.  Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now The second factor is the 2018 midterms, which could potentially see the Democrats take control of the House of Representatives. Should Democrats win control of the chamber, they could be emboldened to humiliate the president by voting to impeach him. Trump may be safe for now, but he might very well spend the next few years nervously looking over his shoulder. That is, if he makes it a few years.

Zelizer and Morton Keller   Jul 28, 2017    Politics      Share    Tweet    …      LinkedIn    Email    Print        Text Size           The election of Donald Trump, and the early days of his presidency, have driven many Americans to rummage through history in search of context and understanding. Trump himself has been compared to historical figures ranging from Ronald Reagan to Henry Ford , and from Andrew Jackson to Benito Mussolini . His steps have been condemned as unprecedented by his critics, and praised as historic by his supporters. To place contemporary events in perspective, we turned to a pair of historians of the United States. Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author, most recently, of The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society . Morton Keller is a professor emeritus of history at Brandeis University. He has written or edited more than 15 books, including Obama’s Time: A History . They’ll be exchanging views periodically on how to understand Trump, his presidency, and this moment in political time. — Yoni Appelbaum Morton Keller: At its inception, the American presidency was a mix of the European monarchical model, and the new American idea of limited rule, reinforced by George Washington's two-term limit. The Virginia Dynasty presidents—Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe—served the two-term span; their regionally limited Massachusetts competitors—John Adams and John Quincy Adams—managed only one. The more democratic party political era that began with Andrew Jackson in 1828 established a new pattern of most chief executives serving single terms (or, if they succeeded to a death-created presidency, no subsequent election). It took special qualities and special circumstances to win reelection: Jackson himself; Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant in the Civil War-Reconstruction era; Grover Cleveland as a Gilded Age reformer (though his were electoral victories separated by a Republican presidential term); the anodyne William McKinley; the Progressive Democrat Woodrow Wilson. From Jackson (1828-1832) until the coming of FDR in 1932, only six presidents were elected to two terms—and 18 elected to one (or, in the cases of John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, and Chester Arthur none). * Related Story      End Times for the American Republic?  To what degree did FDR's four elections change the pattern? Since then, two-term presidencies have been more frequent: Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama. As before, those who came into office as vice president when the incumbent died (or, in Nixon's case, resigned)—Harry Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson—did not pursue the reelection for which they were legally qualified. * And as before, a less than stellar record, or a vote-scattering third party candidacy—Jimmy Carter, the elder Bush—meant that the incumbent fell by the wayside. And the most recent two-termers—George W. Bush and Obama—won less than smashing triumphs. Obama, indeed, was the first two-term president in modern times to win his second term by a considerably smaller margin than his first one. So I think it may be said that in its long history the presidency has generally been hostile territory for extended presidencies—with the exception of FDR. But his four elections went so against the American grain that the 22nd Amendment embedded Washington's two-term limit in the Constitution. What may we look for in the Age of Trump? Given his low poll standings, his increasingly shaky position in his own party, and his inability so far to expand his appeal beyond his core, Trump's second-term prospects (both for nomination and reelection) are less than bright. Of course, we're only six months into his first term, but it is difficult to see much light at the end of the Trumpian tunnel. Given the past record and this future prospect, the need for fresh faces and a fresh approach to governance in 2020 looms ever larger. Trump may have activated a portion of the electorate that Hillary Clinton (who in her way was almost as deplorable a candidate) missed. And yet, Democrats are so far not making very effective noises about reaching out to these voters, much as the Republicans fell short of its efforts to engage Hispanic voters after 2008. Who might those new faces, and what might those new approaches, be? The Democrats might be well advised to skip over their current leaders—Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden—and not-so-young aspirants like Elizabeth Warren. As of now, none of these set many pulses racing. It might be best for the Democrats to see who emerges in the wake of the 2018 election. The Republicans are better stocked with potentials less long in the tooth: House Speaker Paul Ryan, Vice President Mike Pence, and Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Ben Sasse. True, none of these seem to appeal to the Trumpian core so far. But if the incumbent continues on his erratic and off-putting course, that core might well shrink to a collection of parings. And what of programmatic appeals? Without getting too deep in the weeds of policy specifics, both Trumpian excess, and the resistance mode adopted by the Democratic leadership and the media-talking heads chorus, might well give way to a more moderate, open-to-negotiation approach. The take-no-prisoners tails of the two parties make the loudest noises. But it is not clear that they have the biggest battalions. It may be that one of the parties will try to find out in 2020 — and in doing so, hit political pay dirt. Julian Zelizer: Mickey, you raise the question on many people’s minds—whether we are looking at a one-term president. Certainly, as you suggest, if we were placing a bet about his long-term prospects the odds would not be in his favor: Low approval ratings, an ongoing investigation, chaos in the White House, and united government without major legislation to show for it spells trouble. It is too early to have any solid sense of where this is all going, but we can take seriously the speculation that there won’t be two-terms of Trump. You point out that this is not a total surprise, nor is it necessarily just about our current president. For much of American history, one-term presidents were common. FDR shook things up with his four terms and since 1945 there have been a series of two-term presidents. But even then, you remind us, several presidents have not made it that long (either because of resignation, withdrawal, or defeat). Presidents George W. Bush and Obama won “less than smashing triumphs.” The distrust of centralized authority is woven into the founding fabric of this country. We were rebelling against kings when this Republic was created and have not stopped ever since. From my perspective, this structural analysis of the nation’s discomfort with two-term presidents is too easy on Donald Trump. If the president does stay in office for another four years, in this case, I think it’s safe to say that the political failure is more about him than about the institution. This is not like any other presidency that we have seen and the destructive side of commander in chief is doing more than anything else to subvert his future. His recent public bromides against Attorney General Jeff Sessions, his most loyal foot soldier and a favorite of the “base” that the president so cherishes, is a reminder of why things are going wrong. The next question that you raise is what should the parties do? From my perspective, the challenge for Democrats is less about moving to the left or moving to the center, than it is about being more vocal and coherent about the party’s economic world view and being more aggressive in championing reforms to make politics work better. Democrats don’t suffer from being too far to the left, they suffer from being too embarrassed about their own party platform. There is relatively unanimity within the party about a number of key issues, such as raising the minimum wage, the need for well-funded infrastructure programs, providing job training and better child care, supporting educational opportunities and more. The pieces are all there. The problem has been that Democratic candidates often hesitate to put these ideas front and center, always fearing that they will be somehow smeared as too far to the left even though the public supports many of these positions. While Republicans embrace their core agenda with relish, Democrats run away from it. The widespread public rejection of the draconian Medicaid cuts that Republicans have been pushing on Capitol Hill should be a reminder to the party that there is something to the government programs they stand for. In a fascinating piece in The New York Times , Lee Drutman found that the divisions about economic policy are not that deep within the party. The real tension between the Clinton and Sanders “factions” centers on how much they distrust institutions. The Sanders wing doesn’t think much of the political process. A winning Democratic candidate thus needs to combine a robust economic platform with a vision for government reform. The two can be a powerful combination. We should also remember that Clinton won a huge percentage of the popular vote, so the notion that the party can’t attract voters is not clear to me. On the Republican side, coming back from a one-term presidency wouldn’t be so easy. Republicans will own the Trump presidency and a skillful Democrat will take advantage of this. Many of the possible candidates you mention, Paul Ryan and Ben Sasse, for instance, are far to the right. A look at the kinds of policies that they propose could make it difficult for them to really win a broad coalition. While Trump didn’t seem to know the details of any of the health-care bills, Ryan, for instance, has been the architect of an agenda that makes steep cuts in programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Republicans also need to understand that the forces which produced a victory for Donald Trump are deep rooted. Trump is a culmination of many of the changes that have been taking place within the party over the past decade, not merely an anomaly. Unless moderate Republicans wake up to this fact, the party won’t move in a different direction. For all the talk about a working-class rebellion against the Democrats in states like Wisconsin, much more important to his victory was a conservative media universe (a chattering class, as you might call it) that has fostered the kind of public discourse Trump thrives on, as well as intense partisan loyalty which lead Republican voters to push for more extreme candidates and a notable shift in the party’s ideological world view on issues like immigration and climate change. Trump took many of his ideas right out of the playbook that was written by Tea Party Republicans on Capitol Hill. All of these forces will still make it difficult for the Jeb Bush’s of the world to succeed. The next Republican candidate might not be Trump, but it could easily be a cleaned-up version of him and I am not sure this is a successful recipe for the GOP in a world that is becoming more ethnically diverse, more educated, and more socially liberal than it has been in a long time. Obviously, time will tell. I guess for now we should just see if he even makes it for the entire term. Keller : Julian, I do want to take issue with a couple of your statements. One is that the Democrats are more divided on issues than the Republicans; I just don't see that. It is true that traditionally the Democrats were more factional (Comedian Will Rogers in the 1920s said, “I don't belong to an organized political party. I'm a Democrat.”) But it is one of the topsy-turvy aspects of current as compared to past party politics that the once monolithic Republicans seem unable to come up with a unified front that appears to have become second nature to the congressional Democrats. (A not unrelated development is the reversal of the parties in their appeal to the better-off, more educated segments of the voting population.) My second reservation has to do with your comment that a “conservative media universe” defends Trump. My sense is that much of that conservative universe, like The Wall Street Journal and a number of members of the conservative “chattering class,” are quite verbal in their criticism of Trump. Do you really think that there is more division among Democrats over the merits of Elizabeth Warren? I think it is important not to see the Fox-CNN polarity as the defining voices in our political world. Zelizer: I think that there is nothing quite like the Fox News- Breitbart News network. There are some voices in the conservative media who are now critical of the president, but it took a long time. Generally, Fox News has simply echoed the message of the administration and served as much more of a promotional platform for conservatism than a source of journalism. This has been essential to Trump's success given the power that these networks and websites have with Republican voters. It is simply not comparable with other “mainstream news networks” that regularly include conservative voices—including Trump surrogates—and have been highly critical of Democrats, including Hillary Clinton. The major area of criticism for the administration has been the Russia investigation, which comes as much from the media as it does from intelligence agencies, a Republican Congress, and many non-partisan voices. Much of the false or misleading information that Trump tweets about seems to come directly from shows like Fox and Friends . So I think what we have seen in the conservative media world is fundamentally different—and this is part of what the party must reckon with if they are serious about wanting to change course. *  This article originally stated that Zachary Taylor had not been elected to a term as president and omitted Chester Arthur from the list of those who did not seek election. We regret the error. ** This article originally stated that Gerald Ford did not seek election. We regret the error.

Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.

Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.    Continue Reading                  Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   Why the GOP Is Making the Midterm Elections All About Impeachment    David Frum      It may be a counterintuitive gambit, but Republicans are betting it will pay off.   To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.

When Mark Zuckerberg rehearsed the manic routine of a presidential candidate last year, he was of sound mind. Electoral success may have ultimately been beyond his talent set. But the culture accorded him the sort of profound respect that two-term senators and technocratic governors never receive. Zuckerberg sat on the cover of glossy magazines and reaped plaudits: for teaching himself Chinese ( Wired : “Mark Zuckerberg Speaks Mandarin, Blows Everyone’s Mind”); for making bold, not-quite-charitable pledges ( Bloomberg : “Mark Zuckerberg Philanthropy Sets New Giving Standard”).

A court document suggests otherwise.   Much as the role of the addictive multibillion-dollar painkiller OxyContin in the opioid crisis has stirred controversy and rancor nationwide, so it has divided members of the wealthy and philanthropic Sackler family, some of whom own the company that makes the drug.  In recent months, as protesters have begun pressuring the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and other cultural institutions to spurn donations from the Sacklers, one branch of the family has moved aggressively to distance itself from OxyContin and its manufacturer, Purdue Pharma. The widow and one daughter of Arthur Sackler, who owned a related Purdue company with his two brothers, maintain that none of his heirs have profited from sales of the drug. The daughter, Elizabeth Sackler, told  The New York Times in January that Purdue Pharma’s involvement in the opioid epidemic was “morally abhorrent to me.”    Continue Reading                  PNAS / Richard Goerg / Getty / The Atlantic   The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete    James Somers      Here’s what’s next.   T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.    Continue Reading                  Jules Julien   Your Body is a Teeming Battleground    Victoria Sweet      It’s time to rethink the quest to control aging, death, and disease—and the fear of mortality that fuels it.   I went to medical school , at least in part, to get to know death and perhaps to make my peace with it. So did many of my doctor friends, as I would find out. One day—usually when you’re young, though sometimes later—the thought hits you: You really are going to die. That moment is shocking, frightening, terrible. You try to pretend it hasn’t happened (it’s only a thought, after all), and you go about your business, worrying about this or that, until the day you put your hand to your neck—in the shower, say—and … What is that? Those hard lumps that you know, at first touch, should not be there? But there they are, and they mean death. Your death, and you can’t pretend anymore.  I never wanted to be surprised that way, and I thought that if I became a doctor and saw a lot of death, I might get used to it; it wouldn’t surprise me, and I could learn to live with it. My strategy worked pretty well. Over the decades, from all my patients, I learned that I would be well until I got sick and that although I could do some things to delay the inevitable a bit, whatever control I had was limited. I learned that I had to live as if I would die tomorrow and at the same time as if I would live forever. Meanwhile, I watched as what had been called “medical care”—that is, treating the sick— turned into “health care,” keeping people healthy, at an ever-rising cost.    Continue Reading                  Edmon de Haro   The Era of Fake Video Begins    Franklin Foer      The digital manipulation of video may make the current era of “fake news” seem quaint.   In a dank corner of the internet, it is possible to find actresses from Game of Thrones or Harry Potter engaged in all manner of sex acts. Or at least to the world the carnal figures look like those actresses, and the faces in the videos are indeed their own. Everything south of the neck, however, belongs to different women. An artificial intelligence has almost seamlessly stitched the familiar visages into pornographic scenes, one face swapped for another. The genre is one of the cruelest, most invasive forms of identity theft invented in the internet era. At the core of the cruelty is the acuity of the technology: A casual observer can’t easily detect the hoax.  This development, which has been the subject of much hand-wringing in the tech press, is the work of a programmer who goes by the nom de hack “deepfakes.” And it is merely a beta version of a much more ambitious project. One of deepfakes’s compatriots told Vice ’s Motherboard site in January that he intends to democratize this work. He wants to refine the process, further automating it, which would allow anyone to transpose the disembodied head of a crush or an ex or a co-worker into an extant pornographic clip with just a few simple steps. No technical knowledge would be required. And because academic and commercial labs are developing even more-sophisticated tools for non-pornographic purposes—algorithms that map facial expressions and mimic voices with precision—the sordid fakes will soon acquire even greater verisimilitude.    Continue Reading                  Robert Galbraith / Reuters   The States Where People Die Young    Olga Khazan      A new study explores where and why Americans are dying early.   We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame.

Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images  President Donald Trump speaks to the press in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 16, 2017.  President Donald Trump speaks to the press in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 16, 2017. (Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images)   Albert R. Hunt Bloomberg View      Few stories are more irresistible than those that take on the conventional wisdom and come from an unexpected source. Doug Sosnik, a smart operative in Bill Clinton 's White House, provided both with a column this month suggesting that Donald Trump is well-positioned for re-election. The Trump base is solid, the Democratic strategist notes, as the president's appeal to populist anger transcends his leadership failures. There will likely be independent candidates in 2020, so, like last year, Trump can win without a majority of votes. Sosnik's column has led to panicked calls from some Democrats and to provocative chatter on politics sites like FiveThirtyEight, while Trumpites, not surprisingly, welcomed his analysis. It's all interesting — and irrelevant. Informed speculation awaits answers to these five questions:    No. 1: Will there be an economic downturn in the next three years, ending an already 99-month expansion, the third longest in modern U.S. history? Some economists and investors anticipate years of good times, including a stronger-than-expected global economy. The U.S. recovery from a deep downturn has been only modest, creating more leeway for a longer upturn, some potential benefits from regulatory changes, and the expectation of a corporate tax cut. More analysts believe that the business cycle hasn't been repealed, and that the bubble will burst sometime in the next two years. Trump would then blame others — the Federal Reserve, Democrats, China, Gold Star mothers — but a recession would strike hard at his working-class base. No. 2: Will the impetuous commander-in-chief launch a war, specifically a nuclear confrontation with North Korea?  Trump and Kim Jong Un are not the leaders anyone would wish to have for a potential face-off. But more informed and responsible top administration figures see increasing odds of a military response to the North Korean nuclear threat. The desired scenario: minimal deaths and a non-nuclear North Korea dominated by China. More probable would be massive casualties, chaos on the Korean peninsula, and a possible conflict with China. No. 3: Will Democrats win control of the House next year, and reject a left-wing agenda for the 2020 presidential contest? Democratic control of the House, with oversight and endless investigations, would be a nightmare for the ethically challenged Trump administration. It probably would produce legislative stalemate. But there would be internal pressure on Democrats from the left, and Republicans hope 2020 could be a reprise of 1972 and George McGovern. No. 4: Will the 71-year-old Trump have health problems? The second-oldest U.S. president is not expected to release the results of a full physical examination as his recent predecessors have, just as he won't release his tax returns. During the 2016 campaign, he issued a limited report from a family doctor. He is overweight, bordering on obese, and tries to hide it with loosely tailored suits and long ties hanging below the waist. He doesn't believe in exercise other than golf. Some experts have also expressed concerns about his cognitive health, as described in a lengthy investigation by Stat, a respected health and science site, earlier this year. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet can act to remove an incapacitated president. Given the current cast, this isn't going to happen, especially since Trump would contest it. No. 5: Will special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation into Trump and the Russians lead to indictments that implicate the president? The spin from the White House is that it is cooperating fully with Mueller to wrap up the inquiry quickly. The aim of that claim is to give the White House a pretext to attack the special counsel for prolonging a probe. It won't work. This investigation is thoroughly professional. It is diving deeply into any evidence of collusion between Trump operatives and the Russians in the 2016 campaign; into any possible obstruction of justice of the investigation by the president this year, as well as into financial dealings that may date back years. There appear to be several easy indictments, maybe even imminent. It's less clear this leads to Trump. Short of that, even if Democrats take the House, impeachment is a non-starter. Republicans, seeing how Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake , an honest anti-Trump conservative, has been savaged, duck for cover. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, once a Trump critic, has become a cheerleader and enabler for the president. While Trump is sui generis, history offers guidance on the folly of predicting distant elections. At this moment in 1989, George H.W. Bush, having kept his promise not to raise taxes and with communism collapsing, seemed invincible. Three years later, he was defeated. In 2009, Barack Obama was in trouble, with unemployment soaring to 10 percent, up sharply from what it was two years earlier, and with his major health-care initiative seemingly stalled in the Senate. Three years later he was re-elected. If the answer to five questions is no — but only if to all of them — Sosnik is ahead of the curve. Bloomberg View Albert R. Hunt is a Bloomberg View columnist.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Trump-Pence 2016  Donald Trump (politician, business person)  Politics of the United States of America Realistically, what do you think are the chances of Trump getting re-elected? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 20 Answers   William Murphy , Professor of American History, specializing in political history Answered Aug 13, 2017 · Author has 1.7k answers and 6.8m answer views What I usually tell my students when they have asked about any particular president’s chances of being re-elected is this: incumbent presidents have very powerful advantages when seeking re-election. They are already known to the electorate; there is a large group of voters who already voted for them once, and they usually do not face serious primary challenges. The opposition party, meanwhile, usually has to go through a long primary contest to choose a nominee; the candidate who emerges may not have been well known beforehand, and has to spend a lot of time, effort and money introducing themselves to the public and battling opposing candidates from within their own parties who will make arguments against their election that the incumbent president’s team can then adopt. The president can raise money and begin running ads defining their potential opponents in the eyes of voters who do not pay close attention to the primaries, while the primaries are still going on and those potential opponents are still focused on each other. So normally, I would expect an incumbent president to win re-election. The exception would be if the economy is very unhealthy at or around the time of the election. It’s easy to say that Trump is not a “normal” president; he is relatively more unpopular than any of his predecessors at comparable points in their presidencies and he is one of only four presidents to be elected despite losing the popular vote. But I would still expect him to have all of the advantages I’ve listed above. If the economy is healthy in 2020, I would not bet against his re-election. That being said, the one thing that would be a clear indication that he was in trouble would be if he faced a strong primary challenge for re-nomination. This is unusual for a sitting president, but there have been three incumbents who ran for re-election and lost since the institution of presidential term limits in the 1950s: Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush. All three won re-nomination, but only after beating back a strong primary challenge: Ford from Ronald Reagan, Carter from Ted Kennedy, and Bush from Pat Buchanan. No president who has faced a serious challenge from within his own party during this period has gone on to win re-election. If a Republican candidate were to challenge Trump for the nomination in 2020 and actually make some noise, forcing Trump to fight an actual primary contest, this would be a sign (based on the best historical examples we have) that he was in trouble in the general election. If, however, his party is unified behind him and the economy is good… well, it would be very unusual for a president to lose his bid for re-election in those circumstances, and would be another way in which Trump is unusual by historical standards. 8.4k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by TruthFinder Have you ever googled yourself?

Is Donald Trump likely to win the 2016 election (late 2015/early 2016)? Ask New Question   Dallas Mitchell , BA from Boise State University (1998) Answered Oct 1, 2017 · Author has 887 answers and 632.4k answer views Pretty good actually—unfortunately. Incumbents have a very strong record of getting reelected in this country. If he did it once, he can do it again. I see six major unknowns that will play a critical role: How will the economy be doing closer to the election? Will we be better off or worse? The economy is often a major factor. Who will the Democrats choose to run against him? Will they pick someone who is historically unpopular and has already been thoroughly demonized? Or will the pick an unknown, but highly intelligent and charismatic personality with superior communication skills, like Obama or Bill Clinton? As far as I can tell, Trump is doing nothing at all to stop the Russians from interfering on his behalf again. How effective will their continued interference be? Or, if he continues to fail to lift sanctions or undermine NATO, is it possible they’ll decide he isn’t worth it? How effective will Republican voter suppression efforts be? The could be critical in close swing states like Wisconsin. Will Democrats sabotage themselves again? By clearing the ground during the primaries for a favored establishment candidate? Or sabotaging a popular outside with populist positions who is not favored by the establishment? Or failing to coalesce and set aside differences—small differences actually—and vote for the Democrat, or in a snit, stay home and have a far worse Republican candidate (Trump), win again? What will the outcome of Mueller’s investigation be? I still believe it’s quite possible Trump could be impeached or resign. If the Dems take over in the mid-terms (possible, but not too likely IMO), I think the danger of Trump being impeached would increase greatly. Again, what will the economy be doing? Will Trump screw up so badly it might chip into his support more? For those who think Trump has it in the bag—bad news for you, he won by a very narrow margin in a number of key swing states—Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania—where if HRC had spent more time and resources—she may have won, even with all her baggage. A stronger Democratic candidate is likely to win these states, unless things are going just fantastic when Trump is up for reelection. And he is not off to a good start on that end. But for those who are confident of the opposite, and are writing him off already, don’t forget, he did it once, he can do it again. This sort of complacency is a big reason why he won in the first place. He has proven he can win against an experienced and seasoned candidate on the other side. So I’m arguing for uncertainty here. We have too little data, and it’s way to early to tell. But I think my answer at least provides some areas we should watch to see how it’s going, and why we should not have any confidence either way at this point. I would say that while his reelection is possible, it is less likely than any of the last three presidents before him—Obama, Bush or Clinton. 249 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Libertarianism.org Who elected Donald Trump?

It’s hard to narrow it down more this early on. I say greater than 0% because if he’s on the ballot, someone will vote for him. And as long as the balance of power stays about equal in Congress (even if Democrats win both houses back narrowly), i think the odds of him being impeached soon are low. Could everything change because of Mueller’s investigation? Yes, it could. I don’t expect that to happen, though. Even if Trump is implicated in wrong-doing, I think his team will provide him enough political cover that he’ll get by. The reason I don’t think he’ll get re-elected, though, is because he doesn’t adjust well to new circumstances. He constantly makes himself look ridiculous by not adjusting his message to fit events on the ground. Abject lying to try to get the facts on the ground to match your message isn’t going to work as a strategy. Here’s why: In 2020, he won’t be running against Clinton. Whomever he runs against will therefore be more popular than him. At the rate Trump is going, by 2020, gonorrhea will be more popular than him. He won in 2016 because he was pitted against a candidate who was just as unpopular as he was, and he was able to game the board. In 2020, there won’t be such a person to run against. 801 Views · View Upvoters   Joseph Perez , NYC street kid, USAF NCO, Teacher, Driver & almost retired Answered Aug 13, 2017 · Author has 2.1k answers and 1.6m answer views Pretty good chance unfortunately.

Some will argue that incumbents tend to be re elected which is true in recent history BUT Trump is not your average President. It was a perfect storm which achieved his election victory last night, a perfect storm that he will struggle to replicate in 2020. He benefited in 2016 from running against a very unpopular Hillary Clinton, he may be up against a more likely Democrat nominee next time. He’s likely to face a primary challenge next time, incumbents who have faced one in recent history have gone on to become one term Presidents. He won swing states by a tiny margin, a margin that can be very easily overturned next time. 108 Views · View Upvoters   Mayyah Herzi , close observer of Donald Trump Answered Oct 1, 2017 · Author has 69 answers and 311.5k answer views Although most Americans don’t seem to like Trump or particularly trust him, there is a chance he could get re-elected in 2020. Trump won his first term despite having significantly low approval numbers, and running against the slightly more popular candidate, Hillary Clinton. Even though Trump is disliked by the majority of America , he continues to receive unwavering support from the voters who put him in the White House. [1] Trump has already raised millions of dollars, mostly in small donations, for the upcoming reelection, and has already begun putting that money to good use by running ads in key states that praise his achievements and criticize his political rivals. [2] Despite Trump’s approval ratings being undeniably low, he seems to be meeting and exceeding America’s expectations of him. [3] Regardless in the end, it does not matter what the public feels about the incumbent but instead how the public feels about the most likely alternative. In this case it’s the Democrats. The Trump campaign, and the rest of the right-wing media complex, will relentlessly work to try and convince Republican-leaning voters that however much they may dislike Trump, they should fear and hate his opponents more. The Republicans will undoubtedly demonize the opposition and portray the left as repulsive and “a grave threat to ordinary American citizens”, so much that a sizable amount of the population will vote not as Republicans because they agree with a canidates policies but anti-Democrats. Combine that push with the many recent targeted acts of voter suppression specifically in heavily Democratic districts of key swing states, and the effort just  might grant Trump a second term.

This is a question that should've been asked no earlier than 2019, and even at that point, it's hard to tell what late factors could affect the likelihood of Trump's re-election. I will say this: the Democratic Party is in an obvious and undeniable bad shape. The fact that Hillary lost (in the 2016 Presidential Election) in 3 states she was supposed to win (Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin) tells you that Dems need to fix themselves in order to have a chance at beating Trump in 2020. The Congressional Elections of next year should provide a good test of the Democratic Party's chances for 2020, in terms of showing whether or not the party's recovering. 272 Views · View Upvoters Quora User Answered Aug 14, 2017 · Author has 92 answers and 13k answer views As unpopular as Trump is, it remains too early to tell anything. Much will depend on several factors: —2018’s midterms. A strong showing from Democrats could mean an enthused left in 2020. —The candidate in 2020. Hillary Clinton utterly failed to inspire people to show up at the polls, and whatever you felt about her personal issues the fact remained that it muddied the waters enough for people to not trust her. A clean candidate will go a long way towards drawing a contrast with Trump’s filth. —The state of the world for the next three years. Trump has already proven that he’s incapable of going a week without a self-inflicted wound.

However, there's a big factor that could come into play down the road. Potential war. If we go to war with NK or anyone like that, he's likely to be reelected.

However, Mrs. Clinton, despite her experience, and reported intelligence is, frankly a very un-likeable person and that hurt her in the election. A large number of people voted for Trump just to vote against her. And another sizable group chose not to vote, or to vote third party because neither candidate suited them.

By my estimation 40 percent of the voters will probably chooses trump and 40 percent any democratic challenger to Trump. The problem is barring those 40 percent Trump doesn’t ha ve much support. Independents abhor him and another bad sign is that his approval rating among white males is 48 percent in some polls and white males are strong gop voters. 2018 will be an important test for Trump if Senator Casey, Senator Baldwin , Senator Stabenow and Congress woman Jackie Rosen win their senate races then things do not look good .

The market thinks that the threats to Trump's presidency are many – the Mueller investigation, rumours of early stage dementia, former staffers with axes to grind, the list goes on     Christoph Siemroth   Saturday 20 January 2018 10:00 GMT         Click to follow Independent Voices                  Stephen Bannon thinks Trump has a 33.3 per cent chance of making it to January 2021 AP       Donald Trump has been under constant fire from critics since he began his campaign in the summer of 2015, and his presidency has so far been perhaps the most chaotic and bizarre in recent decades. But as he approaches the first anniversary of his inauguration, the pressure is only getting more intense.  First came revelations in Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury of various White House aides’ apparent concerns about the president’s mental capacity. Then came Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s request to question Trump about the his election campaign’s dealings with Russia, and his decision to subpoena the president’s ostracised former ally, Steve Bannon.  So as Trump celebrates a year since his inauguration, what are the chances he’ll still be president when 2018 is over?      Trump's First Year: Who has been and gone from the White House?  There are plenty of guesses and estimates out there, informed and otherwise. Bannon for one is quoted in Fire and Fury as saying Trump only has a 33.3 per cent chance of making it to the end of his term in January 2021. But while many experts and insiders have opinions on the matter, when it comes to forecasting future events, betting and prediction markets have been shown to be rather more reliable .  A prediction market is a simple financial market that allows everyone to bet on an uncertain future outcome. The market most interesting for us asks: “Will Donald Trump be president at year-end 2018?” The “yes” asset will pay 100 cents if Trump is still in office by midnight on 31 December and 0 cents if he is not. Because an asset is worth at most 100 cents and at least 0 cents, the asset price is between 0 and 100 – just like a probability.  Since anyone can trade in these markets and adjust the prices, prediction markets have been characterised as a market-based form of the wisdom of the crowd. If the crowd thinks the asset is underpriced – that is, that the implied probability is too low – then people can buy the asset at an expected profit and thereby adjust the price upwards. If the asset is seen as overpriced, then traders can sell to bring the price down.  And indeed, research shows that the prices in these markets are a good predictor of the probabilities. Whenever the asset price is 60 cents, then in 60 per cent of the cases the underlying outcome does in fact happen. If the price is 70 cents, then the underlying outcome happens in 70 per cent of the cases, and so on. That means prices are “well calibrated”; on average, they correspond to probabilities.

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: "In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears."

Photographer Joshua Roberts: "I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room."

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: "Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump's second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer's office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn't even think about it twice. "We'll do it!" he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on."

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: "We're often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone."

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: "Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don't always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt."

Photographer Carlos Barria: "The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO's of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver's seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected."   Reuters/Carlos Barria     10/29  Air Force One - 6 April 2017   US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: "During the many trips to President Trump's residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called 'Winter White House', Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader."

Photographer Carlos Barria: "A day before President Trump's hundred days in office I was part of the team that interviewed the commander-in-chief in the Oval Office. I was only allowed to photograph Trump during the last five minutes of the interview. The time was very tight so I had to move fast as I had pictures in mind that I wanted to shoot. I walked into the Oval Office and saw that the President had printed maps of the country showing areas in red where he won. I raised my hands holding my camera as high as possible to get the best view of the scene using a 16mm wide angle lens."

Photographer Carlos Barria: "President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on."

Photographer Joshua Roberts: "Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold."

Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France's President Macron."

Photographer Carlos Barria: "On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump's first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world's eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump's hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot."

Photographer Carlos Barria: "This summer the White House organized an event to showcase 'Made in America' products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media."   Reuters     19/29  White House staffers - 25 July 2017   Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: "The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It's crucial to know who's who and why they're important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it's like to be a West Wing staffer on the road."

Photographer Carlos Barria: "President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked."

Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today's politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President."

In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice.

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: "During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls."

Photographer Kevin Lamarque: "The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure."   Reuters/Kevin Lamarque     27/29  Trump in China - 9 November 2017   Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: "It's one of those "how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row". If I'm not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump's recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven't seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn't work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake."   Reuters/Damir Sagolj     28/29  Air Force One - 10 November 2017   US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: "There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples' attention."   Reuters/Jonathan Ernst     29/29  ASEAN handshake - 13 November 2017   Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional "ASEAN handshake" as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: "Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments."   Reuters/Jonathan Ernst        Another study finds that assets set to expire more than half a year in the future can exhibit slight biases. Prices above 50 cents tend to be slightly larger than the true probabilities – so looking at the odds on Trump’s future, it’s important to regard the prices as optimistic estimates.  What the crowd says  Currently the yes-asset trades at 77 cents, implying a 77 per cent or less probability that Trump survives 2018 in office. So the market thinks that while the threats to his presidency are many – the Mueller investigation, rumours of early stage dementia, former staffers with axes to grind – Trump is considerably more likely to survive than be ousted.  Still, of the 57 US presidential terms served prior to Trump, only nine ended prematurely, meaning 84 per cent of terms were fulfilled. So the market expectation of Trump making it through the next year (not even the entire term) is significantly below this historical average.  Another market asks: Will Trump be president at year-end 2019 ? Certainly the probability must be lower here, since Trump cannot resume office in 2019 if ousted in 2018. And indeed, the yes-asset in this market is currently trading at 62 cents, indicating only a 62 per cent probability or less that Trump survives the next two years in office.     But despite the shockwaves generated by Fire and Fury , the prices in both markets have not changed much in the ensuing weeks. Indeed, if anything, they went slightly up around the book’s release, only to revert again a few days later. It seems the markets may have considered the book’s “revelations”, just another episode of Trump melodrama.  However, while the odds didn’t change much, the trading volume – the number of assets bought and sold – started to explode on 1 January, around the time newspapers first started discussing the book. These numbers indicate that, while the book did create a lot of interest, it did not considerably affect people’s estimation of Trump’s chances of staying in office.  The last time we saw such large trading numbers on these markets was on 1 December – the day Michael Flynn (Trump’s former National Security Advisor) pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in its Russia investigation. With new twists in the administration’s various scandals coming thick and fast, it seems safe to say there are other spikes to come – but whether they will shift the odds is another matter.

A FiveThirtyEight Chat  Filed under 2020 Election    Facebook Twitter Email                  In this week’s politics chat , we debate what we can say now about the 2020 presidential election. The transcript below has been lightly edited.   micah ( Micah Cohen , politics editor): Hi, people!  harry ( Harry Enten , senior political writer): Hey, friends! 🙂  micah : This article, “ Trump is on track to win reelection ,” sparked some heated debate in the office. Nate thought it was dead-on and brilliant. I didn’t.  natesilver ( Nate Silver , editor in chief): #fakenews  micah : So let’s argue it out! The idea here isn’t to pick apart this one piece, but more to use it as a vehicle to discuss what we know at this very early date about President Trump’s re-election prospects. So, is Trump more likely than not to win re-election in 2020? Or, as I maintain, is that a silly question at this point given how long we have until that campaign and how unpopular Trump is.  clare.malone ( Clare Malone , senior political writer): This will be a more interesting conversation after the midterms. I’m a little undecided as to whether or not the article is silly.  harry : It certainly had a provocative headline. And while I agree with Clare that this is a question that is difficult to answer now, many potential candidates are asking it.  natesilver : There might be less than a 50 percent chance that Trump will be president on Jan. 21, 2021. But that’s because he might not run again (or might not complete his first term) — it’s not the same thing as the chances of his winning re-election, conditional upon running.  harry : I think that’s true.  micah : OK, let’s go point by point …  First, Trump knows that gaining the support of a majority of voters in a presidential election is not a requirement; it’s simply an aspiration. In fact, two out of the last three presidents were elected despite losing the popular vote.  harry : This is entirely true. You don’t need to win the popular vote (though doing so obviously increases the chances of winning the Electoral College). And you certainly don’t need to win a majority of the popular vote. Bill Clinton never  did . George W. Bush did only  once .  natesilver : Wait — elections are determined by the Electoral College?  harry : I know; this shocked me, too.  micah : This is what bothers me so much. Sure, it’s true that you can win the White House without winning the popular vote. But all else being equal , it’s harder! Right?  harry : It is. The question, which we can get to now or later, is whether Trump is in a better position to win the Electoral College without winning the popular vote than the normal politician.  micah : This also presumes a ton about what the coalitions will look like in 2020.  natesilver : Trump had a very significant Electoral College advantage … but the thing is, the Electoral College edge typically isn’t that stable from election to election . This is from an article we did in November:    The Electoral College advantage ebbs and flows      YEAR  NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE  TIPPING-POINT STATE(S)  TIPPING-POINT MARGIN  ELECTORAL COLLEGE EDGE      2016  D __ +1.8*  Pennsylvania  R __ +1.1  R _ +2.9    2012  D __ +3.9 _  Colorado  D __ +5.4  D _ +1.5    2008  D __ +7.3 _  Colorado  D __ +9.0  D _ +1.7    2004  R __ +2.5 _  Ohio  R __ +2.1  D _ +0.4    2000  D __ +0.5 _  Florida  R __ +0.0  R _ +0.5    1996  D __ +8.5 _  Pennsylvania  D __ +9.2  D _ +0.7    1992  D __ +5.6 _  Tennessee  D __ +4.7  R _ +0.9    1988  R __ +7.7 _  Michigan  R __ +7.9  R _ +0.2    1984  R _ +18.2 _  Michigan  R _ +19.0  R _ +0.8    1980  R __ +9.7 _  Illinois  R __ +7.9  D _ +1.8    1976  D __ +2.1 _  Wisconsin  D __ +1.7  R _ +0.4    1972  R _ +23.1 _  Maine _ and Ohio  R _ +22.3  D _ +0.8    1968  R __ +0.7 _  Illinois _ and Ohio  R __ +2.6  R _ +1.9    1964  D _ +22.6 _  Washington  D _ +24.6  D _ +2.0    1960  D __ +0.2 _  New _ Mexico and Missouri  D __ +0.6  D _ +0.4    1956  R _ +15.4 _  Florida  R _ +14.5  D _ +0.9    1952  R _ +10.9 _  Michigan  R _ +11.5  R _ +0.6    1948  D __ +4.5 _  California _ and Illinois  D __ +0.8  R _ +3.7    1944  D __ +7.5 _  New _ York  D __ +5.0  R _ +2.5    1940  D __ +9.9 _  Pennsylvania  D __ +6.9  R _ +3.0    1936  D _ +24.3 _  Ohio  D _ +20.6  R _ +3.7    1932  D _ +17.8 _  Iowa  D _ +17.7  R _ +0.1    1928  R _ +17.4 _  Illinois  R _ +14.7  D _ +2.7    1924  D _ +26.6 _  New _ York  D _ +25.2  R _ +1.4    1920  D _ +31.2 _  Rhode _ Island  D _ +26.2  R _ +5.0    1916  D __ +3.1 _  California  D __ +0.4  R _ +2.7    1912  D _ +17.0 _  New _ Jersey and Iowa  D _ +18.7  D _ +1.7    1908  R __ +8.5 _  West _ Virginia  R _ +10.2  R _ +1.7    1904  R _ +18.8 _  New _ Jersey  R _ +18.6  D _ +0.2    1900  R __ +6.2 _  Illinois  R __ +8.4  R _ +2.2    1896  R __ +4.3 _  Ohio  R __ +4.8  R _ +0.5    1892  D __ +3.0 _  Connecticut _ and Illinois  D __ +3.2  D _ +0.2    1888  D __ +0.8 _  New _ York  R __ +1.1  R _ +1.9    1884  D __ +0.6 _  New _ York  D __ +0.1  R _ +0.5    1880  R __ +0.2 _  New _ York  R __ +1.9  R _ +1.7    1876  D __ +3.0 _  South _ Carolina  R __ +0.5  R _ +3.5    1872  R _ +11.8 _  Ohio  R __ +7.1  D _ +4.7    1868  R __ +5.3 _  North _ Carolina  R __ +6.8  R _ +1.5    1864  R _ +10.1 _  Illinois  R __ +8.8  D _ +1.3      * 2016 popular vote margin is projected The “Electoral College edge” is the margin in the tipping-point state minus the margin in the national popular vote. Where there are two tipping-point states, their margins are averaged together.  Sources: Dave Leip’s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections, David Wasserman    harry : I think that’s right about the Electoral College advantage not being permanent, Nate. I will point out that Trump’s approval rating is above his national approval rating in enough states to get over 270 electoral votes. That is, that Trump could win the Electoral College while still losing the popular vote still seems quite plausible.  micah : Conditional on him getting more popular.  natesilver : So are we agreeing or disagreeing, Harry? Because I thought I was pointing out that the Electoral College edge isn’t necessarily all that persistent from one election to the next.  harry : I was agreeing and disagreeing if that makes sense.  natesilver : It doesn’t make sense.  harry : I was saying that you’re right historically but that there are some numbers to suggest that maybe the Electoral College advantage will be stable this time around.  micah : How Trump’s coalition is distributed via the Electoral College will be greatly influenced by who the Democratic nominee is, no?  natesilver : I’m not sure I’d say greatly influenced — but somewhat influenced, certainly. After all, Obama overperformed in the Electoral College relative to his performance in the popular vote. And his coalition was not that different from Hillary Clinton’s.  harry : Not just about who, but what that person articulates as their main message.  clare.malone : This goes back to our theory that Democrats will nominate a populist/progressive white guy in 2020 in order to appeal to more geographic areas.  natesilver : I’d still bet on the Electoral College helping Trump, more likely than not. But it’s not quite as safe of an assumption as our friend who wrote this column assumes.  micah : Next point …  Second, the continued decline in support for both political parties works to Trump’s advantage. The lack of voters’ faith in both parties increases the probability that there will be a major third-party candidate on the 2020 ballot. It will also lead to other minor-party candidates joining the presidential race. The multi-candidate field will further divide the anti-Trump vote, making it possible for him to get reelected simply by holding on to his current level of support.  clare.malone : I do not think this is the case, and I disagree with Nate that this is a time in our history when we’re more likely to see a third-party candidate.  micah : BAM!  clare.malone : I think increased partisanship really does mean that people don’t want to play with spoilers. They want their team to win.  natesilver : I disagree with your disagreement!  clare.malone : Please, sir! Explain!  harry : I disagree with all of you.  natesilver : An unpopular president and an opposition party slightly in disarray sounds a lot like … 1980 or 1992 , and those were years that invited third-party challenges.  clare.malone : No, I don’t think we live in the same cultural moment as 1992. There are now two mono-cultures — one for Democrats, one for Republicans. That was not the case in 1992.  natesilver : Well, there were some very … flawed third-party candidates in 2016. And they got, what, 6 percent of the vote? That’s not bad!  micah : But, Nate, 2016 featured the two most unpopular major-party candidates ever , and no real third-party challenger emerged. 2016 doesn’t help your case.  natesilver : The third-party vote was the highest since Perot.  micah : 😐  clare.malone : I would be interested, Nate, to see what kind of candidate you think would be a viable third-party contender in 2020.  natesilver : Viable? I’m not saying anything about viable.  clare.malone : Johnson was very flawed, gaffe-prone , not that serious.  natesilver : How about a Generic Rich Celebrity or Generic Rich Business(wo)man?  How about … K A S I C H L O O P E R !  micah : You’re undermining your own argument here.  natesilver : What do you think my argument is?  micah : That a third-party candidate more viable than Gary Johnson is more likely to emerge in 2020 than they were in 2016.  natesilver : Yes.  So how have I undermined my argument?  micah : Your only suggestions are TBD and Kasichlooper!  natesilver : The playing field is going to look like a mess to a lot of people. You arguably have two parties in disarray. And Trump becoming president will make a lot of people think: The Rules Are Broken And Anything Is Possible.  harry : We’re missing a key point here: I’m not sure a third-party candidacy helps Trump.  natesilver : Well, yeah. I’d agree with that too.  micah : Yeah, that was my next question.  harry : So I pulled some data from the 2016 American National Election Studies and the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Elections Study. According to the former, Republicans won the House vote among people who voted for a third-party presidential candidate by 22 percentage points. The House vote was basically a tie among people who voted for Clinton or Trump. According to the latter, voters who cast a ballot for a third-party presidential candidate were 8 points more likely to identify as Republicans than Democrats. Among Clinton or Trump voters, they were 8 points more likely to identify as Democrats than Republicans.  My point being that in 2016, Clinton was probably helped overall by third-party candidates, not Trump.  natesilver : One of the likelier scenarios — not likely, exactly, but not impossible to imagine, either — is a split within the Republican Party.  clare.malone : #Romney  micah : That seems more likely to me than a split in the Democratic coalition, right?  clare.malone : #Romneyexmachina  (I’m kidding, folks. Don’t send me email.)  natesilver : You could imagine the left wing of the Democratic Party nominating its own candidate.  clare.malone : See, that’s interesting.  natesilver : I tend to think the Democratic Party’s nominee will be quite left wing, but we’ll see.  clare.malone : The people who were Bernie Sanders diehards might be underestimated when it comes to splintering off. I think the Democratic chaos is actually pretty deep-seated .  natesilver : But Republicans have the bigger dilemma. Relations between Trump and the Republican Congress are already fraying .  Who wins if the tickets are: Bernie Sanders (Green), Kamala Harris (Democratic), Donald Trump (independent), Mike Pence (Republican).  💥  clare.malone : Pence. ( Shameless plug .)  Harris and Sanders are both popular in their own right, which would split the left vote; Pence is more likely to attract a swath of Republicans that encompass mainstream voters on that side and those on the far right.  micah : It depends.  natesilver : The answer, if I had to guess, is that Harris would win the popular vote with a plurality, and Pence would win the election in the House.  micah : I think Pence wins? I imagine that without the gravity of partisanship, Trump is a pretty weak candidate.  natesilver : In that scenario, I actually wonder whether one of Sanders or Harris eventually drops out, though. Because a three-way race between Trump, an establishment Republican and a generic Democrat is a very, very good scenario for the Democrat.  micah : You can’t change the scenario!  natesilver : I made the scenario, and I shall change it as I want.  micah : Anyway, this whole thing about third-party candidates doesn’t belong in an argument that Trump is on track to win in 2020. Can everyone at least concede that?  clare.malone : I concede that.  harry : I agree with that.  clare.malone : I bet Nate won’t.  micah : CONTRARIAN NATE! Wait for it …  natesilver : I concede.  micah : 🍾🍾  clare.malone : HE JUST DID IT ‘CAUSE I SAID HE WOULDN’T.  micah : Reverse psychology!  natesilver : I concede NOTHING.  harry : Folks, a parade was just thrown in the office.  micah : OK, next point:  Third, despite dismal poll numbers, Trump enters the contest with a job approval rating that is certainly at least marginally better than what the current national polls would suggest.  natesilver : If he’s talking about comparing polls of registered or likely voters to polls of adults, that’s a vaild point.  micah : That, and also that Trump’s national numbers underestimate his strength in battleground states.  harry : Well, we already spoke a little about the battleground states. That’s true … for now.  It’s also true that he’s doing better among voters than among all adults. We track that .  natesilver : Unregistered voters — who show up in polls of adults but not registered voter or likely voter polls — are largely not a Trump-leaning group. So when they drop out of the sample, things get a bit better for him.  harry : The bigger question is what does a 40 percent approval rating among voters — as Trump has now — mean in terms of a vote.  natesilver : Meh, I don’t think that’s such an interesting question.  harry : OH, I think it’s a very important question.  natesilver : Wrong.  harry : It’s the question, perhaps.  natesilver : Wrong.  clare.malone : This is getting to be unreadable.  harry : A lot of people have argued that Trump won the presidency despite poor favorable ratings and that therefore his piss-poor approval ratings don’t mean squat.  I think that’s wrong, but the question is how wrong.  So here’s something I did. I went back to Franklin Roosevelt and took Gallup’s final estimate of an incumbent president’s approval rating (or Nate’s calculation of that ) and ran it against the margin that the incumbent president won or lost by.  natesilver : I think you’re probably making a mistake to conflate approval ratings and favorability ratings . Once you’ve been on the job for four years, voters aren’t liable to vote for you if they think you’re doing a shitty job. Conversely, they might vote for you even if they don’t like you, if you’re not an incumbent and they think they can “take a chance.”  harry : I’m not disagreeing with you, Nathaniel.  micah : 💤  clare.malone : With you, Micah.  natesilver : I think you’re confusing two things, though. What would Trump’s chances be of being re-elected today , Harry?  micah : [Editor’s note: Harry is yelling at us via verbal slack.]  harry : But what’s interesting to me is that when you run my calculation, you get Trump losing by a little over 3 percentage points with an approval rating of 40 percent. That’s not much different from what he lost by in 2016. It also comes with a large enough margin of error to be quite uncertain. I have NO idea what Trump’s approval rating will be on Election Day 2020. I have no clue if it will be up or down. I’m just saying that a president with an approval rating of 40 percent among voters is not doomed. He’s not in a great position, but it’s not awful.  micah : 💤  j/k … I agree with Harry — this is an important question: Trump won, in no small part, because a lot of people who didn’t like him still voted for him . To what extent that will hold true in future election is important.  harry : I’m so sorry I tried to inform our audience. Maybe I should just go home.  micah : Last point:  Fourth, Trump’s support has largely remained durable with a core group of supporters.  Go ahead, Nate.  This is one of your hobby horses.  natesilver : #actually  harry : I hate all of us.  natesilver : This is a myth — Trump’s strong approval rating has actually fallen quite a bit .  harry : I agree.  Great chat, folks.  LOL  natesilver : There’s also evidence that his support has fallen some even among rural, working-class voters:     Now — it is true that some of those voters — maybe most of them — might come back to Trump when he has a Democratic opponent.  clare.malone : That’s what I think is the case.  harry : This actually ties in with the point earlier about third-party candidates. There are a number of folks who will not vote Democratic but would be willing to vote for a conservative third-party candidate.  micah : But we’re also talking about the Obama-Trump voters .  Or our reluctant Trump voters .  Trump can’t win with only his diehards.  And I don’t think the Democratic nominee will necessarily be a non-starter for those more marginal Trump voters.  clare.malone : Roger that. Who cares about his base, on some level.  micah : Well, electorally, yes.  OK, to wrap …  This argument that Trump is on track to win re-election basically boils down to:   Trump doesn’t need to win the popular vote.  A third-party candidate could come out of left field and help him.  Trump’s not as unpopular as you think.  Trump’s base support is inviolate.   No. 4 is wrong. No. 2 could happen, but it’s not particularly likely or more likely than a third-party candidate hurting Trump. Nos. 1 and 3 are true, but … I guess what I’d say is that if your argument is “it’s not that bad,” doesn’t that suggest it’s still pretty bad? A disadvantage not being fatal doesn’t make it an advantage.  I’d 100 percent sign on to an argument along the lines of “Trump could still very much win in 2020” or “Democrats are by no means guaranteed a win in 2020” or “it’s easy to overrate how much trouble Trump is in.”  harry : I don’t think Trump is on track to win re-election. It’s not good.  clare.malone : Yeah, I think the headline of the piece really oversold it, but that’s not the author’s fault per se.  natesilver : I think there’s a much better argument for why Trump is a favorite: Trump is an incumbent, incumbents usually win, and even though he’s unpopular now, there’s a long way to go and his approval ratings now don’t predict much about what they’ll be in 2020.  micah : That last part is true?  harry : Agree with that latter part, and approval ratings tend to revert to the mean in the long run.  natesilver : Like if you called a “snap” election in five weeks between Trump and Joe Biden, I’m pretty sure that Biden would win. Trump vs. Biden in 2020 is a different story (maybe).  micah : OK, so to end … Trump vs. the field … who you got?  clare.malone : I think THE ROCK is just going to be my standard answer every time this question is hurled at us in chats.  But to answer that more seriously … I think I take the field.  natesilver : Well, to come full circle here … I’m not sure how likely Trump is to finish his term and be the GOP nominee again. Conditional on doing so, he might be, say, a very slight (51 percent? 55 percent? 60 percent?) favorite to win re-election. But the times when Trump is in real trouble, he probably doesn’t run or even loses the GOP nomination.  harry : I’ll take the field.  micah : The Rock vs. the field?  clare.malone : THE ROCK!

Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter       Politics    Sports    Science & Health    Economics    Culture    ESPN    Politics Podcast: FBI Raids Trump’s Lawyer’s Office             Will Donald Trump Be Impeached?     By Nate Silver  Filed under Impeachment  Published May 22, 2017     Facebook Twitter Email                 Getty images     A fter a cacophonous two weeks of political news, a new sound has begun to emerge from Washington: the word “impeachment.” Following the news that President Trump may have tried to bully FBI director James Comey out of investigating Michael Flynn’s ties to Russia, Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent, told CNN that recent allegations, if true, are already making impeachment hearings more likely. Rep. Al Green, a Democrat from Texas, became the first congressman to call for Trump’s impeachment from the House floor. And even some Republicans in blue-leaning districts, such as Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, have begun to entertain impeachment as a possibility.  This might all seem like a liberal fantasy: No president has ever been booted out of the job, and only Richard Nixon resigned under the pressure of the impeachment process.  But people putting money on the line are taking impeachment seriously. According to the prediction market Betfair, the chance that Trump will fail to serve out his four-year term is about 50 percent (!). There’s even a 20 to 25 percent probability (!!) that Trump doesn’t finish out 2017 in office, these bettors reckon.  Are those numbers within the realm of reason? It isn’t easy to forecast Trump’s odds of impeachment, or of his removal from office. There isn’t enough data to build a statistical model of it, in the way we would for an election. But we can say that there are two opposite forces tugging strongly on the impeachment rope:   On the one side, there’s Trump’s escalating pattern of (alleged) misconduct, which increasingly reflects behavior that has been used as grounds for impeachment in the past.  On the other side, there’s the intense partisan loyalty of Republicans , both among GOP members of Congress and among voters in the states and districts they represent.   So long as these sides are pulling with roughly equal force, Trump isn’t going to be removed from office, which would require a two-thirds majority in the Senate. But if something snaps — if Republicans have reason to think Trump has become a liability even in red states — look out. History suggests Trump could be vulnerable under such circumstances, despite the historical rarity of impeachment. Here’s how to think about the chances.   I f Trump left office early, he of course wouldn’t be the first president to do so. There are various ways a president’s term can end prematurely. But some of the possibilities apart from impeachment are fairly remote.  Eight presidents died during their terms. While that possibility can’t be ruled out for Trump, the odds of it are relatively low. Actuarial tables show that a 70-year-old American man (Trump’s age) has only about a 10 percent chance of dying over his next four years. 1      YEAR  PRESIDENT  TERM  TIME OF TERM SERVED  REASON      1841  Harrison  1st  31 days  Natural death    1850  Taylor  1st  1 year, 4 months  Natural death*    1865  Lincoln  2nd  42 days  Assassination    1881  Garfield  1st  7 months  Assassination    1901  McKinley  2nd  6 months  Assassination    1923  Harding  1st  2 years, 5 months  Natural death    1945  Roosevelt  4th  3 months  Natural death    1963  Kennedy  1st  2 years, 10 months  Assassination    1974  Nixon  2nd  1 year, 7 months  Resignation    Which presidents failed to serve out their terms?    * Although a handful of scholars contend that Taylor was poisoned, this is not the consensus view.  Source: historyinpieces.com    Trump could also quit the job for reasons other than the pressure of impeachment — deciding he wanted to spend more time at Mar-a-Lago, for instance. But American elected officials have generally held onto their jobs even when things are going pretty badly . Among U.S. governors since 2000, for example, I could find only one case — Alaska’s Sarah Palin in 2009 — of someone who resigned her position early without being in the midst of a major scandal or having another political job (such as an ambassadorship or Cabinet position) already lined up. 2      YEAR  STATE  GOVERNOR  REASON      2000  Missouri  Mel Carnahan  Died in office    2000  Texas  George W.

Source: Wikipedia    There’s also the prospect of Section 4 of the 25th Amendment being invoked against Trump, which would make Vice President Pence the acting president if Trump were “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” But this isn’t the shortcut that it might seem . Under the 25th Amendment, Trump could be replaced on an interim basis if both Pence and a majority of Cabinet officers agreed that he were unfit for office. But if Trump disputed the finding, it would require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of Congress to keep Trump from returning to the Oval Office. 3  So let’s talk about impeachment. Although if we’re being more precise, impeachment doesn’t remove a president from office; conviction on impeachment charges does. Just to be clear about our terminology:   Impeachment is the sole authority of the House of Representatives and requires a simple majority vote. Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached by the House.  The Senate then holds an impeachment trial and essentially acts as the jury, voting on whether or not to convict the president and remove him from office ; it takes a two-thirds majority (67 of 100 votes) to do so. Neither Johnson nor Clinton was convicted by the Senate, although it came down to one vote in Johnson’s case. The Senate can also vote to bar an impeached president from holding office again.   Although no president has been removed from office, Nixon resigned under the threat of removal, and he probably would have been removed in the absence of his resignation. 4 So he should probably count as a “victim” of the impeachment process.  Even so, that’s only 1 of 44 previous presidencies — and 1 of 57 previous presidential terms — to end in the president’s termination. Therefore, you might think the chance of Trump being removed from office is very low. But it’s not that simple.  The issue is that among the 44 prior presidents, not all that many were plausible candidates for impeachment and removal; there was never any real basis to impeach Dwight Eisenhower, for instance. Instead, the relevant question is how many presidents were removed from office (or compelled to resign) out of the share of presidents who engaged in behavior comparable to Trump’s . If only Trump and Nixon had reached a certain level of “impeachability,” for instance, then the empirical evidence wouldn’t be comforting for Trump; rather, it would suggest that the only president who previously reached that threshold of malfeasance had lost his job.     Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached by the House.  Getty Images    To provide evidence against Trump being removed, the data would instead have to contain examples of presidents who could have been removed from office, but weren’t. For instance, it might be relevant that there were never serious efforts to impeach Ronald Reagan for the Iran-Contra scandal. In fact, the Democratic leadership in Congress went somewhat out of their way to avoid actions that could lead to impeachment proceedings against Reagan. Why was that, exactly? One could come up with a variety of plausible theories: that the scandal wasn’t severe enough; that Reagan wasn’t personally involved enough; that Reagan’s popularity insulated him from impeachment; that Reagan enjoyed good relations with Congress at a period of relatively low partisanship, and so forth.  In a perfect world, we’d have data on hundreds of presidents, a few dozen of whom had been impeached. That would let us statistically identify the various factors that made a president more or less likely to survive the process. In the real world, the best we can do is make some educated guesses. Based on the precedents we have available — and our overall knowledge of the American political system — I would expect the following factors to be important in determining a president’s likelihood of removal or resignation:      The seriousness of the alleged offenses . Does the president’s behavior fall under the constitutional category of “high crimes and misdemeanors?” Have similar behaviors been the basis for impeachment proceedings in the past?  The partisanship of pivotal votes in Congress . How much partisanship is there in Congress? Other things held equal, how likely is the decisive 67th senator to vote to remove a president from his own party?  The president’s popularity . What are the president’s approval ratings? Does the public think he should be impeached? Has there been a “mandate” delivered by midterm elections or special elections? What do his numbers look like in states and congressional districts where members of Congress are on the fence about how to vote?  The president’s relationship with Congress. Does the president generally have good relations with congressional leadership? Is his party’s legislative agenda intact? Does Congress feel as though the balance of power has been upset? Is the president cooperating with investigations into his conduct, or antagonizing Congress instead?  Party control of Congress . Which party controls the House and — less importantly for impeachment purposes — the Senate?  The line of succession. Who would take over for the president? Do leaders of the president’s party regard the replacement as an acceptable — or even preferable — alternative to the president?     Let’s consider each of these factors in Trump’s case.     Factor 1  The seriousness of the alleged offenses     Nixon resigned under the threat of removal — and he probably would have been removed in the absence of his resignation.  getty images    I n 1970, Gerald Ford (then a U.S. representative, and later the president) said rather cynically that “an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers [it] to be at a given moment in history.” While impeachment is undeniably a political process rather than a legal one, Ford’s interpretation is probably too reductionist. Congress has historically used its powers somewhat judiciously and drawn fairly fine distinctions between different grounds for impeachment.  In 1974 , for instance, the House Judiciary Committee recommended impeachment for Nixon on three charges — obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress. But it overwhelmingly rejected recommending impeachment on two other charges related to Nixon’s bombing of Cambodia and his failure to pay taxes . Similarly, in 1998, the House impeached Clinton on two charges — perjury and obstruction of justice — but it rejected an abuse of power charge by a 148–285 margin.  It’s perhaps also noteworthy that neither George W. Bush nor Barack Obama was subjected to serious attempts at impeachment despite facing highly partisan opposition in Congress. They might have done lots of things their adversaries disliked, but nothing that House Speakers Nancy Pelosi, John Boehner and Paul Ryan were willing to call a firing offense.  That’s not to say the correlation between the inherent “impeachability” of the president’s conduct and Congress’s likelihood of action has been perfect, by any means. Congress may exaggerate or underplay the severity of charges for partisan reasons — many scholars argue that Clinton and Johnson’s impeachments were overreaches of congressional power, for instance. But the underlying facts of the case have mattered to some extent.     Neither George W. Bush nor Barack Obama was subjected to serious attempts at impeachment despite facing highly partisan opposition in Congress.  Getty images    So what does that mean for Trump? The Constitution provides that, “The president, vice president and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” While liberals and anti-Trump Republicans have sometimes accused Trump of “treason” for his dealings with Russia, he almost certainly hasn’t committed treason by the letter of the Constitution . 5  The good news for Trump ends there, however. While the term “high crimes and misdemeanors” might seem hopelessly vague, it has a fair amount of legal history and is generally regarded as referring to political crimes (“crimes against the state”) as opposed to personal affairs. A drunk driving conviction might not qualify as a “high crime,” for instance. But an action that wasn’t illegal per se but reflected an abuse of the president’s office could count as one. That Trump almost certainly did not commit a criminal offense in reportedly disclosing highly classified information to Russia would not necessarily protect him from an impeachment charge on those grounds, for example.  But the bigger problem for Trump is probably Comey, in that firing him might have constituted obstruction of justice . Obstruction of justice is about the last accusation that a president wants on his radar if he fears impeachment; it was one of the two charges that the House used to impeach Clinton and one of the three charges that the House Judiciary Committee recommended against Nixon.  One more thing to keep in mind: The Trump presidency is only four months old. Congress has yet not done all that much to investigate his affairs, and special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Trump’s ties to Russia was just announced last week — and yet Trump has already gotten himself in quite a lot of trouble. What might seem like tenuous reasons for impeachment now could could turn out to be just the tip of the iceberg.  The bottom line: If Congress is looking for reasons to impeach Trump, it already has some plausible ones — and it will probably wind up with more before long. This factor substantially contributes to the likelihood of Trump being removed from office.    Factor 2 The partisanship of pivotal votes in Congress     President Trump talks with Republican Rep. Peter King of New York after addressing a joint session of Congress in February.  Getty images    C ongress is at a high tide in terms of both partisan polarization and ideological division. FiveThirtyEight’s Trump Score shows that in the House, the average Republican has sided with Trump 97 percent of the time on votes on which the White House has articulated a position; the average Democrat has done so only 15 percent of the time. (The discrepancy has been nearly as wide in the Senate .) And according to the statistical system DW-Nominate , the ideological gap between the parties has continued to widen; Democrats have gotten more liberal and ( to an even greater extent ) Republicans have gotten more conservative.  While measures such as DW-Nominate and our Trump Score have their imperfections, 6 my colleagues Julia Azari, Perry Bacon Jr. and Harry Enten found that they historically provided a pretty good guide to impeachment voting patterns. In other words, it’s reasonable to infer that because Congress is highly polarized on almost every other issue, it probably also would be polarized on impeachment and removal votes. This would seem to have three major consequences for Trump:   It makes impeachment less likely in the near term, because Republicans control the House.  It makes impeachment (but not Trump’s removal from office) more likely if Democrats take over the House in 2019. Partisanship might compel Democrats to impeach Trump even if the political or legal rationale for doing so is dubious.  Most importantly, it makes Trump’s removal from office much less likely, other factors held equal. Even if all 48 Senate Democrats 7 voted to remove Trump, they’d also need support from 19 Republicans to get to a two-thirds majority. That would require dipping far into the Republican ranks — well past the few moderates in the Senate — and the decisive 67th vote would have to come from a fairly conservative Republican like Missouri’s Roy Blunt or South Dakota’s John Thune instead. This isn’t going to change much in 2019, even if Democrats have a great midterm election.   At the same time, we shouldn’t conclude that partisanship provides Trump with absolute protection against removal from office. As an empirical matter, we don’t have much data on what factor would win out if the case for impeachment were very strong (say, if Mueller uncovered that Trump had accepted bribes from Russia) but partisanship were also very high.  There’s also some question as to where partisanship might lead congressional Republicans if they conclude that a Trump presidency isn’t in the best interests of the GOP. Trump hasn’t been a Republican for all that long , and it isn’t clear how invested he is in the Republican agenda or how competent he is to execute it. Republicans have a poor track record of standing up to Trump , but during the election campaign, the alternative was either to invite chaos (since Marco Rubio and other candidates weren’t clicking with voters ) or to elect Hillary Clinton. Now their alternative is Pence — or Ryan if Pence were also impeached. A lot of Republican members of Congress might view Pence or Ryan as an upgrade on Trump.  The bottom line: Partisanship is the biggest protection that Trump has against impeachment. If you see Republicans start to break with Trump in more substantive ways, such as by launching special committees or holding up his replacement for Comey, he might have more reason for concern. But overall this factor substantially reduces the likelihood of Trump being removed from office.    Factor 3 The president’s popularity     Patrons at a bar watching the Iran-Contra hearings. Reagan had an approval rating of around 50 percent even after the Iran-Contra scandal was revealed. Democratic efforts to impeach him could easily have wound up backfiring.  Getty images    M embers of Congress are loyal to their president, but there’s one thing they usually care about even more: their own re-election. Presidential popularity has a strong influence on congressional races . Beyond a certain point, a president can become toxic enough that it’s in the interest of members of his own party to abandon him. Nixon, for instance, had an approval rating in the mid-20s at the time of his resignation in 1974. Republicans endured a 48-seat loss in the House even after he resigned. But they might have taken an even worse loss if he’d stayed in office. Based on my colleague Harry Enten’s formula , Republicans would have expected to lose around 60 seats if Nixon were still president, given his approval rating.  By contrast, Reagan had an approval rating of around 50 percent even after the Iran-Contra scandal was revealed. Democratic efforts to impeach him could easily have wound up backfiring. Twelve years later, Republicans learned this the hard way, losing House seats in the 1998 midterms 8 in the midst of their attempt to impeach Clinton, whose approval rating exceeded 60 percent.  Trump’s popularity is in a somewhat awkward middle ground. With an approval rating of about 39 percent , he’s no Clinton or Reagan. But he isn’t late-stage Nixon, either. Trump is not very popular, but he was never all that popular to begin with and won the Electoral College despite it. It’s not clear that all that many voters have regrets about their decision to vote for Trump, at least not yet. And few polls have asked voters whether they think Trump should be impeached.  At the same time, the idea that 39 or 40 percent of the country will never abandon Trump is probably mistaken — or at least, it represents a speculative interpretation of the evidence. The share of voters who say they strongly support Trump is only 20 to 25 percent — and those numbers have been falling . Moreover, Trump has lost about one point off his overall approval rating per month. That might not sound like a lot, but if the pattern continued, he’d be in the low-to-mid 30s by the new year and into Nixonian territory by the midterms.  There are a couple of further complications. One issue is that while Trump is fairly unpopular overall, his numbers are holding up better in red states — and red-state senators represent the pivotal votes for Trump’s removal from office. The table below reflects my estimate of Trump’s current approval rating in each state based on recent state-by-state approval-rating polls and the 2016 and 2012 election results.       STATE  APPROVAL RATING  DISAPPROVAL RATING    STATE  APPROVAL RATING  DISAPPROVAL RATING      1  Hawaii  26%  68%   26  Arizona  42%  52%    2  Vermont  28  66   27  Ohio  42  52    3  Calif.  28  66   28  Iowa  42  52    4  Maryland  29  65   29  Georgia  42  51    5  Mass.  29  65   30  Texas  44  49    6  N.Y.  30  64   31  S.C.  45  48    7  R.I.  32  61   32  Alaska  46  48    8  Illinois  33  61   33  Mississippi  46  47    9  Washington  34  60   34  Missouri  47  47    10  N.J.  34  60   35  Indiana  47  47    11  Conn.  34  60   36  Montana  48  46    12  Delaware  35  59   37  Louisiana  48  46    13  Oregon  35  58   38  Kansas  48  45    14  N.M.  36  57   39  Nebraska  50  44    15  Maine  37  56   40  Tennessee  50  44    16  Colorado  38  56   41  Utah  50  43    17  Virginia  38  56   42  Arkansas  50  43    18  Nevada  39  55   43  Alabama  51  43    19  Minnesota  39  55   44  S.D.  51  43    20  Michigan  39  55   45  Kentucky  51  42    21  N.H.  39  55   46  N.D.  53  41    22  Wisconsin  39  54   47  Idaho  53  41    23  Penn.  40  54   48  Oklahoma  54  39    24  Florida  40  54   49  W.Va.  55  38    25  N.C.  41  53   50  Wyoming  58  35    Estimating approval and disapproval of Trump by state    These estimates are based on a regression analysis, where the independent variable is the Republican margin of victory or defeat in the 2016 and 2012 presidential elections, weighted 3:1 in favor of 2016. The dependent variable is Trump’s approval rating (or disapproval rating) in each state, based on state-by-state approval rating polls conducted within the past two months (since March 20), as listed at PollingReport.com and Wikipedia. State-by-state estimates are calibrated such that Trump’s overall numbers, weighted by the number of voters in each state, are a 39 percent approval rating and a 55 percent disapproval rating, matching his national approval and disapproval ratings as of Saturday morning.    If voting in the Senate strictly abided by Trump’s popularity, the 67th vote to remove Trump from office would come from Missouri. (Two-thirds of states are bluer than Missouri and one-third are redder.) But in Missouri, I estimate, Trump’s numbers are roughly breakeven, with about 47 percent of Missourians approving of his performance and 47 percent opposed. I wouldn’t expect Missouri’s senators, Blunt and Democrat Claire McCaskill, to be eager to kick Trump out of office under those circumstances.  Another issue is that it might be a leap of faith for Republicans to impeach Trump on the basis of polling data, given that trust in polls is relatively low right now. I have some … complicated feelings about this . The mainstream media screwed up its interpretation of polls throughout 2016 , misreporting surveys that showed a close and competitive Electoral College race as indicating surefire Clinton victory. At the same time, polls have a real-world margin of error that exceeds their purported margin of error , and Trump’s numbers are slightly better among people who vote than they are among the country overall. Congress could wait for unambiguous evidence that the public had turned on Trump, whether in the form of very poor polling numbers (say, approval ratings in the low 30s) or inexcusable election results (such as in the upcoming special elections in Montana and Georgia, or in a big Republican loss at the midterms). Until we see one or both of those things, I wouldn’t expect Trump to be under that much pressure of impeachment.  The bottom line: For the time being, this factor contributes only modestly to the likelihood of Trump being removed from office. Trump is unpopular, but his numbers are not unsalvageable (several presidents have come back from similar ratings to win a second term). A further deterioration in his popularity would imply that he is unpopular even in red states, however, and would greatly increase the risk to Trump.    Factor 4 The president’s relationship with Congress     The House impeachment committee that tried President Andrew Johnson after he removed Edwin Stanton from office.  Getty images    T his is not a factor that I’d thought a lot about originally. But when you review the scholarship on impeachment and consider the historical evidence, its importance becomes obvious. Impeachment cases have usually involved an element of conflict between the president and the legislative branch.  This is most obvious in the case of Johnson, whose impeachment was the result of a plain-old turf war with Congress. In 1867, Congress had passed something called the Tenure of Office Act , which was supposed to prevent the president from firing Cabinet officers without the Senate’s consent. Johnson fired Secretary of War Edwin Stanton anyway in a direct challenge to the act’s legitimacy. The House impeached him as a result. The Tenure of Office Act was later repealed — and in 1926, posthumously declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court — but it had invited a confrontation with Johnson, and he had obliged.  Contempt of Congress was also one of the articles of impeachment that the House Judiciary Committee recommended against Nixon after he failed to cooperate with congressional subpoenas during the Watergate investigation. And pissing matches between the president and Congress have been the basis of some near-misses in the impeachment process; there were some fairly serious attempts to impeach John Tyler over his use of presidential vetoes, for example.  For the time being, Trump has a cordial relationship with Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (Though that hasn’t always been the case .) The GOP still has hopes of passing major legislation, including health care and tax-reform bills, and that requires cooperation between the White House and Congress. But one can imagine Trump doing various things to antagonize Congress, from Twitter rants against congressional leadership to refusing to comply with the requests of congressional investigators. Firing Comey — who was confirmed 93-1 by the Senate in 2013 — may also have been a risky move in this respect. From Johnson to Harry Truman — who drew calls for impeachment after dismissing General Douglas MacArthur in 1951 — high-profile firings have sometimes prompted members of Congress to ask for the president’s head.  The bottom line: For the time being, this factor doesn’t contribute much to the likelihood of Trump being removed from office. But Trump’s history of escalating conflict and failing to respect boundaries could antagonize Congress and contribute to the likelihood of impeachment in the future, especially if the GOP’s agenda is in disrepair. History suggests that Congress takes that stuff personally, and it probably should, since the impeachment process is part of the Constitution’s system of checks and balances.    Factor 5 Party control of Congress     Impeachment proceedings against Johnson, Nixon and Clinton all took place when the opposition party controlled the House. Carl Albert (above) was the speaker of the House while the Watergate scandal was unfolding.  getty images    I mpeachment proceedings against Johnson, Nixon and Clinton all took place when the opposition party controlled the House. But is it something close to an ironclad rule that a president won’t be impeached when his party runs the House, or just a statistical pattern from a small sample of data?  Imagine, for example, that by this point next year, almost all Democrats in the House want to impeach Trump, and so do about three dozen Republicans — enough to constitute an overall majority. But Republicans are still in charge of the House, and Ryan and other members of the leadership are firmly opposed to an impeachment vote. Moreover, the House Judiciary Committee — which has traditionally run point on the impeachment process — is opposed. 9 Would the pro-impeachment members have any basis to force Ryan’s hand?  The short answer is … maybe, but Ryan and company could make their task a lot harder. I asked Sarah Binder , a professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, about what might happen if a narrow majority of Congress wanted to impeach Trump but the Republican leadership didn’t.  “This is one of those cases where we can outline a set of procedural steps to an impeachment vote, and yet have a hard time actually seeing this happen,” Binder said in an email. Possible routes could include members of Congress raising questions of privilege or filing a discharge petition . “But the key is whether the cross-party impeachment majority would really stick together” through numerous procedural votes and barriers thrown up by Ryan, she said. “I think that’s a very steep hurdle.”  One might raise a sophisticated objection here: Sure, control of the House could matter if there were only a narrow majority in favor of impeachment. But what if there were a large majority instead — enough that Trump was not only under threat of impeachment but also removal by a two-thirds vote in the Senate? Could Ryan & Co. really resist that kind of pressure?  We’re deep into speculative territory, but it’s worth remembering that legislative voting tactics are complicated. Members of a party tend to stick together, until the wheels come off — and even then the wagon sometimes gets repaired again. Consider, for instance, how the Republicans’ health care bill was initially presumed to be almost certain to pass the House, then was pulled from the floor in March , and then was passed this month as both moderates and the conservative Freedom Caucus returned to the fold.  It’s plausible, in other words, that Ryan and the House Judiciary Committee could keep the impeachment genie in the bottle, even if impeachment would prevail by a fairly clear majority if a vote came to the floor and members were left to their own devices.  Control of the Senate is less important, insofar as the Senate would have to try the impeachment charges whether or not they wanted to. And per the Constitution, the trial would be overseen by Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts rather than by the Senate leadership.  The bottom line: A Democratic takeover of the House — perhaps an even-money proposition — is not quite a prerequisite for Trump’s impeachment and removal, but it would greatly increase the odds. It would also give the Democrats far greater powers to investigate Trump and to subpoena key materials, which could create additional bases for impeachment charges.    Factor 6 The line of succession     Pence in next in line. Then comes Ryan.  Getty images    I n 1868, Republicans in Congress had the power to replace Andrew Johnson, a Democrat who had run with Abraham Lincoln on the National Union ticket, with a Republican president. And there was absolutely nothing Democrats could do about it.  The circumstances were unusual . Johnson had ascended to the presidency after Lincoln’s assassination, and the vice presidency was vacant. Instead, the line of succession 10  would have given the presidency to the Republican Benjamin Wade , the president pro tempore of the Senate. Republicans had an overwhelming majority in the Senate in the midst of Reconstruction, so they didn’t need any Democratic votes to convict Johnson and replace him with Wade.  Republicans didn’t quite do it; instead the vote was 35-19 in favor of conviction, one short of the number needed. But the prospect of a Wade presidency was an influential factor in determining senators’ votes , encouraging Radical Republicans to vote to convict Johnson (since Wade was a fellow Radical) but discouraging moderates from doing so.  While Johnson may have been an extreme case, it’s reasonable to assume that the identity of the president’s successor is a factor in the impeachment calculus. Pence is more conservative than Trump and was widely praised by GOP leaders at the time he became Trump’s running mate; he’s also a more predictable politician than Trump and formerly held a leadership position in the Republican-led House. He also has decent favorability ratings , at least for the time being. In short, Republicans have some reasons to prefer Pence to Trump, which could make removing Trump more palatable. (Of course, that’s assuming that Pence isn’t implicated in any sort of scandal himself .)  The bottom line: If the theory is that you shouldn’t hire a well-qualified understudy because he makes your job more vulnerable, then Trump made a mistake in picking Pence as his running mate. Pence isn’t popular with everyone, but he’s likely to be broadly acceptable to Republicans in the House and Senate, and they’re the ones with impeachment votes. Articles like this one , in which Republicans begin to “whisper” about the probability of a President Pence, should be seen as a bearish indicator for Trump.     Trump’s firing of Comey might have constituted obstruction of justice, one of the two charges that the House used to impeach Clinton and one of the three charges that the House Judiciary Committee recommended against Nixon.  getty images     A ll that work … and I’m still not going to give you a precise number for how likely Trump is to lose his job. That’s because this is a thought experiment and not a mathematical model 11 . I do think I owe you a range, however. I’m pretty sure I’d sell Trump-leaves-office-early stock (whether because of removal from office or other reasons) at even money (50 percent), and I’m pretty sure I’d buy it at 3-to-1 against (25 percent). I could be convinced by almost any number within that range.  The easiest-to-imagine scenario for Trump being removed is if Republicans get clobbered in the midterms after two years of trying to defend Trump, the Republican agenda is in shambles, Democrats begin impeachment proceedings in early 2019, and just enough Republicans decide that Pence (or some fresh face with no ties to the Trump White House) gives them a better shot to avoid total annihilation in 2020.  In some sense, then, the most important indicators of Trump’s impeachment odds are the ones you’d always use to monitor the political environment: presidential approval ratings , the generic congressional ballot and (if taken with appropriate grains of salt) special election results . What makes this time a little different is that if Republicans think the ship is sinking, impeachment may give them an opportunity to throw their president overboard first.  CLARIFICATION (May 22, 1:33 p.m.): A previous version of this article described imprecisely Rep. Angus King’s comments about Trump’s impeachment prospects. The paragraph has been updated.     Footnotes   You’d also need to account for some possibility of an unnatural death — by assassination or in a terrorist attack, for instance.  Palin had a minor scandal brewing surrounding the dismissal of Alaska’s public safety commissioner. But it reportedly wasn’t the direct cause of her decision to leave office.  And even if Congress got that supermajority, it wouldn’t technically remove Trump from office: Pence would still be serving as acting president rather than president. For this reason, it’s not clear whether the various betting markets would classify the invocation of the 25th Amendment as Trump having left office prematurely. If you’re inclined to put money down on these things, it’s probably a good idea to check the fine print of the contract.  On July 29, 1974, 28 out of 38 members (74 percent) of the House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach Nixon on abuse of power charges, suggesting that a large majority of the overall House would also have done so. And Nixon’s tenuous chances of avoiding conviction from the Senate were undermined by the release of the “smoking gun” tape on August 5, which proved that Nixon had sought to cover up the Watergate break-in. Facing a further collapse in his support, Nixon resigned four days later.  The reason is simple: A treason charge requires that the U.S. be at war with a country (or a non-state entity such as al-Qaida) and the U.S. is not at war with Russia.  They don’t capture behavior on bills that never make it to the floor because they face congressional opposition, for instance.  Including the two independent senators who caucus with the Democrats.  This was one of only two occasions since 1938 when the opposition party failed to gain House seats at the midterms; the other was in 2002, when Republicans gained seats as Bush’s popularity soared after the Sept. 11 attacks.  The Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are a very conservative bunch.  The line of succession has since changed to put the speaker of the House ahead of the president of the Senate  And I’ve gotten burned before on the whole “subjective odds” thing .

Eduardo Munoz Alvarez—AFP/Getty Images        By Lucinda Shen  November 9, 2016       How much could you have made had you bet that the political outsider Donald Trump would have taken the White House?  Many, including professional gambler Paul Krishnamurty, lost after Trump’s upset Tuesday night. Krishnamurty said he lost about $15,000 on online betting site, Betfair.  He, like political pollsters and many of his fellow professional gamblers, expected Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to take the White House as election results were reported last night.  “I was supremely confident. I though she was going to win by a landslide. When the results were first coming in, I was extremely confident,” he told Fortune . Krishnamurty is also an analyst at Betfair and runs the blog, the Political Gambler . “[Trump’s win] was 1,000 time less likely than Brexit. I was arguing that Trump had no chance.”      But the tables turned at 9:30 p.m. EST Tuesday, as Georgia announced that its electoral votes had gone to Trump, and more and more swing states sided with the GOP candidate.  Yet one Betfair gambler was confident in a Trump victory, with a future that had been widely considered “delusional ” and improbable . He was the biggest winner over the presidential elections, collecting $2.5 million through the course of the campaign, according to U.K.-based Betfair. The customer made several bets as the odds of a Trump presidency continued to shift with polls and events. The customer, who wished to remain anonymous, made his or her first bet following the Iowa caucuses in February.  The odds of a Trump win closed from around 25 to 1 in August 2015 when he first announced his campaign, or a return 25 times the initial investment, according to Krishnamurty, down to 6 to 4 ahead of the first presidential debate, and 5 to 1 on Tuesday night.    Among online betters, Trump was considered highly unlikely to become president, according to Betfair. Roughly 40% of cash staked on the elections fell in favor of a Clinton win, and most polls leading up to election night on Tuesday ruled in Clinton’s favor.  And what if gamblers had decided to bet on Trump winning particular states? After all, the now president elect managed, against all odds, to break through the “blue wall,” claiming both Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.  According to Ladbrokes’ Shaddick, customers likely won the most by betting that Pennsylvania would be claimed by Trump. It would likely result in a few thousand dollars at most, he said, since those bets tend to be risker, leading individuals to bet less.          Individuals who bet on Trump taking Pennsylvania last night would have earned four times their initial investment, Shaddick said .  Similarly, those who bet that Michigan or Wisconsin would go to Trump last night would’ve also earned four times their initial stake on Betfair.

The tracker, which takes an average of the last eight polls, put Trump's approval rating on 42.3 per cent on March 23. The last time this figure was so high was on 9 May 2018 - the day of Comey's controversial dismissal.  The year since Donald Trump's election has been packed with controversy and intrigue but, underneath it all, few people seem to have really changed their minds about America's 45th President.  His approval rating quickly slumped in the chaotic days after assuming office, with Trump achieving a majority disapproval rating in a record of just...

By JOSH KATZ   UPDATED November 8, 2016     The Upshot’s presidential forecast, updated with each new poll.             Alaska  Ariz.  Colo.  Fla.  Ga.  Ind.  Iowa  Miss.  Mo.  N.C.  N.H.  Nev.  Ohio  Pa.  Wis.          The estimates on this page are based on pre-election polls. For an estimate including results, The Times is providing live forecasts on election night.   President  Senate  House         Hillary Clinton has an  85% chance to win.  Last updated Tuesday, November  8 at 10:20 PM ET      Chance of winning     85%  Hillary Clinton     15%  Donald J. Trump              Forecast history ↘  Recent changes ↘  State by state ↘  Other forecasts ↘  Likely scenarios ↘  Explore paths ↘       The Upshot’s elections model suggests that Hillary Clinton is favored to win the presidency, based on the latest state and national polls . A victory by Mr. Trump remains possible: Mrs. Clinton’s chance of losing is about the same as the probability that an N.F.L. kicker misses a 37-yard field goal .    For months, we’ve been updating our estimates with each new poll. Today, it’s Election Day, what we’ve all been waiting for, and there will be no more updates. You can chart different paths to victory below. Here’s how our estimates have changed over time:            Where the Race Has Shifted #    To understand what is driving the national trend, it’s worth taking a look at the states where the winning probabilities have changed most over the last two weeks:                The Democrats have a 52% chance of winning the Senate →      State-by-State Estimates #    To forecast each party’s chance of winning the presidency, our model calculates vote estimates for each state and the District of Columbia, as well as congressional districts in Maine and Nebraska, which assign electoral votes by district.    In the table below, we have divided the country into groups based on each area’s voting history relative to the nation since 2004. Our forecast in places that tend to vote …         * Maine and Nebraska award two electoral votes to the statewide winner and a single electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district.             How Other Forecasts Compare #    The New York Times is one of many news organizations to publish election ratings or forecasts. Some, like FiveThirtyEight or the Princeton Election Consortium , use statistical models, as The Times does; others, like the Cook Political Report , rely on reporting and knowledgeable experts’ opinions. PredictWise uses information from betting markets.    We compile and standardize these ratings every day into one scoreboard for comparison. First, every organization’s estimate for who will win the presidency:               NYT       538       HuffPost       PW       PEC       DK       Cook       Roth. 1       Sabato           Note: The 538 model shown is its default (polls-only) forecast. Qualitative ratings reflect the rating for the state in the middle of each organization’s forecast, weighted by electoral votes.      Second, each organization’s state-by-state ratings. Viewed together, the differences between the models become much clearer.      We’re showing just the most competitive states by default.

Spencer Platt / Getty   Share         U.S.  Donald Trump  Impeachment  Gambling  Republicans President Donald Trump may not want to look at betting odds on his impeachment if he wants to get 2018 off to a positive start. The odds would likely leave the president on the brink of his first tweetstorm of the new year. Related: Support for Donald Trump's impeachment is higher than his re-election chances The Ireland-based gambling website Paddy Power thinks it's highly unlikely Trump lasts his first term in office without being impeached. The odds are currently 4-7 that the president is impeached before Inauguration Day 2021. To put that in perspective, oddsmakers at Paddy Power think it's nearly twice as likely Trump will be impeached as it is that he will serve four years in office. Paddy Power has additional ominous betting odds for the White House. Of the three years Trump has remaining in his presidency, the betting site has impeachment most likely in 2018. The odds that Trump is impeached in 2018 are nearly even at 5-4. For a sitting president, that doesn't paint a particularly rosy picture. The odds get exponentially better for Trump if he emerges from 2018 unscathed, as the site puts the odds at 7-1 that Trump is impeached in 2019 and 50-1 in 2020.

On the topic of Trump being impeached in his first term, the market is a bit more bullish on the president's survival. The site, which does its betting differently than Paddy Power, allows for a 35-cent bet on Trump's impeachment and a 65-cent bet on Trump completing the entirety of his term. That would put the odds at approximately 2-1. The House of Representatives, which has the sole power to impeach a president, got started in 2017 as Democratic Texas Representative Al Green introduced and forced a vote on articles of impeachment against the president. The vote failed overwhelmingly, but it did garner the support of 58 Democrats. The odds of the president being impeached are likely dependent on two factors: The first major factor is the FBI investigation, led by special counsel Robert Mueller, into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Should the investigation yield bombshell revelations against the president or his close confidantes, a bipartisan coalition of representatives could see fit to reintroduce impeachment with a broader base of support.  Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now The second factor is the 2018 midterms, which could potentially see the Democrats take control of the House of Representatives. Should Democrats win control of the chamber, they could be emboldened to humiliate the president by voting to impeach him. Trump may be safe for now, but he might very well spend the next few years nervously looking over his shoulder. That is, if he makes it a few years.

Trump himself has been compared to historical figures ranging from Ronald Reagan to Henry Ford , and from Andrew Jackson to Benito Mussolini . His steps have been condemned as unprecedented by his critics, and praised as historic by his supporters. To place contemporary events in perspective, we turned to a pair of historians of the United States. Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author, most recently, of The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society . Morton Keller is a professor emeritus of history at Brandeis University. He has written or edited more than 15 books, including Obama’s Time: A History . They’ll be exchanging views periodically on how to understand Trump, his presidency, and this moment in political time. — Yoni Appelbaum Morton Keller: At its inception, the American presidency was a mix of the European monarchical model, and the new American idea of limited rule, reinforced by George Washington's two-term limit. The Virginia Dynasty presidents—Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe—served the two-term span; their regionally limited Massachusetts competitors—John Adams and John Quincy Adams—managed only one. The more democratic party political era that began with Andrew Jackson in 1828 established a new pattern of most chief executives serving single terms (or, if they succeeded to a death-created presidency, no subsequent election). It took special qualities and special circumstances to win reelection: Jackson himself; Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant in the Civil War-Reconstruction era; Grover Cleveland as a Gilded Age reformer (though his were electoral victories separated by a Republican presidential term); the anodyne William McKinley; the Progressive Democrat Woodrow Wilson. From Jackson (1828-1832) until the coming of FDR in 1932, only six presidents were elected to two terms—and 18 elected to one (or, in the cases of John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, and Chester Arthur none). * Related Story      End Times for the American Republic?  To what degree did FDR's four elections change the pattern? Since then, two-term presidencies have been more frequent: Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama. As before, those who came into office as vice president when the incumbent died (or, in Nixon's case, resigned)—Harry Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson—did not pursue the reelection for which they were legally qualified. * And as before, a less than stellar record, or a vote-scattering third party candidacy—Jimmy Carter, the elder Bush—meant that the incumbent fell by the wayside. And the most recent two-termers—George W. Bush and Obama—won less than smashing triumphs. Obama, indeed, was the first two-term president in modern times to win his second term by a considerably smaller margin than his first one. So I think it may be said that in its long history the presidency has generally been hostile territory for extended presidencies—with the exception of FDR. But his four elections went so against the American grain that the 22nd Amendment embedded Washington's two-term limit in the Constitution. What may we look for in the Age of Trump? Given his low poll standings, his increasingly shaky position in his own party, and his inability so far to expand his appeal beyond his core, Trump's second-term prospects (both for nomination and reelection) are less than bright. Of course, we're only six months into his first term, but it is difficult to see much light at the end of the Trumpian tunnel. Given the past record and this future prospect, the need for fresh faces and a fresh approach to governance in 2020 looms ever larger. Trump may have activated a portion of the electorate that Hillary Clinton (who in her way was almost as deplorable a candidate) missed. And yet, Democrats are so far not making very effective noises about reaching out to these voters, much as the Republicans fell short of its efforts to engage Hispanic voters after 2008. Who might those new faces, and what might those new approaches, be? The Democrats might be well advised to skip over their current leaders—Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden—and not-so-young aspirants like Elizabeth Warren. As of now, none of these set many pulses racing. It might be best for the Democrats to see who emerges in the wake of the 2018 election. The Republicans are better stocked with potentials less long in the tooth: House Speaker Paul Ryan, Vice President Mike Pence, and Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Ben Sasse. True, none of these seem to appeal to the Trumpian core so far. But if the incumbent continues on his erratic and off-putting course, that core might well shrink to a collection of parings. And what of programmatic appeals? Without getting too deep in the weeds of policy specifics, both Trumpian excess, and the resistance mode adopted by the Democratic leadership and the media-talking heads chorus, might well give way to a more moderate, open-to-negotiation approach. The take-no-prisoners tails of the two parties make the loudest noises. But it is not clear that they have the biggest battalions. It may be that one of the parties will try to find out in 2020 — and in doing so, hit political pay dirt. Julian Zelizer: Mickey, you raise the question on many people’s minds—whether we are looking at a one-term president. Certainly, as you suggest, if we were placing a bet about his long-term prospects the odds would not be in his favor: Low approval ratings, an ongoing investigation, chaos in the White House, and united government without major legislation to show for it spells trouble. It is too early to have any solid sense of where this is all going, but we can take seriously the speculation that there won’t be two-terms of Trump. You point out that this is not a total surprise, nor is it necessarily just about our current president. For much of American history, one-term presidents were common. FDR shook things up with his four terms and since 1945 there have been a series of two-term presidents. But even then, you remind us, several presidents have not made it that long (either because of resignation, withdrawal, or defeat). Presidents George W. Bush and Obama won “less than smashing triumphs.” The distrust of centralized authority is woven into the founding fabric of this country. We were rebelling against kings when this Republic was created and have not stopped ever since. From my perspective, this structural analysis of the nation’s discomfort with two-term presidents is too easy on Donald Trump. If the president does stay in office for another four years, in this case, I think it’s safe to say that the political failure is more about him than about the institution. This is not like any other presidency that we have seen and the destructive side of commander in chief is doing more than anything else to subvert his future. His recent public bromides against Attorney General Jeff Sessions, his most loyal foot soldier and a favorite of the “base” that the president so cherishes, is a reminder of why things are going wrong. The next question that you raise is what should the parties do? From my perspective, the challenge for Democrats is less about moving to the left or moving to the center, than it is about being more vocal and coherent about the party’s economic world view and being more aggressive in championing reforms to make politics work better. Democrats don’t suffer from being too far to the left, they suffer from being too embarrassed about their own party platform. There is relatively unanimity within the party about a number of key issues, such as raising the minimum wage, the need for well-funded infrastructure programs, providing job training and better child care, supporting educational opportunities and more. The pieces are all there. The problem has been that Democratic candidates often hesitate to put these ideas front and center, always fearing that they will be somehow smeared as too far to the left even though the public supports many of these positions. While Republicans embrace their core agenda with relish, Democrats run away from it. The widespread public rejection of the draconian Medicaid cuts that Republicans have been pushing on Capitol Hill should be a reminder to the party that there is something to the government programs they stand for. In a fascinating piece in The New York Times , Lee Drutman found that the divisions about economic policy are not that deep within the party. The real tension between the Clinton and Sanders “factions” centers on how much they distrust institutions. The Sanders wing doesn’t think much of the political process. A winning Democratic candidate thus needs to combine a robust economic platform with a vision for government reform. The two can be a powerful combination. We should also remember that Clinton won a huge percentage of the popular vote, so the notion that the party can’t attract voters is not clear to me. On the Republican side, coming back from a one-term presidency wouldn’t be so easy. Republicans will own the Trump presidency and a skillful Democrat will take advantage of this. Many of the possible candidates you mention, Paul Ryan and Ben Sasse, for instance, are far to the right. A look at the kinds of policies that they propose could make it difficult for them to really win a broad coalition. While Trump didn’t seem to know the details of any of the health-care bills, Ryan, for instance, has been the architect of an agenda that makes steep cuts in programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Republicans also need to understand that the forces which produced a victory for Donald Trump are deep rooted. Trump is a culmination of many of the changes that have been taking place within the party over the past decade, not merely an anomaly. Unless moderate Republicans wake up to this fact, the party won’t move in a different direction. For all the talk about a working-class rebellion against the Democrats in states like Wisconsin, much more important to his victory was a conservative media universe (a chattering class, as you might call it) that has fostered the kind of public discourse Trump thrives on, as well as intense partisan loyalty which lead Republican voters to push for more extreme candidates and a notable shift in the party’s ideological world view on issues like immigration and climate change. Trump took many of his ideas right out of the playbook that was written by Tea Party Republicans on Capitol Hill. All of these forces will still make it difficult for the Jeb Bush’s of the world to succeed. The next Republican candidate might not be Trump, but it could easily be a cleaned-up version of him and I am not sure this is a successful recipe for the GOP in a world that is becoming more ethnically diverse, more educated, and more socially liberal than it has been in a long time. Obviously, time will tell. I guess for now we should just see if he even makes it for the entire term. Keller : Julian, I do want to take issue with a couple of your statements. One is that the Democrats are more divided on issues than the Republicans; I just don't see that. It is true that traditionally the Democrats were more factional (Comedian Will Rogers in the 1920s said, “I don't belong to an organized political party. I'm a Democrat.”) But it is one of the topsy-turvy aspects of current as compared to past party politics that the once monolithic Republicans seem unable to come up with a unified front that appears to have become second nature to the congressional Democrats. (A not unrelated development is the reversal of the parties in their appeal to the better-off, more educated segments of the voting population.) My second reservation has to do with your comment that a “conservative media universe” defends Trump. My sense is that much of that conservative universe, like The Wall Street Journal and a number of members of the conservative “chattering class,” are quite verbal in their criticism of Trump. Do you really think that there is more division among Democrats over the merits of Elizabeth Warren? I think it is important not to see the Fox-CNN polarity as the defining voices in our political world. Zelizer: I think that there is nothing quite like the Fox News- Breitbart News network. There are some voices in the conservative media who are now critical of the president, but it took a long time. Generally, Fox News has simply echoed the message of the administration and served as much more of a promotional platform for conservatism than a source of journalism. This has been essential to Trump's success given the power that these networks and websites have with Republican voters. It is simply not comparable with other “mainstream news networks” that regularly include conservative voices—including Trump surrogates—and have been highly critical of Democrats, including Hillary Clinton. The major area of criticism for the administration has been the Russia investigation, which comes as much from the media as it does from intelligence agencies, a Republican Congress, and many non-partisan voices. Much of the false or misleading information that Trump tweets about seems to come directly from shows like Fox and Friends . So I think what we have seen in the conservative media world is fundamentally different—and this is part of what the party must reckon with if they are serious about wanting to change course. *  This article originally stated that Zachary Taylor had not been elected to a term as president and omitted Chester Arthur from the list of those who did not seek election.

Updated at 12:11 p.m.  Whatever evidence federal prosecutors have collected concerning Michael Cohen, President Trump’s longtime attorney, it is most likely extraordinarily strong.  Before federal agents raided Cohen’s home, hotel room, and office Monday afternoon, they would have had to convince high-ranking officials at the Department of Justice and a federal judge that a search warrant was necessary to obtain the evidence sought.  “Doing a search warrant rather than a subpoena suggests the investigators thought Cohen, if given a subpoena, would possibly destroy evidence or withhold key evidence, particularly if it were incriminating,” Clinton Watts, a former FBI agent and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said.

Graham      The president’s comments on Monday underline his campaign against the American approach to fair and impartial justice.   Hours after the FBI raided the office, home, and hotel room of his sometime-personal attorney Michael Cohen, President Trump delivered an angry response at the White House on Monday.  The group of people he targeted is wide and deep: Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey, and his own appointee as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Taken together, however, it becomes apparent that Trump is not really angry at individuals so much as he is at the rule of law itself.  “It’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It's a total witch hunt.”  The reason for the raid on Cohen’s spaces is not yet clear. Cohen’s attorney said the Southern District of New York, the federal government’s prosecutorial office for Manhattan, had conducted the raid using a search warrant, and that it was “in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.” The lawyer, Stephen Ryan, called it “completely inappropriate and unnecessary” and said his client had already been cooperating with authorities. Such raids sometimes indicate prosecutors are concerned that an individual might try to conceal or destroy evidence.

ATLANTA—It was not until a few years after he moved in that Zachary Anderson realized he was not, in fact, the owner of the house he thought he’d purchased. Anderson had already spent tens of thousands of dollars repairing a hole in the roof, replacing a cracked sidewalk, and fixing the ceilings of the small two-bedroom home where he lives in southwest Atlanta, when he learned the truth. He was trying to get a reduction in his property taxes when his brother, who was helping him with his taxes, looked up the property in public records and found that the owner of the home was actually listed as Harbour Portfolio VII LP.  “It’s like a trick,” Anderson, a 57-year-old, told me, sitting in front of a wood-burning fireplace he’d installed in the living room of the house to lower his heating bills. “They get free work out of a lot of people.” Anderson had entered into a contract for deed, a type of transaction that was rampant in the 1950s and 1960s before African Americans had access to avenues of conventional lending. In a contract for deed, the buyer purchases an agreement for the deed rather than buying the deed itself. The tenant has to fulfill the conditions of the agreement in order to get the deed, conditions that usually include making a series of timely payments over decades, paying for home repairs and general maintenance of the home, and paying taxes and insurance on the property. If he misses one payment, thus violating the agreement, he can be evicted, losing all the equity he put into the home.

To the old-fashioned, it might seem crazy that the Republicans plan to fight the 2018 election as a referendum on a Trump impeachment.  Traditional wisdom was: If the president of your party is unpopular, try your utmost to de-nationalize off-year elections.  Focus the voters on local issues and down-ballot candidates! “Maybe you don’t like Trump. But you like the new factory openings in our district, don’t you?”  So why are Republicans edging toward the opposite approach?  The short answer: They have no choice. The old saying, “All politics is local,” is outdated. All politics is national. In his forthcoming book, The Great Alignment , the political scientist Alan Abramowitz argues that national-party ID holds an overwhelming sway over local results. This election will be about the president, as 2014 and 2010 and 2006 were about the president. Republicans might as well face up to that fact. Rather than run away from an association that cannot be escaped, it’s tactically smarter to embrace the association and try to mobilize such turnout as can be mobilized in at-risk seats like the one they lost in the Pennsylvania special election of March 13, 2018.

A court document suggests otherwise.   Much as the role of the addictive multibillion-dollar painkiller OxyContin in the opioid crisis has stirred controversy and rancor nationwide, so it has divided members of the wealthy and philanthropic Sackler family, some of whom own the company that makes the drug.  In recent months, as protesters have begun pressuring the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and other cultural institutions to spurn donations from the Sacklers, one branch of the family has moved aggressively to distance itself from OxyContin and its manufacturer, Purdue Pharma. The widow and one daughter of Arthur Sackler, who owned a related Purdue company with his two brothers, maintain that none of his heirs have profited from sales of the drug. The daughter, Elizabeth Sackler, told  The New York Times in January that Purdue Pharma’s involvement in the opioid epidemic was “morally abhorrent to me.”    Continue Reading                  PNAS / Richard Goerg / Getty / The Atlantic   The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete    James Somers      Here’s what’s next.   T he scientific paper—the actual form of it—was one of the enabling inventions of modernity. Before it was developed in the 1600s, results were communicated privately in letters, ephemerally in lectures, or all at once in books. There was no public forum for incremental advances. By making room for reports of single experiments or minor technical advances, journals made the chaos of science accretive. Scientists from that point forward became like the social insects: They made their progress steadily, as a buzzing mass.  The earliest papers were in some ways more readable than papers are today. They were less specialized, more direct, shorter, and far less formal. Calculus had only just been invented. Entire data sets could fit in a table on a single page. What little “computation” contributed to the results was done by hand and could be verified in the same way.    Continue Reading                  Jules Julien   Your Body is a Teeming Battleground    Victoria Sweet      It’s time to rethink the quest to control aging, death, and disease—and the fear of mortality that fuels it.   I went to medical school , at least in part, to get to know death and perhaps to make my peace with it. So did many of my doctor friends, as I would find out. One day—usually when you’re young, though sometimes later—the thought hits you: You really are going to die. That moment is shocking, frightening, terrible. You try to pretend it hasn’t happened (it’s only a thought, after all), and you go about your business, worrying about this or that, until the day you put your hand to your neck—in the shower, say—and … What is that? Those hard lumps that you know, at first touch, should not be there? But there they are, and they mean death. Your death, and you can’t pretend anymore.  I never wanted to be surprised that way, and I thought that if I became a doctor and saw a lot of death, I might get used to it; it wouldn’t surprise me, and I could learn to live with it. My strategy worked pretty well. Over the decades, from all my patients, I learned that I would be well until I got sick and that although I could do some things to delay the inevitable a bit, whatever control I had was limited. I learned that I had to live as if I would die tomorrow and at the same time as if I would live forever. Meanwhile, I watched as what had been called “medical care”—that is, treating the sick— turned into “health care,” keeping people healthy, at an ever-rising cost.    Continue Reading                  Edmon de Haro   The Era of Fake Video Begins    Franklin Foer      The digital manipulation of video may make the current era of “fake news” seem quaint.   In a dank corner of the internet, it is possible to find actresses from Game of Thrones or Harry Potter engaged in all manner of sex acts. Or at least to the world the carnal figures look like those actresses, and the faces in the videos are indeed their own. Everything south of the neck, however, belongs to different women. An artificial intelligence has almost seamlessly stitched the familiar visages into pornographic scenes, one face swapped for another. The genre is one of the cruelest, most invasive forms of identity theft invented in the internet era. At the core of the cruelty is the acuity of the technology: A casual observer can’t easily detect the hoax.  This development, which has been the subject of much hand-wringing in the tech press, is the work of a programmer who goes by the nom de hack “deepfakes.” And it is merely a beta version of a much more ambitious project. One of deepfakes’s compatriots told Vice ’s Motherboard site in January that he intends to democratize this work. He wants to refine the process, further automating it, which would allow anyone to transpose the disembodied head of a crush or an ex or a co-worker into an extant pornographic clip with just a few simple steps. No technical knowledge would be required. And because academic and commercial labs are developing even more-sophisticated tools for non-pornographic purposes—algorithms that map facial expressions and mimic voices with precision—the sordid fakes will soon acquire even greater verisimilitude.

We’ve known for some time now that Americans are increasingly dying younger , but the scale and nature of the problem has been a little bit murky. There was speculation that the downturn in American life expectancy was all thanks to “deaths of despair ,” but some experts have said that might not be the full story , and that obesity and tobacco are still major factors in American mortality.  A new study out today in the Journal of the American Medical Association drills down into which states are showing increases in deaths among the young, and why. In doing so, it reveals a profound disparity among the states when it comes to both life expectancy and disability.  Most startlingly, since 1990, 21 states have seen an increase in the death rate among people aged 20 to 55. In five states—Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia, and Wyoming—the probability of early death among young adults rose by more than 10 percent in that time frame. Meanwhile, in New York and California, young and middle-aged people became much less likely to die in the same time period. The authors note that opioids, alcoholism, suicide, and kidney disease—which can be brought on by diabetes and alcoholism—were the main factors leading to the increases in early deaths.

President Donald Trump speaks to the press in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 16, 2017. (Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images)   Albert R. Hunt Bloomberg View      Few stories are more irresistible than those that take on the conventional wisdom and come from an unexpected source. Doug Sosnik, a smart operative in Bill Clinton 's White House, provided both with a column this month suggesting that Donald Trump is well-positioned for re-election. The Trump base is solid, the Democratic strategist notes, as the president's appeal to populist anger transcends his leadership failures. There will likely be independent candidates in 2020, so, like last year, Trump can win without a majority of votes. Sosnik's column has led to panicked calls from some Democrats and to provocative chatter on politics sites like FiveThirtyEight, while Trumpites, not surprisingly, welcomed his analysis. It's all interesting — and irrelevant. Informed speculation awaits answers to these five questions:    No. 1: Will there be an economic downturn in the next three years, ending an already 99-month expansion, the third longest in modern U.S. history? Some economists and investors anticipate years of good times, including a stronger-than-expected global economy. The U.S. recovery from a deep downturn has been only modest, creating more leeway for a longer upturn, some potential benefits from regulatory changes, and the expectation of a corporate tax cut. More analysts believe that the business cycle hasn't been repealed, and that the bubble will burst sometime in the next two years. Trump would then blame others — the Federal Reserve, Democrats, China, Gold Star mothers — but a recession would strike hard at his working-class base. No. 2: Will the impetuous commander-in-chief launch a war, specifically a nuclear confrontation with North Korea?  Trump and Kim Jong Un are not the leaders anyone would wish to have for a potential face-off. But more informed and responsible top administration figures see increasing odds of a military response to the North Korean nuclear threat. The desired scenario: minimal deaths and a non-nuclear North Korea dominated by China. More probable would be massive casualties, chaos on the Korean peninsula, and a possible conflict with China. No. 3: Will Democrats win control of the House next year, and reject a left-wing agenda for the 2020 presidential contest? Democratic control of the House, with oversight and endless investigations, would be a nightmare for the ethically challenged Trump administration. It probably would produce legislative stalemate. But there would be internal pressure on Democrats from the left, and Republicans hope 2020 could be a reprise of 1972 and George McGovern. No. 4: Will the 71-year-old Trump have health problems? The second-oldest U.S. president is not expected to release the results of a full physical examination as his recent predecessors have, just as he won't release his tax returns. During the 2016 campaign, he issued a limited report from a family doctor. He is overweight, bordering on obese, and tries to hide it with loosely tailored suits and long ties hanging below the waist. He doesn't believe in exercise other than golf. Some experts have also expressed concerns about his cognitive health, as described in a lengthy investigation by Stat, a respected health and science site, earlier this year. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet can act to remove an incapacitated president. Given the current cast, this isn't going to happen, especially since Trump would contest it. No. 5: Will special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation into Trump and the Russians lead to indictments that implicate the president? The spin from the White House is that it is cooperating fully with Mueller to wrap up the inquiry quickly. The aim of that claim is to give the White House a pretext to attack the special counsel for prolonging a probe. It won't work. This investigation is thoroughly professional. It is diving deeply into any evidence of collusion between Trump operatives and the Russians in the 2016 campaign; into any possible obstruction of justice of the investigation by the president this year, as well as into financial dealings that may date back years. There appear to be several easy indictments, maybe even imminent. It's less clear this leads to Trump. Short of that, even if Democrats take the House, impeachment is a non-starter. Republicans, seeing how Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake , an honest anti-Trump conservative, has been savaged, duck for cover. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, once a Trump critic, has become a cheerleader and enabler for the president. While Trump is sui generis, history offers guidance on the folly of predicting distant elections. At this moment in 1989, George H.W. Bush, having kept his promise not to raise taxes and with communism collapsing, seemed invincible. Three years later, he was defeated. In 2009, Barack Obama was in trouble, with unemployment soaring to 10 percent, up sharply from what it was two years earlier, and with his major health-care initiative seemingly stalled in the Senate. Three years later he was re-elected. If the answer to five questions is no — but only if to all of them — Sosnik is ahead of the curve. Bloomberg View Albert R. Hunt is a Bloomberg View columnist.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Trump-Pence 2016  Donald Trump (politician, business person)  Politics of the United States of America Realistically, what do you think are the chances of Trump getting re-elected? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 20 Answers   William Murphy , Professor of American History, specializing in political history Answered Aug 13, 2017 · Author has 1.7k answers and 6.8m answer views What I usually tell my students when they have asked about any particular president’s chances of being re-elected is this: incumbent presidents have very powerful advantages when seeking re-election. They are already known to the electorate; there is a large group of voters who already voted for them once, and they usually do not face serious primary challenges. The opposition party, meanwhile, usually has to go through a long primary contest to choose a nominee; the candidate who emerges may not have been well known beforehand, and has to spend a lot of time, effort and money introducing themselves to the public and battling opposing candidates from within their own parties who will make arguments against their election that the incumbent president’s team can then adopt. The president can raise money and begin running ads defining their potential opponents in the eyes of voters who do not pay close attention to the primaries, while the primaries are still going on and those potential opponents are still focused on each other. So normally, I would expect an incumbent president to win re-election. The exception would be if the economy is very unhealthy at or around the time of the election. It’s easy to say that Trump is not a “normal” president; he is relatively more unpopular than any of his predecessors at comparable points in their presidencies and he is one of only four presidents to be elected despite losing the popular vote. But I would still expect him to have all of the advantages I’ve listed above. If the economy is healthy in 2020, I would not bet against his re-election. That being said, the one thing that would be a clear indication that he was in trouble would be if he faced a strong primary challenge for re-nomination. This is unusual for a sitting president, but there have been three incumbents who ran for re-election and lost since the institution of presidential term limits in the 1950s: Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush. All three won re-nomination, but only after beating back a strong primary challenge: Ford from Ronald Reagan, Carter from Ted Kennedy, and Bush from Pat Buchanan. No president who has faced a serious challenge from within his own party during this period has gone on to win re-election. If a Republican candidate were to challenge Trump for the nomination in 2020 and actually make some noise, forcing Trump to fight an actual primary contest, this would be a sign (based on the best historical examples we have) that he was in trouble in the general election. If, however, his party is unified behind him and the economy is good… well, it would be very unusual for a president to lose his bid for re-election in those circumstances, and would be another way in which Trump is unusual by historical standards. 8.4k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by TruthFinder Have you ever googled yourself?

Ask New Question   Dallas Mitchell , BA from Boise State University (1998) Answered Oct 1, 2017 · Author has 887 answers and 632.4k answer views Pretty good actually—unfortunately. Incumbents have a very strong record of getting reelected in this country. If he did it once, he can do it again. I see six major unknowns that will play a critical role: How will the economy be doing closer to the election? Will we be better off or worse? The economy is often a major factor. Who will the Democrats choose to run against him? Will they pick someone who is historically unpopular and has already been thoroughly demonized? Or will the pick an unknown, but highly intelligent and charismatic personality with superior communication skills, like Obama or Bill Clinton? As far as I can tell, Trump is doing nothing at all to stop the Russians from interfering on his behalf again. How effective will their continued interference be? Or, if he continues to fail to lift sanctions or undermine NATO, is it possible they’ll decide he isn’t worth it? How effective will Republican voter suppression efforts be? The could be critical in close swing states like Wisconsin. Will Democrats sabotage themselves again? By clearing the ground during the primaries for a favored establishment candidate? Or sabotaging a popular outside with populist positions who is not favored by the establishment? Or failing to coalesce and set aside differences—small differences actually—and vote for the Democrat, or in a snit, stay home and have a far worse Republican candidate (Trump), win again? What will the outcome of Mueller’s investigation be? I still believe it’s quite possible Trump could be impeached or resign. If the Dems take over in the mid-terms (possible, but not too likely IMO), I think the danger of Trump being impeached would increase greatly. Again, what will the economy be doing? Will Trump screw up so badly it might chip into his support more? For those who think Trump has it in the bag—bad news for you, he won by a very narrow margin in a number of key swing states—Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania—where if HRC had spent more time and resources—she may have won, even with all her baggage. A stronger Democratic candidate is likely to win these states, unless things are going just fantastic when Trump is up for reelection. And he is not off to a good start on that end. But for those who are confident of the opposite, and are writing him off already, don’t forget, he did it once, he can do it again. This sort of complacency is a big reason why he won in the first place. He has proven he can win against an experienced and seasoned candidate on the other side. So I’m arguing for uncertainty here. We have too little data, and it’s way to early to tell. But I think my answer at least provides some areas we should watch to see how it’s going, and why we should not have any confidence either way at this point. I would say that while his reelection is possible, it is less likely than any of the last three presidents before him—Obama, Bush or Clinton. 249 Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Libertarianism.org Who elected Donald Trump?

It’s hard to narrow it down more this early on. I say greater than 0% because if he’s on the ballot, someone will vote for him. And as long as the balance of power stays about equal in Congress (even if Democrats win both houses back narrowly), i think the odds of him being impeached soon are low. Could everything change because of Mueller’s investigation? Yes, it could. I don’t expect that to happen, though. Even if Trump is implicated in wrong-doing, I think his team will provide him enough political cover that he’ll get by. The reason I don’t think he’ll get re-elected, though, is because he doesn’t adjust well to new circumstances. He constantly makes himself look ridiculous by not adjusting his message to fit events on the ground. Abject lying to try to get the facts on the ground to match your message isn’t going to work as a strategy. Here’s why: In 2020, he won’t be running against Clinton. Whomever he runs against will therefore be more popular than him. At the rate Trump is going, by 2020, gonorrhea will be more popular than him. He won in 2016 because he was pitted against a candidate who was just as unpopular as he was, and he was able to game the board. In 2020, there won’t be such a person to run against. 801 Views · View Upvoters   Joseph Perez , NYC street kid, USAF NCO, Teacher, Driver & almost retired Answered Aug 13, 2017 · Author has 2.1k answers and 1.6m answer views Pretty good chance unfortunately.

Some will argue that incumbents tend to be re elected which is true in recent history BUT Trump is not your average President. It was a perfect storm which achieved his election victory last night, a perfect storm that he will struggle to replicate in 2020. He benefited in 2016 from running against a very unpopular Hillary Clinton, he may be up against a more likely Democrat nominee next time. He’s likely to face a primary challenge next time, incumbents who have faced one in recent history have gone on to become one term Presidents. He won swing states by a tiny margin, a margin that can be very easily overturned next time. 108 Views · View Upvoters   Mayyah Herzi , close observer of Donald Trump Answered Oct 1, 2017 · Author has 69 answers and 311.5k answer views Although most Americans don’t seem to like Trump or particularly trust him, there is a chance he could get re-elected in 2020. Trump won his first term despite having significantly low approval numbers, and running against the slightly more popular candidate, Hillary Clinton. Even though Trump is disliked by the majority of America , he continues to receive unwavering support from the voters who put him in the White House. [1] Trump has already raised millions of dollars, mostly in small donations, for the upcoming reelection, and has already begun putting that money to good use by running ads in key states that praise his achievements and criticize his political rivals. [2] Despite Trump’s approval ratings being undeniably low, he seems to be meeting and exceeding America’s expectations of him. [3] Regardless in the end, it does not matter what the public feels about the incumbent but instead how the public feels about the most likely alternative. In this case it’s the Democrats. The Trump campaign, and the rest of the right-wing media complex, will relentlessly work to try and convince Republican-leaning voters that however much they may dislike Trump, they should fear and hate his opponents more. The Republicans will undoubtedly demonize the opposition and portray the left as repulsive and “a grave threat to ordinary American citizens”, so much that a sizable amount of the population will vote not as Republicans because they agree with a canidates policies but anti-Democrats. Combine that push with the many recent targeted acts of voter suppression specifically in heavily Democratic districts of key swing states, and the effort just  might grant Trump a second term.

This is a question that should've been asked no earlier than 2019, and even at that point, it's hard to tell what late factors could affect the likelihood of Trump's re-election. I will say this: the Democratic Party is in an obvious and undeniable bad shape. The fact that Hillary lost (in the 2016 Presidential Election) in 3 states she was supposed to win (Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin) tells you that Dems need to fix themselves in order to have a chance at beating Trump in 2020. The Congressional Elections of next year should provide a good test of the Democratic Party's chances for 2020, in terms of showing whether or not the party's recovering. 272 Views · View Upvoters Quora User Answered Aug 14, 2017 · Author has 92 answers and 13k answer views As unpopular as Trump is, it remains too early to tell anything. Much will depend on several factors: —2018’s midterms. A strong showing from Democrats could mean an enthused left in 2020. —The candidate in 2020. Hillary Clinton utterly failed to inspire people to show up at the polls, and whatever you felt about her personal issues the fact remained that it muddied the waters enough for people to not trust her. A clean candidate will go a long way towards drawing a contrast with Trump’s filth. —The state of the world for the next three years. Trump has already proven that he’s incapable of going a week without a self-inflicted wound. Imagine what he would do with a crisis not of his own making—such as North Korea actually making good on their threats, or engaging in a trade war with China.

However, there's a big factor that could come into play down the road. Potential war. If we go to war with NK or anyone like that, he's likely to be reelected.

He is not currently any less popular than he was on Election Day. So one might assume his chances are good. However, Mrs. Clinton, despite her experience, and reported intelligence is, frankly a very un-likeable person and that hurt her in the election. A large number of people voted for Trump just to vote against her. And another sizable group chose not to vote, or to vote third party because neither candidate suited them. I think if either party fields a candidate that is well qualified and well liked he or she would stand a good chance against Trump. 148 Views · View Upvoters   Katie Faulk , Writer & Marketing Answered Aug 14, 2017 · Author has 81 answers and 25.1k answer views Depends.

If he “ gets “ tax cuts, aca repeal and other parts of his plan then possibly but not as it stands right now. The problem for Trump now is his low approval rating among independents. By my estimation 40 percent of the voters will probably chooses trump and 40 percent any democratic challenger to Trump. The problem is barring those 40 percent Trump doesn’t ha ve much support. Independents abhor him and another bad sign is that his approval rating among white males is 48 percent in some polls and white males are strong gop voters. 2018 will be an important test for Trump if Senator Casey, Senator Baldwin , Senator Stabenow and Congress woman Jackie Rosen win their senate races then things do not look good .

The market thinks that the threats to Trump's presidency are many – the Mueller investigation, rumours of early stage dementia, former staffers with axes to grind, the list goes on     Christoph Siemroth   Saturday 20 January 2018 10:00 GMT         Click to follow Independent Voices                  Stephen Bannon thinks Trump has a 33.3 per cent chance of making it to January 2021 AP       Donald Trump has been under constant fire from critics since he began his campaign in the summer of 2015, and his presidency has so far been perhaps the most chaotic and bizarre in recent decades. But as he approaches the first anniversary of his inauguration, the pressure is only getting more intense.  First came revelations in Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury of various White House aides’ apparent concerns about the president’s mental capacity. Then came Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s request to question Trump about the his election campaign’s dealings with Russia, and his decision to subpoena the president’s ostracised former ally, Steve Bannon.  So as Trump celebrates a year since his inauguration, what are the chances he’ll still be president when 2018 is over?      Trump's First Year: Who has been and gone from the White House?  There are plenty of guesses and estimates out there, informed and otherwise. Bannon for one is quoted in Fire and Fury as saying Trump only has a 33.3 per cent chance of making it to the end of his term in January 2021. But while many experts and insiders have opinions on the matter, when it comes to forecasting future events, betting and prediction markets have been shown to be rather more reliable .  A prediction market is a simple financial market that allows everyone to bet on an uncertain future outcome. The market most interesting for us asks: “Will Donald Trump be president at year-end 2018?” The “yes” asset will pay 100 cents if Trump is still in office by midnight on 31 December and 0 cents if he is not. Because an asset is worth at most 100 cents and at least 0 cents, the asset price is between 0 and 100 – just like a probability.  Since anyone can trade in these markets and adjust the prices, prediction markets have been characterised as a market-based form of the wisdom of the crowd. If the crowd thinks the asset is underpriced – that is, that the implied probability is too low – then people can buy the asset at an expected profit and thereby adjust the price upwards. If the asset is seen as overpriced, then traders can sell to bring the price down.  And indeed, research shows that the prices in these markets are a good predictor of the probabilities. Whenever the asset price is 60 cents, then in 60 per cent of the cases the underlying outcome does in fact happen. If the price is 70 cents, then the underlying outcome happens in 70 per cent of the cases, and so on. That means prices are “well calibrated”; on average, they correspond to probabilities.

I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn't even think about it twice. "We'll do it!" he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on."   Reuters/Jonathan Ernst     7/29  Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway - 27 February 2017   Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: "We're often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone."   Reuters/Jonathan Ernst     8/29  Angela Merkel heads to Washington - 17 March 2017   Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: "Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don't always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt."   Reuters/Jonathan Ernst     9/29  Trump welcomes truckers to the White House - 23 March 2017   President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: "The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO's of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver's seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected."

Carlos Barria: "During the many trips to President Trump's residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called 'Winter White House', Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader."   Reuters/Carlos Barria     11/29  100 Days - 27 April 2017   US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. 
Photographer Carlos Barria: "A day before President Trump's hundred days in office I was part of the team that interviewed the commander-in-chief in the Oval Office. I was only allowed to photograph Trump during the last five minutes of the interview. The time was very tight so I had to move fast as I had pictures in mind that I wanted to shoot. I walked into the Oval Office and saw that the President had printed maps of the country showing areas in red where he won. I raised my hands holding my camera as high as possible to get the best view of the scene using a 16mm wide angle lens."   Reuters/Carlos Barria     12/29  100 Days - 27 April 2017   US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: "President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on."

Photographer Joshua Roberts: "Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold."

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: "The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad."

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: "One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France's President Macron."

Photographer Carlos Barria: "On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump's first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world's eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump's hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot."

First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania's hair up in the air."

Photographer Carlos Barria: "This summer the White House organized an event to showcase 'Made in America' products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media."   Reuters     19/29  White House staffers - 25 July 2017   Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: "The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It's crucial to know who's who and why they're important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it's like to be a West Wing staffer on the road."

Photographer Carlos Barria: "President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked."

Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: "Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work."

Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today's politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President."   Reuters/Carlos Barria     24/29  Take a knee - 27 September 2017   A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice.

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: "During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls."

Photographer Kevin Lamarque: "The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure."   Reuters/Kevin Lamarque     27/29  Trump in China - 9 November 2017   Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: "It's one of those "how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row". If I'm not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump's recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven't seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn't work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake."   Reuters/Damir Sagolj     28/29  Air Force One - 10 November 2017   US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: "There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples' attention."   Reuters/Jonathan Ernst     29/29  ASEAN handshake - 13 November 2017   Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional "ASEAN handshake" as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: "Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments."   Reuters/Jonathan Ernst        Another study finds that assets set to expire more than half a year in the future can exhibit slight biases. Prices above 50 cents tend to be slightly larger than the true probabilities – so looking at the odds on Trump’s future, it’s important to regard the prices as optimistic estimates.  What the crowd says  Currently the yes-asset trades at 77 cents, implying a 77 per cent or less probability that Trump survives 2018 in office. So the market thinks that while the threats to his presidency are many – the Mueller investigation, rumours of early stage dementia, former staffers with axes to grind – Trump is considerably more likely to survive than be ousted.  Still, of the 57 US presidential terms served prior to Trump, only nine ended prematurely, meaning 84 per cent of terms were fulfilled. So the market expectation of Trump making it through the next year (not even the entire term) is significantly below this historical average.  Another market asks: Will Trump be president at year-end 2019 ? Certainly the probability must be lower here, since Trump cannot resume office in 2019 if ousted in 2018. And indeed, the yes-asset in this market is currently trading at 62 cents, indicating only a 62 per cent probability or less that Trump survives the next two years in office.     But despite the shockwaves generated by Fire and Fury , the prices in both markets have not changed much in the ensuing weeks. Indeed, if anything, they went slightly up around the book’s release, only to revert again a few days later. It seems the markets may have considered the book’s “revelations”, just another episode of Trump melodrama.  However, while the odds didn’t change much, the trading volume – the number of assets bought and sold – started to explode on 1 January, around the time newspapers first started discussing the book. These numbers indicate that, while the book did create a lot of interest, it did not considerably affect people’s estimation of Trump’s chances of staying in office.  The last time we saw such large trading numbers on these markets was on 1 December – the day Michael Flynn (Trump’s former National Security Advisor) pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in its Russia investigation. With new twists in the administration’s various scandals coming thick and fast, it seems safe to say there are other spikes to come – but whether they will shift the odds is another matter.

A FiveThirtyEight Chat  Filed under 2020 Election    Facebook Twitter Email                  In this week’s politics chat , we debate what we can say now about the 2020 presidential election. The transcript below has been lightly edited.   micah ( Micah Cohen , politics editor): Hi, people!  harry ( Harry Enten , senior political writer): Hey, friends! 🙂  micah : This article, “ Trump is on track to win reelection ,” sparked some heated debate in the office. Nate thought it was dead-on and brilliant. I didn’t.  natesilver ( Nate Silver , editor in chief): #fakenews  micah : So let’s argue it out! The idea here isn’t to pick apart this one piece, but more to use it as a vehicle to discuss what we know at this very early date about President Trump’s re-election prospects. So, is Trump more likely than not to win re-election in 2020? Or, as I maintain, is that a silly question at this point given how long we have until that campaign and how unpopular Trump is.  clare.malone ( Clare Malone , senior political writer): This will be a more interesting conversation after the midterms. I’m a little undecided as to whether or not the article is silly.  harry : It certainly had a provocative headline. And while I agree with Clare that this is a question that is difficult to answer now, many potential candidates are asking it.  natesilver : There might be less than a 50 percent chance that Trump will be president on Jan. 21, 2021. But that’s because he might not run again (or might not complete his first term) — it’s not the same thing as the chances of his winning re-election, conditional upon running.  harry : I think that’s true.  micah : OK, let’s go point by point …  First, Trump knows that gaining the support of a majority of voters in a presidential election is not a requirement; it’s simply an aspiration. In fact, two out of the last three presidents were elected despite losing the popular vote.  harry : This is entirely true. You don’t need to win the popular vote (though doing so obviously increases the chances of winning the Electoral College). And you certainly don’t need to win a majority of the popular vote. Bill Clinton never  did . George W. Bush did only  once .  natesilver : Wait — elections are determined by the Electoral College?  harry : I know; this shocked me, too.  micah : This is what bothers me so much. Sure, it’s true that you can win the White House without winning the popular vote. But all else being equal , it’s harder! Right?  harry : It is. The question, which we can get to now or later, is whether Trump is in a better position to win the Electoral College without winning the popular vote than the normal politician.  micah : This also presumes a ton about what the coalitions will look like in 2020.  natesilver : Trump had a very significant Electoral College advantage … but the thing is, the Electoral College edge typically isn’t that stable from election to election . This is from an article we did in November:    The Electoral College advantage ebbs and flows      YEAR  NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE  TIPPING-POINT STATE(S)  TIPPING-POINT MARGIN  ELECTORAL COLLEGE EDGE      2016  D __ +1.8*  Pennsylvania  R __ +1.1  R _ +2.9    2012  D __ +3.9 _  Colorado  D __ +5.4  D _ +1.5    2008  D __ +7.3 _  Colorado  D __ +9.0  D _ +1.7    2004  R __ +2.5 _  Ohio  R __ +2.1  D _ +0.4    2000  D __ +0.5 _  Florida  R __ +0.0  R _ +0.5    1996  D __ +8.5 _  Pennsylvania  D __ +9.2  D _ +0.7    1992  D __ +5.6 _  Tennessee  D __ +4.7  R _ +0.9    1988  R __ +7.7 _  Michigan  R __ +7.9  R _ +0.2    1984  R _ +18.2 _  Michigan  R _ +19.0  R _ +0.8    1980  R __ +9.7 _  Illinois  R __ +7.9  D _ +1.8    1976  D __ +2.1 _  Wisconsin  D __ +1.7  R _ +0.4    1972  R _ +23.1 _  Maine _ and Ohio  R _ +22.3  D _ +0.8    1968  R __ +0.7 _  Illinois _ and Ohio  R __ +2.6  R _ +1.9    1964  D _ +22.6 _  Washington  D _ +24.6  D _ +2.0    1960  D __ +0.2 _  New _ Mexico and Missouri  D __ +0.6  D _ +0.4    1956  R _ +15.4 _  Florida  R _ +14.5  D _ +0.9    1952  R _ +10.9 _  Michigan  R _ +11.5  R _ +0.6    1948  D __ +4.5 _  California _ and Illinois  D __ +0.8  R _ +3.7    1944  D __ +7.5 _  New _ York  D __ +5.0  R _ +2.5    1940  D __ +9.9 _  Pennsylvania  D __ +6.9  R _ +3.0    1936  D _ +24.3 _  Ohio  D _ +20.6  R _ +3.7    1932  D _ +17.8 _  Iowa  D _ +17.7  R _ +0.1    1928  R _ +17.4 _  Illinois  R _ +14.7  D _ +2.7    1924  D _ +26.6 _  New _ York  D _ +25.2  R _ +1.4    1920  D _ +31.2 _  Rhode _ Island  D _ +26.2  R _ +5.0    1916  D __ +3.1 _  California  D __ +0.4  R _ +2.7    1912  D _ +17.0 _  New _ Jersey and Iowa  D _ +18.7  D _ +1.7    1908  R __ +8.5 _  West _ Virginia  R _ +10.2  R _ +1.7    1904  R _ +18.8 _  New _ Jersey  R _ +18.6  D _ +0.2    1900  R __ +6.2 _  Illinois  R __ +8.4  R _ +2.2    1896  R __ +4.3 _  Ohio  R __ +4.8  R _ +0.5    1892  D __ +3.0 _  Connecticut _ and Illinois  D __ +3.2  D _ +0.2    1888  D __ +0.8 _  New _ York  R __ +1.1  R _ +1.9    1884  D __ +0.6 _  New _ York  D __ +0.1  R _ +0.5    1880  R __ +0.2 _  New _ York  R __ +1.9  R _ +1.7    1876  D __ +3.0 _  South _ Carolina  R __ +0.5  R _ +3.5    1872  R _ +11.8 _  Ohio  R __ +7.1  D _ +4.7    1868  R __ +5.3 _  North _ Carolina  R __ +6.8  R _ +1.5    1864  R _ +10.1 _  Illinois  R __ +8.8  D _ +1.3      * 2016 popular vote margin is projected The “Electoral College edge” is the margin in the tipping-point state minus the margin in the national popular vote. Where there are two tipping-point states, their margins are averaged together.  Sources: Dave Leip’s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections, David Wasserman    harry : I think that’s right about the Electoral College advantage not being permanent, Nate. I will point out that Trump’s approval rating is above his national approval rating in enough states to get over 270 electoral votes. That is, that Trump could win the Electoral College while still losing the popular vote still seems quite plausible.  micah : Conditional on him getting more popular.  natesilver : So are we agreeing or disagreeing, Harry? Because I thought I was pointing out that the Electoral College edge isn’t necessarily all that persistent from one election to the next.  harry : I was agreeing and disagreeing if that makes sense.  natesilver : It doesn’t make sense.  harry : I was saying that you’re right historically but that there are some numbers to suggest that maybe the Electoral College advantage will be stable this time around.  micah : How Trump’s coalition is distributed via the Electoral College will be greatly influenced by who the Democratic nominee is, no?  natesilver : I’m not sure I’d say greatly influenced — but somewhat influenced, certainly. After all, Obama overperformed in the Electoral College relative to his performance in the popular vote. And his coalition was not that different from Hillary Clinton’s.  harry : Not just about who, but what that person articulates as their main message.  clare.malone : This goes back to our theory that Democrats will nominate a populist/progressive white guy in 2020 in order to appeal to more geographic areas.  natesilver : I’d still bet on the Electoral College helping Trump, more likely than not. But it’s not quite as safe of an assumption as our friend who wrote this column assumes.  micah : Next point …  Second, the continued decline in support for both political parties works to Trump’s advantage. The lack of voters’ faith in both parties increases the probability that there will be a major third-party candidate on the 2020 ballot. It will also lead to other minor-party candidates joining the presidential race. The multi-candidate field will further divide the anti-Trump vote, making it possible for him to get reelected simply by holding on to his current level of support.  clare.malone : I do not think this is the case, and I disagree with Nate that this is a time in our history when we’re more likely to see a third-party candidate.  micah : BAM!  clare.malone : I think increased partisanship really does mean that people don’t want to play with spoilers. They want their team to win.  natesilver : I disagree with your disagreement!  clare.malone : Please, sir! Explain!  harry : I disagree with all of you.  natesilver : An unpopular president and an opposition party slightly in disarray sounds a lot like … 1980 or 1992 , and those were years that invited third-party challenges.  clare.malone : No, I don’t think we live in the same cultural moment as 1992. There are now two mono-cultures — one for Democrats, one for Republicans. That was not the case in 1992.  natesilver : Well, there were some very … flawed third-party candidates in 2016. And they got, what, 6 percent of the vote? That’s not bad!  micah : But, Nate, 2016 featured the two most unpopular major-party candidates ever , and no real third-party challenger emerged. 2016 doesn’t help your case.  natesilver : The third-party vote was the highest since Perot.  micah : 😐  clare.malone : I would be interested, Nate, to see what kind of candidate you think would be a viable third-party contender in 2020.  natesilver : Viable? I’m not saying anything about viable.  clare.malone : Johnson was very flawed, gaffe-prone , not that serious.  natesilver : How about a Generic Rich Celebrity or Generic Rich Business(wo)man?  How about … K A S I C H L O O P E R !  micah : You’re undermining your own argument here.  natesilver : What do you think my argument is?  micah : That a third-party candidate more viable than Gary Johnson is more likely to emerge in 2020 than they were in 2016.  natesilver : Yes.  So how have I undermined my argument?  micah : Your only suggestions are TBD and Kasichlooper!  natesilver : The playing field is going to look like a mess to a lot of people. You arguably have two parties in disarray. And Trump becoming president will make a lot of people think: The Rules Are Broken And Anything Is Possible.  harry : We’re missing a key point here: I’m not sure a third-party candidacy helps Trump.  natesilver : Well, yeah. I’d agree with that too.  micah : Yeah, that was my next question.  harry : So I pulled some data from the 2016 American National Election Studies and the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Elections Study. According to the former, Republicans won the House vote among people who voted for a third-party presidential candidate by 22 percentage points. The House vote was basically a tie among people who voted for Clinton or Trump. According to the latter, voters who cast a ballot for a third-party presidential candidate were 8 points more likely to identify as Republicans than Democrats. Among Clinton or Trump voters, they were 8 points more likely to identify as Democrats than Republicans.  My point being that in 2016, Clinton was probably helped overall by third-party candidates, not Trump.  natesilver : One of the likelier scenarios — not likely, exactly, but not impossible to imagine, either — is a split within the Republican Party.  clare.malone : #Romney  micah : That seems more likely to me than a split in the Democratic coalition, right?  clare.malone : #Romneyexmachina  (I’m kidding, folks. Don’t send me email.)  natesilver : You could imagine the left wing of the Democratic Party nominating its own candidate.  clare.malone : See, that’s interesting.  natesilver : I tend to think the Democratic Party’s nominee will be quite left wing, but we’ll see.  clare.malone : The people who were Bernie Sanders diehards might be underestimated when it comes to splintering off. I think the Democratic chaos is actually pretty deep-seated .  natesilver : But Republicans have the bigger dilemma. Relations between Trump and the Republican Congress are already fraying .  Who wins if the tickets are: Bernie Sanders (Green), Kamala Harris (Democratic), Donald Trump (independent), Mike Pence (Republican).  💥  clare.malone : Pence. ( Shameless plug .)  Harris and Sanders are both popular in their own right, which would split the left vote; Pence is more likely to attract a swath of Republicans that encompass mainstream voters on that side and those on the far right.  micah : It depends.  natesilver : The answer, if I had to guess, is that Harris would win the popular vote with a plurality, and Pence would win the election in the House.  micah : I think Pence wins? I imagine that without the gravity of partisanship, Trump is a pretty weak candidate.  natesilver : In that scenario, I actually wonder whether one of Sanders or Harris eventually drops out, though. Because a three-way race between Trump, an establishment Republican and a generic Democrat is a very, very good scenario for the Democrat.  micah : You can’t change the scenario!  natesilver : I made the scenario, and I shall change it as I want.  micah : Anyway, this whole thing about third-party candidates doesn’t belong in an argument that Trump is on track to win in 2020. Can everyone at least concede that?  clare.malone : I concede that.  harry : I agree with that.  clare.malone : I bet Nate won’t.  micah : CONTRARIAN NATE! Wait for it …  natesilver : I concede.  micah : 🍾🍾  clare.malone : HE JUST DID IT ‘CAUSE I SAID HE WOULDN’T.  micah : Reverse psychology!  natesilver : I concede NOTHING.  harry : Folks, a parade was just thrown in the office.  micah : OK, next point:  Third, despite dismal poll numbers, Trump enters the contest with a job approval rating that is certainly at least marginally better than what the current national polls would suggest.  natesilver : If he’s talking about comparing polls of registered or likely voters to polls of adults, that’s a vaild point.  micah : That, and also that Trump’s national numbers underestimate his strength in battleground states.  harry : Well, we already spoke a little about the battleground states. That’s true … for now.  It’s also true that he’s doing better among voters than among all adults. We track that .  natesilver : Unregistered voters — who show up in polls of adults but not registered voter or likely voter polls — are largely not a Trump-leaning group. So when they drop out of the sample, things get a bit better for him.  harry : The bigger question is what does a 40 percent approval rating among voters — as Trump has now — mean in terms of a vote.  natesilver : Meh, I don’t think that’s such an interesting question.  harry : OH, I think it’s a very important question.  natesilver : Wrong.  harry : It’s the question, perhaps.  natesilver : Wrong.  clare.malone : This is getting to be unreadable.  harry : A lot of people have argued that Trump won the presidency despite poor favorable ratings and that therefore his piss-poor approval ratings don’t mean squat.  I think that’s wrong, but the question is how wrong.  So here’s something I did. I went back to Franklin Roosevelt and took Gallup’s final estimate of an incumbent president’s approval rating (or Nate’s calculation of that ) and ran it against the margin that the incumbent president won or lost by.  natesilver : I think you’re probably making a mistake to conflate approval ratings and favorability ratings . Once you’ve been on the job for four years, voters aren’t liable to vote for you if they think you’re doing a shitty job. Conversely, they might vote for you even if they don’t like you, if you’re not an incumbent and they think they can “take a chance.”  harry : I’m not disagreeing with you, Nathaniel.  micah : 💤  clare.malone : With you, Micah.  natesilver : I think you’re confusing two things, though. What would Trump’s chances be of being re-elected today , Harry?  micah : [Editor’s note: Harry is yelling at us via verbal slack.]  harry : But what’s interesting to me is that when you run my calculation, you get Trump losing by a little over 3 percentage points with an approval rating of 40 percent. That’s not much different from what he lost by in 2016. It also comes with a large enough margin of error to be quite uncertain. I have NO idea what Trump’s approval rating will be on Election Day 2020. I have no clue if it will be up or down. I’m just saying that a president with an approval rating of 40 percent among voters is not doomed. He’s not in a great position, but it’s not awful.  micah : 💤  j/k … I agree with Harry — this is an important question: Trump won, in no small part, because a lot of people who didn’t like him still voted for him . To what extent that will hold true in future election is important.  harry : I’m so sorry I tried to inform our audience. Maybe I should just go home.  micah : Last point:  Fourth, Trump’s support has largely remained durable with a core group of supporters.  Go ahead, Nate.  This is one of your hobby horses.  natesilver : #actually  harry : I hate all of us.  natesilver : This is a myth — Trump’s strong approval rating has actually fallen quite a bit .  harry : I agree.  Great chat, folks.  LOL  natesilver : There’s also evidence that his support has fallen some even among rural, working-class voters:     Now — it is true that some of those voters — maybe most of them — might come back to Trump when he has a Democratic opponent.  clare.malone : That’s what I think is the case.  harry : This actually ties in with the point earlier about third-party candidates. There are a number of folks who will not vote Democratic but would be willing to vote for a conservative third-party candidate.  micah : But we’re also talking about the Obama-Trump voters .  Or our reluctant Trump voters .  Trump can’t win with only his diehards.  And I don’t think the Democratic nominee will necessarily be a non-starter for those more marginal Trump voters.  clare.malone : Roger that. Who cares about his base, on some level.  micah : Well, electorally, yes.  OK, to wrap …  This argument that Trump is on track to win re-election basically boils down to:   Trump doesn’t need to win the popular vote.  A third-party candidate could come out of left field and help him.  Trump’s not as unpopular as you think.  Trump’s base support is inviolate.   No. 4 is wrong. No. 2 could happen, but it’s not particularly likely or more likely than a third-party candidate hurting Trump. Nos. 1 and 3 are true, but … I guess what I’d say is that if your argument is “it’s not that bad,” doesn’t that suggest it’s still pretty bad? A disadvantage not being fatal doesn’t make it an advantage.  I’d 100 percent sign on to an argument along the lines of “Trump could still very much win in 2020” or “Democrats are by no means guaranteed a win in 2020” or “it’s easy to overrate how much trouble Trump is in.”  harry : I don’t think Trump is on track to win re-election. It’s not good.  clare.malone : Yeah, I think the headline of the piece really oversold it, but that’s not the author’s fault per se.  natesilver : I think there’s a much better argument for why Trump is a favorite: Trump is an incumbent, incumbents usually win, and even though he’s unpopular now, there’s a long way to go and his approval ratings now don’t predict much about what they’ll be in 2020.  micah : That last part is true?  harry : Agree with that latter part, and approval ratings tend to revert to the mean in the long run.  natesilver : Like if you called a “snap” election in five weeks between Trump and Joe Biden, I’m pretty sure that Biden would win. Trump vs. Biden in 2020 is a different story (maybe).  micah : OK, so to end … Trump vs. the field … who you got?  clare.malone : I think THE ROCK is just going to be my standard answer every time this question is hurled at us in chats.  But to answer that more seriously … I think I take the field.  natesilver : Well, to come full circle here … I’m not sure how likely Trump is to finish his term and be the GOP nominee again. Conditional on doing so, he might be, say, a very slight (51 percent? 55 percent? 60 percent?) favorite to win re-election. But the times when Trump is in real trouble, he probably doesn’t run or even loses the GOP nomination.  harry : I’ll take the field.  micah : The Rock vs. the field?  clare.malone : THE ROCK!

Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter       Politics    Sports    Science & Health    Economics    Culture    ESPN    Politics Podcast: FBI Raids Trump’s Lawyer’s Office             Will Donald Trump Be Impeached?     By Nate Silver  Filed under Impeachment  Published May 22, 2017     Facebook Twitter Email                 Getty images     A fter a cacophonous two weeks of political news, a new sound has begun to emerge from Washington: the word “impeachment.” Following the news that President Trump may have tried to bully FBI director James Comey out of investigating Michael Flynn’s ties to Russia, Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent, told CNN that recent allegations, if true, are already making impeachment hearings more likely. Rep. Al Green, a Democrat from Texas, became the first congressman to call for Trump’s impeachment from the House floor. And even some Republicans in blue-leaning districts, such as Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida, have begun to entertain impeachment as a possibility.  This might all seem like a liberal fantasy: No president has ever been booted out of the job, and only Richard Nixon resigned under the pressure of the impeachment process.  But people putting money on the line are taking impeachment seriously. According to the prediction market Betfair, the chance that Trump will fail to serve out his four-year term is about 50 percent (!). There’s even a 20 to 25 percent probability (!!) that Trump doesn’t finish out 2017 in office, these bettors reckon.  Are those numbers within the realm of reason? It isn’t easy to forecast Trump’s odds of impeachment, or of his removal from office. There isn’t enough data to build a statistical model of it, in the way we would for an election. But we can say that there are two opposite forces tugging strongly on the impeachment rope:   On the one side, there’s Trump’s escalating pattern of (alleged) misconduct, which increasingly reflects behavior that has been used as grounds for impeachment in the past.  On the other side, there’s the intense partisan loyalty of Republicans , both among GOP members of Congress and among voters in the states and districts they represent.   So long as these sides are pulling with roughly equal force, Trump isn’t going to be removed from office, which would require a two-thirds majority in the Senate. But if something snaps — if Republicans have reason to think Trump has become a liability even in red states — look out. History suggests Trump could be vulnerable under such circumstances, despite the historical rarity of impeachment. Here’s how to think about the chances.   I f Trump left office early, he of course wouldn’t be the first president to do so. There are various ways a president’s term can end prematurely. But some of the possibilities apart from impeachment are fairly remote.  Eight presidents died during their terms. While that possibility can’t be ruled out for Trump, the odds of it are relatively low. Actuarial tables show that a 70-year-old American man (Trump’s age) has only about a 10 percent chance of dying over his next four years. 1      YEAR  PRESIDENT  TERM  TIME OF TERM SERVED  REASON      1841  Harrison  1st  31 days  Natural death    1850  Taylor  1st  1 year, 4 months  Natural death*    1865  Lincoln  2nd  42 days  Assassination    1881  Garfield  1st  7 months  Assassination    1901  McKinley  2nd  6 months  Assassination    1923  Harding  1st  2 years, 5 months  Natural death    1945  Roosevelt  4th  3 months  Natural death    1963  Kennedy  1st  2 years, 10 months  Assassination    1974  Nixon  2nd  1 year, 7 months  Resignation    Which presidents failed to serve out their terms?    * Although a handful of scholars contend that Taylor was poisoned, this is not the consensus view.  Source: historyinpieces.com    Trump could also quit the job for reasons other than the pressure of impeachment — deciding he wanted to spend more time at Mar-a-Lago, for instance. But American elected officials have generally held onto their jobs even when things are going pretty badly . Among U.S. governors since 2000, for example, I could find only one case — Alaska’s Sarah Palin in 2009 — of someone who resigned her position early without being in the midst of a major scandal or having another political job (such as an ambassadorship or Cabinet position) already lined up. 2      YEAR  STATE  GOVERNOR  REASON      2000  Missouri  Mel Carnahan  Died in office    2000  Texas  George W.

Source: Wikipedia    There’s also the prospect of Section 4 of the 25th Amendment being invoked against Trump, which would make Vice President Pence the acting president if Trump were “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” But this isn’t the shortcut that it might seem . Under the 25th Amendment, Trump could be replaced on an interim basis if both Pence and a majority of Cabinet officers agreed that he were unfit for office. But if Trump disputed the finding, it would require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of Congress to keep Trump from returning to the Oval Office. 3  So let’s talk about impeachment. Although if we’re being more precise, impeachment doesn’t remove a president from office; conviction on impeachment charges does. Just to be clear about our terminology:   Impeachment is the sole authority of the House of Representatives and requires a simple majority vote. Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached by the House.  The Senate then holds an impeachment trial and essentially acts as the jury, voting on whether or not to convict the president and remove him from office ; it takes a two-thirds majority (67 of 100 votes) to do so. Neither Johnson nor Clinton was convicted by the Senate, although it came down to one vote in Johnson’s case. The Senate can also vote to bar an impeached president from holding office again.   Although no president has been removed from office, Nixon resigned under the threat of removal, and he probably would have been removed in the absence of his resignation. 4 So he should probably count as a “victim” of the impeachment process.  Even so, that’s only 1 of 44 previous presidencies — and 1 of 57 previous presidential terms — to end in the president’s termination. Therefore, you might think the chance of Trump being removed from office is very low. But it’s not that simple.  The issue is that among the 44 prior presidents, not all that many were plausible candidates for impeachment and removal; there was never any real basis to impeach Dwight Eisenhower, for instance. Instead, the relevant question is how many presidents were removed from office (or compelled to resign) out of the share of presidents who engaged in behavior comparable to Trump’s . If only Trump and Nixon had reached a certain level of “impeachability,” for instance, then the empirical evidence wouldn’t be comforting for Trump; rather, it would suggest that the only president who previously reached that threshold of malfeasance had lost his job.     Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached by the House.  Getty Images    To provide evidence against Trump being removed, the data would instead have to contain examples of presidents who could have been removed from office, but weren’t. For instance, it might be relevant that there were never serious efforts to impeach Ronald Reagan for the Iran-Contra scandal. In fact, the Democratic leadership in Congress went somewhat out of their way to avoid actions that could lead to impeachment proceedings against Reagan. Why was that, exactly? One could come up with a variety of plausible theories: that the scandal wasn’t severe enough; that Reagan wasn’t personally involved enough; that Reagan’s popularity insulated him from impeachment; that Reagan enjoyed good relations with Congress at a period of relatively low partisanship, and so forth.  In a perfect world, we’d have data on hundreds of presidents, a few dozen of whom had been impeached. That would let us statistically identify the various factors that made a president more or less likely to survive the process. In the real world, the best we can do is make some educated guesses. Based on the precedents we have available — and our overall knowledge of the American political system — I would expect the following factors to be important in determining a president’s likelihood of removal or resignation:      The seriousness of the alleged offenses . Does the president’s behavior fall under the constitutional category of “high crimes and misdemeanors?” Have similar behaviors been the basis for impeachment proceedings in the past?  The partisanship of pivotal votes in Congress . How much partisanship is there in Congress? Other things held equal, how likely is the decisive 67th senator to vote to remove a president from his own party?  The president’s popularity . What are the president’s approval ratings? Does the public think he should be impeached? Has there been a “mandate” delivered by midterm elections or special elections? What do his numbers look like in states and congressional districts where members of Congress are on the fence about how to vote?  The president’s relationship with Congress. Does the president generally have good relations with congressional leadership? Is his party’s legislative agenda intact? Does Congress feel as though the balance of power has been upset? Is the president cooperating with investigations into his conduct, or antagonizing Congress instead?  Party control of Congress . Which party controls the House and — less importantly for impeachment purposes — the Senate?  The line of succession. Who would take over for the president? Do leaders of the president’s party regard the replacement as an acceptable — or even preferable — alternative to the president?     Let’s consider each of these factors in Trump’s case.     Factor 1  The seriousness of the alleged offenses     Nixon resigned under the threat of removal — and he probably would have been removed in the absence of his resignation.  getty images    I n 1970, Gerald Ford (then a U.S. representative, and later the president) said rather cynically that “an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers [it] to be at a given moment in history.” While impeachment is undeniably a political process rather than a legal one, Ford’s interpretation is probably too reductionist. Congress has historically used its powers somewhat judiciously and drawn fairly fine distinctions between different grounds for impeachment.  In 1974 , for instance, the House Judiciary Committee recommended impeachment for Nixon on three charges — obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress. But it overwhelmingly rejected recommending impeachment on two other charges related to Nixon’s bombing of Cambodia and his failure to pay taxes . Similarly, in 1998, the House impeached Clinton on two charges — perjury and obstruction of justice — but it rejected an abuse of power charge by a 148–285 margin.  It’s perhaps also noteworthy that neither George W. Bush nor Barack Obama was subjected to serious attempts at impeachment despite facing highly partisan opposition in Congress. They might have done lots of things their adversaries disliked, but nothing that House Speakers Nancy Pelosi, John Boehner and Paul Ryan were willing to call a firing offense.  That’s not to say the correlation between the inherent “impeachability” of the president’s conduct and Congress’s likelihood of action has been perfect, by any means. Congress may exaggerate or underplay the severity of charges for partisan reasons — many scholars argue that Clinton and Johnson’s impeachments were overreaches of congressional power, for instance. But the underlying facts of the case have mattered to some extent.     Neither George W. Bush nor Barack Obama was subjected to serious attempts at impeachment despite facing highly partisan opposition in Congress.  Getty images    So what does that mean for Trump? The Constitution provides that, “The president, vice president and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” While liberals and anti-Trump Republicans have sometimes accused Trump of “treason” for his dealings with Russia, he almost certainly hasn’t committed treason by the letter of the Constitution . 5  The good news for Trump ends there, however. While the term “high crimes and misdemeanors” might seem hopelessly vague, it has a fair amount of legal history and is generally regarded as referring to political crimes (“crimes against the state”) as opposed to personal affairs. A drunk driving conviction might not qualify as a “high crime,” for instance. But an action that wasn’t illegal per se but reflected an abuse of the president’s office could count as one. That Trump almost certainly did not commit a criminal offense in reportedly disclosing highly classified information to Russia would not necessarily protect him from an impeachment charge on those grounds, for example.  But the bigger problem for Trump is probably Comey, in that firing him might have constituted obstruction of justice . Obstruction of justice is about the last accusation that a president wants on his radar if he fears impeachment; it was one of the two charges that the House used to impeach Clinton and one of the three charges that the House Judiciary Committee recommended against Nixon.  One more thing to keep in mind: The Trump presidency is only four months old. Congress has yet not done all that much to investigate his affairs, and special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Trump’s ties to Russia was just announced last week — and yet Trump has already gotten himself in quite a lot of trouble. What might seem like tenuous reasons for impeachment now could could turn out to be just the tip of the iceberg.  The bottom line: If Congress is looking for reasons to impeach Trump, it already has some plausible ones — and it will probably wind up with more before long. This factor substantially contributes to the likelihood of Trump being removed from office.    Factor 2 The partisanship of pivotal votes in Congress     President Trump talks with Republican Rep. Peter King of New York after addressing a joint session of Congress in February.  Getty images    C ongress is at a high tide in terms of both partisan polarization and ideological division. FiveThirtyEight’s Trump Score shows that in the House, the average Republican has sided with Trump 97 percent of the time on votes on which the White House has articulated a position; the average Democrat has done so only 15 percent of the time. (The discrepancy has been nearly as wide in the Senate .) And according to the statistical system DW-Nominate , the ideological gap between the parties has continued to widen; Democrats have gotten more liberal and ( to an even greater extent ) Republicans have gotten more conservative.  While measures such as DW-Nominate and our Trump Score have their imperfections, 6 my colleagues Julia Azari, Perry Bacon Jr. and Harry Enten found that they historically provided a pretty good guide to impeachment voting patterns. In other words, it’s reasonable to infer that because Congress is highly polarized on almost every other issue, it probably also would be polarized on impeachment and removal votes. This would seem to have three major consequences for Trump:   It makes impeachment less likely in the near term, because Republicans control the House.  It makes impeachment (but not Trump’s removal from office) more likely if Democrats take over the House in 2019. Partisanship might compel Democrats to impeach Trump even if the political or legal rationale for doing so is dubious.  Most importantly, it makes Trump’s removal from office much less likely, other factors held equal. Even if all 48 Senate Democrats 7 voted to remove Trump, they’d also need support from 19 Republicans to get to a two-thirds majority. That would require dipping far into the Republican ranks — well past the few moderates in the Senate — and the decisive 67th vote would have to come from a fairly conservative Republican like Missouri’s Roy Blunt or South Dakota’s John Thune instead. This isn’t going to change much in 2019, even if Democrats have a great midterm election.   At the same time, we shouldn’t conclude that partisanship provides Trump with absolute protection against removal from office. As an empirical matter, we don’t have much data on what factor would win out if the case for impeachment were very strong (say, if Mueller uncovered that Trump had accepted bribes from Russia) but partisanship were also very high.  There’s also some question as to where partisanship might lead congressional Republicans if they conclude that a Trump presidency isn’t in the best interests of the GOP. Trump hasn’t been a Republican for all that long , and it isn’t clear how invested he is in the Republican agenda or how competent he is to execute it. Republicans have a poor track record of standing up to Trump , but during the election campaign, the alternative was either to invite chaos (since Marco Rubio and other candidates weren’t clicking with voters ) or to elect Hillary Clinton. Now their alternative is Pence — or Ryan if Pence were also impeached. A lot of Republican members of Congress might view Pence or Ryan as an upgrade on Trump.  The bottom line: Partisanship is the biggest protection that Trump has against impeachment. If you see Republicans start to break with Trump in more substantive ways, such as by launching special committees or holding up his replacement for Comey, he might have more reason for concern. But overall this factor substantially reduces the likelihood of Trump being removed from office.    Factor 3 The president’s popularity     Patrons at a bar watching the Iran-Contra hearings. Reagan had an approval rating of around 50 percent even after the Iran-Contra scandal was revealed. Democratic efforts to impeach him could easily have wound up backfiring.  Getty images    M embers of Congress are loyal to their president, but there’s one thing they usually care about even more: their own re-election. Presidential popularity has a strong influence on congressional races . Beyond a certain point, a president can become toxic enough that it’s in the interest of members of his own party to abandon him. Nixon, for instance, had an approval rating in the mid-20s at the time of his resignation in 1974. Republicans endured a 48-seat loss in the House even after he resigned. But they might have taken an even worse loss if he’d stayed in office. Based on my colleague Harry Enten’s formula , Republicans would have expected to lose around 60 seats if Nixon were still president, given his approval rating.  By contrast, Reagan had an approval rating of around 50 percent even after the Iran-Contra scandal was revealed. Democratic efforts to impeach him could easily have wound up backfiring. Twelve years later, Republicans learned this the hard way, losing House seats in the 1998 midterms 8 in the midst of their attempt to impeach Clinton, whose approval rating exceeded 60 percent.  Trump’s popularity is in a somewhat awkward middle ground. With an approval rating of about 39 percent , he’s no Clinton or Reagan. But he isn’t late-stage Nixon, either. Trump is not very popular, but he was never all that popular to begin with and won the Electoral College despite it. It’s not clear that all that many voters have regrets about their decision to vote for Trump, at least not yet. And few polls have asked voters whether they think Trump should be impeached.  At the same time, the idea that 39 or 40 percent of the country will never abandon Trump is probably mistaken — or at least, it represents a speculative interpretation of the evidence. The share of voters who say they strongly support Trump is only 20 to 25 percent — and those numbers have been falling . Moreover, Trump has lost about one point off his overall approval rating per month. That might not sound like a lot, but if the pattern continued, he’d be in the low-to-mid 30s by the new year and into Nixonian territory by the midterms.  There are a couple of further complications. One issue is that while Trump is fairly unpopular overall, his numbers are holding up better in red states — and red-state senators represent the pivotal votes for Trump’s removal from office. The table below reflects my estimate of Trump’s current approval rating in each state based on recent state-by-state approval-rating polls and the 2016 and 2012 election results.       STATE  APPROVAL RATING  DISAPPROVAL RATING    STATE  APPROVAL RATING  DISAPPROVAL RATING      1  Hawaii  26%  68%   26  Arizona  42%  52%    2  Vermont  28  66   27  Ohio  42  52    3  Calif.  28  66   28  Iowa  42  52    4  Maryland  29  65   29  Georgia  42  51    5  Mass.  29  65   30  Texas  44  49    6  N.Y.  30  64   31  S.C.  45  48    7  R.I.  32  61   32  Alaska  46  48    8  Illinois  33  61   33  Mississippi  46  47    9  Washington  34  60   34  Missouri  47  47    10  N.J.  34  60   35  Indiana  47  47    11  Conn.  34  60   36  Montana  48  46    12  Delaware  35  59   37  Louisiana  48  46    13  Oregon  35  58   38  Kansas  48  45    14  N.M.  36  57   39  Nebraska  50  44    15  Maine  37  56   40  Tennessee  50  44    16  Colorado  38  56   41  Utah  50  43    17  Virginia  38  56   42  Arkansas  50  43    18  Nevada  39  55   43  Alabama  51  43    19  Minnesota  39  55   44  S.D.  51  43    20  Michigan  39  55   45  Kentucky  51  42    21  N.H.  39  55   46  N.D.  53  41    22  Wisconsin  39  54   47  Idaho  53  41    23  Penn.  40  54   48  Oklahoma  54  39    24  Florida  40  54   49  W.Va.  55  38    25  N.C.  41  53   50  Wyoming  58  35    Estimating approval and disapproval of Trump by state    These estimates are based on a regression analysis, where the independent variable is the Republican margin of victory or defeat in the 2016 and 2012 presidential elections, weighted 3:1 in favor of 2016. The dependent variable is Trump’s approval rating (or disapproval rating) in each state, based on state-by-state approval rating polls conducted within the past two months (since March 20), as listed at PollingReport.com and Wikipedia. State-by-state estimates are calibrated such that Trump’s overall numbers, weighted by the number of voters in each state, are a 39 percent approval rating and a 55 percent disapproval rating, matching his national approval and disapproval ratings as of Saturday morning.    If voting in the Senate strictly abided by Trump’s popularity, the 67th vote to remove Trump from office would come from Missouri. (Two-thirds of states are bluer than Missouri and one-third are redder.) But in Missouri, I estimate, Trump’s numbers are roughly breakeven, with about 47 percent of Missourians approving of his performance and 47 percent opposed. I wouldn’t expect Missouri’s senators, Blunt and Democrat Claire McCaskill, to be eager to kick Trump out of office under those circumstances.  Another issue is that it might be a leap of faith for Republicans to impeach Trump on the basis of polling data, given that trust in polls is relatively low right now. I have some … complicated feelings about this . The mainstream media screwed up its interpretation of polls throughout 2016 , misreporting surveys that showed a close and competitive Electoral College race as indicating surefire Clinton victory. At the same time, polls have a real-world margin of error that exceeds their purported margin of error , and Trump’s numbers are slightly better among people who vote than they are among the country overall. Congress could wait for unambiguous evidence that the public had turned on Trump, whether in the form of very poor polling numbers (say, approval ratings in the low 30s) or inexcusable election results (such as in the upcoming special elections in Montana and Georgia, or in a big Republican loss at the midterms). Until we see one or both of those things, I wouldn’t expect Trump to be under that much pressure of impeachment.  The bottom line: For the time being, this factor contributes only modestly to the likelihood of Trump being removed from office. Trump is unpopular, but his numbers are not unsalvageable (several presidents have come back from similar ratings to win a second term). A further deterioration in his popularity would imply that he is unpopular even in red states, however, and would greatly increase the risk to Trump.    Factor 4 The president’s relationship with Congress     The House impeachment committee that tried President Andrew Johnson after he removed Edwin Stanton from office.  Getty images    T his is not a factor that I’d thought a lot about originally. But when you review the scholarship on impeachment and consider the historical evidence, its importance becomes obvious. Impeachment cases have usually involved an element of conflict between the president and the legislative branch.  This is most obvious in the case of Johnson, whose impeachment was the result of a plain-old turf war with Congress. In 1867, Congress had passed something called the Tenure of Office Act , which was supposed to prevent the president from firing Cabinet officers without the Senate’s consent. Johnson fired Secretary of War Edwin Stanton anyway in a direct challenge to the act’s legitimacy. The House impeached him as a result. The Tenure of Office Act was later repealed — and in 1926, posthumously declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court — but it had invited a confrontation with Johnson, and he had obliged.  Contempt of Congress was also one of the articles of impeachment that the House Judiciary Committee recommended against Nixon after he failed to cooperate with congressional subpoenas during the Watergate investigation. And pissing matches between the president and Congress have been the basis of some near-misses in the impeachment process; there were some fairly serious attempts to impeach John Tyler over his use of presidential vetoes, for example.  For the time being, Trump has a cordial relationship with Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (Though that hasn’t always been the case .) The GOP still has hopes of passing major legislation, including health care and tax-reform bills, and that requires cooperation between the White House and Congress. But one can imagine Trump doing various things to antagonize Congress, from Twitter rants against congressional leadership to refusing to comply with the requests of congressional investigators. Firing Comey — who was confirmed 93-1 by the Senate in 2013 — may also have been a risky move in this respect. From Johnson to Harry Truman — who drew calls for impeachment after dismissing General Douglas MacArthur in 1951 — high-profile firings have sometimes prompted members of Congress to ask for the president’s head.  The bottom line: For the time being, this factor doesn’t contribute much to the likelihood of Trump being removed from office. But Trump’s history of escalating conflict and failing to respect boundaries could antagonize Congress and contribute to the likelihood of impeachment in the future, especially if the GOP’s agenda is in disrepair. History suggests that Congress takes that stuff personally, and it probably should, since the impeachment process is part of the Constitution’s system of checks and balances.    Factor 5 Party control of Congress     Impeachment proceedings against Johnson, Nixon and Clinton all took place when the opposition party controlled the House. Carl Albert (above) was the speaker of the House while the Watergate scandal was unfolding.  getty images    I mpeachment proceedings against Johnson, Nixon and Clinton all took place when the opposition party controlled the House. But is it something close to an ironclad rule that a president won’t be impeached when his party runs the House, or just a statistical pattern from a small sample of data?  Imagine, for example, that by this point next year, almost all Democrats in the House want to impeach Trump, and so do about three dozen Republicans — enough to constitute an overall majority. But Republicans are still in charge of the House, and Ryan and other members of the leadership are firmly opposed to an impeachment vote. Moreover, the House Judiciary Committee — which has traditionally run point on the impeachment process — is opposed. 9 Would the pro-impeachment members have any basis to force Ryan’s hand?  The short answer is … maybe, but Ryan and company could make their task a lot harder. I asked Sarah Binder , a professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, about what might happen if a narrow majority of Congress wanted to impeach Trump but the Republican leadership didn’t.  “This is one of those cases where we can outline a set of procedural steps to an impeachment vote, and yet have a hard time actually seeing this happen,” Binder said in an email. Possible routes could include members of Congress raising questions of privilege or filing a discharge petition . “But the key is whether the cross-party impeachment majority would really stick together” through numerous procedural votes and barriers thrown up by Ryan, she said. “I think that’s a very steep hurdle.”  One might raise a sophisticated objection here: Sure, control of the House could matter if there were only a narrow majority in favor of impeachment. But what if there were a large majority instead — enough that Trump was not only under threat of impeachment but also removal by a two-thirds vote in the Senate? Could Ryan & Co. really resist that kind of pressure?  We’re deep into speculative territory, but it’s worth remembering that legislative voting tactics are complicated. Members of a party tend to stick together, until the wheels come off — and even then the wagon sometimes gets repaired again. Consider, for instance, how the Republicans’ health care bill was initially presumed to be almost certain to pass the House, then was pulled from the floor in March , and then was passed this month as both moderates and the conservative Freedom Caucus returned to the fold.  It’s plausible, in other words, that Ryan and the House Judiciary Committee could keep the impeachment genie in the bottle, even if impeachment would prevail by a fairly clear majority if a vote came to the floor and members were left to their own devices.  Control of the Senate is less important, insofar as the Senate would have to try the impeachment charges whether or not they wanted to. And per the Constitution, the trial would be overseen by Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts rather than by the Senate leadership.  The bottom line: A Democratic takeover of the House — perhaps an even-money proposition — is not quite a prerequisite for Trump’s impeachment and removal, but it would greatly increase the odds. It would also give the Democrats far greater powers to investigate Trump and to subpoena key materials, which could create additional bases for impeachment charges.    Factor 6 The line of succession     Pence in next in line. Then comes Ryan.  Getty images    I n 1868, Republicans in Congress had the power to replace Andrew Johnson, a Democrat who had run with Abraham Lincoln on the National Union ticket, with a Republican president. And there was absolutely nothing Democrats could do about it.  The circumstances were unusual . Johnson had ascended to the presidency after Lincoln’s assassination, and the vice presidency was vacant. Instead, the line of succession 10  would have given the presidency to the Republican Benjamin Wade , the president pro tempore of the Senate. Republicans had an overwhelming majority in the Senate in the midst of Reconstruction, so they didn’t need any Democratic votes to convict Johnson and replace him with Wade.  Republicans didn’t quite do it; instead the vote was 35-19 in favor of conviction, one short of the number needed. But the prospect of a Wade presidency was an influential factor in determining senators’ votes , encouraging Radical Republicans to vote to convict Johnson (since Wade was a fellow Radical) but discouraging moderates from doing so.  While Johnson may have been an extreme case, it’s reasonable to assume that the identity of the president’s successor is a factor in the impeachment calculus. Pence is more conservative than Trump and was widely praised by GOP leaders at the time he became Trump’s running mate; he’s also a more predictable politician than Trump and formerly held a leadership position in the Republican-led House. He also has decent favorability ratings , at least for the time being. In short, Republicans have some reasons to prefer Pence to Trump, which could make removing Trump more palatable. (Of course, that’s assuming that Pence isn’t implicated in any sort of scandal himself .)  The bottom line: If the theory is that you shouldn’t hire a well-qualified understudy because he makes your job more vulnerable, then Trump made a mistake in picking Pence as his running mate. Pence isn’t popular with everyone, but he’s likely to be broadly acceptable to Republicans in the House and Senate, and they’re the ones with impeachment votes. Articles like this one , in which Republicans begin to “whisper” about the probability of a President Pence, should be seen as a bearish indicator for Trump.     Trump’s firing of Comey might have constituted obstruction of justice, one of the two charges that the House used to impeach Clinton and one of the three charges that the House Judiciary Committee recommended against Nixon.  getty images     A ll that work … and I’m still not going to give you a precise number for how likely Trump is to lose his job. That’s because this is a thought experiment and not a mathematical model 11 . I do think I owe you a range, however. I’m pretty sure I’d sell Trump-leaves-office-early stock (whether because of removal from office or other reasons) at even money (50 percent), and I’m pretty sure I’d buy it at 3-to-1 against (25 percent). I could be convinced by almost any number within that range.  The easiest-to-imagine scenario for Trump being removed is if Republicans get clobbered in the midterms after two years of trying to defend Trump, the Republican agenda is in shambles, Democrats begin impeachment proceedings in early 2019, and just enough Republicans decide that Pence (or some fresh face with no ties to the Trump White House) gives them a better shot to avoid total annihilation in 2020.  In some sense, then, the most important indicators of Trump’s impeachment odds are the ones you’d always use to monitor the political environment: presidential approval ratings , the generic congressional ballot and (if taken with appropriate grains of salt) special election results . What makes this time a little different is that if Republicans think the ship is sinking, impeachment may give them an opportunity to throw their president overboard first.  CLARIFICATION (May 22, 1:33 p.m.): A previous version of this article described imprecisely Rep. Angus King’s comments about Trump’s impeachment prospects. The paragraph has been updated.     Footnotes   You’d also need to account for some possibility of an unnatural death — by assassination or in a terrorist attack, for instance.  Palin had a minor scandal brewing surrounding the dismissal of Alaska’s public safety commissioner. But it reportedly wasn’t the direct cause of her decision to leave office.  And even if Congress got that supermajority, it wouldn’t technically remove Trump from office: Pence would still be serving as acting president rather than president. For this reason, it’s not clear whether the various betting markets would classify the invocation of the 25th Amendment as Trump having left office prematurely. If you’re inclined to put money down on these things, it’s probably a good idea to check the fine print of the contract.  On July 29, 1974, 28 out of 38 members (74 percent) of the House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach Nixon on abuse of power charges, suggesting that a large majority of the overall House would also have done so. And Nixon’s tenuous chances of avoiding conviction from the Senate were undermined by the release of the “smoking gun” tape on August 5, which proved that Nixon had sought to cover up the Watergate break-in. Facing a further collapse in his support, Nixon resigned four days later.  The reason is simple: A treason charge requires that the U.S. be at war with a country (or a non-state entity such as al-Qaida) and the U.S. is not at war with Russia.  They don’t capture behavior on bills that never make it to the floor because they face congressional opposition, for instance.  Including the two independent senators who caucus with the Democrats.  This was one of only two occasions since 1938 when the opposition party failed to gain House seats at the midterms; the other was in 2002, when Republicans gained seats as Bush’s popularity soared after the Sept. 11 attacks.  The Republicans on the Judiciary Committee are a very conservative bunch.  The line of succession has since changed to put the speaker of the House ahead of the president of the Senate  And I’ve gotten burned before on the whole “subjective odds” thing .

Eduardo Munoz Alvarez—AFP/Getty Images        By Lucinda Shen  November 9, 2016       How much could you have made had you bet that the political outsider Donald Trump would have taken the White House?  Many, including professional gambler Paul Krishnamurty, lost after Trump’s upset Tuesday night. Krishnamurty said he lost about $15,000 on online betting site, Betfair.  He, like political pollsters and many of his fellow professional gamblers, expected Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to take the White House as election results were reported last night.  “I was supremely confident. I though she was going to win by a landslide. When the results were first coming in, I was extremely confident,” he told Fortune . Krishnamurty is also an analyst at Betfair and runs the blog, the Political Gambler . “[Trump’s win] was 1,000 time less likely than Brexit. I was arguing that Trump had no chance.”      But the tables turned at 9:30 p.m. EST Tuesday, as Georgia announced that its electoral votes had gone to Trump, and more and more swing states sided with the GOP candidate.  Yet one Betfair gambler was confident in a Trump victory, with a future that had been widely considered “delusional ” and improbable . He was the biggest winner over the presidential elections, collecting $2.5 million through the course of the campaign, according to U.K.-based Betfair. The customer made several bets as the odds of a Trump presidency continued to shift with polls and events. The customer, who wished to remain anonymous, made his or her first bet following the Iowa caucuses in February.  The odds of a Trump win closed from around 25 to 1 in August 2015 when he first announced his campaign, or a return 25 times the initial investment, according to Krishnamurty, down to 6 to 4 ahead of the first presidential debate, and 5 to 1 on Tuesday night.    Among online betters, Trump was considered highly unlikely to become president, according to Betfair. Roughly 40% of cash staked on the elections fell in favor of a Clinton win, and most polls leading up to election night on Tuesday ruled in Clinton’s favor.  And what if gamblers had decided to bet on Trump winning particular states? After all, the now president elect managed, against all odds, to break through the “blue wall,” claiming both Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.  According to Ladbrokes’ Shaddick, customers likely won the most by betting that Pennsylvania would be claimed by Trump. It would likely result in a few thousand dollars at most, he said, since those bets tend to be risker, leading individuals to bet less.          Individuals who bet on Trump taking Pennsylvania last night would have earned four times their initial investment, Shaddick said .  Similarly, those who bet that Michigan or Wisconsin would go to Trump last night would’ve also earned four times their initial stake on Betfair.

The tracker, which takes an average of the last eight polls, put Trump's approval rating on 42.3 per cent on March 23. The last time this figure was so high was on 9 May 2018 - the day of Comey's controversial dismissal.  The year since Donald Trump's election has been packed with controversy and intrigue but, underneath it all, few people seem to have really changed their minds about America's 45th President.

By JOSH KATZ   UPDATED November 8, 2016     The Upshot’s presidential forecast, updated with each new poll.             Alaska  Ariz.  Colo.  Fla.  Ga.  Ind.  Iowa  Miss.  Mo.  N.C.  N.H.  Nev.  Ohio  Pa.  Wis.          The estimates on this page are based on pre-election polls. For an estimate including results, The Times is providing live forecasts on election night.   President  Senate  House         Hillary Clinton has an  85% chance to win.  Last updated Tuesday, November  8 at 10:20 PM ET      Chance of winning     85%  Hillary Clinton     15%  Donald J. Trump              Forecast history ↘  Recent changes ↘  State by state ↘  Other forecasts ↘  Likely scenarios ↘  Explore paths ↘       The Upshot’s elections model suggests that Hillary Clinton is favored to win the presidency, based on the latest state and national polls . A victory by Mr. Trump remains possible: Mrs. Clinton’s chance of losing is about the same as the probability that an N.F.L. kicker misses a 37-yard field goal .    For months, we’ve been updating our estimates with each new poll. Today, it’s Election Day, what we’ve all been waiting for, and there will be no more updates. You can chart different paths to victory below. Here’s how our estimates have changed over time:            Where the Race Has Shifted #    To understand what is driving the national trend, it’s worth taking a look at the states where the winning probabilities have changed most over the last two weeks:                The Democrats have a 52% chance of winning the Senate →      State-by-State Estimates #    To forecast each party’s chance of winning the presidency, our model calculates vote estimates for each state and the District of Columbia, as well as congressional districts in Maine and Nebraska, which assign electoral votes by district.    In the table below, we have divided the country into groups based on each area’s voting history relative to the nation since 2004. Our forecast in places that tend to vote …         * Maine and Nebraska award two electoral votes to the statewide winner and a single electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district.             How Other Forecasts Compare #    The New York Times is one of many news organizations to publish election ratings or forecasts. Some, like FiveThirtyEight or the Princeton Election Consortium , use statistical models, as The Times does; others, like the Cook Political Report , rely on reporting and knowledgeable experts’ opinions. PredictWise uses information from betting markets.    We compile and standardize these ratings every day into one scoreboard for comparison. First, every organization’s estimate for who will win the presidency:               NYT       538       HuffPost       PW       PEC       DK       Cook       Roth. 1       Sabato           Note: The 538 model shown is its default (polls-only) forecast. Qualitative ratings reflect the rating for the state in the middle of each organization’s forecast, weighted by electoral votes.      Second, each organization’s state-by-state ratings. Viewed together, the differences between the models become much clearer.      We’re showing just the most competitive states by default.
