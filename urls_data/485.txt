All these combine to tell you what you scores are required to get into University of California, Los Angeles.    Average SAT: 1370 (Old: 1947)   The average SAT score composite at UCLA is a 1370 .  On the old 2400 SAT , this corresponds to an average SAT score of 1947 .    UCLA SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)  The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1250, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 1500.

If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 Average GPA: 4.31   The average GPA at UCLA is 4.31 . This makes UCLA Extremely Competitive for GPAs.   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.  With a GPA of 4.31, UCLA
      
      requires you to be at the top of your class . You'll need nearly straight A's in all your classes to compete with other applicants. You should also have taken plenty of AP or IB classes to show your ability to excel in academic challenge.  If you're a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change from this point on. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 4.31, you'll need a higher SAT score to compensate and show that you're prepared to take on college academics. This will help you compete effectively with other applicants.    Admissions Rate: 17%   The acceptance rate at UCLA is 17% . In other words, of 100 students who apply, only 17 are admitted.   This means the school is very selective . Scores are vital to getting past their first round of filters. After that, you will need to impress them beyond just your academic scores.    Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is extremely selective, getting a high SAT score and GPA is vital to having a chance at getting in . If you don't pass their SAT and GPA requirements, they'll likely reject you without much consideration. To be safe, you should aim for the 75th percentile, with a 2170 SAT and a 4.31 GPA or higher to be above average. This is only part of the challenge - after this, you'll need to impress them beyond your academic scores, with your accomplishments and extracurriculars. But if you apply with a 1947 SAT or below, you unfortunately have a small chance of getting in.

Calculate your chances of getting in with this free tool from Cappex.       GPA, SAT and ACT Stats                 UCLA, the University of California Los Angeles GPA, SAT Scores and ACT Scores for Admission.
Data Courtesy of Cappex   On the graph above, blue and green represent accepted students. As you can see, the majority of students who got into UCLA had a GPA over 3.5, an SAT score (RW+M) above 1100, and an ACT composite score of 22 or higher. Chances of admission improve as those numbers go up. Realize, however, that hidden beneath the blue and green on the graph is a lot of red. Many students with high GPAs and test scores get rejected from UCLA. Note also that a number of students were accepted with test scores and grades below the norm. Like all of the University of California schools , UCLA has holistic admissions , so the admissions officers are evaluating students based on more than numerical data. Students who show some kind of remarkable talent or have a compelling story to tell will often get a close look even if grades and test scores aren't up to the ideal. Make sure your application has strong essays. You'll want to put significant time and care into your personal insight questions on the UC application. Top universities like UCLA are looking for students who will contribute to the campus community in meaningful ways, and who show the potential to make a positive impact on the world after graduation. UCLA looks to enroll a diverse student body, and they will look at personal qualities such as leadership ability, creativity, and character as well as an applicant's achievement in his or her school, community, and/or workplace.               UCLA Waitlist and Rejection Data                 Waitlist and rejection data for the University of California Los Angeles, UCLA.
Data courtesy of Cappex   The graph at the top of this article might suggest that students with a strong A average and good SAT scores are very likely to be admitted to UCLA. The reality, however, is that you're going to need more than good grades and standardized test scores to be admitted. Plenty of students with solid A averages get rejected. The reasons can be many: weak application essays, a failure to take challenging AP or IB courses in high school, or unimpressive extracurricular activities. Also, some programs at UCLA are more competitive than others. In general, when a school admits just a quarter of all applicants, it's best to consider it a reach school even if your grades and test scores are on target for admission.

The school consistently takes SAT composite scores down to 1230 on a 1600 scale, below which admission should be considered a reach.  We estimate some students could be accepted with SAT's as low as 1090.  The estimated average SAT composite for admitted freshman is 1370 out of 1600. A competitive SAT score is critical as 81 percent of applicants submit SAT scores to the school. Note: SAT scores presented on this page have been adjusted upwards per the College Board's concordance tables for test takers after March 2016.

Submit Before you press calculate, double-check that all of your information is accurate and read the explanations below.  Calculate     How this works: A word of caution RogerHub UC Admissions Calculator is based fully on data released online by the UC Office of the President under the University of California StatFinder . This site has since been taken down, but some data can still be found at the UC Infocenter .  This is not a probability or chance calculator. This calculator utilizes data from past applications in order to determine what percentage of applicants similar to you received an offer of admission. It is an analysis of past records, not a chance calculator.   Is this accurate? No. I make no guarantees about the reliability of this data. Statistics change from year to year. You should always research the data yourself at data.universityofcalifornia.edu .   How does this work? Statfinder did not provide raw data about students and admissions. This calculator uses mathematical models generated using distribution data and the least squares method which is listed below:  S = Σ(y − f(x))²  Each of the variables that you provide in the calculator is tracked to a distribution model. Each has a weight constant, k, and affects the total score, p, as follows:  p′ = p + kp(1 - p) = p + kp - kp²  You are free to submit different hypothetical students to this calculator. Some of the trends that the data exhibit are rather surprising.   Responsibility and Disclaimer I am not associated in any way with the UC Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Please be responsible with what you do with this calculator. Do not be encouraged nor discouraged by this calculator. I make no claims, explicit or implied, about the reliability nor accuracy of this calculator.        379 Comments Add one    These comments were written by anonymous visitors. Roger’s comments are colored blue .  San Diego Mom Thu, 29 Mar 2018 15:58:55 GMT Hello Everyone, I thought you might find this article useful.  It might help explain some of the admit patterns we are seeing for very bright children.  Good luck to everyone out there.  https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2018/03/26/reports-circulate-even-more-difficult-year-be-admitted-leading#.WrngbzMQNuk.email  Anonymous Fri, 23 Mar 2018 04:22:25 GMT Hi Roger,  I have heard that UC Berkeley considers applicants' "full weighted GPA." However, your calculator asks for weighted and capped GPA. Is this accounted for? Should I enter my full weighted GPA for the most accurate percentage?   Roger: My impression is that admissions looks at your whole transcript, not just any particular GPA. In any case, this calculator expects the weighted and capped GPA, because the original dataset contained only the weighted and capped GPA.   A failure Wed, 21 Mar 2018 00:06:29 GMT Hey roger, i got Holy smokes or high 60s for davis, santa barbara, and irvine. Ive gotten flat out rejected from all 3. My essays were pretty good i think, and my ecs were pretty good, working with nasa in high school and being the founder and president of a club. :(  nice calculator, but i think its pretty outdated now. Ive pretty much given up, with all these rejections, but thanks for giving us hope!   Roger: Sorry to hear that! The data used in this calculator is a bit old, and the UCs understandably aren’t keen on publishing enough data to update these models. At some point, I’ll probably start sunsetting this calculator.   Deb Tue, 20 Mar 2018 03:05:15 GMT Hey there. With a ACT score of 33 and GPA of 4.24, my daughter got a Holy Smokes for UC Davis. Her personal statements were neither about torturing animals nor pyromania, she is president of a club, has been a peer tutor for 3 years, and played a varsity sport for 3 years. Yet she was wait-listed.  Tomorrow is UCSB decision day; another Holy Smokes result, but I'm not holding out much hope!   Roger: Sorry to hear that, but good luck with UCSB!   Emily Sun, 18 Mar 2018 08:04:21 GMT Hi Roger! I posted back here in the past (November) about my low GPA and high test score. I was recently accepted to UCLA! Hopefully that'll add a lil bit of data. Thank you for this calculator! Emily   Roger: Congrats!   May Wed, 14 Mar 2018 06:21:02 GMT Is the data you use for this up to date? I know you pull numbers from the uc system, but does this calculator adjust based on the most recent data?   Roger: Nope, not at all. Check out my reply to “Leslie” below.   Harold Henderson Wed, 14 Mar 2018 00:53:20 GMT Hi Roger,  ik you arent an admissions counselor/expert or anything but was just wondering from your personal experience: Do you think first sem. senior year grades matter for UC's?   Roger: Not unless you get a C or lower, I think.   Simone Roche Tue, 06 Mar 2018 23:42:25 GMT Was curious how this calculator factors the high school of the applicant?  The reason I ask is because when I enter a high school that is ranked in the top 20 of California I get a lower chance than if I enter a school that is ranked considerably lower (i.e. - > 1000) even though all the other entries are exactly the same.   Roger: It’s been a long time since I worked on this calculator, but I vaguely remember that school rank had a nonlinear affect on admissions. I obviously can’t explain the correlation definitively, but here’s my guess: Students at really great schools tend to be disadvantaged because of grade inflation and competition. Students at really terrible schools are disadvantaged because their schools are terrible. Given the same GPA and test scores, admissions odds tend to favor “pretty good” schools, simply because it’s easier to stand out.   Sherman Sun, 25 Feb 2018 19:50:39 GMT Hey Roger is it common for many people to apply undeclared? If so does it give people a certain advantage?   Roger: At UC Berkeley, it’s very common (probably because it’s mandatory for the College of Letters and Science).   Sherman Sat, 17 Feb 2018 23:44:01 GMT Hey Roger, excuse me for asking this,but where did you go to college?   Roger: UC Berkeley (it’s on my home page ).   kim Fri, 09 Feb 2018 16:27:10 GMT What if your 1 B (out of state student - really a B+) was sophomore year in a Math class that was one year advanced (Trig)? Is the calculation different?  Steven Damm Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:37:33 GMT Hey Roger. This is helpful, but can you make an updated version with the new SAT and updated stats? It would help me and a lot of other current high schoolers. Thanks!   Roger: Glad you found it helpful! I answered this question a few times below.   Andre Thu, 01 Feb 2018 01:35:52 GMT You're like a local celebrity in our grade! People have gone to nickname you things like "My Boy Roger," or "The Young Roger."   Roger: Haha   Jeff Tue, 30 Jan 2018 06:51:24 GMT Hello Roger,  Thanks for making all these cool websites and applications, you've become a living legend in our high school.   Roger: Glad you like them!   Sherman Sun, 28 Jan 2018 23:24:46 GMT Hey Roger, How did you create this calculator and how did you collect the stats? Thanks, Sherman   Roger: Check out this blog post .   Safwayne James Wed, 24 Jan 2018 00:53:50 GMT Hey Roger,  I have straight A's except for a B in an art class, and an A- in my English class. My UC weighted GPA is 4.7, and I got  1590 on the SAT. DO you think I'll get into Berkley.   Roger: Sure I do.   Ash Samula Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:07:42 GMT Hey, I just wanted your advice. The gist is, in my sophomore year I didn't try at all. In my junior year, I didn't try at all until a month ago. My SAT is above average for nearly every UC, sitting at a 1490 on the 1600 scale. But the fact that I didn't try at all until a month ago has me only achieving a 3.43 GPA at the end of my junior year. But there will be an upward trend for sure, seeing as how I have been getting A's or high B's on everything ever since I started trying a month ago. I also played volleyball, and am board for one cultural club and expect to be board for at least 2 next year, as well as member of a few others. Also, I started volunteering at a science museum. So with all this said, do you think UC's would overlook my poor GPA in favor of my test scores, extracurriculars, and upward trend? Thanks in advance.   Roger: I think you might have misunderstood who I am. I don’t actually know anything about college admissions. In my personal experience, I never met anyone at Berkeley whose low high school GPA was overlooked based on test scores and extracurriculars. Pretty much everyone I knew had decently strong GPA and test scores across the board. I think that large public schools don’t really have the patience for upward trends and overlooking deficiencies unless the candidate is particularly unusual. That being said, your GPA isn’t all that low (is 3.43 your unweighted GPA?), and your SAT score does seem high. Good luck!   Ryan T Thu, 28 Dec 2017 21:11:07 GMT Hi, Roger, my name is Ryan and I'm applying for UCSB... I was wondering if you had any insight as to whether or not I'd be accepted or deferred. I currently have a 3.77 UC GPA, and a 3.90 weighted HS GPA, I have a 1250/1600 on the New SAT and a 22/24 on the essay portion. I'm a first generation white college student. I only applied to UCSB (for the UCs) and I addressed my Prompt 8 (Besides the information provided in your application, what makes you stand out among other candidates to admission faculty?) to UCSB admission readers themselves and told them how diligently I would work if accepted and how hard I've worked throughout the past 4 years. The admission calculator gave me a 48% chance, but I read that it is based on 2009 data. Any input is appreciated, thanks!   Roger: Hi. I think you might be asking the wrong person. I don’t really know anything about college admissions, and I don’t even know where Santa Barbara is. I’m a computer programmer, not a college counselor. Anyway, good luck!   John Fri, 15 Dec 2017 01:01:53 GMT Hi, with the larger class size for 2018, I was wondering if this data is still accurate. http://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/_files/factsheets/2018/fall-2018-applications-table1.pdf   Roger: Not at all. Check out my reply to “Leslie” below.   Anon Tue, 12 Dec 2017 05:31:05 GMT Hi! I was just wondering if you could change the format of the calculator to the new SAT it was really throwing me off haha   Roger: Check out my reply to “Leslie” below.   raxit gupta Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:49:24 GMT accepted. thank you for delivering the letter of rec  Alex Mon, 04 Dec 2017 19:27:37 GMT Hey Roger. I saw how you mentioned that most eecs freshman didn't take AP physics c; however, do you think that earning a b in a stem class junior year would still negatively affect me for eecs at Berkeley? I messed up this semester pretty badly and will probably earn 3 B's (AP physics c, apush, AP stats) and 3 A's (AP English, Spanish 3, AP calc bc). I know that junior year is the most important and I feel so screwed right now. However, if I pull it together and get straight A's next semester and have great test scores and ec's, do you think I'll still have a decent chance? My uw should be about 3.82 and w 4.55. Thx!   Roger: I don’t think it’s a big deal to get a B in AP Physics C, especially because a lot of freshmen EECS majors take an equivalent course during their first year (e.g. Physics 7A and 7B) and plenty of them get B’s. For what it’s worth, I never took AP Physics C in high school. My school didn’t offer the course or the exam. I self-studied for the test and tried registering to take it at another school, but I fudged the registration and ended up never taking the test. (I never took AP stats either, but that’s just because it sounded boring.) Also, consider applying to the College of Letters and Sciences instead of EECS (assuming you don’t actually want to be an electrical engineer). At Berkeley, L&S students don’t declare a major until after they start taking classes. You can enroll undeclared and then switch to L&S Computer Science during your sophomore year along with everybody else.   Li Fri, 01 Dec 2017 23:42:57 GMT *Forgot to state that I am pursuing Computer Science from College of Letters and Science.   Roger: Glad to hear you’re studying computer science! Have fun.   Li Fri, 01 Dec 2017 23:40:52 GMT What are your opinions about my chances of getting into UCLA or Berkeley? I currently have a 1400 SAT score, 18 on the Essay. UC GPA: 4.46. Numerous ECs and I am an out of state student. First generation going to college with Chinese background. 9 AP classes Senior year.   Roger: You sound like a great candidate, but I’m not at all qualified to give my opinion. (Maybe you’re mistaken about who I am?)   Amy Tran Thu, 30 Nov 2017 09:28:10 GMT What is a total semester?  How come when I put my SAT score it doesn't work? Math-36 Reading-36 Writing-38   Roger: If you’re referring to the input labeled “total semesters of AP, IB/HL, or CC courses”, then “total” is an adjective describing the number of semesters (not the semesters themselves). Also, this calculator uses the old 2400-point SAT scoring scale. Check out my response to “Leslie” below for more information about why this calculator is out of date.   Admirer Thu, 30 Nov 2017 05:31:39 GMT Thank you for giving your personal insight to all these comments Really means a lot to everyone   Roger: Glad to help!   Mariam Wed, 29 Nov 2017 05:15:24 GMT Hi, I am a Senior and I am taking a Community College course right now. I will know my grade in the middle of December, which is after the UC deadline. Still, will that be counted in my UC GPA?   Roger: You have the option of submitting a mid-year report to the UC’s, which would contain your senior year grades for the first half of your senior year as well as the community college course you’re taking right now. But as far as I know, the report is optional and most students don’t submit it. Does that answer your question?   Emily Mon, 27 Nov 2017 13:58:52 GMT Hi Roger, I'm an out of state applicant and because my honor courses aren't counted, my gpa is extremely low (3.7 uc gpa). However, I do well on standardized tests and I got a 1540 on the SAT. But if I put this into the calculator, it says my stats aren't believable and I can't get a result. Can this be modified? Thank you, Emily   Roger: You should only have that problem with the top UC schools. There simply weren’t enough applicants with that kind of GPA and SAT score for the models to make a confident prediction. Since there isn’t any new data available (see my reply to “Leslie” below), this is unlikely to change. Sorry!   JesusTheSIR Thu, 23 Nov 2017 21:16:52 GMT Hey so I really wanna study physics at Berkely, I have a 4.19 UC GPA although I got 540 English and 580 math and 21 ACT ;( I’m a bad test taker when it comes to timed especially, I know the material but the time get me especially reading since I’m a slow reader maybe because Spanish was my first language but I do Alof of community service and am even in charge of my schools JROTC, are my chances really below 10%?   Roger: I think you’re asking the wrong person. I’m a computer programmer and I don’t actually know anything about college admissions. Anyway, good luck!

UCLA gets more than 90K applications each year.   Priority admission goes to California residents so your scores have to be almost perfect.  Your grades have to be perfect and your EC's have to be focused. Since you are a CA resident, you may get in; you never know unless you apply.  Anything bio-related is impacted.  In other words, it is a very competitive major so once they run out of seats, they are done.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     mlsdream89    Registered User  Posts: 35  Junior Member      September 2017       SAT too low, not enough related things to your major, not enough information about your academic rigor.

Sorry I didn't include that in my last response. That's already giving a lot of leeway, most people get automatic 800's on the SAT for math because it's so easy, and the reading should at least be over 700.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #6     Matthewbeast2018    Registered User  Posts: 42  Junior Member      September 2017       Lmao @misdream89 saying you need 1500 minimum. Their 75th percentile isn't even 1500, so clearly you don't need 1500 to get in.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #7     mlsdream89    Registered User  Posts: 35  Junior Member      September 2017       He says his major is biochemistry... (although he may get in under 1500 for that), useful majors with a high ROI and can make money after, such as engineering and some STEM majors are more competitive. Impractical, liberal arts, or degrees that don't make you money won't be as competitive.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #8     10s4life    Registered User  Posts: 1,170  Senior Member      September 2017    edited September 2017        @mlsdream89 I'm not sure if you know but L&S admissions is to the whole college not admission by major. Everyone who applied to L&S gets admitted without a major. Engineering admits by major. And I can tell you a 1500 is not needed. Im a student engineering ambassador and for admissions there are plenty of non 1500 students getting in. That's a 2250 average on the old sat. And don't say it used to be more competitive in the past it wasn't in fact UCLA has gotten more competitive as time as gone on. You've been on the UCLA threads saying false and quite frankly rather negative feedback to students. @Gumbymom has reputable posts you can learn from.  2   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #9     Gumbymom    Registered User  Posts: 21,336  Senior Member      September 2017       OP, just an FYI.  Your application will reviewed as follows and yes GPA and test scores are very important, but all aspects of your application will be evaluated.  No one person can say you need a specific test score or GPA to get an acceptance but looking at the data available such as the Freshman profile can help gauge your chances.  There will always to outliers at each end of the spectrum.  Here is some information about how UCLA review applications:::  * Los Angeles * * 		Very important: Academic GPA, Application essay, Rigor of secondary school record, Standardized test scores * 		Important: Character/personal qualities, Extracurricular activities, Talent/ability, Volunteer work, Work experience * 		Considered: First generation college student, Geographical residence * 		Note: GPA, test scores, course work, number of and performance in honors and AP courses most important. Essay considered. Strong senior program important. Extracurricular activities, honors and awards also reviewed. *  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook         Sign In or Register to comment.

I have a 3.98 unweighted GPA (4.3 weighted) and a 1270 SAT (I just retook it though and have not received my scores back yet). I've taken 4 AP classes and 7 honors classes (straight A's in all of them). Most of the AP and honors courses were focused on English and Spanish because they are my strengths and I plan to major in English. The reason I have not taken as many AP/honors is mainly because in my freshman year of high school I was diagnosed with cancer. However, I have done a bunch of charity work for cancer organizations. I have spoken at different events, raised money at my school and outside my school for different events, and was the Honored Hero of 2016 for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. I am a member of the Honors Institute at my school and the Spanish Honor Society. I also do a lot of film/TV acting classes and workshops too. I know it feels like I should have done more extracurriculars, but I really tried to focus on the things I'm most passionate about. I know my story is pretty unique, but what do you think my chances really are?  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook      Replies to: What are my chances at getting into UCLA?       #1     Gumbymom    Registered User  Posts: 21,336  Senior Member      October 2017    edited October 2017       Calculate your UC GPA capped weighted and fully weighted: https://rogerhub.com/gpa-calculator-uc/  Not all HS Honors courses are UC approved, so make sure you check this link if you are a CA HS student to see which courses at your HS will give you the extra honors points:   https://hs-articulation.ucop.edu/agcourselist#/list/search/institution  Your current SAT is on the low side (below 25th percentile) for UCLA but if you addressed your health issues along with your passion for your EC’s in your essays, it could have a positive impact on you chances.  25th - 75th percentiles for SAT: UCLA:  1280-1500  Freshman admit rates for UC GPA of 3.80-4.19 (capped weighted) and not major specific:  UCB: 14% UCLA: 14% UCSD: 44% UCSB: 54% UCD: 58% UCI: 65% UCSC: 85% UCR: 94% UCM: 96%  Freshman admit rates for UC GPA of 4.20 or above:  UCB: 42% UCLA: 54% UCSD: 87% UCSB: 85% UCD: 91% UCI: 94% UCR/UCM: 98%   Best of luck but consider UCLA as a Reach and apply widely.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook         Sign In or Register to comment.

Additionally, this school receives so many applicants, and not everyone can receive admissions. UCLA is a high reach for you, but your ECs, and possibly your essays, may sway the admissions in your favor.

Now on to your question.  It looks like you're doing a lot to make up for the lack of APs in your school, and UCLA will certainly take into account the fact that those classes are not available to you. Contintue volunteering, identify a strong example of your leadership abilities for use in your personal statement, and work hard your last year with as tough a schedule as you can take to show UCLA that you can make the most of the opportunities your school does have. Finally, I would retake either the SAT or ACT to increase your chances. Focus on the one you can do better on. It can't hurt your chances!

The chance of getting in to UCLA varies by student. I didn't do a lot of volunteering, but i still did some; i came from a disadvantaged school in South Central L.A with crappy teachers, classes, etc.; Magnet students had priority for AP's, I didn't get AP classes till I was a senior (I had two AP classes); AND my SAT I score was at around 1300, I didn't take the ACT, didn't pass the darn AP exams, and got a 520 in the math 2 section, 470 in physics, 410 in chemistry, 380 in history, and 730 in the Spanish section; I graduated amongst the top 10 at my school and I still managed to get in.  Compared to other students, academically, I might be average or below average, but I was still able to get in. So just understand that there is no one specific standard that defines what makes a student worthy of a certain college. Colleges also take in consideration your personal statement--Yes it's nerve wrecking, but just chill :)   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #9     Gobith    Registered User  Posts: 45  Junior Member      August 2014       My son has a 34/36 on the ACTs, 780 Subject SAT Bio, 760 Subject SAT Chem.

Duh.  But here’s something that many parents in California don’t realize. Sending your child to a top high school could reduce their chances of getting into UCLA or  Berkeley .  During the past couple of weeks, I’ve run into parents who are mystified and angry that their teenagers didn’t get into these UC schools. One of these parents is my physician whose brilliant daughter had a nearly perfect SAT and grades to match at one of the top public high schools in San Diego County. The daughter of friend, who is an investment advisor, had the same kind of stats and she attends a private high school.  While I was hearing their complaints, a girl in my son’s carpool at High Tech High was rejoicing that she got into UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Davis and every other UC she applied to. Her SAT score was about 350 points less than the scores of each of the overachieving girls. Her SAT subject tests weren’t great either.  So what gives?  The girl with the lower scores attends a school that is in the ELC (Eligibility in the Local Context) program, which represents one of the three paths to UC freshmen eligibility. According to the rules, the top 4% of students at ELC high schools are qualified to attend a UC school based on their coursework, but not necessarily their first choice. The goal of ELC is to boost the eligibility pool to the kind of kids who might not otherwise be eligible for a UC.  ELC schools tend to be lower-income and diverse, but the girl in my carpool is white and Jewish.  How much easier is it to get to a UC campus by being near the top of the class at an ELC school? Here’s an example: Berkeley admits about 21% of applicants, but 56% of ELC students. If you don’t know if your teen’s school is in the ELC program, you might want to ask.

You do realize that SAT scores are only part of the  deal right. I have a relatively low ACT score…, 26. So why did I get into UCLA? Maybe it had to do with the fact that I challenged myself to be strong, learned from my failures, took initiative in my learning, showed humanity and passion that is needed to be a doctor, and shows my personality in the personal statement. I also explained that I have a type of dyslexia that does not allow me to read quickly, thereby me doing bad on the ACT.  Btw, my school is not ELC. My school is very competitive. UCLA takes people who thrive at competitive schools because (news shock!) UCLA is competitive. Those overachieving girls just got a high SAT score as far as you know…. But were they able to thrive in a competitive environment? And UCLA will admit the person who thrives in a competitive school than the one who gets the top grade in the lower school any time.   Reply          Brenda Rocha  March 17, 2014 at 11:30 pm  #     I didnt get into UC davis, UCSB, and UCSD… those universities have a higher percent acceptance than UCLA and UC berkeley.. do you guys still think I may have a chance? or does getting rejected by those top schools pretty much says it all?.   Reply          Karla Alexandra  January 6, 2013 at 5:09 am  #     Though this is written in 2009, I think this is still recent. UCLA and Berkeley look for those that excelled despite having many difficult circumstances. The girl with the higher SAT scores, probably did not take all the AP classes available, maybe her personal statement (more than likely well written) didn’t reflect thoughtfully on a social issue, etc. Even if the white Jewish girl did not attend UCLA or Berkeley, and decided to attend UCSB, she has higher chances of “success”–better jobs, better housing, networking with other “successful” middle-class persons. This is called WHITE PRIVILEGE that UCLA and Berkeley are very aware about and give chances to those that have been HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED and underrepresented in Higher Education. My point is whatever college you send your upper-middle class, child to, they will continue to be upper-middle class or mobilize into a higher SES. Also, getting into Berkeley and UCLA requires more than biased test scores that depict only one side of a person. What I think admitted me into Berkeley was being employed while in high school, reflecting thoughtfully on my experience through my personal statement and also committing myself into public service. It’s also important to note the difference between SOLIDARITY versus Charity!

Just one has to be at the top 4% in your school.   Reply          courtney  December 3, 2009 at 11:26 am  #     i want to know how much it is to get into UCLA and what gpa do you need to get in? is it hard to get accepted? or no? i wanna know   Reply          Lynn  December 3, 2009 at 3:43 pm  #     Courtney,  To get into UCLA you need to be in the top 10% of your high school class. You also need to have a GPA that is 3.75 or above. You can get a lot of freshmen admission stats by getting UCLA’s Common Data Set. http://www.aim.ucla.edu/CDS/cds0809/CDS0809A.asp  You can find blog posts about the Common Data Set on my site.

		      freshman applicants who were not admitted to UCLA.  Q: Can you tell me why I was denied?  A: Every application receives a minimum of two reviews, which balance academic and extracurricular information, combined with information we learn from the personal statement. Because this process 		      is not based on a formula, there rarely is a single reason 		      (such as one low test score or grade, etc.) that we can point 		      to as to why an individual applicant is not admitted.  Generally speaking, the primary reason that we must turn away so many qualified students is simply that of competition. For Fall Quarter 2017, UCLA received more than 102,000 freshman applications for a class of just over 6,000 new freshmen. We had to deny more than 85,000 applicants. Among these were some of the brightest and highest achieving high school seniors in the state. Almost all of them were UC eligible. Most students denied by UCLA are eligible to gain admission to at least one of the other UC campuses. We strongly encourage you to focus on the options you have.  Here	are some statistics showing the GPAs, courses, and ACT/SAT scores at the 25th and 75th percentile mark within the admitted class.       Fully-Weighted GPA  extra grade point for honors  ACT Composite Score  a-g course honors semesters, grades 10–12*        75th percentile  4.64    25th percentile  4.29      75th percentile  34    25th percentile  30      75th percentile  28    25th percentile  18         Unweighted GPA  no extra grade point for honors    *These figures are for domestic applicants only.        75th percentile  4.00    25th percentile  3.88        ( more statistics
		      on freshman class )  Q: Can I be placed
		      on your waitlist?  A: Unfortunately, no. Applicants invited to be on UCLA's waitlist are identified prior to the release of decisions, as part of our overall freshman admission selection process; applicants themselves cannot request to be placed on the waitlist.  Q: I would like
		      to appeal my decision. What should I include in my appeal?  A: Because all
		      applicants are examined so thoroughly in multiple reviews,
		      admission decisions are rarely overturned. Requests for reconsideration
		      are most likely to be persuasive only when students present
		      new information. By "new" we mean information
		      not already presented in the original application (e.g.
		      missing ACT/SAT scores, classes that were not listed as AP/Honors
		      that should have been, additional course work, etc.); information
		      that clearly shows you to have a stronger academic record
		      than had been earlier evidenced. Additional
		      extracurricular activities or fall term grades are not a basis
		      for a reversal of the decision since decisions are based on
		      academic information that was available at the time of application.  In rare cases, students may find it necessary
		      to be in Los Angeles due to a personal hardship. In itself,
		      this is not necessarily grounds for reversal of an admission
		      decision since there are several other colleges in the Los
		      Angeles area. Academic qualifications combined
		      with the particular hardship listed would allow for an additional
		      review of an applicant. If you base your appeal on an emergency
		      or sudden-need situation, please be prepared to document your
		      circumstances.  ( more on the appeal
		      process )    Q: Was I considered
		      for my alternate major also?  A:
		      Within the College of Letters and
		      Science, the major an applicant chooses is not a factor in
		      the review process at the freshman level. Unfortunately, due
		      to the high volume of applicants each term, UCLA does not
		      normally review applicants who applied to Arts, Music, Engineering,
		      or Theater/Film/TV majors for their alternate choices.    Q: I was ELC Eligible,
		      why was I not admitted to UCLA?  A: ELC students are guaranteed a spot at one of the nine UC Undergraduate
		      campuses , though not necessarily at their campus or program
		      of choice.  Q: I would still
		      like to attend UCLA. What are my options?  A: Entering UCLA as a freshman
		      is not your only option. We also accept applications from
		      students who have completed their first two years of college
		      at another institution.  While we accept applications from students from
		      other 4-year institutions, we give priority to students transferring
		      from other UC Campuses and California community colleges .
		      Many of these schools have special programs that help students
		      prepare to transfer to UCLA or other 4-year institutions.  ( more on transfer admission )    Q: I was denied
		      for Fall quarter, can I apply for winter quarter?  A:  No. UCLA only accepts new
		      freshman students for the fall quarter.    Was your

( self.ucla ) submitted 2 years ago by joeytman I'm a senior in high school right now. I want to major in Computer Science or Programming. Can anyone with even a tiny bit of knowledge about admissions give me what they think my chances are? I'd be incredibly grateful. I know that admissions can be a tossup, and it's difficult to quantify extracurriculars and lump them in with statistics, making it hard for me to judge for myself.  I have a 4.17 UC GPA, 2200 SAT with an 800 on the math, 200 community service hours with AP Comp sci peer tutoring as the primary contributor, 5's on both AP English Language and AP Comp Sci tests, and an internship at a computer science buisness. I also am the president of the computer science club at our school, although I just started it and I'm gonna be applying in a couple months so I don't have a lot of time in that leadership position. I'll be taking the SAT again this october, for the third time, in an attempt to superscore >2300. I'll also be taking the Physics and Math 2 subject tests. I'm currently enrolled in AP Calc AB + BC, AP Lit, AP Physics, AP Econ, and taking Poly Sci at a community college. Outside of that, nothing else, really. No sports, no interesting life story.  Actually, I'm really into ultimate frisbee, but up until this season starts I've only played casually with friends. I've been training hard the last couple of months. Any word on the ultimate team at UCLA?  Thanks for reading, and a response, if you're so inclined.   7 comments share save hide report all 7 comments sorted by: best top new controversial old random q&a live (beta) Want to add to the discussion?

Your extracurrculars are very focused, which I don't think is either a good or bad thing. You seem very passionate about CS, which is something you can write your essays on. You're right, admissions can be a toss up, and when you're applying to the second highest ranked public university in the country, everyone's scores are going to be similar. You want your extracurriculars and essays to show the admissions people that you're someone they want to be here. Be passionate (and maybe a little lucky) and you can get in.  Also, I hear our ultimate team is pretty good.   permalink embed save give gold [–] ford310nm1  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (1 child) Realistically speaking your scores are damn well on point. They are really something to be proud of when filling out your application. Really congrats.  With that being said: Applicants with your scores are a dime a dozen. Honestly, how many applications do you think UCLA receives with those scores listed? It's almost expected from an applicant to have scores like this when applying.  Great test scores and academic success won't get you into UCLA alone. I've have friends ranked top 5 in our class, all with GPAs greater than 4.0, all with SAT scores more than 2100, and with 6 or 7 AP classes at the time who were rejected.  To be perfectly honest, you need to demonstrate to the admission board what sets you apart from the rest and what you're going to bring to the table. UCLA is looking for diversity in ideas, people that are outgoing, and people who will eventually contribute something to academia.  My advice to you is to start on your personal statement now. Have your counselor, your teachers, your friends, and even current students read it. Ask them if what they read stuck and if they would accept you if they were part of the board. Polish and re polish your work until you are happy with. It's your personal statement that will sell you to the admission people. Focus on it and DO NOT wait until the last minute.  I wish you the best of luck wherever you end up. PM me if you have any questions.   permalink embed save give gold [–] joeytman [ S ]  1 point 2 points 3 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Thank you so much for your kind words and advice. I just started the prewriting stage for my personal statement, and will have my english teacher, parents, and friends (all who are ranked at or above my level) read it over and offer critique. Unfortunately, not a lot of interesting things have happened to me in my life to discuss, but I do take pride in who I am as a person. I'm driven, motivated, and definitely outgoing, so I will be sure to convey that in 999 words.  If you don't mind me asking, what did you write on your own personal statement? How did you address the prompt, what aspects of yourself and your life did you highlight? Berkeley and ucla are my effective top picks (besides mit, but I think my chances there are miniscule) and I am having trouble finding the inspiration for what I should write about.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] Terranwaterbender  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (1 child) I think it's damn good TBH, you've chosen a major with applicable merits (internship and president of a computer science club), you have a strong SAT and GPA, and you've gotten a casual activity that you love doing.  However that said I don't know what it's like for in-state competitors since it is supposedly more difficult for them to enter but you've got the marks and the merits that back up what you want to major in.   permalink embed save give gold [–] joeytman [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) Thanks for the information, I appreciate all the information I get. I'm excited; ucla is beautiful, and I'm hopeful.   permalink embed save parent give gold [–] insert90 Poli Sci/Econ '19  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (1 child) I got in with similar stats and more sports, but a lot less community service. You probably don't need to do the SAT again, and assuming you can write a compelling essay, you have a decent shot. (I'm also out of state.)   permalink embed save give gold [–] joeytman [ S ]  0 points 1 point 2 points  2 years ago  (0 children) I'm already signed up for it. They offered it for free because they messed up on the last sat, so I figured why not retake.   permalink embed save parent give gold about blog about advertising careers help site rules Reddit help center wiki reddiquette mod guidelines contact us apps & tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons <3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy . © 2018 reddit inc.

A snapshot of the admitted freshmen class for the fall of 2017 shows these stats for the middle 50 percent: High School GPA: 4.13 to 4.31 on a five-point scale ACT Composite Score: 30 to 34 ACT English: 28 to 32 SAT Evidence Based Reading and Writing: 640 to 730 SAT Mathematics: 640 to 770 SAT Essay: 16 to 20 How do you measure up at UCLA? Calculate your chances of getting in with this free tool from Cappex.       GPA, SAT and ACT Stats                 UCLA, the University of California Los Angeles GPA, SAT Scores and ACT Scores for Admission.
Data Courtesy of Cappex   On the graph above, blue and green represent accepted students. As you can see, the majority of students who got into UCLA had a GPA over 3.5, an SAT score (RW+M) above 1100, and an ACT composite score of 22 or higher. Chances of admission improve as those numbers go up. Realize, however, that hidden beneath the blue and green on the graph is a lot of red. Many students with high GPAs and test scores get rejected from UCLA. Note also that a number of students were accepted with test scores and grades below the norm. Like all of the University of California schools , UCLA has holistic admissions , so the admissions officers are evaluating students based on more than numerical data. Students who show some kind of remarkable talent or have a compelling story to tell will often get a close look even if grades and test scores aren't up to the ideal. Make sure your application has strong essays. You'll want to put significant time and care into your personal insight questions on the UC application. Top universities like UCLA are looking for students who will contribute to the campus community in meaningful ways, and who show the potential to make a positive impact on the world after graduation. UCLA looks to enroll a diverse student body, and they will look at personal qualities such as leadership ability, creativity, and character as well as an applicant's achievement in his or her school, community, and/or workplace.               UCLA Waitlist and Rejection Data                 Waitlist and rejection data for the University of California Los Angeles, UCLA.
Data courtesy of Cappex   The graph at the top of this article might suggest that students with a strong A average and good SAT scores are very likely to be admitted to UCLA. The reality, however, is that you're going to need more than good grades and standardized test scores to be admitted. Plenty of students with solid A averages get rejected. The reasons can be many: weak application essays, a failure to take challenging AP or IB courses in high school, or unimpressive extracurricular activities. Also, some programs at UCLA are more competitive than others. In general, when a school admits just a quarter of all applicants, it's best to consider it a reach school even if your grades and test scores are on target for admission.

It became the Southern Branch of the University of California in 1919, making it the second-oldest undergraduate campus of the ten-campus University of California system. [10] It offers 337 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in a wide range of disciplines. [11] UCLA enrolls about 31,000 undergraduate and 13,000 graduate students, [6] and had 119,000 applicants for Fall 2016, including transfer applicants, the most applicants for any American university. [12]  The university is organized into six undergraduate colleges, seven professional schools, and four professional health science schools. The undergraduate colleges are the College of Letters and Science ; Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS) ; School of the Arts and Architecture ; Herb Alpert School of Music ; School of Theater, Film and Television ; and School of Nursing .  As of 2017, 24 Nobel laureates , 3 Fields Medalists , and 5 Turing Award winners have been affiliated with UCLA as faculty, researchers, or alumni. [13] [14] [15] In addition, two Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force . Among the current faculty members, 55 have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences , 28 to the National Academy of Engineering , 39 to the Institute of Medicine , and 124 to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . [16] The university was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1974. [17]  The Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2017–2018 ranked UCLA 15th in the world for academics, No.1 US Public University for academics, and 13th in the world for reputation. [18] [19] In 2017, UCLA ranked 12th in the world (10th in North America) by the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) [20] and 33rd in the 2017–2018 QS World University Rankings . [21] In 2017, the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) ranked the university 15th in the world based on quality of education, alumni employment, quality of faculty, publications, influence, citations, broad impact, and patents. [22] In 2017–2018, US News & World Report ranked UCLA as the #1 public university in the United States in a tie with its sister campus, UC Berkeley. [23]  UCLA student-athletes compete as the Bruins in the Pac-12 Conference . The Bruins have won 126 national championships, including 114 NCAA team championships, more than any other university except Stanford. [24] [25] [26] UCLA student-athletes, coaches and staff won 251 Olympic medals : 126 gold , 65 silver and 60 bronze . [27] UCLA student-athletes competed in every Olympics since 1920 with one exception ( 1924 ), and won a gold medal in every Olympics that the United States participated in since 1932.

The State Normal School at Los Angeles opened on August 29, 1882, on what is now the site of the Central Library of the Los Angeles Public Library system. The facility included an elementary school where teachers-in-training could practice their technique with children. That elementary school is related to the present day version, UCLA Lab School . In 1887, the school became known as the Los Angeles State Normal School. [29]     The Los Angeles branch of California State Normal School , 1881.    In 1914, the school moved to a new campus on Vermont Avenue (now the site of Los Angeles City College ) in East Hollywood . In 1917, UC Regent Edward Augustus Dickson , the only regent representing the Southland at the time, and Ernest Carroll Moore , Director of the Normal School, began to lobby the State Legislature to enable the school to become the second University of California campus, after UC Berkeley . They met resistance from UC Berkeley alumni, Northern California members of the state legislature, and Benjamin Ide Wheeler , President of the University of California from 1899 to 1919, who were all vigorously opposed to the idea of a southern campus. However, David Prescott Barrows , the new President of the University of California, did not share Wheeler's objections.  On May 23, 1919, the Southern Californians' efforts were rewarded when Governor William D. Stephens signed Assembly Bill 626 into law, which transformed the Los Angeles Normal School into the Southern Branch of the University of California . The same legislation added its general undergraduate program, the College of Letters and Science. [30] The Southern Branch campus opened on September 15 of that year, offering two-year undergraduate programs to 250 Letters and Science students and 1,250 students in the Teachers College, under Moore's continued direction. [31]     Southern Branch of the University of California's Vermont Campus, 1922.    Under University of California President William Wallace Campbell , enrollment at the Southern Branch expanded so rapidly that by the mid-1920s the institution was outgrowing the 25 acre Vermont Avenue location. The Regents searched for a new location and announced their selection of the so-called "Beverly Site"—just west of Beverly Hills —on March 21, 1925 edging out the panoramic hills of the still-empty Palos Verdes Peninsula . After the athletic teams entered the Pacific Coast conference in 1926, the Southern Branch student council adopted the nickname "Bruins", a name offered by the student council at UC Berkeley. [32] In 1927, the Regents renamed the Southern Branch the University of California at Los Angeles (the word "at" was officially replaced by a comma in 1953, in line with other UC campuses). In the same year, the state broke ground in Westwood on land sold for $1 million, less than one-third its value, by real estate developers Edwin and Harold Janss , for whom the Janss Steps are named. [29] The campus in Westwood opened to students in 1929.  The original four buildings were the College Library (now Powell Library ), Royce Hall , the Physics-Biology Building (now the Humanities Building), and the Chemistry Building (now Haines Hall), arrayed around a quadrangular courtyard on the 400 acre (1.6 km²) campus. The first undergraduate classes on the new campus were held in 1929 with 5,500 students. After lobbying by alumni, faculty, administration and community leaders, UCLA was permitted to award the master's degree in 1933, and the doctorate in 1936, against continued resistance from UC Berkeley. [33]  A timeline of the history can be found on its website, [34] as well as a published book. [35]  Maturity as a university [ edit ]      This section needs expansion with: History after 1951. You can help by adding to it .  (June 2016)     During its first 32 years, UCLA was treated as an off-site department of UC. As such, its presiding officer was called a "provost", and reported to the main campus in Berkeley. In 1951, UCLA was formally elevated to co-equal status with UC Berkeley, and its presiding officer Raymond B. Allen was the first chief executive to be granted the title of chancellor. The appointment of Franklin David Murphy to the position of Chancellor in 1960 helped spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. By the end of the decade, UCLA had achieved distinction in a wide range of subjects. This era also secured UCLA's position as a proper university and not simply a branch of the UC system. This change is exemplified by an incident involving Chancellor Murphy, which was described by him:   I picked up the telephone and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, "University of California." And I said, "Is this Berkeley?" She said, "No." I said, "Well, who have I gotten to?" "UCLA." I said, "Why didn't you say UCLA?" "Oh", she said, "we're instructed to say University of California." So the next morning I went to the office and wrote a memo; I said, "Will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, 'UCLA. ' " And they said, "You know they won't like it at Berkeley." And I said, "Well, let's just see. There are a few things maybe we can do around here without getting their permission." [36]   2016 shooting [ edit ]  Main article: 2016 UCLA shooting  On June 1, 2016, two men were killed in a murder-suicide at an engineering building in the university. School officials put the campus on lockdown as Los Angeles Police Department officers, including SWAT , cleared the campus. [37] [38]  Campus [ edit ]  The new UCLA campus in 1929 had four buildings: Royce Hall and Haines Hall on the north, and Powell Library and Kinsey Hall (now the Humanities Building) on the south. The Janss Steps were the original 87-step entrance to the university that lead to the quad of these four buildings. Today, the campus includes 163 buildings across 419 acres (1.7 km²) in the western part of Los Angeles , north of the Westwood shopping district and just south of Sunset Boulevard . In terms of acreage, it is the second smallest of the ten UC campuses. [7] The campus is close but not adjacent to the 405 San Diego Freeway . [39]     The Bruin statue, designed by Billy Fitzgerald, in Bruin Plaza. [40]    The campus is in the residential area of Westwood and bordered by Bel-Air to the north, Beverly Hills to the east, and Brentwood to the west. The campus is informally divided into North Campus and South Campus, which are both on the eastern half of the university's land. North Campus is the original campus core; its buildings are more traditional in appearance and clad in imported Italian brick. North Campus is home to the arts, humanities, social sciences, law, and business programs and is centered around ficus and sycamore-lined Dickson Court, also known as the "Sunken Garden". South Campus is home to the physical sciences, life sciences, engineering, mathematical sciences, health-related fields, and the UCLA Medical Center . The campus includes sculpture gardens, fountains, museums, and a mix of architectural styles.     Janss Steps, in front of Royce Hall    Ackerman Union, the John Wooden Center, the Arthur Ashe Health and Wellness Center, the Student Activities Center, Kerckhoff Hall, the J.D. Morgan Center, the James West Alumni Center, and Pauley Pavilion stand at the center of the campus, bordering Wilson Plaza. The campus is bisected by Bruin Walk, a heavily traveled pathway from the residential hill to the main campus. At the intersection of Bruin Walk and Westwood Plaza is Bruin Plaza, featuring an outdoor performing arts stage and a bronze statue of the Bruin bear.  During the 2028 Summer Olympics , wrestling and judo will be held at Pauley Pavilion . The campus will also be the location of the Olympic Village for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. [41]  Architecture [ edit ]  The first buildings were designed by the local firm Allison & Allison . The Romanesque Revival style of these first four structures remained the predominant building style until the 1950s, when architect Welton Becket was hired to supervise the expansion of the campus over the next two decades. Becket greatly streamlined its general appearance, adding several rows of minimalist , slab–shaped brick buildings to the southern half, the largest of these being the UCLA Medical Center . [42] Architects such as A. Quincy Jones , William Pereira and Paul Williams designed many subsequent structures on the campus during the mid-20th century. More recent additions include buildings designed by architects I.M. Pei , Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates , Richard Meier , Cesar Pelli , and Rafael Vinoly . To accommodate UCLA's rapidly growing student population, multiple construction and renovation projects are in progress, including expansions of the life sciences and engineering research complexes. This continuous construction gives UCLA the nickname "Under Construction Like Always". [43]      Royce Hall , one of the original four buildings, inspired by Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio    One notable building on campus is named after African-American alumnus Ralph Bunche , who received the 1950 Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating an armistice agreement between the Jews and Arabs in Israel. The entrance of Bunche Hall features a bust of him overlooking the Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden. He was the first individual of non-European background and the first UCLA alumnus to be honored with the Prize.  The Hannah Carter Japanese Garden is located a mile north of campus, in the community of Bel Air . The garden was designed by landscape architect Nagao Sakurai of Tokyo and garden designer Kazuo Nakamura of Kyoto in 1959. After the garden was damaged by heavy rains in 1969, UCLA Professor of Art and Campus Architect Koichi Kawana took on the task of its reconstruction.  Filming [ edit ]  UCLA has attracted filming for decades with its proximity to Hollywood . Much of the film Gotcha! (1985) was shot at UCLA, as well as John Singleton 's Higher Learning (1995). Legally Blonde (2001), Old School (2003), The Nutty Professor (1995), Erin Brockovich (2000), How High (2001), National Lampoon's Van Wilder (2002), American Pie 2 (2001), and Bring It On Again (2004) were all mainly shot around campus. In January 2009, the Bollywood movie My Name is Khan (2010) was shot at UCLA. UCLA is also often cast as Stanford in television shows such as The Mindy Project and Chuck . Some of the exterior shots of the fictional UC Sunnydale in Buffy the Vampire Slayer , and ABC Family original series Greek were also filmed at UCLA. In response to the major demand for filming, UCLA has instated a policy to regulate filming and professional photography at the campus. [44] "UCLA is located in Los Angeles, the same place as the American motion picture industry", said UCLA visiting professor of film and television Jonathan Kuntz. [45] "So we're convenient for (almost) all of the movie companies, TV production companies, commercial companies and so on. We're right where the action is."      California NanoSystems Institute interior walkways above a parking structure.    Transportation and parking [ edit ]  The campus maintains 24,000 parking spaces and operates an award-winning sustainable transportation program. [46] [47] [48] Elements of the sustainable transportation program include vanpools, a campus shuttle system called BruinBus, discounted carpool permits, and subsidized transit passes. One of the pass programs includes BruinGo!, [49] which allows students and staff members to purchase discounted passes to ride Santa Monica's Big Blue Bus and the Culver CityBus . [50] Additionally, UCLA has a grocery shuttle that transports students between the dorms and Westwood, on weekends in order to facilitate students' shopping needs.

The UCLA Health System operates the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center , a hospital in Santa Monica and twelve primary care clinics throughout Los Angeles County . In addition, the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine uses two Los Angeles County public hospitals as teaching hospitals— Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Olive View-UCLA Medical Center —as well as the largest private nonprofit hospital on the west coast, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center . The Greater Los Angeles VA Medical Center is also a major teaching and training site for the university. The UCLA Medical Center made history in 1981 when Assistant Professor Michael Gottlieb first diagnosed AIDS . UCLA medical researchers also pioneered the use of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to study brain function. Professor of Pharmacology Louis Ignarro was one of the recipients of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering the signaling cascade of nitric oxide , one of the most important molecules in cardiopulmonary physiology.  The U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals ranking for 2017 ranks UCLA Medical Center 7th in the United States and 2nd in the West after the UCSF Medical Center at the University of California, San Francisco , which is also part of the UC System . [52] UCLA Medical Center was ranked within the top 20 in the United States for 15 out of 16 medical specialty areas examined.

[118]  Library system [ edit ]  Main article: University of California, Los Angeles Library     Powell Library, across the quad from Royce Hall    UCLA's library system has over nine million books and 70,000 serials spread over twelve libraries and eleven other archives, reading rooms, and research centers. It is the United States' 12th largest library in number of volumes. [119]  The first library, University Library (presently Powell Library ), was founded in 1884. In 1910, Elizabeth Fargo became the university's first librarian. Lawrence Powell became librarian in 1944, and began a series of system overhauls and modifications, and in 1959, he was named Dean of the School of Library Service. [120] More libraries were added as previous ones filled. Page Ackerman became University Librarian in 1973, and was the nation's first female librarian of a system as large and complex as UCLA's. She oversaw the first coordinations between other UC schools, and formed a new administrative network that is still in use today. [121] Since her retirement, the system has seen steady growth and improvement under various Librarians. The present University Librarian is Virginia Steel, who took office on July 15, 2013. [122]  Medical school admissions [ edit ]  According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), UCLA supplies the most undergraduate applicants to U.S. medical schools among all American universities. In 2015, UCLA supplied 961 medical school applicants, followed by UC Berkeley with 819 and the University of Florida with 802. [123]  Among first-time medical school applicants who received their bachelor's degree from UCLA in 2014, 51% were admitted to at least one U.S. medical school.

[131] 102,177 prospective freshmen applied for Fall 2017, the most of any four-year university in the United States. [125]  Admission rates vary according to the residency of applicants. For Fall 2016, California residents had an admission rate of 18%, while out-of-state U.S. residents had an admission rate of 22% and internationals had an admission rate of 14%. [132]  Admitted freshman applicants for Fall 2016 had a weighted GPA interquartile range of 4.25 – 4.62, an SAT interquartile range of 1900–2250, and an ACT interquartile range of 29 – 34. [132] Enrolled freshmen for Fall 2016 had an average weighted GPA of 4.33, an SAT interquartile range of 1720–2160, and an ACT interquartile range of 25 – 33. [126]  UCLA's freshman admission rate varies drastically across colleges. For Fall 2016, the College of Letters and Science had an admission rate of 21.2%, the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS) had an admission rate of 12.4%, the Herb Alpert School of Music had an admission rate of 23.5%, the School of the Arts and Architecture had an admission rate of 10.3%, the School of Nursing had an admission rate of 2.2%, and the School of Theater, Film and Television had an admission rate of 4.4%. [133]  Transfer students experienced a much higher admission rate of 26% for Fall 2016. [134]  About 3,350 transfer students entered UCLA in Fall 2016, 83% of whom came from the California Community Colleges System . [134] Over the past 15 years, more than 45,000 students have transferred to UCLA. [ citation needed ] Between one-half to one-third of baccalaureate degrees are awarded to students who transferred to UCLA. [ citation needed ] One of the major issues is the decreased admission of African-Americans since the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996, prohibiting racial or sexual discrimination at public institutions. [135] UCLA responded by shifting to a holistic admissions process starting Fall 2007. [136] The holistic admissions process evaluates applicants based on their opportunities in high school, their personal hardships and unusual circumstances at home.  Among the admitted freshman applicants for Fall 2016, 37% chose to enroll at UCLA. [126]  Graduate [ edit ]     Hugh and Hazel Darling Law Library, UCLA School of Law    For Fall 2014, the David Geffen School of Medicine admitted 3.2% of its applicants, making it the 9th most selective U.S. medical school. [137] The School of Law had a median undergraduate GPA of 3.74 and median Law School Admission Test (LSAT) score of 166 for the enrolled class of 2018. [138] The Anderson School of Management had a middle-80% GPA range of 3.2 – 3.8 and an average Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) score of 714 for the enrolled MBA class of 2017. [139]  The School of Dentistry had an average overall GPA of 3.75, an average science GPA of 3.71 and an average Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score of 22 for the enrolled class of 2018. [140] The Graduate School of Nursing currently has an acceptance rate of 3.9%. For Fall 2015, the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS) had a graduate acceptance rate of 27.6%. [141]  Economic impact [ edit ]     A hoodie from the UCLA Store    The university has a significant impact in the Los Angeles economy. It is the fifth largest employer in the county (after Los Angeles County, the Los Angeles Unified School District, the federal government and the City of Los Angeles) and the seventh largest in the region. [142] [143]  Trademarks and licensing [ edit ]  The UCLA trademark "is the exclusive property of the Regents of the University of California ", [144] but it is managed, protected, and licensed through UCLA Trademarks and Licensing, a division of the Associated Students UCLA, the largest student employer on campus. [145] [146] As such, the ASUCLA also has a share in the profits.  Due to UCLA's academic and athletic prestige, as well as the name, being associated with popular images of Southern California lifestyle, apparel with UCLA logos and insignia sells not just in the United States, but as an overseas clothing and accessories brand. High demand for UCLA apparel has inspired the licensing of its trademark to UCLA brand stores throughout Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Since 1980, 15 UCLA stores have opened in South Korea , and 49 are currently open in China. The newest store was opened in Kuwait. [147] There are also stores in Mexico , Singapore , India and Europe. [148] UCLA makes $400,000 in royalties every year through its international licensing program. [148]  Commerce on campus [ edit ]  UCLA has various store locations around campus, with the main store in Ackerman Union. In addition, UCLA-themed products are sold at the gift shop of Fowler Museum on campus.  Due to licensing and trademarks, products with UCLA logos and insignia are usually higher priced than their unlicensed counterparts. These products have popularity among visitors, who buy them as gifts and souvenirs. For certain products (such as notebooks and folders) the UCLA Store offers both licensed (logo) and unlicensed (without logo, thus cheaper) options, but for many other products the latter option is often unavailable. [ citation needed ]  Students who are part-time employed by ASUCLA at a UCLA Store or a UCLA Restaurant are offered certain discounts when they are shopping at UCLA Stores, in addition to their salary.  Athletics [ edit ]  Main article: UCLA Bruins     Basketball at Pauley Pavilion       Football at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena       Track and field at Drake Stadium    The school's sports teams are called the Bruins , with colors True Blue and gold. The Bruins participate in NCAA Division I as part of the Pac-12 Conference . Two notable sports facilities serve as home venues for UCLA sports. The Bruin men's football team plays home games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena ; the team won a national title in 1954. The basketball and volleyball teams, and the women's gymnastics team compete at Pauley Pavilion on campus. The school also sponsors cross country , soccer , women's rowing , golf , tennis , water polo , track and field , and women's softball .  The mascots are Joe and Josephine Bruin, and the fight songs are Sons of Westwood and Mighty Bruins . The alma mater is Hail to the Hills of Westwood .  When Henry "Red" Sanders came to UCLA to coach football in 1949, the uniforms were redesigned. Sanders added a gold loop on the shoulders—the UCLA Stripe. The navy blue was changed to a lighter shade of blue. Sanders figured that the baby blue would look better on the field and in film. He dubbed the uniform "Powder Keg Blue", a powder blue with an explosive kick. This would also differentiate UCLA from all other UC teams, whose official colors are blue and gold.  UCLA competes in all major Division I sports and has won 126 national championships, including 114 NCAA championships. Only Stanford University has more NCAA team championships, with 116. [149] Most recently, UCLA's women's soccer team defeated Florida State to win its first NCAA National Championship along with women's tennis who defeated North Carolina to win its second NCAA National title ever. [150] UCLA's softball program is also outstanding. [151] Women's softball won their NCAA-leading 11th National Championship, on June 8, 2010. The women's water polo team is also dominant, with a record 7 NCAA championships. Notably, the team helped UCLA become the first school to win 100 NCAA championships overall when they won their fifth on May 13, 2007.  The men's water polo team won UCLA's 112th, 113th, and 114th national championships, defeating USC in the championship game three times: on December 7, 2014, on December 6, 2015, and on December 3, 2017. On October 9, 2016, the top-ranked men's water polo team broke the NCAA record for consecutive wins when they defeated UC Davis for their 52nd straight win. This toppled Stanford's previous record of 51 consecutive wins set in 1985–87. The men's water polo team has become a dominant sport on campus with a total of 11 national championships, including the school's most recent.  Among UCLA's 114 championship titles, some of the more notable victories are in men's basketball . Under legendary coach John Wooden , UCLA men's basketball teams won 10 NCAA championships, including a record seven consecutive , in 1964, 1965, 1967–1973, and 1975, and an 11th was added under then-coach Jim Harrick in 1995 (through 2008, the most consecutive by any other team is two ). [151] From 1971 to 1974, UCLA men's basketball won an unprecedented 88 consecutive games. UCLA has also shown dominance in men's volleyball , with 19 national championships. All 19 teams were led by former [152] coach Al Scates , which ties him with John McDonnell of the University of Arkansas as NCAA leader for national championships in a single sport. [151]  Former UCLA basketball player and former NBA player Earl Watson commented, "Eleven national championships, the best coach (Wooden) to coach the game says a lot. I take offense to those who act like UCLA is just another school compared with Duke . Duke is a great school in the east, but UCLA is worldwide."  UCLA is one of only five universities ( Michigan , Stanford , Ohio State , and UC Berkeley being the others) to have won national championships in all three major men's sports (baseball, basketball, and football). [153]  USC rivalry [ edit ]  Main article: UCLA–USC rivalry  UCLA shares a traditional sports rivalry with the nearby University of Southern California , especially for football. Under famous coach John Wooden, UCLA became a dominating power in men's basketball, and has won 11 NCAA championships , against USC's zero. [154] In football, UCLA has one national champion team and 16 conference titles, compared to USC's 11 national championships and 37 conference championships. The two football teams compete for annual possession of the Victory Bell , the trophy of the rivalry football game. In 2015, UCLA's football team was beaten by USC in a 21-40 defeat at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum , ending its three-game winning streak. [155]  The schools share a rivalry in many other sports. In men's volleyball, UCLA won 19 NCAA Men's Volleyball Championships against USC's four. [151] UCLA also dominates the all-time series vs. USC in men's volleyball (86–34). [156] In women's volleyball UCLA leads the all-time series against USC as well and has won eight national champions to USC's six. [157] In soccer, UCLA leads USC in the all-time series 13–3–0, yet USC no longer competes in men's NCAA Division I soccer. [158] The annual SoCal BMW Crosstown Cup compares the two schools based on their performance in 19 varsity sports; UCLA has won five times and USC has won nine times. This rivalry extends to the Olympic Games , where UCLA athletes have won 250 medals over a span of 50 years while USC athletes have won 287 over 100 years. [159] [160] [161]  UCLA and USC also compete in the We Run The City 5K, an annual charity race to raise donations for Special Olympics Southern California. The race is located on the campus of one of the schools and switches to the other campus each year. USC won the race in 2013 and 2015, while UCLA won the race in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2017. [162]  The origin is unclear, but the rivalry most likely started when football Hall of Fame coach Red Sanders led UCLA to dominance in the 1950s. USC, having won four national championships prior to UCLA's first and only title in 1954 diverted some attention from then-rival University of Notre Dame , and the new cross-town rivalry began.

UCLA offers classical orchestras , intramural sports , and over 800 student organizations. UCLA is also home to more than 70 fraternities and sororities , which represent 13% of the undergraduate population. [164]  Phrateres , a non-exclusive social-service club for women was founded here in 1924 by the Dean of Women, Helen Matthewson Laughlin. Students and staff participate in dinghy sailing, surfing, windsurfing, rowing, and kayaking at the UCLA Marina Aquatic Center in Marina del Rey .  UCLA's first contemporary a cappella group, Awaken A Cappella, was founded in 1992. The all-male group, Bruin Harmony, has enjoyed a successful career since its inception in 2006, portraying a collegiate a cappella group in The Social Network (2010), while the ScatterTones finished in second-place in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella in 2011–2013. Other a cappella groups include Signature, Random Voices, Medleys, YOUTHphonics, Resonance, Deviant Voices, Awechords and Cadenza. YOUTHphonics and Medleys are UCLA's only nonprofit service-oriented a cappella groups. [165]  There are also a variety of cultural organizations on campus, such as Nikkei Student Union (NSU), Japanese Student Association (JSA), [166] Association of Chinese Americans (ACA), Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA), Chinese Music Ensemble (CME), Chinese Cultural Dance Club (CCDC), Taiwanese American Union (TAU), Taiwanese Student Association (TSA), Hong Kong Student Society (HKSS), Hanoolim Korean Cultural Awareness Group, Samahang Pilipino, Vietnamese Student Union (VSU), and Thai Smakom. Many of these organizations have an annual "culture night" consisting of drama and dance which raises awareness of culture and history to the campus and community.  UCLA operates on a quarter calendar with the exception of the UCLA School of Law and the UCLA School of Medicine , which operate on a semester calendar .

(October 2016)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Fraternities and sororities have been a part of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) campus since 1923. Today UCLA is home to more than 60 national and local Greek-letter organizations, six governing councils with approximately 4,000 students which represents 13% of the undergraduate student population.  The Interfraternity Council (IFC) comprises 22 fraternities. The Panhellenic Association is made up of 17 sororities and over 4,000 women.

Latino Greek Council (LGC): Governing body of the 8 Latino/a founded Greek-letter organizations. Multi-Interest Greek Council (MIGC): Governing body of the 15 cultural-based/special-interest fraternity and sorority organizations. National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC): Governing body of the 7 historically African American Greek-letter organizations at UCLA.  Traditions [ edit ]     Spring Sing 2009    UCLA's official charity is UniCamp, founded in 1934. It is a week-long summer camp for under-served children from the greater Los Angeles area , with UCLA volunteer counselors. UniCamp runs for seven weeks throughout the summer at Camp River Glen in the San Bernardino National Forest. Because UniCamp is a non-profit organization, student volunteers from UCLA also fundraise money throughout the year to allow these children to attend summer camp. [169]  True Bruin Welcome begins the fall quarter to introduce new students to clubs and activities. The week includes the Day of Service for all freshmen, the Enormous Activities Fair, and the Sports Fair. At the end of move-in and the beginning of True Bruin Welcome, UCLA holds Bruin Bash, which includes a concert, dance and movie pre-release. Bruin Bash was created as a replacement for Black Sunday, a large-scale day of partying including all fraternities in North Westwood Village.  The Pediatric AIDS Coalition organizes the annual Dance Marathon in Pauley Pavilion, where thousands of students raise a minimum of $250 and dance for 26 hours to support the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation , Project Kindle, and the UCLA AIDS Institute. Dancers are not allowed to sit (except to use the restroom) during the marathon, literally taking a stand against pediatric AIDS, and symbolizing the suffering of affected children around the world. In 2015, Dance Marathon at UCLA raised $446,157. [170]  During Finals Week, UCLA students participate in "Midnight Yell", where they yell as loudly as possible for a few minutes at midnight to release some stress from studying. The quarterly Undie Run takes place during the Wednesday evening of Finals Week, when students run through the campus in their underwear or in skimpy costumes. The run began in Fall of 2001 when a student, Eric Whitehead, wearing what he described as "really short shorts" walked around singing and playing guitar to protest the police restrictions on the Midnight Yell. [171] With the increasing safety hazards and Police and Administration involvement, a student committee changed the route to a run through campus to Shapiro Fountain, which now culminates with students dancing in the fountain. [172] In 2007, the route was changed again to begin at Strathmore Avenue instead of Landfair Avenue. The Undie Run has spread to other American universities, including the University of Texas at Austin , Arizona State University , and Syracuse University .  The Alumni Association sponsors several events, usually large extravaganzas involving huge amounts of coordination, such as the 70-year-old Spring Sing, organized by the Student Alumni Association (SAA). UCLA's oldest tradition, Spring Sing is an annual gala of student talent, which is held at either Pauley Pavilion or the outdoor Los Angeles Tennis Center . The committee bestows the George and Ira Gershwin Lifetime Achievement Award each year to a major contributor to the music industry. Past recipients have included Stevie Wonder , Frank Sinatra , Ella Fitzgerald , James Taylor , Ray Charles , Natalie Cole , Quincy Jones , [173]  Lionel Richie , and in 2009, Julie Andrews . [174] The Dinner for 12 Strangers is a gathering of students, alumni, administration and faculty to network around different interests. [175] The "Beat 'SC Bonfire and Rally" occurs the week before the USC rivalry football game.      JazzReggae Festival 2010    The USAC Cultural Affairs Commission hosts the JazzReggae Festival , a two-day concert on Memorial Day weekend that attracts more than 20,000 attendees. The JazzReggae Festival is the largest, entirely student produced and run event of its kind on the West Coast. [176]  Sigma Eta Pi and Bruin Entrepreneurs organize LA Hacks , an annual hackathon where students from around the United States come to build technology products. LA Hacks established itself as the largest hackathon in the United States when over 1500 students participated in April 11–13, 2014. [177] LA Hacks also holds the record for the most funds raised via corporate sponsorships with $250,000 raised. Some of the tech world's most prominent people have given talks and judged projects at LA Hacks, including Evan Spiegel (Founder and CEO of Snapchat ), Alexis Ohanian (Co-Founder of Reddit ), Sam Altman (President of Y Combinator ) and Chris De Wolfe (Founder of Myspace ).  Student government [ edit ]     Kerckhoff Hall houses the student government and the Daily Bruin .    The Associated Students UCLA (ASUCLA) encompasses the student government and student-led enterprises at UCLA. ASUCLA has four major components: the Undergraduate Students Association, the Graduate Students Association, Student Media, and services & enterprises. However, in common practice, the term ASUCLA refers to the services and enterprises component. This includes the Student Store, Bookstore, Food Services, Student Union, etc. These commercial enterprises generate approximately $40 million in annual revenues. [178] As a nonprofit corporation, the financial goal of ASUCLA is to provide quality services and programs for students. ASUCLA is governed by a student-majority Board of Directors. The Undergraduate Students Association and Graduate Students Association each appoint three members plus one alternate. In addition to the student members, there are representatives appointed by the administration, the academic senate, and the alumni association. The "services and enterprises" portion of ASUCLA is run by a professional executive director who oversees some 300 staff and 2,000 student employees.  The Graduate Students Association is the governing body for approximately 13,000 graduate and professional students at UCLA. [179]  The Undergraduate Students Association Council (USAC) is the governing body of the Undergraduate Students Association (USA) whose membership comprises every UCLA undergraduate student. [180] As of 2015, the student body had two major political slates: Bruins United and Let's Act. In the Spring 2016 election, the two competing parties were Bruins United and Waves of Change—a smaller faction that broke off of Lets Act.  USAC's fourteen student officers and commissioners are elected by members of the Undergraduate Students Association at an annual election held during Spring Quarter. In addition to its fourteen elected members, USAC includes appointed representatives of the Administration, the Alumni, and the Faculty, as well as two ex-officio members, the ASUCLA Executive Director and a student Finance Committee Chairperson who is appointed by the USA President and approved by USAC. All members of USAC may participate fully in Council deliberations, but only the elected officers, minus the USAC President may vote.  Along with the council, the student government also includes a seven-member Judicial Board, which similar to the Supreme Court, serves as the judicial branch of government and reviews actions of the council. These seven students are appointed by the student body president and confirmed by the council.  USAC's programs offers additional services to the campus and surrounding communities. For example, each year approximately 40,000 students, faculty and staff attend programs of the Campus Events Commission , including a low-cost film program, a speakers program which presents leading figures from a wide range of disciplines, and performances by dozens of entertainers. Two to three thousand UCLA undergraduates participate annually in the more than twenty voluntary outreach programs run by the Community Service Commission. A large corps of undergraduate volunteers also participate in programs run by the Student Welfare Commission, such as AIDS Awareness , Substance Abuse Awareness, Blood Drives and CPR/First Aid Training.  Media publications [ edit ]  UCLA Student Media is the home of UCLA's newspaper, magazines, and radio station. [181] Most student media publications are governed by the ASUCLA Communications Board.  The Daily Bruin is UCLA's most prominent student publication. Founded in 1919 under the name Cub Californian , it has since then developed into Los Angeles' third-most circulated newspaper. It has won dozens of national awards, and is regularly commended for layout and content. In 2016, the paper won two National Pacemaker Awards – one for the best college newspaper in the country, and another for the best college media website in the country. [182] The newspaper has not been without scrutiny and controversy, and in 1954, the administration attempted to intervene with the previous policy of electing editors by a student council.  UCLA Student Media also publishes seven special-interest news magazines: Al-Talib , Fem , Ha'Am , La Gente , Nommo , Pacific Ties , and OutWrite , a school yearbook, BruinLife , and the student-run radio station, UCLA Radio.  Student groups such as The Forum for Energy Economics and Development also publish yearly journals focused on energy technologies and industries. There are also numerous graduate student-run journals at UCLA, such as Carte Italiane , Issues in Applied Linguistics , and Mediascape . [183] Many of these publications are available through open access . The School of Law publishes the UCLA Law Review which is currently ranked seventh among American law schools. [184]  Housing [ edit ]  Main article: UCLA student housing     Rieber Terrace housing    UCLA provides housing to over 10,000 undergraduate and 2,900 graduate students. [185]  Most undergraduate students are housed in 14 complexes on the western side of campus, referred to by students as "The Hill". Students can live in halls, plazas, suites, or university apartments, which vary in pricing and privacy. Housing plans also offer students access to dining facilities, which have been ranked by the Princeton Review as some of the best in the United States. [186] Dining halls are located in Covel Commons, Rieber Hall, Carnesale Commons and De Neve Plaza. In winter 2012, a dining hall called The Feast at Rieber opened to students. The newest dining hall (as of Winter Quarter 2014) is Bruin Plate, located in the Carnesale Commons (commonly referred to as Sproul Plaza). Residential cafes include Bruin Cafe, Rendezvous, The Study at Hedrick, and Cafe 1919. [187] UCLA currently offers three years guaranteed housing to its incoming freshmen, and one year to incoming transfer students. There are four type of housing available for students: residential halls, deluxe residential halls, residential plazas, and residential suites. Available on the hill are study rooms, basketball courts, tennis courts, and Sunset Recreational Center which includes three swimming pools.  Graduate students are housed in one of five apartment complexes. Weyburn Terrace is located just southwest of the campus in Westwood Village. The other four are roughly five miles south of UCLA in Palms and Mar Vista. They too vary in pricing and privacy. [188] Approximately 400 students live at the University Cooperative Housing Association, located two blocks off campus. [189]  Students who are involved in Greek life have the option to also live in Greek housing while at UCLA. Sorority houses are located east of campus on Hilgard Avenue, and fraternity houses are located west of campus throughout Westwood Village. A student usually lives with 50+ students in Greek housing.  Hospitality [ edit ]  Hospitality constituents of the university include departments not directly related to student life or administration. The Hospitality department manages the UCLA Guest House, a full-service, on-campus hotel. The 61-room Guest House services those visiting the university for campus-related activities. [190] The department also manages the UCLA Conference Center, a 40-acre (0.2 km²) conference center in the San Bernardino Mountains near Lake Arrowhead . [191] Hospitality also operates UCLA Catering [192] a vending operation, and summer conference center located on the Westwood campus. [193]  Chabad House [ edit ]  The UCLA Chabad House is a community center for Jewish students operated by the Orthodox Jewish  Chabad movement. Established in 1969, it was the first Chabad House at a university. [194] [195] In 1980, three students died in a fire in the original building of the UCLA Chabad House. The present building was erected in their memory. The building, completed in 1984, was the first of many Chabad houses worldwide designed as architectural reproductions of the residence of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson at 770 Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, New York. [194] The Chabad House hosts the UCLA chapter of The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute 's Sinai Scholars Society. [196] [197]  Healthy Campus Initiative [ edit ]      This section is too long . Consider splitting it into new pages, adding subheadings , or condensing it. (November 2016)           It has been suggested that this section be split out into another article. ( Discuss ) (November 2016)     In January 2013, Chancellor Gene Block launched the UCLA Healthy Campus Initiative (HCI), envisioned and supported by Jane and Terry Semel. [198] The Semel HCI prioritizes the health and wellness of UCLA students, staff, and faculty by "making the healthy choice the easy choice." [198] The goal of the initiative is to make UCLA the healthiest campus in the country, and to share best practices and research with other communities, locally and beyond. [199]  The initiative is a campuswide, multi-year effort that champions programs such as the tobacco-free policy, [200] expansion of campus gardens, [201] stairwell makeovers, [202] bicycle infrastructure improvements, [203] healthy and sustainable dining options, [204] and peer counseling, [205] among others.  The UCLA Healthy Campus Initiative is credited with providing inspiration for national initiatives including the Partnership for a Healthier America (PHA) Healthier Campus Initiative and the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) Global Food Initiative (GFI). [201] [206] In November 2014, UCLA was one of the 20 inaugural colleges and universities to pledge to adopt PHA's guidelines for food and nutrition, physical activity and programming over three years. [206] The Semel HCI is a member of both the Menus of Change Research Collaborative [207] and the Teaching Kitchen Collaborative, [208] and a contributor to The Huffington Post. [209]  In 2015, UCLA was included on Greatist's list of "The 25 Healthiest Colleges in the U.S." [210] In 2016, UCLA was ranked best college food in America by Town & Country.

Fencing championships before 1990 and skiing championships before 1983 were awarded as men's or women's championships and are counted here as such.     ^ a  b  c  d  The NCAA started sponsoring the intercollegiate golf championship in 1939, but it retained the titles from the 41 championships previously conferred by the National Intercollegiate Golf Association in its records. Of these pre-NCAA titles, Yale, Princeton, Michigan and Stanford won 20, 11, 2 and 1, respectively.  ^ a  b  c  Arkansas' 2004 and 2005 men's outdoor track and field championships, LSU's 2012 women's outdoor track and field championship, and UCLA's 1995 softball championship were all vacated by the NCAA Committee on Infractions and are not included in the schools' totals.

UCLA Admissions Statistics  There are three critical numbers when considering your admissions chances: SAT scores, GPA, and acceptance rate . All these combine to tell you what you scores are required to get into University of California, Los Angeles.    Average SAT: 1370 (Old: 1947)   The average SAT score composite at UCLA is a 1370 .  On the old 2400 SAT , this corresponds to an average SAT score of 1947 .    UCLA SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)  The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1250, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 1500.  In other words, a 1250 places you below average, while a 1500 will move you up to above average. There's no absolute SAT requirement at UCLA, but they really want to see at least a 1250 to have a chance at being considered.

If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 Average GPA: 4.31   The average GPA at UCLA is 4.31 . This makes UCLA Extremely Competitive for GPAs.   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.  With a GPA of 4.31, UCLA
      
      requires you to be at the top of your class . You'll need nearly straight A's in all your classes to compete with other applicants. You should also have taken plenty of AP or IB classes to show your ability to excel in academic challenge.  If you're a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change from this point on. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 4.31, you'll need a higher SAT score to compensate and show that you're prepared to take on college academics. This will help you compete effectively with other applicants.    Admissions Rate: 17%   The acceptance rate at UCLA is 17% . In other words, of 100 students who apply, only 17 are admitted.   This means the school is very selective . Scores are vital to getting past their first round of filters. After that, you will need to impress them beyond just your academic scores.    Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is extremely selective, getting a high SAT score and GPA is vital to having a chance at getting in . If you don't pass their SAT and GPA requirements, they'll likely reject you without much consideration. To be safe, you should aim for the 75th percentile, with a 2170 SAT and a 4.31 GPA or higher to be above average. This is only part of the challenge - after this, you'll need to impress them beyond your academic scores, with your accomplishments and extracurriculars. But if you apply with a 1947 SAT or below, you unfortunately have a small chance of getting in.

A snapshot of the admitted freshmen class for the fall of 2017 shows these stats for the middle 50 percent: High School GPA: 4.13 to 4.31 on a five-point scale ACT Composite Score: 30 to 34 ACT English: 28 to 32 SAT Evidence Based Reading and Writing: 640 to 730 SAT Mathematics: 640 to 770 SAT Essay: 16 to 20 How do you measure up at UCLA? Calculate your chances of getting in with this free tool from Cappex.       GPA, SAT and ACT Stats                 UCLA, the University of California Los Angeles GPA, SAT Scores and ACT Scores for Admission.
Data Courtesy of Cappex   On the graph above, blue and green represent accepted students. As you can see, the majority of students who got into UCLA had a GPA over 3.5, an SAT score (RW+M) above 1100, and an ACT composite score of 22 or higher. Chances of admission improve as those numbers go up. Realize, however, that hidden beneath the blue and green on the graph is a lot of red. Many students with high GPAs and test scores get rejected from UCLA. Note also that a number of students were accepted with test scores and grades below the norm. Like all of the University of California schools , UCLA has holistic admissions , so the admissions officers are evaluating students based on more than numerical data. Students who show some kind of remarkable talent or have a compelling story to tell will often get a close look even if grades and test scores aren't up to the ideal. Make sure your application has strong essays. You'll want to put significant time and care into your personal insight questions on the UC application. Top universities like UCLA are looking for students who will contribute to the campus community in meaningful ways, and who show the potential to make a positive impact on the world after graduation. UCLA looks to enroll a diverse student body, and they will look at personal qualities such as leadership ability, creativity, and character as well as an applicant's achievement in his or her school, community, and/or workplace.               UCLA Waitlist and Rejection Data                 Waitlist and rejection data for the University of California Los Angeles, UCLA.
Data courtesy of Cappex   The graph at the top of this article might suggest that students with a strong A average and good SAT scores are very likely to be admitted to UCLA. The reality, however, is that you're going to need more than good grades and standardized test scores to be admitted. Plenty of students with solid A averages get rejected. The reasons can be many: weak application essays, a failure to take challenging AP or IB courses in high school, or unimpressive extracurricular activities. Also, some programs at UCLA are more competitive than others. In general, when a school admits just a quarter of all applicants, it's best to consider it a reach school even if your grades and test scores are on target for admission.

In this guide, we'll discuss what scores are needed for you to get admitted into UCLA. You'll also get to calculate your own chances with our admissions calculator.  Location: Los Angeles, CA  This school is also known as: UCLA, UC Los Angeles, University of California, Los Angeles    You're applying to a very selective school.

You'll learn what it takes to achieve perfection, with strategies you can use to prep more effectively.  UCLA Admissions Statistics  There are three critical numbers when considering your admissions chances: ACT scores, GPA, and acceptance rate . All these combine to tell you what you scores are required to get into University of California, Los Angeles.    Average ACT: 29   The average ACT score composite at UCLA is a 29 .   The 25th percentile ACT score is 25, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 33.  In other words, a 25 places you below average, while a 33 will move you up to above average.

Download our free guide on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve your score. This guide was written by Harvard graduates and ACT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 Average GPA: 4.31   The average GPA at UCLA is 4.31 . This makes UCLA Extremely Competitive for GPAs.   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.  With a GPA of 4.31, UCLA
      
      requires you to be at the top of your class . You'll need nearly straight A's in all your classes to compete with other applicants. You should also have taken plenty of AP or IB classes to show your ability to excel in academic challenge.  If you're a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change from this point on. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 4.31, you'll need a higher ACT score to compensate and show that you're prepared to take on college academics. This will help you compete effectively with other applicants.    Admissions Rate: 17%   The acceptance rate at UCLA is 17% . In other words, of 100 students who apply, only 17 are admitted.   This means the school is very selective . Scores are vital to getting past their first round of filters. After that, you will need to impress them beyond just your academic scores.    Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is extremely selective, getting a high ACT score and GPA is vital to having a chance at getting in . If you don't pass their ACT and GPA requirements, they'll likely reject you without much consideration. To be safe, you should aim for the 75th percentile, with a 33 ACT and a 4.31 GPA or higher to be above average. This is only part of the challenge - after this, you'll need to impress them beyond your academic scores, with your accomplishments and extracurriculars. But if you apply with a 29 ACT or below, you unfortunately have a small chance of getting in.

All these combine to tell you what you scores are required to get into University of California, Los Angeles.    Average SAT: 1370 (Old: 1947)   The average SAT score composite at UCLA is a 1370 .  On the old 2400 SAT , this corresponds to an average SAT score of 1947 .    UCLA SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)  The 25th percentile New SAT score is 1250, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 1500.

Download our free guide on the top 5 strategies you must be using to improve your score. This guide was written by Harvard graduates and SAT perfect scorers. If you apply the strategies in this guide, you'll study smarter and make huge score improvements.                 Average GPA: 4.31   The average GPA at UCLA is 4.31 . This makes UCLA Extremely Competitive for GPAs.   (Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.  With a GPA of 4.31, UCLA
      
      requires you to be at the top of your class . You'll need nearly straight A's in all your classes to compete with other applicants. You should also have taken plenty of AP or IB classes to show your ability to excel in academic challenge.  If you're a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change from this point on. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 4.31, you'll need a higher SAT score to compensate and show that you're prepared to take on college academics. This will help you compete effectively with other applicants.    Admissions Rate: 17%   The acceptance rate at UCLA is 17% . In other words, of 100 students who apply, only 17 are admitted.   This means the school is very selective . Scores are vital to getting past their first round of filters. After that, you will need to impress them beyond just your academic scores.    Final Admissions Verdict    Because this school is extremely selective, getting a high SAT score and GPA is vital to having a chance at getting in . If you don't pass their SAT and GPA requirements, they'll likely reject you without much consideration. To be safe, you should aim for the 75th percentile, with a 2170 SAT and a 4.31 GPA or higher to be above average. This is only part of the challenge - after this, you'll need to impress them beyond your academic scores, with your accomplishments and extracurriculars. But if you apply with a 1947 SAT or below, you unfortunately have a small chance of getting in.    Admissions Calculator    What are your chances of admission at University of California, Los Angeles?   Chances of admission with these scores:   Here's our custom admissions calculator. Plug in your numbers to see what your chances of getting in are. Pick your test: Old SAT  New SAT  ACT    SAT Score      Your GPA       Note: Your admission decision relies not only on your GPA and SAT/ACT scores, but also on your coursework difficulty, extracurriculars, letters of recommendation, and personal statements.

This calculator utilizes data from past applications in order to determine what percentage of applicants similar to you received an offer of admission. It is an analysis of past records, not a chance calculator.   Is this accurate? No. I make no guarantees about the reliability of this data. Statistics change from year to year. You should always research the data yourself at data.universityofcalifornia.edu .   How does this work? Statfinder did not provide raw data about students and admissions. This calculator uses mathematical models generated using distribution data and the least squares method which is listed below:  S = Σ(y − f(x))²  Each of the variables that you provide in the calculator is tracked to a distribution model. Each has a weight constant, k, and affects the total score, p, as follows:  p′ = p + kp(1 - p) = p + kp - kp²  You are free to submit different hypothetical students to this calculator. Some of the trends that the data exhibit are rather surprising.   Responsibility and Disclaimer I am not associated in any way with the UC Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Please be responsible with what you do with this calculator. Do not be encouraged nor discouraged by this calculator.

It might help explain some of the admit patterns we are seeing for very bright children.  Good luck to everyone out there.  https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2018/03/26/reports-circulate-even-more-difficult-year-be-admitted-leading#.WrngbzMQNuk.email  Anonymous Fri, 23 Mar 2018 04:22:25 GMT Hi Roger,  I have heard that UC Berkeley considers applicants' "full weighted GPA." However, your calculator asks for weighted and capped GPA. Is this accounted for? Should I enter my full weighted GPA for the most accurate percentage?   Roger: My impression is that admissions looks at your whole transcript, not just any particular GPA. In any case, this calculator expects the weighted and capped GPA, because the original dataset contained only the weighted and capped GPA.   A failure Wed, 21 Mar 2018 00:06:29 GMT Hey roger, i got Holy smokes or high 60s for davis, santa barbara, and irvine. Ive gotten flat out rejected from all 3. My essays were pretty good i think, and my ecs were pretty good, working with nasa in high school and being the founder and president of a club. :(  nice calculator, but i think its pretty outdated now. Ive pretty much given up, with all these rejections, but thanks for giving us hope!   Roger: Sorry to hear that! The data used in this calculator is a bit old, and the UCs understandably aren’t keen on publishing enough data to update these models. At some point, I’ll probably start sunsetting this calculator.   Deb Tue, 20 Mar 2018 03:05:15 GMT Hey there. With a ACT score of 33 and GPA of 4.24, my daughter got a Holy Smokes for UC Davis. Her personal statements were neither about torturing animals nor pyromania, she is president of a club, has been a peer tutor for 3 years, and played a varsity sport for 3 years. Yet she was wait-listed.  Tomorrow is UCSB decision day; another Holy Smokes result, but I'm not holding out much hope!   Roger: Sorry to hear that, but good luck with UCSB!   Emily Sun, 18 Mar 2018 08:04:21 GMT Hi Roger! I posted back here in the past (November) about my low GPA and high test score. I was recently accepted to UCLA! Hopefully that'll add a lil bit of data. Thank you for this calculator! Emily   Roger: Congrats!   May Wed, 14 Mar 2018 06:21:02 GMT Is the data you use for this up to date? I know you pull numbers from the uc system, but does this calculator adjust based on the most recent data?   Roger: Nope, not at all. Check out my reply to “Leslie” below.   Harold Henderson Wed, 14 Mar 2018 00:53:20 GMT Hi Roger,  ik you arent an admissions counselor/expert or anything but was just wondering from your personal experience: Do you think first sem. senior year grades matter for UC's?   Roger: Not unless you get a C or lower, I think.   Simone Roche Tue, 06 Mar 2018 23:42:25 GMT Was curious how this calculator factors the high school of the applicant?  The reason I ask is because when I enter a high school that is ranked in the top 20 of California I get a lower chance than if I enter a school that is ranked considerably lower (i.e. - > 1000) even though all the other entries are exactly the same.   Roger: It’s been a long time since I worked on this calculator, but I vaguely remember that school rank had a nonlinear affect on admissions. I obviously can’t explain the correlation definitively, but here’s my guess: Students at really great schools tend to be disadvantaged because of grade inflation and competition. Students at really terrible schools are disadvantaged because their schools are terrible. Given the same GPA and test scores, admissions odds tend to favor “pretty good” schools, simply because it’s easier to stand out.   Sherman Sun, 25 Feb 2018 19:50:39 GMT Hey Roger is it common for many people to apply undeclared? If so does it give people a certain advantage?   Roger: At UC Berkeley, it’s very common (probably because it’s mandatory for the College of Letters and Science).   Sherman Sat, 17 Feb 2018 23:44:01 GMT Hey Roger, excuse me for asking this,but where did you go to college?   Roger: UC Berkeley (it’s on my home page ).   kim Fri, 09 Feb 2018 16:27:10 GMT What if your 1 B (out of state student - really a B+) was sophomore year in a Math class that was one year advanced (Trig)? Is the calculation different?  Steven Damm Thu, 01 Feb 2018 17:37:33 GMT Hey Roger. This is helpful, but can you make an updated version with the new SAT and updated stats? It would help me and a lot of other current high schoolers. Thanks!   Roger: Glad you found it helpful! I answered this question a few times below.   Andre Thu, 01 Feb 2018 01:35:52 GMT You're like a local celebrity in our grade! People have gone to nickname you things like "My Boy Roger," or "The Young Roger."   Roger: Haha   Jeff Tue, 30 Jan 2018 06:51:24 GMT Hello Roger,  Thanks for making all these cool websites and applications, you've become a living legend in our high school.   Roger: Glad you like them!   Sherman Sun, 28 Jan 2018 23:24:46 GMT Hey Roger, How did you create this calculator and how did you collect the stats? Thanks, Sherman   Roger: Check out this blog post .   Safwayne James Wed, 24 Jan 2018 00:53:50 GMT Hey Roger,  I have straight A's except for a B in an art class, and an A- in my English class. My UC weighted GPA is 4.7, and I got  1590 on the SAT. DO you think I'll get into Berkley.   Roger: Sure I do.   Ash Samula Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:07:42 GMT Hey, I just wanted your advice. The gist is, in my sophomore year I didn't try at all. In my junior year, I didn't try at all until a month ago. My SAT is above average for nearly every UC, sitting at a 1490 on the 1600 scale. But the fact that I didn't try at all until a month ago has me only achieving a 3.43 GPA at the end of my junior year. But there will be an upward trend for sure, seeing as how I have been getting A's or high B's on everything ever since I started trying a month ago. I also played volleyball, and am board for one cultural club and expect to be board for at least 2 next year, as well as member of a few others. Also, I started volunteering at a science museum. So with all this said, do you think UC's would overlook my poor GPA in favor of my test scores, extracurriculars, and upward trend? Thanks in advance.   Roger: I think you might have misunderstood who I am. I don’t actually know anything about college admissions. In my personal experience, I never met anyone at Berkeley whose low high school GPA was overlooked based on test scores and extracurriculars. Pretty much everyone I knew had decently strong GPA and test scores across the board. I think that large public schools don’t really have the patience for upward trends and overlooking deficiencies unless the candidate is particularly unusual. That being said, your GPA isn’t all that low (is 3.43 your unweighted GPA?), and your SAT score does seem high. Good luck!   Ryan T Thu, 28 Dec 2017 21:11:07 GMT Hi, Roger, my name is Ryan and I'm applying for UCSB... I was wondering if you had any insight as to whether or not I'd be accepted or deferred. I currently have a 3.77 UC GPA, and a 3.90 weighted HS GPA, I have a 1250/1600 on the New SAT and a 22/24 on the essay portion. I'm a first generation white college student. I only applied to UCSB (for the UCs) and I addressed my Prompt 8 (Besides the information provided in your application, what makes you stand out among other candidates to admission faculty?) to UCSB admission readers themselves and told them how diligently I would work if accepted and how hard I've worked throughout the past 4 years. The admission calculator gave me a 48% chance, but I read that it is based on 2009 data. Any input is appreciated, thanks!   Roger: Hi. I think you might be asking the wrong person. I don’t really know anything about college admissions, and I don’t even know where Santa Barbara is. I’m a computer programmer, not a college counselor. Anyway, good luck!   John Fri, 15 Dec 2017 01:01:53 GMT Hi, with the larger class size for 2018, I was wondering if this data is still accurate. http://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/_files/factsheets/2018/fall-2018-applications-table1.pdf   Roger: Not at all. Check out my reply to “Leslie” below.   Anon Tue, 12 Dec 2017 05:31:05 GMT Hi! I was just wondering if you could change the format of the calculator to the new SAT it was really throwing me off haha   Roger: Check out my reply to “Leslie” below.   raxit gupta Fri, 08 Dec 2017 18:49:24 GMT accepted. thank you for delivering the letter of rec  Alex Mon, 04 Dec 2017 19:27:37 GMT Hey Roger. I saw how you mentioned that most eecs freshman didn't take AP physics c; however, do you think that earning a b in a stem class junior year would still negatively affect me for eecs at Berkeley? I messed up this semester pretty badly and will probably earn 3 B's (AP physics c, apush, AP stats) and 3 A's (AP English, Spanish 3, AP calc bc). I know that junior year is the most important and I feel so screwed right now. However, if I pull it together and get straight A's next semester and have great test scores and ec's, do you think I'll still have a decent chance? My uw should be about 3.82 and w 4.55. Thx!   Roger: I don’t think it’s a big deal to get a B in AP Physics C, especially because a lot of freshmen EECS majors take an equivalent course during their first year (e.g. Physics 7A and 7B) and plenty of them get B’s. For what it’s worth, I never took AP Physics C in high school. My school didn’t offer the course or the exam. I self-studied for the test and tried registering to take it at another school, but I fudged the registration and ended up never taking the test. (I never took AP stats either, but that’s just because it sounded boring.) Also, consider applying to the College of Letters and Sciences instead of EECS (assuming you don’t actually want to be an electrical engineer). At Berkeley, L&S students don’t declare a major until after they start taking classes. You can enroll undeclared and then switch to L&S Computer Science during your sophomore year along with everybody else.   Li Fri, 01 Dec 2017 23:42:57 GMT *Forgot to state that I am pursuing Computer Science from College of Letters and Science.   Roger: Glad to hear you’re studying computer science! Have fun.   Li Fri, 01 Dec 2017 23:40:52 GMT What are your opinions about my chances of getting into UCLA or Berkeley? I currently have a 1400 SAT score, 18 on the Essay. UC GPA: 4.46. Numerous ECs and I am an out of state student. First generation going to college with Chinese background. 9 AP classes Senior year.   Roger: You sound like a great candidate, but I’m not at all qualified to give my opinion. (Maybe you’re mistaken about who I am?)   Amy Tran Thu, 30 Nov 2017 09:28:10 GMT What is a total semester?  How come when I put my SAT score it doesn't work? Math-36 Reading-36 Writing-38   Roger: If you’re referring to the input labeled “total semesters of AP, IB/HL, or CC courses”, then “total” is an adjective describing the number of semesters (not the semesters themselves). Also, this calculator uses the old 2400-point SAT scoring scale. Check out my response to “Leslie” below for more information about why this calculator is out of date.   Admirer Thu, 30 Nov 2017 05:31:39 GMT Thank you for giving your personal insight to all these comments Really means a lot to everyone   Roger: Glad to help!   Mariam Wed, 29 Nov 2017 05:15:24 GMT Hi, I am a Senior and I am taking a Community College course right now. I will know my grade in the middle of December, which is after the UC deadline. Still, will that be counted in my UC GPA?   Roger: You have the option of submitting a mid-year report to the UC’s, which would contain your senior year grades for the first half of your senior year as well as the community college course you’re taking right now. But as far as I know, the report is optional and most students don’t submit it. Does that answer your question?   Emily Mon, 27 Nov 2017 13:58:52 GMT Hi Roger, I'm an out of state applicant and because my honor courses aren't counted, my gpa is extremely low (3.7 uc gpa). However, I do well on standardized tests and I got a 1540 on the SAT. But if I put this into the calculator, it says my stats aren't believable and I can't get a result. Can this be modified? Thank you, Emily   Roger: You should only have that problem with the top UC schools. There simply weren’t enough applicants with that kind of GPA and SAT score for the models to make a confident prediction. Since there isn’t any new data available (see my reply to “Leslie” below), this is unlikely to change. Sorry!   JesusTheSIR Thu, 23 Nov 2017 21:16:52 GMT Hey so I really wanna study physics at Berkely, I have a 4.19 UC GPA although I got 540 English and 580 math and 21 ACT ;( I’m a bad test taker when it comes to timed especially, I know the material but the time get me especially reading since I’m a slow reader maybe because Spanish was my first language but I do Alof of community service and am even in charge of my schools JROTC, are my chances really below 10%?   Roger: I think you’re asking the wrong person. I’m a computer programmer and I don’t actually know anything about college admissions. Anyway, good luck!

UCLA gets more than 90K applications each year.   Priority admission goes to California residents so your scores have to be almost perfect.  Your grades have to be perfect and your EC's have to be focused. Since you are a CA resident, you may get in; you never know unless you apply.  Anything bio-related is impacted.  In other words, it is a very competitive major so once they run out of seats, they are done.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #4     mlsdream89    Registered User  Posts: 35  Junior Member      September 2017       SAT too low, not enough related things to your major, not enough information about your academic rigor.

(although he may get in under 1500 for that), useful majors with a high ROI and can make money after, such as engineering and some STEM majors are more competitive.

Everyone who applied to L&S gets admitted without a major. Engineering admits by major. And I can tell you a 1500 is not needed. Im a student engineering ambassador and for admissions there are plenty of non 1500 students getting in. That's a 2250 average on the old sat. And don't say it used to be more competitive in the past it wasn't in fact UCLA has gotten more competitive as time as gone on.

No one person can say you need a specific test score or GPA to get an acceptance but looking at the data available such as the Freshman profile can help gauge your chances.  There will always to outliers at each end of the spectrum.  Here is some information about how UCLA review applications:::  * Los Angeles * * 		Very important: Academic GPA, Application essay, Rigor of secondary school record, Standardized test scores * 		Important: Character/personal qualities, Extracurricular activities, Talent/ability, Volunteer work, Work experience * 		Considered: First generation college student, Geographical residence * 		Note: GPA, test scores, course work, number of and performance in honors and AP courses most important. Essay considered. Strong senior program important.

New Discussion What are my chances at getting into UCLA?       caitxoxo    Registered User  Posts: 12  New Member      October 2017    edited October 2017   in University of California - GENERAL      Hi, I am a high school senior currently applying to UCLA. I have a 3.98 unweighted GPA (4.3 weighted) and a 1270 SAT (I just retook it though and have not received my scores back yet). I've taken 4 AP classes and 7 honors classes (straight A's in all of them). Most of the AP and honors courses were focused on English and Spanish because they are my strengths and I plan to major in English. The reason I have not taken as many AP/honors is mainly because in my freshman year of high school I was diagnosed with cancer. However, I have done a bunch of charity work for cancer organizations. I have spoken at different events, raised money at my school and outside my school for different events, and was the Honored Hero of 2016 for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. I am a member of the Honors Institute at my school and the Spanish Honor Society. I also do a lot of film/TV acting classes and workshops too. I know it feels like I should have done more extracurriculars, but I really tried to focus on the things I'm most passionate about. I know my story is pretty unique, but what do you think my chances really are?  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook      Replies to: What are my chances at getting into UCLA?       #1     Gumbymom    Registered User  Posts: 21,336  Senior Member      October 2017    edited October 2017       Calculate your UC GPA capped weighted and fully weighted: https://rogerhub.com/gpa-calculator-uc/  Not all HS Honors courses are UC approved, so make sure you check this link if you are a CA HS student to see which courses at your HS will give you the extra honors points:   https://hs-articulation.ucop.edu/agcourselist#/list/search/institution  Your current SAT is on the low side (below 25th percentile) for UCLA but if you addressed your health issues along with your passion for your EC’s in your essays, it could have a positive impact on you chances.  25th - 75th percentiles for SAT: UCLA:  1280-1500  Freshman admit rates for UC GPA of 3.80-4.19 (capped weighted) and not major specific:  UCB: 14% UCLA: 14% UCSD: 44% UCSB: 54% UCD: 58% UCI: 65% UCSC: 85% UCR: 94% UCM: 96%  Freshman admit rates for UC GPA of 4.20 or above:  UCB: 42% UCLA: 54% UCSD: 87% UCSB: 85% UCD: 91% UCI: 94% UCR/UCM: 98%   Best of luck but consider UCLA as a Reach and apply widely.  0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook         Sign In or Register to comment.

If 3.8 is your UW GPA, then you are competitive in terms of GPA.

Additionally, this school receives so many applicants, and not everyone can receive admissions. UCLA is a high reach for you, but your ECs, and possibly your essays, may sway the admissions in your favor.

Now on to your question.  It looks like you're doing a lot to make up for the lack of APs in your school, and UCLA will certainly take into account the fact that those classes are not available to you. Contintue volunteering, identify a strong example of your leadership abilities for use in your personal statement, and work hard your last year with as tough a schedule as you can take to show UCLA that you can make the most of the opportunities your school does have. Finally, I would retake either the SAT or ACT to increase your chances. Focus on the one you can do better on. It can't hurt your chances!

The chance of getting in to UCLA varies by student. I didn't do a lot of volunteering, but i still did some; i came from a disadvantaged school in South Central L.A with crappy teachers, classes, etc.; Magnet students had priority for AP's, I didn't get AP classes till I was a senior (I had two AP classes); AND my SAT I score was at around 1300, I didn't take the ACT, didn't pass the darn AP exams, and got a 520 in the math 2 section, 470 in physics, 410 in chemistry, 380 in history, and 730 in the Spanish section; I graduated amongst the top 10 at my school and I still managed to get in.  Compared to other students, academically, I might be average or below average, but I was still able to get in. So just understand that there is no one specific standard that defines what makes a student worthy of a certain college. Colleges also take in consideration your personal statement--Yes it's nerve wrecking, but just chill :)   0   ·  Reply   ·  Share on Facebook          #9     Gobith    Registered User  Posts: 45  Junior Member      August 2014       My son has a 34/36 on the ACTs, 780 Subject SAT Bio, 760 Subject SAT Chem. But, his GPA is 3.0. He goes to a top private school in Manhattan/NYC. I add this fact, because, I was told that the weighted GPA can be higher as a result. He has taken tough courses (e.g. Advanced Physics, Adv Math, Adv Computer Sci). Was told that schools would look at these favorably. Not sure though.

Duh.  But here’s something that many parents in California don’t realize. Sending your child to a top high school could reduce their chances of getting into UCLA or  Berkeley .  During the past couple of weeks, I’ve run into parents who are mystified and angry that their teenagers didn’t get into these UC schools. One of these parents is my physician whose brilliant daughter had a nearly perfect SAT and grades to match at one of the top public high schools in San Diego County. The daughter of friend, who is an investment advisor, had the same kind of stats and she attends a private high school.  While I was hearing their complaints, a girl in my son’s carpool at High Tech High was rejoicing that she got into UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Davis and every other UC she applied to. Her SAT score was about 350 points less than the scores of each of the overachieving girls. Her SAT subject tests weren’t great either.  So what gives?  The girl with the lower scores attends a school that is in the ELC (Eligibility in the Local Context) program, which represents one of the three paths to UC freshmen eligibility. According to the rules, the top 4% of students at ELC high schools are qualified to attend a UC school based on their coursework, but not necessarily their first choice. The goal of ELC is to boost the eligibility pool to the kind of kids who might not otherwise be eligible for a UC.  ELC schools tend to be lower-income and diverse, but the girl in my carpool is white and Jewish.  How much easier is it to get to a UC campus by being near the top of the class at an ELC school? Here’s an example: Berkeley admits about 21% of applicants, but 56% of ELC students. If you don’t know if your teen’s school is in the ELC program, you might want to ask.

You do realize that SAT scores are only part of the  deal right. I have a relatively low ACT score…, 26. So why did I get into UCLA? Maybe it had to do with the fact that I challenged myself to be strong, learned from my failures, took initiative in my learning, showed humanity and passion that is needed to be a doctor, and shows my personality in the personal statement. I also explained that I have a type of dyslexia that does not allow me to read quickly, thereby me doing bad on the ACT.  Btw, my school is not ELC. My school is very competitive. UCLA takes people who thrive at competitive schools because (news shock!) UCLA is competitive. Those overachieving girls just got a high SAT score as far as you know…. But were they able to thrive in a competitive environment? And UCLA will admit the person who thrives in a competitive school than the one who gets the top grade in the lower school any time.   Reply          Brenda Rocha  March 17, 2014 at 11:30 pm  #     I didnt get into UC davis, UCSB, and UCSD… those universities have a higher percent acceptance than UCLA and UC berkeley.. do you guys still think I may have a chance? or does getting rejected by those top schools pretty much says it all?.   Reply          Karla Alexandra  January 6, 2013 at 5:09 am  #     Though this is written in 2009, I think this is still recent. UCLA and Berkeley look for those that excelled despite having many difficult circumstances. The girl with the higher SAT scores, probably did not take all the AP classes available, maybe her personal statement (more than likely well written) didn’t reflect thoughtfully on a social issue, etc. Even if the white Jewish girl did not attend UCLA or Berkeley, and decided to attend UCSB, she has higher chances of “success”–better jobs, better housing, networking with other “successful” middle-class persons. This is called WHITE PRIVILEGE that UCLA and Berkeley are very aware about and give chances to those that have been HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED and underrepresented in Higher Education. My point is whatever college you send your upper-middle class, child to, they will continue to be upper-middle class or mobilize into a higher SES. Also, getting into Berkeley and UCLA requires more than biased test scores that depict only one side of a person. What I think admitted me into Berkeley was being employed while in high school, reflecting thoughtfully on my experience through my personal statement and also committing myself into public service. It’s also important to note the difference between SOLIDARITY versus Charity!

Just one has to be at the top 4% in your school.   Reply          courtney  December 3, 2009 at 11:26 am  #     i want to know how much it is to get into UCLA and what gpa do you need to get in? is it hard to get accepted? or no? i wanna know   Reply          Lynn  December 3, 2009 at 3:43 pm  #     Courtney,  To get into UCLA you need to be in the top 10% of your high school class. You also need to have a GPA that is 3.75 or above. You can get a lot of freshmen admission stats by getting UCLA’s Common Data Set. http://www.aim.ucla.edu/CDS/cds0809/CDS0809A.asp  You can find blog posts about the Common Data Set on my site. Good luck.  Lynn O’Shaughnessy   Reply           Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

		      freshman applicants who were not admitted to UCLA.  Q: Can you tell me why I was denied?  A: Every application receives a minimum of two reviews, which balance academic and extracurricular information, combined with information we learn from the personal statement. Because this process 		      is not based on a formula, there rarely is a single reason 		      (such as one low test score or grade, etc.) that we can point 		      to as to why an individual applicant is not admitted.  Generally speaking, the primary reason that we must turn away so many qualified students is simply that of competition. For Fall Quarter 2017, UCLA received more than 102,000 freshman applications for a class of just over 6,000 new freshmen. We had to deny more than 85,000 applicants. Among these were some of the brightest and highest achieving high school seniors in the state. Almost all of them were UC eligible. Most students denied by UCLA are eligible to gain admission to at least one of the other UC campuses. We strongly encourage you to focus on the options you have.  Here	are some statistics showing the GPAs, courses, and ACT/SAT scores at the 25th and 75th percentile mark within the admitted class.       Fully-Weighted GPA  extra grade point for honors  ACT Composite Score  a-g course honors semesters, grades 10–12*        75th percentile  4.64    25th percentile  4.29      75th percentile  34    25th percentile  30      75th percentile  28    25th percentile  18         Unweighted GPA  no extra grade point for honors    *These figures are for domestic applicants only.        75th percentile  4.00    25th percentile  3.88        ( more statistics
		      on freshman class )  Q: Can I be placed
		      on your waitlist?  A: Unfortunately, no. Applicants invited to be on UCLA's waitlist are identified prior to the release of decisions, as part of our overall freshman admission selection process; applicants themselves cannot request to be placed on the waitlist.  Q: I would like
		      to appeal my decision. What should I include in my appeal?  A: Because all
		      applicants are examined so thoroughly in multiple reviews,
		      admission decisions are rarely overturned. Requests for reconsideration
		      are most likely to be persuasive only when students present
		      new information. By "new" we mean information
		      not already presented in the original application (e.g.
		      missing ACT/SAT scores, classes that were not listed as AP/Honors
		      that should have been, additional course work, etc.); information
		      that clearly shows you to have a stronger academic record
		      than had been earlier evidenced. Additional
		      extracurricular activities or fall term grades are not a basis
		      for a reversal of the decision since decisions are based on
		      academic information that was available at the time of application.  In rare cases, students may find it necessary
		      to be in Los Angeles due to a personal hardship. In itself,
		      this is not necessarily grounds for reversal of an admission
		      decision since there are several other colleges in the Los
		      Angeles area. Academic qualifications combined
		      with the particular hardship listed would allow for an additional
		      review of an applicant. If you base your appeal on an emergency
		      or sudden-need situation, please be prepared to document your
		      circumstances.  ( more on the appeal
		      process )    Q: Was I considered
		      for my alternate major also?  A:
		      Within the College of Letters and
		      Science, the major an applicant chooses is not a factor in
		      the review process at the freshman level. Unfortunately, due
		      to the high volume of applicants each term, UCLA does not
		      normally review applicants who applied to Arts, Music, Engineering,
		      or Theater/Film/TV majors for their alternate choices.    Q: I was ELC Eligible,
		      why was I not admitted to UCLA?  A: ELC students are guaranteed a spot at one of the nine UC Undergraduate
		      campuses , though not necessarily at their campus or program
		      of choice.  Q: I would still
		      like to attend UCLA. What are my options?  A: Entering UCLA as a freshman
		      is not your only option. We also accept applications from
		      students who have completed their first two years of college
		      at another institution.  While we accept applications from students from
		      other 4-year institutions, we give priority to students transferring
		      from other UC Campuses and California community colleges .
		      Many of these schools have special programs that help students
		      prepare to transfer to UCLA or other 4-year institutions.  ( more on transfer admission )    Q: I was denied
		      for Fall quarter, can I apply for winter quarter?  A:  No. UCLA only accepts new
		      freshman students for the fall quarter.    Was your

Calculate your chances of getting in with this free tool from Cappex.       GPA, SAT and ACT Stats                 UCLA, the University of California Los Angeles GPA, SAT Scores and ACT Scores for Admission.
Data Courtesy of Cappex   On the graph above, blue and green represent accepted students. As you can see, the majority of students who got into UCLA had a GPA over 3.5, an SAT score (RW+M) above 1100, and an ACT composite score of 22 or higher. Chances of admission improve as those numbers go up. Realize, however, that hidden beneath the blue and green on the graph is a lot of red. Many students with high GPAs and test scores get rejected from UCLA. Note also that a number of students were accepted with test scores and grades below the norm. Like all of the University of California schools , UCLA has holistic admissions , so the admissions officers are evaluating students based on more than numerical data. Students who show some kind of remarkable talent or have a compelling story to tell will often get a close look even if grades and test scores aren't up to the ideal. Make sure your application has strong essays. You'll want to put significant time and care into your personal insight questions on the UC application. Top universities like UCLA are looking for students who will contribute to the campus community in meaningful ways, and who show the potential to make a positive impact on the world after graduation. UCLA looks to enroll a diverse student body, and they will look at personal qualities such as leadership ability, creativity, and character as well as an applicant's achievement in his or her school, community, and/or workplace.               UCLA Waitlist and Rejection Data                 Waitlist and rejection data for the University of California Los Angeles, UCLA.
Data courtesy of Cappex   The graph at the top of this article might suggest that students with a strong A average and good SAT scores are very likely to be admitted to UCLA. The reality, however, is that you're going to need more than good grades and standardized test scores to be admitted. Plenty of students with solid A averages get rejected. The reasons can be many: weak application essays, a failure to take challenging AP or IB courses in high school, or unimpressive extracurricular activities. Also, some programs at UCLA are more competitive than others. In general, when a school admits just a quarter of all applicants, it's best to consider it a reach school even if your grades and test scores are on target for admission.

It became the Southern Branch of the University of California in 1919, making it the second-oldest undergraduate campus of the ten-campus University of California system. [10] It offers 337 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in a wide range of disciplines. [11] UCLA enrolls about 31,000 undergraduate and 13,000 graduate students, [6] and had 119,000 applicants for Fall 2016, including transfer applicants, the most applicants for any American university. [12]  The university is organized into six undergraduate colleges, seven professional schools, and four professional health science schools. The undergraduate colleges are the College of Letters and Science ; Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS) ; School of the Arts and Architecture ; Herb Alpert School of Music ; School of Theater, Film and Television ; and School of Nursing .  As of 2017, 24 Nobel laureates , 3 Fields Medalists , and 5 Turing Award winners have been affiliated with UCLA as faculty, researchers, or alumni. [13] [14] [15] In addition, two Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force . Among the current faculty members, 55 have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences , 28 to the National Academy of Engineering , 39 to the Institute of Medicine , and 124 to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . [16] The university was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1974. [17]  The Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2017–2018 ranked UCLA 15th in the world for academics, No.1 US Public University for academics, and 13th in the world for reputation. [18] [19] In 2017, UCLA ranked 12th in the world (10th in North America) by the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) [20] and 33rd in the 2017–2018 QS World University Rankings . [21] In 2017, the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) ranked the university 15th in the world based on quality of education, alumni employment, quality of faculty, publications, influence, citations, broad impact, and patents. [22] In 2017–2018, US News & World Report ranked UCLA as the #1 public university in the United States in a tie with its sister campus, UC Berkeley. [23]  UCLA student-athletes compete as the Bruins in the Pac-12 Conference . The Bruins have won 126 national championships, including 114 NCAA team championships, more than any other university except Stanford. [24] [25] [26] UCLA student-athletes, coaches and staff won 251 Olympic medals : 126 gold , 65 silver and 60 bronze . [27] UCLA student-athletes competed in every Olympics since 1920 with one exception ( 1924 ), and won a gold medal in every Olympics that the United States participated in since 1932.

The State Normal School at Los Angeles opened on August 29, 1882, on what is now the site of the Central Library of the Los Angeles Public Library system. The facility included an elementary school where teachers-in-training could practice their technique with children. That elementary school is related to the present day version, UCLA Lab School . In 1887, the school became known as the Los Angeles State Normal School. [29]     The Los Angeles branch of California State Normal School , 1881.    In 1914, the school moved to a new campus on Vermont Avenue (now the site of Los Angeles City College ) in East Hollywood . In 1917, UC Regent Edward Augustus Dickson , the only regent representing the Southland at the time, and Ernest Carroll Moore , Director of the Normal School, began to lobby the State Legislature to enable the school to become the second University of California campus, after UC Berkeley . They met resistance from UC Berkeley alumni, Northern California members of the state legislature, and Benjamin Ide Wheeler , President of the University of California from 1899 to 1919, who were all vigorously opposed to the idea of a southern campus. However, David Prescott Barrows , the new President of the University of California, did not share Wheeler's objections.  On May 23, 1919, the Southern Californians' efforts were rewarded when Governor William D. Stephens signed Assembly Bill 626 into law, which transformed the Los Angeles Normal School into the Southern Branch of the University of California . The same legislation added its general undergraduate program, the College of Letters and Science. [30] The Southern Branch campus opened on September 15 of that year, offering two-year undergraduate programs to 250 Letters and Science students and 1,250 students in the Teachers College, under Moore's continued direction. [31]     Southern Branch of the University of California's Vermont Campus, 1922.    Under University of California President William Wallace Campbell , enrollment at the Southern Branch expanded so rapidly that by the mid-1920s the institution was outgrowing the 25 acre Vermont Avenue location. The Regents searched for a new location and announced their selection of the so-called "Beverly Site"—just west of Beverly Hills —on March 21, 1925 edging out the panoramic hills of the still-empty Palos Verdes Peninsula . After the athletic teams entered the Pacific Coast conference in 1926, the Southern Branch student council adopted the nickname "Bruins", a name offered by the student council at UC Berkeley. [32] In 1927, the Regents renamed the Southern Branch the University of California at Los Angeles (the word "at" was officially replaced by a comma in 1953, in line with other UC campuses). In the same year, the state broke ground in Westwood on land sold for $1 million, less than one-third its value, by real estate developers Edwin and Harold Janss , for whom the Janss Steps are named. [29] The campus in Westwood opened to students in 1929.  The original four buildings were the College Library (now Powell Library ), Royce Hall , the Physics-Biology Building (now the Humanities Building), and the Chemistry Building (now Haines Hall), arrayed around a quadrangular courtyard on the 400 acre (1.6 km²) campus. The first undergraduate classes on the new campus were held in 1929 with 5,500 students. After lobbying by alumni, faculty, administration and community leaders, UCLA was permitted to award the master's degree in 1933, and the doctorate in 1936, against continued resistance from UC Berkeley. [33]  A timeline of the history can be found on its website, [34] as well as a published book. [35]  Maturity as a university [ edit ]      This section needs expansion with: History after 1951. You can help by adding to it .  (June 2016)     During its first 32 years, UCLA was treated as an off-site department of UC. As such, its presiding officer was called a "provost", and reported to the main campus in Berkeley. In 1951, UCLA was formally elevated to co-equal status with UC Berkeley, and its presiding officer Raymond B. Allen was the first chief executive to be granted the title of chancellor. The appointment of Franklin David Murphy to the position of Chancellor in 1960 helped spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. By the end of the decade, UCLA had achieved distinction in a wide range of subjects. This era also secured UCLA's position as a proper university and not simply a branch of the UC system. This change is exemplified by an incident involving Chancellor Murphy, which was described by him:   I picked up the telephone and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, "University of California." And I said, "Is this Berkeley?" She said, "No." I said, "Well, who have I gotten to?" "UCLA." I said, "Why didn't you say UCLA?" "Oh", she said, "we're instructed to say University of California." So the next morning I went to the office and wrote a memo; I said, "Will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, 'UCLA. ' " And they said, "You know they won't like it at Berkeley." And I said, "Well, let's just see. There are a few things maybe we can do around here without getting their permission." [36]   2016 shooting [ edit ]  Main article: 2016 UCLA shooting  On June 1, 2016, two men were killed in a murder-suicide at an engineering building in the university. School officials put the campus on lockdown as Los Angeles Police Department officers, including SWAT , cleared the campus. [37] [38]  Campus [ edit ]  The new UCLA campus in 1929 had four buildings: Royce Hall and Haines Hall on the north, and Powell Library and Kinsey Hall (now the Humanities Building) on the south. The Janss Steps were the original 87-step entrance to the university that lead to the quad of these four buildings. Today, the campus includes 163 buildings across 419 acres (1.7 km²) in the western part of Los Angeles , north of the Westwood shopping district and just south of Sunset Boulevard . In terms of acreage, it is the second smallest of the ten UC campuses. [7] The campus is close but not adjacent to the 405 San Diego Freeway . [39]     The Bruin statue, designed by Billy Fitzgerald, in Bruin Plaza. [40]    The campus is in the residential area of Westwood and bordered by Bel-Air to the north, Beverly Hills to the east, and Brentwood to the west. The campus is informally divided into North Campus and South Campus, which are both on the eastern half of the university's land. North Campus is the original campus core; its buildings are more traditional in appearance and clad in imported Italian brick. North Campus is home to the arts, humanities, social sciences, law, and business programs and is centered around ficus and sycamore-lined Dickson Court, also known as the "Sunken Garden". South Campus is home to the physical sciences, life sciences, engineering, mathematical sciences, health-related fields, and the UCLA Medical Center . The campus includes sculpture gardens, fountains, museums, and a mix of architectural styles.     Janss Steps, in front of Royce Hall    Ackerman Union, the John Wooden Center, the Arthur Ashe Health and Wellness Center, the Student Activities Center, Kerckhoff Hall, the J.D. Morgan Center, the James West Alumni Center, and Pauley Pavilion stand at the center of the campus, bordering Wilson Plaza. The campus is bisected by Bruin Walk, a heavily traveled pathway from the residential hill to the main campus. At the intersection of Bruin Walk and Westwood Plaza is Bruin Plaza, featuring an outdoor performing arts stage and a bronze statue of the Bruin bear.  During the 2028 Summer Olympics , wrestling and judo will be held at Pauley Pavilion . The campus will also be the location of the Olympic Village for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. [41]  Architecture [ edit ]  The first buildings were designed by the local firm Allison & Allison . The Romanesque Revival style of these first four structures remained the predominant building style until the 1950s, when architect Welton Becket was hired to supervise the expansion of the campus over the next two decades. Becket greatly streamlined its general appearance, adding several rows of minimalist , slab–shaped brick buildings to the southern half, the largest of these being the UCLA Medical Center . [42] Architects such as A. Quincy Jones , William Pereira and Paul Williams designed many subsequent structures on the campus during the mid-20th century. More recent additions include buildings designed by architects I.M. Pei , Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates , Richard Meier , Cesar Pelli , and Rafael Vinoly . To accommodate UCLA's rapidly growing student population, multiple construction and renovation projects are in progress, including expansions of the life sciences and engineering research complexes. This continuous construction gives UCLA the nickname "Under Construction Like Always". [43]      Royce Hall , one of the original four buildings, inspired by Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio    One notable building on campus is named after African-American alumnus Ralph Bunche , who received the 1950 Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating an armistice agreement between the Jews and Arabs in Israel. The entrance of Bunche Hall features a bust of him overlooking the Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden. He was the first individual of non-European background and the first UCLA alumnus to be honored with the Prize.  The Hannah Carter Japanese Garden is located a mile north of campus, in the community of Bel Air . The garden was designed by landscape architect Nagao Sakurai of Tokyo and garden designer Kazuo Nakamura of Kyoto in 1959. After the garden was damaged by heavy rains in 1969, UCLA Professor of Art and Campus Architect Koichi Kawana took on the task of its reconstruction.  Filming [ edit ]  UCLA has attracted filming for decades with its proximity to Hollywood . Much of the film Gotcha! (1985) was shot at UCLA, as well as John Singleton 's Higher Learning (1995). Legally Blonde (2001), Old School (2003), The Nutty Professor (1995), Erin Brockovich (2000), How High (2001), National Lampoon's Van Wilder (2002), American Pie 2 (2001), and Bring It On Again (2004) were all mainly shot around campus. In January 2009, the Bollywood movie My Name is Khan (2010) was shot at UCLA. UCLA is also often cast as Stanford in television shows such as The Mindy Project and Chuck . Some of the exterior shots of the fictional UC Sunnydale in Buffy the Vampire Slayer , and ABC Family original series Greek were also filmed at UCLA. In response to the major demand for filming, UCLA has instated a policy to regulate filming and professional photography at the campus. [44] "UCLA is located in Los Angeles, the same place as the American motion picture industry", said UCLA visiting professor of film and television Jonathan Kuntz. [45] "So we're convenient for (almost) all of the movie companies, TV production companies, commercial companies and so on. We're right where the action is."      California NanoSystems Institute interior walkways above a parking structure.    Transportation and parking [ edit ]  The campus maintains 24,000 parking spaces and operates an award-winning sustainable transportation program. [46] [47] [48] Elements of the sustainable transportation program include vanpools, a campus shuttle system called BruinBus, discounted carpool permits, and subsidized transit passes. One of the pass programs includes BruinGo!, [49] which allows students and staff members to purchase discounted passes to ride Santa Monica's Big Blue Bus and the Culver CityBus . [50] Additionally, UCLA has a grocery shuttle that transports students between the dorms and Westwood, on weekends in order to facilitate students' shopping needs.

The UCLA Health System operates the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center , a hospital in Santa Monica and twelve primary care clinics throughout Los Angeles County . In addition, the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine uses two Los Angeles County public hospitals as teaching hospitals— Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Olive View-UCLA Medical Center —as well as the largest private nonprofit hospital on the west coast, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center . The Greater Los Angeles VA Medical Center is also a major teaching and training site for the university. The UCLA Medical Center made history in 1981 when Assistant Professor Michael Gottlieb first diagnosed AIDS . UCLA medical researchers also pioneered the use of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to study brain function. Professor of Pharmacology Louis Ignarro was one of the recipients of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering the signaling cascade of nitric oxide , one of the most important molecules in cardiopulmonary physiology.  The U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals ranking for 2017 ranks UCLA Medical Center 7th in the United States and 2nd in the West after the UCSF Medical Center at the University of California, San Francisco , which is also part of the UC System . [52] UCLA Medical Center was ranked within the top 20 in the United States for 15 out of 16 medical specialty areas examined.

[117] In 2015, research firm PitchBook ranked UCLA 15th in the world for producing the most undergraduate alumni who are entrepreneurs backed by venture capital and 11th in the world for producing the most MBA graduate alumni who are entrepreneurs backed by venture capital. [118]  Library system [ edit ]  Main article: University of California, Los Angeles Library     Powell Library, across the quad from Royce Hall    UCLA's library system has over nine million books and 70,000 serials spread over twelve libraries and eleven other archives, reading rooms, and research centers. It is the United States' 12th largest library in number of volumes. [119]  The first library, University Library (presently Powell Library ), was founded in 1884. In 1910, Elizabeth Fargo became the university's first librarian. Lawrence Powell became librarian in 1944, and began a series of system overhauls and modifications, and in 1959, he was named Dean of the School of Library Service. [120] More libraries were added as previous ones filled. Page Ackerman became University Librarian in 1973, and was the nation's first female librarian of a system as large and complex as UCLA's. She oversaw the first coordinations between other UC schools, and formed a new administrative network that is still in use today. [121] Since her retirement, the system has seen steady growth and improvement under various Librarians. The present University Librarian is Virginia Steel, who took office on July 15, 2013. [122]  Medical school admissions [ edit ]  According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), UCLA supplies the most undergraduate applicants to U.S. medical schools among all American universities. In 2015, UCLA supplied 961 medical school applicants, followed by UC Berkeley with 819 and the University of Florida with 802. [123]  Among first-time medical school applicants who received their bachelor's degree from UCLA in 2014, 51% were admitted to at least one U.S. medical school. [124]  Admissions [ edit ]  Undergraduate [ edit ]   Fall Admission Statistics  Excluding deferred applications or other unique situations.     2017 [125]  2016 [126]  2015 [127]  2014 [128]  2013 [129]    Applicants  102,232  97,115  92,728  86,548  80,522    Admits  16,494  17,474  16,016  16,059  16,448    Admit rate  16.1%  18.0%  17.3%  18.6%  20.4%    Enrolled  N/A  6,545  5,679  5,764  5,697    Average GPA  N/A  4.33  4.33  4.31  4.29    SAT Range  N/A  1720–2160  1750–2170  1760–2190  1750–2150    ACT Range  N/A  25-33  25-33  25-32  25-32    U.S. News & World Report rates UCLA "Most Selective" [130] and Princeton Review rates its admissions selectivity of 97 out of 99. [131] 102,177 prospective freshmen applied for Fall 2017, the most of any four-year university in the United States. [125]  Admission rates vary according to the residency of applicants. For Fall 2016, California residents had an admission rate of 18%, while out-of-state U.S. residents had an admission rate of 22% and internationals had an admission rate of 14%. [132]  Admitted freshman applicants for Fall 2016 had a weighted GPA interquartile range of 4.25 – 4.62, an SAT interquartile range of 1900–2250, and an ACT interquartile range of 29 – 34. [132] Enrolled freshmen for Fall 2016 had an average weighted GPA of 4.33, an SAT interquartile range of 1720–2160, and an ACT interquartile range of 25 – 33. [126]  UCLA's freshman admission rate varies drastically across colleges. For Fall 2016, the College of Letters and Science had an admission rate of 21.2%, the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS) had an admission rate of 12.4%, the Herb Alpert School of Music had an admission rate of 23.5%, the School of the Arts and Architecture had an admission rate of 10.3%, the School of Nursing had an admission rate of 2.2%, and the School of Theater, Film and Television had an admission rate of 4.4%. [133]  Transfer students experienced a much higher admission rate of 26% for Fall 2016. [134]  About 3,350 transfer students entered UCLA in Fall 2016, 83% of whom came from the California Community Colleges System . [134] Over the past 15 years, more than 45,000 students have transferred to UCLA. [ citation needed ] Between one-half to one-third of baccalaureate degrees are awarded to students who transferred to UCLA. [ citation needed ] One of the major issues is the decreased admission of African-Americans since the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996, prohibiting racial or sexual discrimination at public institutions. [135] UCLA responded by shifting to a holistic admissions process starting Fall 2007. [136] The holistic admissions process evaluates applicants based on their opportunities in high school, their personal hardships and unusual circumstances at home.  Among the admitted freshman applicants for Fall 2016, 37% chose to enroll at UCLA. [126]  Graduate [ edit ]     Hugh and Hazel Darling Law Library, UCLA School of Law    For Fall 2014, the David Geffen School of Medicine admitted 3.2% of its applicants, making it the 9th most selective U.S. medical school. [137] The School of Law had a median undergraduate GPA of 3.74 and median Law School Admission Test (LSAT) score of 166 for the enrolled class of 2018. [138] The Anderson School of Management had a middle-80% GPA range of 3.2 – 3.8 and an average Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) score of 714 for the enrolled MBA class of 2017. [139]  The School of Dentistry had an average overall GPA of 3.75, an average science GPA of 3.71 and an average Dental Admissions Test (DAT) score of 22 for the enrolled class of 2018. [140] The Graduate School of Nursing currently has an acceptance rate of 3.9%. For Fall 2015, the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science (HSSEAS) had a graduate acceptance rate of 27.6%. [141]  Economic impact [ edit ]     A hoodie from the UCLA Store    The university has a significant impact in the Los Angeles economy. It is the fifth largest employer in the county (after Los Angeles County, the Los Angeles Unified School District, the federal government and the City of Los Angeles) and the seventh largest in the region. [142] [143]  Trademarks and licensing [ edit ]  The UCLA trademark "is the exclusive property of the Regents of the University of California ", [144] but it is managed, protected, and licensed through UCLA Trademarks and Licensing, a division of the Associated Students UCLA, the largest student employer on campus. [145] [146] As such, the ASUCLA also has a share in the profits.  Due to UCLA's academic and athletic prestige, as well as the name, being associated with popular images of Southern California lifestyle, apparel with UCLA logos and insignia sells not just in the United States, but as an overseas clothing and accessories brand. High demand for UCLA apparel has inspired the licensing of its trademark to UCLA brand stores throughout Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Since 1980, 15 UCLA stores have opened in South Korea , and 49 are currently open in China. The newest store was opened in Kuwait. [147] There are also stores in Mexico , Singapore , India and Europe. [148] UCLA makes $400,000 in royalties every year through its international licensing program. [148]  Commerce on campus [ edit ]  UCLA has various store locations around campus, with the main store in Ackerman Union. In addition, UCLA-themed products are sold at the gift shop of Fowler Museum on campus.  Due to licensing and trademarks, products with UCLA logos and insignia are usually higher priced than their unlicensed counterparts. These products have popularity among visitors, who buy them as gifts and souvenirs. For certain products (such as notebooks and folders) the UCLA Store offers both licensed (logo) and unlicensed (without logo, thus cheaper) options, but for many other products the latter option is often unavailable. [ citation needed ]  Students who are part-time employed by ASUCLA at a UCLA Store or a UCLA Restaurant are offered certain discounts when they are shopping at UCLA Stores, in addition to their salary.  Athletics [ edit ]  Main article: UCLA Bruins     Basketball at Pauley Pavilion       Football at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena       Track and field at Drake Stadium    The school's sports teams are called the Bruins , with colors True Blue and gold. The Bruins participate in NCAA Division I as part of the Pac-12 Conference . Two notable sports facilities serve as home venues for UCLA sports. The Bruin men's football team plays home games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena ; the team won a national title in 1954. The basketball and volleyball teams, and the women's gymnastics team compete at Pauley Pavilion on campus. The school also sponsors cross country , soccer , women's rowing , golf , tennis , water polo , track and field , and women's softball .  The mascots are Joe and Josephine Bruin, and the fight songs are Sons of Westwood and Mighty Bruins . The alma mater is Hail to the Hills of Westwood .  When Henry "Red" Sanders came to UCLA to coach football in 1949, the uniforms were redesigned. Sanders added a gold loop on the shoulders—the UCLA Stripe. The navy blue was changed to a lighter shade of blue. Sanders figured that the baby blue would look better on the field and in film. He dubbed the uniform "Powder Keg Blue", a powder blue with an explosive kick. This would also differentiate UCLA from all other UC teams, whose official colors are blue and gold.  UCLA competes in all major Division I sports and has won 126 national championships, including 114 NCAA championships. Only Stanford University has more NCAA team championships, with 116. [149] Most recently, UCLA's women's soccer team defeated Florida State to win its first NCAA National Championship along with women's tennis who defeated North Carolina to win its second NCAA National title ever. [150] UCLA's softball program is also outstanding. [151] Women's softball won their NCAA-leading 11th National Championship, on June 8, 2010. The women's water polo team is also dominant, with a record 7 NCAA championships. Notably, the team helped UCLA become the first school to win 100 NCAA championships overall when they won their fifth on May 13, 2007.  The men's water polo team won UCLA's 112th, 113th, and 114th national championships, defeating USC in the championship game three times: on December 7, 2014, on December 6, 2015, and on December 3, 2017. On October 9, 2016, the top-ranked men's water polo team broke the NCAA record for consecutive wins when they defeated UC Davis for their 52nd straight win. This toppled Stanford's previous record of 51 consecutive wins set in 1985–87. The men's water polo team has become a dominant sport on campus with a total of 11 national championships, including the school's most recent.  Among UCLA's 114 championship titles, some of the more notable victories are in men's basketball . Under legendary coach John Wooden , UCLA men's basketball teams won 10 NCAA championships, including a record seven consecutive , in 1964, 1965, 1967–1973, and 1975, and an 11th was added under then-coach Jim Harrick in 1995 (through 2008, the most consecutive by any other team is two ). [151] From 1971 to 1974, UCLA men's basketball won an unprecedented 88 consecutive games. UCLA has also shown dominance in men's volleyball , with 19 national championships. All 19 teams were led by former [152] coach Al Scates , which ties him with John McDonnell of the University of Arkansas as NCAA leader for national championships in a single sport. [151]  Former UCLA basketball player and former NBA player Earl Watson commented, "Eleven national championships, the best coach (Wooden) to coach the game says a lot. I take offense to those who act like UCLA is just another school compared with Duke . Duke is a great school in the east, but UCLA is worldwide."  UCLA is one of only five universities ( Michigan , Stanford , Ohio State , and UC Berkeley being the others) to have won national championships in all three major men's sports (baseball, basketball, and football). [153]  USC rivalry [ edit ]  Main article: UCLA–USC rivalry  UCLA shares a traditional sports rivalry with the nearby University of Southern California , especially for football. Under famous coach John Wooden, UCLA became a dominating power in men's basketball, and has won 11 NCAA championships , against USC's zero. [154] In football, UCLA has one national champion team and 16 conference titles, compared to USC's 11 national championships and 37 conference championships. The two football teams compete for annual possession of the Victory Bell , the trophy of the rivalry football game. In 2015, UCLA's football team was beaten by USC in a 21-40 defeat at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum , ending its three-game winning streak. [155]  The schools share a rivalry in many other sports. In men's volleyball, UCLA won 19 NCAA Men's Volleyball Championships against USC's four. [151] UCLA also dominates the all-time series vs. USC in men's volleyball (86–34). [156] In women's volleyball UCLA leads the all-time series against USC as well and has won eight national champions to USC's six. [157] In soccer, UCLA leads USC in the all-time series 13–3–0, yet USC no longer competes in men's NCAA Division I soccer. [158] The annual SoCal BMW Crosstown Cup compares the two schools based on their performance in 19 varsity sports; UCLA has won five times and USC has won nine times. This rivalry extends to the Olympic Games , where UCLA athletes have won 250 medals over a span of 50 years while USC athletes have won 287 over 100 years. [159] [160] [161]  UCLA and USC also compete in the We Run The City 5K, an annual charity race to raise donations for Special Olympics Southern California. The race is located on the campus of one of the schools and switches to the other campus each year. USC won the race in 2013 and 2015, while UCLA won the race in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2017. [162]  The origin is unclear, but the rivalry most likely started when football Hall of Fame coach Red Sanders led UCLA to dominance in the 1950s. USC, having won four national championships prior to UCLA's first and only title in 1954 diverted some attention from then-rival University of Notre Dame , and the new cross-town rivalry began. [163]  Student life [ edit ]   Ethnicity, 2016 [6]    Undergrad  Graduate  Percentage    Black Non-Hispanic  1,485  619  4.8%    Asian or Pacific Islander  9,917  2,566  29.1%    Hispanic  6,462  1,188  17.3%    American Indian or Alaskan Native  169  79  0.6%    White Non-Hispanic  8,113  4,394  29.1%    Unstated, Unknown , Other  1,068  670  4.0%    Foreign  3,659  3,159  15.2%    The campus is located near prominent entertainment venues such as the Getty Center , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and Walt Disney Concert Hall . UCLA offers classical orchestras , intramural sports , and over 800 student organizations. UCLA is also home to more than 70 fraternities and sororities , which represent 13% of the undergraduate population. [164]  Phrateres , a non-exclusive social-service club for women was founded here in 1924 by the Dean of Women, Helen Matthewson Laughlin. Students and staff participate in dinghy sailing, surfing, windsurfing, rowing, and kayaking at the UCLA Marina Aquatic Center in Marina del Rey .  UCLA's first contemporary a cappella group, Awaken A Cappella, was founded in 1992. The all-male group, Bruin Harmony, has enjoyed a successful career since its inception in 2006, portraying a collegiate a cappella group in The Social Network (2010), while the ScatterTones finished in second-place in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella in 2011–2013. Other a cappella groups include Signature, Random Voices, Medleys, YOUTHphonics, Resonance, Deviant Voices, Awechords and Cadenza. YOUTHphonics and Medleys are UCLA's only nonprofit service-oriented a cappella groups. [165]  There are also a variety of cultural organizations on campus, such as Nikkei Student Union (NSU), Japanese Student Association (JSA), [166] Association of Chinese Americans (ACA), Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA), Chinese Music Ensemble (CME), Chinese Cultural Dance Club (CCDC), Taiwanese American Union (TAU), Taiwanese Student Association (TSA), Hong Kong Student Society (HKSS), Hanoolim Korean Cultural Awareness Group, Samahang Pilipino, Vietnamese Student Union (VSU), and Thai Smakom. Many of these organizations have an annual "culture night" consisting of drama and dance which raises awareness of culture and history to the campus and community.  UCLA operates on a quarter calendar with the exception of the UCLA School of Law and the UCLA School of Medicine , which operate on a semester calendar .

(October 2016)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Fraternities and sororities have been a part of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) campus since 1923. Today UCLA is home to more than 60 national and local Greek-letter organizations, six governing councils with approximately 4,000 students which represents 13% of the undergraduate student population.  The Interfraternity Council (IFC) comprises 22 fraternities. The Panhellenic Association is made up of 17 sororities and over 4,000 women.

Latino Greek Council (LGC): Governing body of the 8 Latino/a founded Greek-letter organizations. Multi-Interest Greek Council (MIGC): Governing body of the 15 cultural-based/special-interest fraternity and sorority organizations. National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC): Governing body of the 7 historically African American Greek-letter organizations at UCLA.  Traditions [ edit ]     Spring Sing 2009    UCLA's official charity is UniCamp, founded in 1934. It is a week-long summer camp for under-served children from the greater Los Angeles area , with UCLA volunteer counselors. UniCamp runs for seven weeks throughout the summer at Camp River Glen in the San Bernardino National Forest. Because UniCamp is a non-profit organization, student volunteers from UCLA also fundraise money throughout the year to allow these children to attend summer camp. [169]  True Bruin Welcome begins the fall quarter to introduce new students to clubs and activities. The week includes the Day of Service for all freshmen, the Enormous Activities Fair, and the Sports Fair. At the end of move-in and the beginning of True Bruin Welcome, UCLA holds Bruin Bash, which includes a concert, dance and movie pre-release. Bruin Bash was created as a replacement for Black Sunday, a large-scale day of partying including all fraternities in North Westwood Village.  The Pediatric AIDS Coalition organizes the annual Dance Marathon in Pauley Pavilion, where thousands of students raise a minimum of $250 and dance for 26 hours to support the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation , Project Kindle, and the UCLA AIDS Institute. Dancers are not allowed to sit (except to use the restroom) during the marathon, literally taking a stand against pediatric AIDS, and symbolizing the suffering of affected children around the world. In 2015, Dance Marathon at UCLA raised $446,157. [170]  During Finals Week, UCLA students participate in "Midnight Yell", where they yell as loudly as possible for a few minutes at midnight to release some stress from studying. The quarterly Undie Run takes place during the Wednesday evening of Finals Week, when students run through the campus in their underwear or in skimpy costumes. The run began in Fall of 2001 when a student, Eric Whitehead, wearing what he described as "really short shorts" walked around singing and playing guitar to protest the police restrictions on the Midnight Yell. [171] With the increasing safety hazards and Police and Administration involvement, a student committee changed the route to a run through campus to Shapiro Fountain, which now culminates with students dancing in the fountain. [172] In 2007, the route was changed again to begin at Strathmore Avenue instead of Landfair Avenue. The Undie Run has spread to other American universities, including the University of Texas at Austin , Arizona State University , and Syracuse University .  The Alumni Association sponsors several events, usually large extravaganzas involving huge amounts of coordination, such as the 70-year-old Spring Sing, organized by the Student Alumni Association (SAA). UCLA's oldest tradition, Spring Sing is an annual gala of student talent, which is held at either Pauley Pavilion or the outdoor Los Angeles Tennis Center . The committee bestows the George and Ira Gershwin Lifetime Achievement Award each year to a major contributor to the music industry. Past recipients have included Stevie Wonder , Frank Sinatra , Ella Fitzgerald , James Taylor , Ray Charles , Natalie Cole , Quincy Jones , [173]  Lionel Richie , and in 2009, Julie Andrews . [174] The Dinner for 12 Strangers is a gathering of students, alumni, administration and faculty to network around different interests. [175] The "Beat 'SC Bonfire and Rally" occurs the week before the USC rivalry football game.      JazzReggae Festival 2010    The USAC Cultural Affairs Commission hosts the JazzReggae Festival , a two-day concert on Memorial Day weekend that attracts more than 20,000 attendees. The JazzReggae Festival is the largest, entirely student produced and run event of its kind on the West Coast. [176]  Sigma Eta Pi and Bruin Entrepreneurs organize LA Hacks , an annual hackathon where students from around the United States come to build technology products. LA Hacks established itself as the largest hackathon in the United States when over 1500 students participated in April 11–13, 2014. [177] LA Hacks also holds the record for the most funds raised via corporate sponsorships with $250,000 raised. Some of the tech world's most prominent people have given talks and judged projects at LA Hacks, including Evan Spiegel (Founder and CEO of Snapchat ), Alexis Ohanian (Co-Founder of Reddit ), Sam Altman (President of Y Combinator ) and Chris De Wolfe (Founder of Myspace ).  Student government [ edit ]     Kerckhoff Hall houses the student government and the Daily Bruin .    The Associated Students UCLA (ASUCLA) encompasses the student government and student-led enterprises at UCLA. ASUCLA has four major components: the Undergraduate Students Association, the Graduate Students Association, Student Media, and services & enterprises. However, in common practice, the term ASUCLA refers to the services and enterprises component. This includes the Student Store, Bookstore, Food Services, Student Union, etc. These commercial enterprises generate approximately $40 million in annual revenues. [178] As a nonprofit corporation, the financial goal of ASUCLA is to provide quality services and programs for students. ASUCLA is governed by a student-majority Board of Directors. The Undergraduate Students Association and Graduate Students Association each appoint three members plus one alternate. In addition to the student members, there are representatives appointed by the administration, the academic senate, and the alumni association. The "services and enterprises" portion of ASUCLA is run by a professional executive director who oversees some 300 staff and 2,000 student employees.  The Graduate Students Association is the governing body for approximately 13,000 graduate and professional students at UCLA. [179]  The Undergraduate Students Association Council (USAC) is the governing body of the Undergraduate Students Association (USA) whose membership comprises every UCLA undergraduate student. [180] As of 2015, the student body had two major political slates: Bruins United and Let's Act. In the Spring 2016 election, the two competing parties were Bruins United and Waves of Change—a smaller faction that broke off of Lets Act.  USAC's fourteen student officers and commissioners are elected by members of the Undergraduate Students Association at an annual election held during Spring Quarter. In addition to its fourteen elected members, USAC includes appointed representatives of the Administration, the Alumni, and the Faculty, as well as two ex-officio members, the ASUCLA Executive Director and a student Finance Committee Chairperson who is appointed by the USA President and approved by USAC. All members of USAC may participate fully in Council deliberations, but only the elected officers, minus the USAC President may vote.  Along with the council, the student government also includes a seven-member Judicial Board, which similar to the Supreme Court, serves as the judicial branch of government and reviews actions of the council. These seven students are appointed by the student body president and confirmed by the council.  USAC's programs offers additional services to the campus and surrounding communities. For example, each year approximately 40,000 students, faculty and staff attend programs of the Campus Events Commission , including a low-cost film program, a speakers program which presents leading figures from a wide range of disciplines, and performances by dozens of entertainers. Two to three thousand UCLA undergraduates participate annually in the more than twenty voluntary outreach programs run by the Community Service Commission. A large corps of undergraduate volunteers also participate in programs run by the Student Welfare Commission, such as AIDS Awareness , Substance Abuse Awareness, Blood Drives and CPR/First Aid Training.  Media publications [ edit ]  UCLA Student Media is the home of UCLA's newspaper, magazines, and radio station. [181] Most student media publications are governed by the ASUCLA Communications Board.  The Daily Bruin is UCLA's most prominent student publication. Founded in 1919 under the name Cub Californian , it has since then developed into Los Angeles' third-most circulated newspaper. It has won dozens of national awards, and is regularly commended for layout and content. In 2016, the paper won two National Pacemaker Awards – one for the best college newspaper in the country, and another for the best college media website in the country. [182] The newspaper has not been without scrutiny and controversy, and in 1954, the administration attempted to intervene with the previous policy of electing editors by a student council.  UCLA Student Media also publishes seven special-interest news magazines: Al-Talib , Fem , Ha'Am , La Gente , Nommo , Pacific Ties , and OutWrite , a school yearbook, BruinLife , and the student-run radio station, UCLA Radio.  Student groups such as The Forum for Energy Economics and Development also publish yearly journals focused on energy technologies and industries. There are also numerous graduate student-run journals at UCLA, such as Carte Italiane , Issues in Applied Linguistics , and Mediascape . [183] Many of these publications are available through open access . The School of Law publishes the UCLA Law Review which is currently ranked seventh among American law schools. [184]  Housing [ edit ]  Main article: UCLA student housing     Rieber Terrace housing    UCLA provides housing to over 10,000 undergraduate and 2,900 graduate students. [185]  Most undergraduate students are housed in 14 complexes on the western side of campus, referred to by students as "The Hill". Students can live in halls, plazas, suites, or university apartments, which vary in pricing and privacy. Housing plans also offer students access to dining facilities, which have been ranked by the Princeton Review as some of the best in the United States. [186] Dining halls are located in Covel Commons, Rieber Hall, Carnesale Commons and De Neve Plaza. In winter 2012, a dining hall called The Feast at Rieber opened to students. The newest dining hall (as of Winter Quarter 2014) is Bruin Plate, located in the Carnesale Commons (commonly referred to as Sproul Plaza). Residential cafes include Bruin Cafe, Rendezvous, The Study at Hedrick, and Cafe 1919. [187] UCLA currently offers three years guaranteed housing to its incoming freshmen, and one year to incoming transfer students. There are four type of housing available for students: residential halls, deluxe residential halls, residential plazas, and residential suites. Available on the hill are study rooms, basketball courts, tennis courts, and Sunset Recreational Center which includes three swimming pools.  Graduate students are housed in one of five apartment complexes. Weyburn Terrace is located just southwest of the campus in Westwood Village. The other four are roughly five miles south of UCLA in Palms and Mar Vista. They too vary in pricing and privacy. [188] Approximately 400 students live at the University Cooperative Housing Association, located two blocks off campus. [189]  Students who are involved in Greek life have the option to also live in Greek housing while at UCLA. Sorority houses are located east of campus on Hilgard Avenue, and fraternity houses are located west of campus throughout Westwood Village. A student usually lives with 50+ students in Greek housing.  Hospitality [ edit ]  Hospitality constituents of the university include departments not directly related to student life or administration. The Hospitality department manages the UCLA Guest House, a full-service, on-campus hotel. The 61-room Guest House services those visiting the university for campus-related activities. [190] The department also manages the UCLA Conference Center, a 40-acre (0.2 km²) conference center in the San Bernardino Mountains near Lake Arrowhead . [191] Hospitality also operates UCLA Catering [192] a vending operation, and summer conference center located on the Westwood campus. [193]  Chabad House [ edit ]  The UCLA Chabad House is a community center for Jewish students operated by the Orthodox Jewish  Chabad movement. Established in 1969, it was the first Chabad House at a university. [194] [195] In 1980, three students died in a fire in the original building of the UCLA Chabad House. The present building was erected in their memory. The building, completed in 1984, was the first of many Chabad houses worldwide designed as architectural reproductions of the residence of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson at 770 Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, New York. [194] The Chabad House hosts the UCLA chapter of The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute 's Sinai Scholars Society. [196] [197]  Healthy Campus Initiative [ edit ]      This section is too long .

[198] The goal of the initiative is to make UCLA the healthiest campus in the country, and to share best practices and research with other communities, locally and beyond. [199]  The initiative is a campuswide, multi-year effort that champions programs such as the tobacco-free policy, [200] expansion of campus gardens, [201] stairwell makeovers, [202] bicycle infrastructure improvements, [203] healthy and sustainable dining options, [204] and peer counseling, [205] among others.  The UCLA Healthy Campus Initiative is credited with providing inspiration for national initiatives including the Partnership for a Healthier America (PHA) Healthier Campus Initiative and the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) Global Food Initiative (GFI). [201] [206] In November 2014, UCLA was one of the 20 inaugural colleges and universities to pledge to adopt PHA's guidelines for food and nutrition, physical activity and programming over three years. [206] The Semel HCI is a member of both the Menus of Change Research Collaborative [207] and the Teaching Kitchen Collaborative, [208] and a contributor to The Huffington Post.
