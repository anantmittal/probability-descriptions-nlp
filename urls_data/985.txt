The first group of players bets even when the odds are not in their favor. The second group of players profits from the cash left behind by the first group. You want to belong to the
    second group.  Knowing your odds well is a key discipline one must possess to consistently win
        at poker. The poker odds chart below shows the probabilities of obtaining various
        winning hands Â in Texas Hold'em Poker.  "Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought.

Gambling led to the development of probability theory in the late 1400s. When playing a game with high stakes, players wanted to know what the chance of winning would be. In 1494, Fra Luca Paccioli released his work Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni e proportionalita which was the first written text on probability. Motivated by Paccioliâs work, Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) made further developments in probability theory. His work from 1550, titled Liber de Ludo Aleae , discussed the concepts of probability and how they directly related to gambling. However, his work did not receive any recognition because it was not published until after his death. Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) also contributed to probability theory. His friend, Chevalier de MÃ©rÃ©, was an avid gambler with the goal to become wealthy from it. De MÃ©rÃ© tried a new mathematical approach to a gambling game but did not get the desired results. Determined to know why his strategy was unsuccessful, he consulted with Pascal. Pascalâs work on this problem began an important correspondence between him and fellow mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Communicating through letters, the two continued to exchange their ideas and thoughts. These interactions led to the conception of basic probability theory. To this day, many gamblers still rely on the basic concepts of probability theory in order to make informed decisions while gambling. [1]  [2]  Frequency of 5-card poker hands [ edit ]     A Venn diagram depicting poker hands and their odds from a typical American 9/6 Jacks or Better machine    The following chart enumerates the (absolute) frequency of each hand, given all combinations of 5 cards randomly drawn from a full deck of 52 without replacement. Wild cards are not considered. In this chart:   Distinct hands is the number of different ways to draw the hand, not counting different suits.  Frequency is the number of ways to draw the hand, including the same card values in different suits.  The Probability of drawing a given hand is calculated by dividing the number of ways of drawing the hand ( Frequency ) by the total number of 5-card hands (the sample space ;             (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle \,{\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   ). For example, there are 4 different ways to draw a royal flush (one for each suit), so the probability is 4 / 2,598,960 , or one in 649,740. One would then expect to draw this hand about once in every 649,740 draws, that's nearly 0.000154% of the time.  Cumulative probability refers to the probability of drawing a hand as good as or better than the specified one. For example, the probability of drawing three of a kind is approximately 2.11%, while the probability of drawing a hand at least as good as three of a kind is about 2.87%. The cumulative probability is determined by adding one hand's probability with the probabilities of all hands above it.  The Odds are defined as the ratio of the number of ways not to draw the hand, to the number of ways to draw it. For instance, with a royal flush, there are 4 ways to draw one, and 2,598,956 ways to draw something else (2,598,960 - 4), so the odds against drawing a royal flush are 2,598,956Â : 4, or 649,739Â : 1. The formula for establishing the odds can also be stated as (1/p) - 1Â : 1 , where p is the aforementioned probability.  The values given for Probability , Cumulative probability , and Odds are rounded off for simplicity; the Distinct hands and Frequency values are exact.   The nCr function on most scientific calculators can be used to calculate hand frequencies; entering nCr with 52 and 5 , for example, yields            (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   as above.

It can be formed 4 ways (one for each suit), giving it a probability of 0.000154% and odds of 649,739Â : 1.  When ace-low straights and ace-low straight flushes are not counted, the probabilities of each are reduced: straights and straight flushes each become 9/10 as common as they otherwise would be. The 4 missed straight flushes become flushes and the 1,020 missed straights become no pair.  Note that since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. For example, the hand 3â£ 7â£ 8â£ Qâ  Aâ  is identical to 3â¦ 7â¦ 8â¦ Qâ¥ Aâ¥ because replacing all of the clubs in the first hand with diamonds and all of the spades with hearts produces the second hand. So eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values, there are only 134,459 distinct hands.  The number of distinct poker hands is even smaller. For example, 3â£ 7â£ 8â£ Qâ  Aâ  and 3â¦ 7â£ 8â¦ Qâ¥ Aâ¥ are not identical hands when just ignoring suit assignments because one hand has three suits, while the other hand has only twoâthat difference could affect the relative value of each hand when there are more cards to come. However, even though the hands are not identical from that perspective, they still form equivalent poker hands because each hand is an A-Q-8-7-3 high card hand. There are 7,462 distinct poker hands.  Frequency of 7-card poker hands [ edit ]  In some popular variations of poker, a player uses the best five-card poker hand out of seven cards. The frequencies are calculated in a manner similar to that shown for 5-card hands, except additional complications arise due to the extra two cards in the 7-card poker hand. The total number of distinct 7-card hands is            (    52  7    )     =  133  ,  784  ,  560        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 7}=133,784,560\end{matrix}}}   . It is notable that the probability of a no-pair hand is less than the probability of a one-pair or two-pair hand.  The Ace-high straight flush or royal flush is slightly more frequent (4324) than the lower straight flushes (4140 each) because the remaining two cards can have any value; a King-high straight flush, for example, cannot have the Ace of its suit in the hand (as that would make it ace-high instead).      Hand  Frequency  Probability  Cumulative  Odds    Royal flush  4,324  0.0032%  0.0032%  30,939Â : 1    Straight flush (excl. royal flush)  37,260  0.0279%  0.0311%  3,589.6Â : 1    Four of a kind  224,848  0.168%  0.199%  594Â : 1    Full house  3,473,184  2.60%  2.80%  37.5Â : 1    Flush  4,047,644  3.03%  5.82%  32.1Â : 1    Straight  6,180,020  4.62%  10.4%  20.6Â : 1    Three of a kind  6,461,620  4.83%  15.3%  19.7Â : 1    Two pair  31,433,400  23.5%  38.8%  3.26Â : 1    One pair  58,627,800  43.8%  82.6%  1.28Â : 1    No pair  23,294,460  17.4%  100%  4.74Â : 1    Total  133,784,560  100%  100%  0Â : 1      (The frequencies given are exact; the probabilities and odds are approximate.)  Since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. Eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values leaves 6,009,159 distinct 7-card hands.  The number of distinct 5-card poker hands that are possible from 7 cards is 4,824. Perhaps surprisingly, this is fewer than the number of 5-card poker hands from 5 cards because some 5-card hands are impossible with 7 cards (e.g. 7-high).  Frequency of 5-card lowball poker hands [ edit ]  See also: Lowball (poker)  Some variants of poker, called lowball , use a low hand to determine the winning hand. In most variants of lowball, the ace is counted as the lowest card and straights and flushes don't count against a low hand, so the lowest hand is the five-high hand A-2-3-4-5 , also called a wheel .

Frequency of 7-card lowball poker hands [ edit ]  See also: Lowball (poker)  In some variants of poker a player uses the best five-card low hand selected from seven cards. In most variants of lowball, the ace is counted as the lowest card and straights and flushes don't count against a low hand, so the lowest hand is the five-high hand A-2-3-4-5 , also called a wheel .

Although you donât need to be a math genius to play poker, a solid understanding of probability will serve you well and knowing the odds is what itâs all about in poker. It has also been said that in poker, there are good bets and bad bets. The game just determines who can tell the difference. That statement relates to the importance of knowing and understanding the math of the game.  In this lesson weâre going to focus on drawing odds in poker and how to calculate your chances of hitting a winning hand. Weâll start with some basic math before showing you how to correctly calculate your odds. Donât worry about any complex math â we will show you how to crunch the numbers, but weâll also provide some simple and easy shortcuts that you can commit to memory.  Basic Math â Odds and Percentages  Odds can be expressed both âforâ and âagainstâ. Letâs use a poker example to illustrate. The odds against hitting a flush when you hold four suited cards with one card to come is expressed as approximately 4-to-1. This is a ratio, not a fraction. It doesnât mean âa quarterâ. To figure the odds for this event simply add 4 and 1 together, which makes 5. So in this example you would expect to hit your flush 1 out of every 5 times. In percentage terms this would be expressed as 20% (100 / 5).  Here are some examples:   2-to-1 against = 1 out of every 3 times = 33.3%  3-to-1 against = 1 out of every 4 times = 25%  4-to-1 against = 1 out of every 5 times= 20%  5-to-1 against = 1 out of every 6 times = 16.6%   Converting odds into a percentage:   3-to-1 odds: 3 + 1 = 4. Then 100 / 4 = 25%  4-to-1 odds: 4 + 1 = 5. Then 100 / 5 = 20%   Converting a percentage into odds:   25%: 100 / 25 = 4. Then 4 â 1 = 3, giving 3-to-1 odds.  20%: 100 / 20 = 5. Then 5 â 1 = 4, giving 4-to-1 odds.   Another method of converting percentage into odds is to divide the percentage chance when you donât hit by the percentage when you do hit. For example, with a 20% chance of hitting (such as in a flush draw) we would do the following; 80% / 20% = 4, thus 4-to-1. Here are some other examples:   25% chance = 75 / 25 = 3 (thus, 3-to-1 odds).  30% chance = 70 / 30 = 2.33 (thus, 2.33-to-1 odds).   Some people are more comfortable working with percentages rather than odds, and vice versa. Whatâs most important is that you fully understand how odds work, because now weâre going to apply this knowledge of odds to the game of poker.  Counting Your Outs  Before you can begin to calculate your poker odds you need to know your âoutsâ. An out is a card which will make your hand. For example, if you are on a flush draw with four hearts in your hand, then there will be nine hearts (outs) remaining in the deck to give you a flush. Remember there are thirteen cards in a suit, so this is easily worked out; 13 â 4 = 9.  Another example would be if you hold a hand like and hit two pair on the flop of . You might already have the best hand, but thereâs room for improvement and you have four ways of making a full house. Any of the following cards will help improve your hand to a full house; .  The following table provides a short list of some common outs for post-flop play. I recommend you commit these outs to memory:  Table #1 â Outs to Improve Your Hand   The next table provides a list of even more types of draws and give examples, including the specific outs needed to make your hand. Take a moment to study these examples:  Table #2 â Examples of Drawing Hands (click to enlarge)   Counting outs is a fairly straightforward process. You simply count the number of unknown cards that will improve your hand, right? Waitâ¦ there are one or two things you need to consider:  Donât Count Outs Twice  There are 15 outs when you have both a straight and flush draw. You might be wondering why itâs 15 outs and not 17 outs, since there are 8 outs to make a straight and 9 outs for a flush (and 8 + 9 = 17). The reason is simpleâ¦ in our example from table #2 the and the will make a flush and also complete a straight. These outs cannot be counted twice, so our total outs for this type of draw is 15 and not 17.  Anti-Outs and Blockers  There are outs that will improve your hand but wonât help you win. For example, suppose you hold on a flop of . Youâre drawing to a straight and any two or any seven will help you make it. However, the flop also contains two hearts, so if you hit the or the you will have a straight, but could be losing to a flush. So from 8 possible outs you really only have 6 good outs.  Itâs generally better to err on the side of caution when assessing your possible outs. Donât fall into the trap of assuming that all your outs will help you. Some wonât, and they should be discounted from the equation. There are good outs, no-so good outs, and anti-outs. Keep this in mind.  Calculating Your Poker Odds  Once you know how many outs youâve got (remember to only include âgood outsâ), itâs time to calculate your odds. There are many ways to figure the actual odds of hitting these outs, and weâll explain three methods. This first one does not require math, just use the handy chart below:  Table #3 â Poker Odds Chart   As you can see in the above table, if youâre holding a flush draw after the flop (9 outs) you have a 19.1% chance of hitting it on the turn or expressed in odds, youâre 4.22-to-1 against. The odds are slightly better from the turn to the river, and much better when you have both cards still to come. Indeed, with both the turn and river you have a 35% chance of making your flush, or 1.86-to-1.  We have created a printable version of the poker drawing odds chart whichÂ will load as a PDF documentÂ Â (in a new window).Â Youâll need to have Adobe Acrobat on your computer to be able to view the PDF,Â but this isÂ installed onÂ most computers by default.Â We recommend you print the chart andÂ use it as a source of reference. It should come in very handy.  Doing the Math â Crunching Numbers  There are a couple of ways to do the math. One is complete and totally accurate and the other, a short cut which is close enough.  Letâs again use a flush draw as an example. The odds against hitting your flush from the flop to the river is 1.86-to-1. How do we get to this number? Letâs take a lookâ¦  With 9 hearts remaining there would be 36 combinations of getting 2 hearts and making your flush with 5 hearts. This is calculated as follows:  (9 x 8 / 2 x 1) = (72 / 2) â 36.  This is the probability of 2 running hearts when you only need 1 but this has to be figured. Of the 47 unknown remaining cards, 38 of them can combine with any of the 9 remaining hearts:  9 x 38 â 342.  Now we know there are 342 combinations of any non heart/heart combination. So we then add the two combinations that can make you your flush:  36 + 342 â 380.  The total number of turn and river combos is 1081 which is calculated as follows:  (47 x 46 / 2 x 1) = (2162 / 2) â 1081.  Now you take the 380 possible ways to make it and divide by the 1081 total possible outcomes:  380 / 1081 = 35.18518%  This number can be rounded to .352 or just .35 in decimal terms. You divide .35 into its reciprocal of .65:  0.65 / 0.35 = 1.8571428  And voila, this is how we reach 1.86. If that made you dizzy, here is the short hand method because you do not need to know it to 7 decimal points.  The Rule of Four and Two  A much easier way of calculating poker odds is the 4 and 2 method, which states you multiply your outs by 4 when you have both the turn and river to come â and with one card to go (i.e. turn to river) you would multiply your outs by 2 instead of 4.  Imagine a player goes all-in and by calling youâre guaranteed to see both the turn and river cards. If you have nine outs then itâs just a case of 9 x 4 = 36. It doesnât match the exact odds given in the chart, but itâs accurate enough.  What about with just one card to come? Well, itâs even easier. Using our flush example, nine outs would equal 18% (9 x 2). For a straight draw, simply count the outs and multiply by two, so thatâs 16% (8 x 2) â which is almost 17%. Again, itâs close enough and easy to do â you really donât have to be a math genius.  Conclusion  In this lesson weâve covered a lot of ground. We havenât mentioned the topic of pot odds yet â which is when we calculate whether or not itâs correct to call a bet based on the odds. This lesson was step one of the process, and in our pot odds lesson weâll give some examples of how the knowledge of poker odds is applied to making crucial decisions at the poker table.  As for calculating your oddsâ¦. have faith in the tables, they are accurate and the math is correct. Memorize some of the common draws, such as knowing that a flush draw is 4-to-1 against or 20%. The reason this is easier is that it requires less work when calculating the pot odds, which weâll get to in the next lesson.

List of poker hands   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search      An ace-high straight flush, commonly known as a royal flush , is the best possible hand in many variants of poker.    In poker , players construct sets of five playing cards , called hands , according to the rules of the game being played. [1] Each hand has a rank , which is compared against the ranks of other hands participating in the showdown to determine who wins the pot . [2] In high games, like Texas hold 'em and seven-card stud , the highest-ranking hands win. In low games, like razz , the lowest-ranking hands win. In high-low split games, both the highest-ranking and lowest-ranking hands win, though different rules are used to rank the high and low hands. [3] [4]  Each hand falls into a hand-ranking category determined by the patterns formed by its cards. Hands in a higher-ranking category always rank higher than hands in a lower-ranking category. Hands in the same category are ranked relative to each other by comparing the ranks of their respective cards. [5] Suits are not ranked in poker, so hands in the same category that differ by suit alone are of equal rank. [6] Cards in poker are ranked, from highest to lowest: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2. [7] However, aces have the lowest rank under high rules when forming part of a five-high straight or straight flush, or when playing ace-to-five low or ace-to-six low rules. [8] [9]  There are nine hand-ranking categories when using a standard 52-card deck , except under ace-to-five low rules where straights, flushes and straight flushes are not recognized. An additional category, five of a kind, is introduced when using one or more wild cards . The fewer hands a category contains, the higher its rank. [10] There are 311,875,200 ways to deal five cards from the deck but only 2,598,960 distinct hands, because the order in which cards are dealt or arranged in a hand does not matter. [11] Moreover, since hands differing only by suit are of equal rank, there are only 7,462 distinct hand ranks when using nine hand categories.

It ranks above a straight flush but is only possible when using one or more wild cards, as there are only four cards of each rank in a standard 52-card deck. [8] A five of a kind becomes possible when a joker is added to the deck as a bug , a form of wild card that may either act as a fifth ace or be used to complete any straight, flush or straight flush. Under these rules, the only possible five of a kind is five aces, A â¥  A â¦  A â£  A â   Jkr . [7] Other wild card rules allow jokers or other designated wild cards to represent any card in the deck, enabling the formation of five of a kind of any rank. [ citation needed ]  Each five of a kind is ranked by the rank of its quintuplet. For example, Q â   Q â¥  Q â£  Q â¦  Q ranks higher than 6 â£  6 â   6 â¦  6 â¥  6 . [8] [14]   Straight flush [ edit ]   "Straight flush" redirects here. For other uses, see Straight flush (disambiguation) .     A jack-high straight flush    A straight flush is a poker hand containing five cards of sequential rank, all of the same suit, such as Q â¥  J â¥  10 â¥  9 â¥  8 â¥ (a "queen-high straight flush"). [4] It ranks below five of a kind and above four of a kind. [7] As part of a straight flush, an ace can rank either above a king or below a two, depending on the rules of the game. Under high rules, an ace can rank either high (e.g. A â¥  K â¥  Q â¥  J â¥  10 â¥ is an ace-high straight flush) or low (e.g. 5 â¦  4 â¦  3 â¦  2 â¦  A â¦ is a five-high straight flush), but cannot rank both high and low in the same hand (e.g. Q â£  K â£  A â£  2 â£  3 â£ is an ace-high flush, not a straight flush). [8] [14] Under deuce-to-seven low rules, aces can only rank high, so a hand such as 5 â   4 â   3 â   2 â   A â  is actually an ace-high flush. Under ace-to-six low rules, aces can only rank low, so a hand such as A â¥  K â¥  Q â¥  J â¥  10 â¥ is actually a king-high flush. [15] Under ace-to-five low rules, straight flushes are not recognized, and a hand that would be categorized as a straight flush is instead a high card hand. [9]  There are 40 possible straight flush hands and 10 distinct ranks of straight flush under high rules when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each straight flush is ranked by the rank of its highest-ranking card. For example, 10 â£  9 â£  8 â£  7 â£  6 â£ ranks higher than 8 â¥  7 â¥  6 â¥  5 â¥  4 â¥ , which ranks higher than 6 â   5 â   4 â   3 â   2 â  . Straight flush hands that differ by suit alone, such as 7 â¦  6 â¦  5 â¦  4 â¦  3 â¦ and 7 â   6 â   5 â   4 â   3 â  , are of equal rank. [8] [14]  An ace-high straight flush, such as A â¦  K â¦  Q â¦  J â¦  10 â¦ , is commonly known as a royal flush or royal straight flush and is the best possible hand in high games when not using wild cards. [7] [16] [17] A five-high straight flush, such as 5 â¥  4 â¥  3 â¥  2 â¥  A â¥ , is called a steel wheel and is significant in ace-to-five high-low split games for being both the best low hand and usually the best high hand of the showdown. [4]   Four of a kind [ edit ]      Four of a kind, fives    Four of a kind , also known as quads , is a poker hand containing four cards of the same rank and one card of another rank (the kicker ), such as 9 â£  9 â   9 â¦  9 â¥  J â¥ ("four of a kind, nines"). It ranks below a straight flush and above a full house. [7]  There are 624 possible four of a kind hands and 156 distinct ranks of four of a kind when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each four of a kind is ranked first by the rank of its quadruplet, and then by the rank of its kicker. For example, K â   K â¥  K â£  K â¦  3 â¥ ranks higher than 7 â¥  7 â¦  7 â   7 â£  Q â¥ , which ranks higher than 7 â¥  7 â¦  7 â   7 â£  10 â  . Four of a kind hands that differ by suit alone, such as 4 â£  4 â   4 â¦  4 â¥  9 â£ and 4 â£  4 â   4 â¦  4 â¥  9 â¦ , are of equal rank. [8] [14]   Full house [ edit ]      A full house, sixes over kings    A full house , also known as a full boat (and originally called a full hand ), is a poker hand containing three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as 3 â£  3 â   3 â¦  6 â£  6 â¥ (a "full house, threes over sixes" or "threes full of sixes" or "threes full"). [18] [19] It ranks below four of a kind and above a flush. [7]  There are 3,744 possible full house hands and 156 distinct ranks of full house when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each full house is ranked first by the rank of its triplet, and then by the rank of its pair. For example, 8 â   8 â¦  8 â¥  7 â¦  7 â£ ranks higher than 4 â¦  4 â   4 â£  9 â¦  9 â£ , which ranks higher than 4 â¦  4 â   4 â£  5 â£  5 â¦ . Full house hands that differ by suit alone, such as K â£  K â   K â¦  J â£  J â  and K â£  K â¥  K â¦  J â£  J â¥ , are of equal rank. [8] [14]   Flush [ edit ]      A jack-high flush    A flush is a poker hand containing five cards all of the same suit, not all of sequential rank, such as K â£  10 â£  7 â£  6 â£  4 â£ (a "king-high flush" or "king-ten-high flush"). [20] It ranks below a full house and above a straight. [7] Under ace-to-five low rules, flushes are not recognized, and a hand that would be categorized as a flush is instead a high card hand. [9]  There are 5,108 possible flush hands and 1,277 distinct ranks of flush under high rules when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each flush is ranked first by the rank of its highest-ranking card, then by the rank of its second highest-ranking card, then by the rank of its third highest-ranking card, then by the rank of its fourth highest-ranking card, and finally by the rank of its lowest-ranking card. For example, K â¦  J â¦  9 â¦  6 â¦  4 â¦ ranks higher than Q â£  J â£  7 â£  6 â£  5 â£ , which ranks higher than J â¥  10 â¥  9 â¥  4 â¥  2 â¥ , which ranks higher than J â   10 â   8 â   6 â   3 â  , which ranks higher than J â¥  10 â¥  8 â¥  4 â¥  3 â¥ , which ranks higher than J â£  10 â£  8 â£  4 â£  2 â£ . Flush hands that differ by suit alone, such as 10 â¦  8 â¦  7 â¦  6 â¦  5 â¦ and 10 â   8 â   7 â   6 â   5 â  , are of equal rank. [8] [14]   Straight [ edit ]      A ten-high straight    A straight is a poker hand containing five cards of sequential rank, not all of the same suit, such as 7 â£  6 â   5 â   4 â¥  3 â¥ (a "seven-high straight"). It ranks below a flush and above three of a kind. [7] As part of a straight, an ace can rank either above a king or below a two, depending on the rules of the game. Under high rules, an ace can rank either high (e.g. A â¦  K â£  Q â£  J â¦  10 â  is an ace-high straight) or low (e.g. 5 â£  4 â¦  3 â¥  2 â¥  A â  is a five-high straight), but the ace cannot rank both high and low in the same hand (e.g. Q â   K â   A â£  2 â¥  3 â¦ is an ace-high high-card hand, not a straight). [8] [14] Under deuce-to-seven low rules, aces can only rank high, so a hand such as 5 â¥  4 â   3 â¥  2 â£  A â¦ is actually an ace-high high-card hand. Under ace-to-six low rules, aces can only rank low, so a hand such as A â£  K â   Q â   J â¦  10 â  is actually a king-high high-card hand. [15] Under ace-to-five low rules, straights are not recognized, and a hand that would be categorized as a straight is instead a high-card hand. [9]  There are 10,200 possible straight hands and 10 distinct ranks of straight under high rules when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each straight is ranked by the rank of its highest-ranking card. For example, J â¥  10 â¥  9 â£  8 â   7 â¥ ranks higher than 10 â   9 â   8 â£  7 â¥  6 â  , which ranks higher than 6 â£  5 â   4 â¥  3 â   2 â¦ . Straight hands that differ by suit alone, such as 9 â£  8 â£  7 â£  6 â¦  5 â¦ and 9 â   8 â   7 â   6 â¥  5 â¥ , are of equal rank. [8] [14]  An ace-high straight, such as A â£  K â£  Q â¦  J â   10 â  , is otherwise known as a broadway straight , [21] while a five-high straight, such as 5 â   4 â¦  3 â¦  2 â   A â¥ , is otherwise known as a baby straight , [22]  bicycle or wheel and is the best possible hand in ace-to-five low games, where it is instead categorized as a high card hand. [23] [24]   Three of a kind [ edit ]      Three of a kind, queens    Three of a kind , also known as trips or a set , is a poker hand containing three cards of the same rank and two cards of two other ranks (the kickers), such as 2 â¦  2 â   2 â£  K â   6 â¥ ("three of a kind, twos" or "trip twos" or a "set of twos"). It ranks below a straight and above two pair. [7]  There are 54,912 possible three of a kind hands and 858 distinct ranks of three of a kind when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each three of a kind is ranked first by the rank of its triplet, then by the rank of its highest-ranking kicker, and finally by the rank of its lowest-ranking kicker. For example, 6 â¥  6 â¦  6 â   Q â£  4 â  ranks higher than 3 â¦  3 â   3 â£  K â   2 â  , which ranks higher than 3 â¦  3 â   3 â£  J â£  7 â¥ , which ranks higher than 3 â¦  3 â   3 â£  J â   5 â¦ . Three of a kind hands that differ by suit alone, such as 9 â   9 â¥  9 â¦  10 â¦  8 â¥ and 9 â£  9 â   9 â¥  10 â¦  8 â¦ , are of equal rank. [8] [14]  In community card games, such as Texas hold 'em, three of a kind is called a set only when it comprises a pocket pair and a third card on the board . [25]   Two pair [ edit ]      Two pair, jacks and threes    Two pair is a poker hand containing two cards of the same rank, two cards of another rank and one card of a third rank (the kicker), such as J â¥  J â£  4 â£  4 â   9 â¥ ("two pair, jacks and fours" or "two pair, jacks over fours" or "jacks up"). [18] [26] It ranks below three of a kind and above one pair. [7]  There are 123,552 possible two pair hands and 858 distinct ranks of two pair when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each two pair is ranked first by the rank of its highest-ranking pair, then by the rank of its lowest-ranking pair, and finally by the rank of its kicker. For example, 10 â¦  10 â   2 â   2 â£  K â£ ranks higher than 5 â£  5 â   4 â¦  4 â¥  10 â¥ , which ranks higher than 5 â£  5 â   3 â£  3 â¦  Q â  , which ranks higher than 5 â£  5 â   3 â£  3 â¦  J â  . Two pair hands that differ by suit alone, such as K â¦  K â   7 â¦  7 â¥  8 â¥ and K â£  K â   7 â£  7 â¥  8 â£ , are of equal rank. [8] [14]   One pair [ edit ]      One pair, tens    One pair , or simply a pair , is a poker hand containing two cards of the same rank and three cards of three other ranks (the kickers), such as 4 â¥  4 â   K â   10 â¦  5 â  ("one pair, fours" or a "pair of fours"). It ranks below two pair and above high card. [7]  There are 1,098,240 possible one pair hands and 2,860 distinct ranks of one pair when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each one pair is ranked first by the rank of its pair, then by the rank of its highest-ranking kicker, then by the rank of its second highest-ranking kicker, and finally by the rank of its lowest-ranking kicker. For example, 9 â£  9 â¦  Q â   J â¥  5 â¥ ranks higher than 6 â¦  6 â¥  K â   7 â¥  4 â£ , which ranks higher than 6 â¦  6 â¥  Q â¥  J â   2 â£ , which ranks higher than 6 â¦  6 â¥  Q â   8 â£  7 â¦ , which ranks higher than 6 â¦  6 â¥  Q â¦  8 â¥  3 â  . One pair hands that differ by suit alone, such as 8 â   8 â¦  10 â¥  6 â£  5 â  and 8 â¥  8 â£  10 â£  6 â   5 â£ , are of equal rank. [8] [14]   High card [ edit ]      High card, king    High card , also known as no pair or simply nothing , is a poker hand containing five cards not all of sequential rank or of the same suit, and none of which are of the same rank, such as K â¥  J â¥  8 â£  7 â¦  4 â  ("high card, king" or "king-jack-high" or "king-high"). [18] [27] Under ace-to-five low rules, where straights, flushes and straight flushes are not recognized, hands that would fall into these categories are also high card hands. [9] It ranks below one pair. [7]  There are 1,302,540 possible high cards hands and 1,277 distinct ranks of high card hand under high rules when using a standard 52-card deck.

(July 2008)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In poker , bad beat is a subjective term for a hand in which a player with what appear to be strong cards nevertheless loses. It most often occurs where one player bets the clearly stronger hand and their opponent makes a poor call that eventually "sucks out" and wins. There is no consensus among poker players as to what exactly constitutes a bad beat and often players will disagree about whether a particular hand was a bad beat. A few examples are: quads over full house, quads over quads, straight flush over quads, small full house vs. bigger full house or better.     Contents    1  Types of bad beats  2  Reacting to bad beats  3  Bad beats online  4  Bad beat jackpot  5  See also  6  Notes  7  Books     Types of bad beats [ edit ]  Any hand that looked like a favorite to win can end up losing as more cards are dealt (with the nuts being the exception), but bad beats usually involve one of two not mutually exclusive scenarios:   The player who wins on a bad beat is rewarded for mathematically unsound play. Calling a bet despite having neither the best hand nor the right pot odds or implied odds to call, then winning anyway, is characteristic of this type of bad beat. It can also involve the inferior hand catching running cards when it requires two cards in a row to come from behind to win the pot. For example, catching cards on both the turn and the river in Texas hold 'em that complete a straight or flush.  A very strong hand loses to an even stronger one, better known as "cooler". This type of beat occurs with some frequency in movies. In the films The Cincinnati Kid and Casino Royale , The Kid and Le Chiffre each lose with a full house to a straight flush. In this situation, it is possible that both players have played their cards well, and avoiding the bad beat could not have been achieved without committing a mistake.   Reacting to bad beats [ edit ]  A bad beat can be a profound psychological blow, and can easily lead to a player going on tilt . Professional player Phil Hellmuth , among others, is notorious for his pronounced reactions to bad beats. However, suffering a bad beat means that the losing player was "getting the money in good" and in most instances would win by playing the same hand the same way. Thus, the more stoic poker players accept bad beats as an unpleasant but necessary drawback to a tactic that works the vast majority of the time.  Bad beats online [ edit ]  In online poker rooms, bad beats often lead to accusations that the random number generator is "rigged", even though such beats also occur in offline games. Many online poker rooms post statistical data to demonstrate the randomness of the hands generated. [1] In online poker games players have an opportunity to play in "bad beat" tables where the player who has the best losing hand receives an accumulated prize pool. An additional amount of rake is taken from each hand to fund the jackpot. The largest online jackpot to date was â¬1.25 million, hit in July 2011 with â¬443,000 going to the loser of the hand. [2]  Players are statistically more likely to experience bad beats online, since playing using a computer allows for more hands played per hour. Also, online players may play multiple cash game tables and/or tournaments at the same time, also increasing the frequency of hands dealt. Also, tells are rendered moot, so players are incapable of reading clues such as body language in aid of deriving the strength of an opponent's hand. Finally, online poker games (especially freeroll tournaments)are far more accessible to the average player who, being average, is less likely to be knowledgeable regarding the techniques of the game, in turn making it more likely they will bet from the gut or intuition rather than experience.  Bad beat jackpot [ edit ]  A bad beat jackpot is a prize that is paid when a sufficiently strong hand is shown down and loses to an even stronger hand held by another player. [3] Not all poker games offer bad beat jackpots, and those that do have specific requirements for how strong a losing hand must be to qualify for the jackpot. For example, the losing hand may be required to be four-of-a-kind or better. There may be additional requirements as well. For example, in Texas hold 'em there is usually a requirement that both hole cards play in both the losing and winning hands, or that where a full house is the minimum (usually aces full of jacks or higher), both hole cards must be used to make the three-of-a-kind in the full house.  Bad beat jackpots are usually progressive , often with a small rake being taken out of each pot to fund the jackpot (in addition to the regular rake). When a jackpot is won, it is usually split among all players sitting at the table at the time of the bad beat with the losing hand getting the largest share, followed by the winning hand, and all the other players dividing the remainder. Generally, only the best losing hand is eligible to win the largest share, even if another hand would also qualify.  Specific rules, collections, payout percentages, and amounts vary greatly from one casino or cardroom to the next, and are sometimes changed.

Hi everyone,   I'm looking for the specific odds of making quads with a pocket pair by the river. If you ran out all the community cards.  Also, odds of making quads on the flop. Thank you.                                      #2     12th May 2016, 7:17 AM             Shaetano [84]         Online Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: Holdem              Hey, here you go  Draw Probabilities for obtaining quads with pocket pair hole cards Complete on Flop: 0.245% Complete on Turn: 2.128% Complete on River: 2.174%                                   #3     12th May 2016, 7:26 AM              Aaron Soto [250]         Poker at: Bovada  Game: NL HOLDEM              Okay, so basically, your saying its about 1 in 50 I make quads by the turn? With a pocket pair? That can't be right.....I need the 1/10 type not percents. 0.245% on flop equates to about what? 1 in 400 which actually, seems correct. I can't see that by adding one more card (the turn) it becomes 1 in 50 no way.....                                   #4     12th May 2016, 9:24 AM           Excomm [30]         Online Poker at: BOL / ACR  Game: NLHE              It may be surprising, but that is the probability of drawing to 1 out on the turn (46:1) and the river (45:1).  It is the same probability of completing a straight flush draw as well.  The probabilities that Shaetano posted above are correct.  Think of it this way.  To make quads...  On the flop you are trying to draw 2 cards out of 50 and then 1 card out of 49 OR 2 cards out of 50 and then 1 card out of 48 OR 2 cards out of 49 and then 1 card out of 48.  On the Turn you are trying to draw just 1 card out of 47 (not that hard).  On the River you are trying to draw 1 card out of 46 (only a little worse than trying to get a powerball match  )                                   #5     12th May 2016, 9:46 AM              TimovieMan [2,264]         Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: Texas Holdem                   Originally Posted by Aaron Soto   I need the 1/10 type not percents.

Thank you. Yes. I don't know how to convert percents into fractions I'd have to look it up.   Thank you for your post. Well done.                                   #7     12th May 2016, 3:46 PM             Shaetano [84]         Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: Holdem              Hey,  easiest way is just to divide 100 by the odd:  For example 100 / 0.245 = 408,1633 ==> 408,1633 : 1 ==> 407 is more accurate as the effective odd isnt 0.245, but a lot more digits behind the comma.                                   #8     12th May 2016, 4:10 PM              TimovieMan [2,264]         Online Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: Texas Holdem                   Originally Posted by Shaetano   Hey,  easiest way is just to divide 100 by the odd:  For example 100 / 0.245 = 408,1633 ==> 408,1633 : 1 ==> 407 is more accurate as the effective odd isnt 0.245, but a lot more digits behind the comma.        Incorrect.  I hope my wording will be clear.  You subtract 1 from the 408.1633 to get the accurate number. It happens once in 408 hands, so the odds of it happening are 407:1.  Odds of 25% are 3:1, not 4:1 (as that would be 20%). It'll happen 25% of the time, or once in 4, but the odds are 3:1.   So it's ((100 / odds %) - 1 ) : 1.                                   #9     12th May 2016, 4:31 PM              SuzdalDEcor [511]                          Originally Posted by TimovieMan   Because converting is hard?

And the River probability is also misleading.        Fair enough.  It's true that the odds of making quads only improve significantly if you flop a set.  These are the odds of getting quads (when dealt a pocket pair) (or a straight flush with two suited and connected cards) WITHOUT assuming that you flopped a set.  *edit* Note that the odds for the turn include quads made on the flop, and the odds for the river include quads made on the flop and the turn.  Later today if I have time I'll figure out the odds of making these hands EXACTLY on the turn and river.  on Flop:  0.145 (407.33:1) by Turn:  0.490 (203.17:1) by River: 0.816 (121.50:1)  My bad for misinterpreting the original question.                                   #14     13th May 2016, 10:01 PM              Dutchtegon [155]         Online Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: holdem              Its nice to know such little facts, but I guess you are not going to play for those kind of things. When playing on pokerstars there are people wo do, and in general you can take their money without any problem, but when you lose from them the rage is to big to describe.                                   #15     13th May 2016, 10:25 PM           Excomm [30]         Poker at: BOL / ACR  Game: NLHE              I made a typo in my last response so I'll post the odds again here (sorry for the confusion)  on Flop  0.245 (407.33:1) (changed from the 0.145 typo) by Turn  0.490 (203.17:1) by River 0.816 (121.50:1)  If we subtract the quads made on previous streets then we will get the odds of hitting quads EXACTLY on those streets.  on Flop  0.245 (407.33:1) on Turn  0.245 (407.33:1) on River 0.327 (305.25:1)                                   #16     13th May 2016, 11:02 PM           shmucky [3]                     side note.       funny you bring this up. I just saw quad fours on the flop busted by a straight flush on the river. it was free roll on sports betting but painful to see lol                                  #17     27th December 2017, 10:23 AM             Mikeisanace777 [84]                     All the other answers are based on false Data mostly..       These odds are based on similar video poker data not real live poker ,or even online .The reason for this is sometimes,or a lot of times you have 0% whereas video poker it's always the same there are no hole cards and no burn cards which influence the unknown variables of quads and all hands in holdem poker by a lot!! Sometimes to hit the quads the card you need is burned,or usually folded or in play therefore it's not predictable at all. Same goes for a set it may be 1/8 chance to flop it or sometimes based on a 9 ring game and 3 burn cards could be 0% it's always fluctuates and this goes for flush draws,and all draws. In fact if you knew the remaining 31 cards in the deck vs other players hands you would always know what to do right? Say you got A/7 of spades in a limit game and you knew your up against KA off AQ off and jj but you somehow magically could see the remaining 31 cards and the burns then you would continue even after the flop. For instance say the flop came 9-A-8 with 2 spades vs the previous match ups I described in a good size pot,but you knew the remaining cards contained 3 sevens-2 aces and 2 eights, and to go with that the full match up of spades in the deck vs AK this is a huge beni factor for you as you got many cards to fill up,chop and 9 outs to flush out in your spade draw. Of course you never actually know this this is why Holdem poker is an incomplete data game there is no good cards in holdem especially limit holdem. As I said before you never know what could occur! Say you have kk vs 10-j and 67 with the remaining cards to be seen as 89-9 a load of 7's 10's and 2 fives all within that spectrum of the top of the deck,what makes matters worse even in the 31 random deck scenario vs these types of hands sometimes your kings aren't even in there and no running pairs to give you a counterfeit 2 pair either so your essentially dead in the water vs probable 2 pair flops like 8-10-4 -Q-5-10 etc.. It doesn't mean your one pair won't be gold it just means your hoping to hold up with no chance of improving. So to hit Quads on a flopped set of 99 all the stars have to line up right just the even have the true odds to make it in that scenario. Iv'e seen your previous posts and you enjoy 3/6 limit and play a lot you check on my post on advanced 3/6 theory gl man.

If the board card is higher or tied with either player's best hole card it's a split  pot.

P(1st spade)*P(2nd spade)*P(3rd spade) = (11/50)*(10/49)*(9/48) = 33/3920 = %0.84 (...)  this assumes we care about the order of the spades  in poker it does not matter what's the exact order of the cards hence the calculations needs to be multiplied by 3! = 1*2*3 = 6  (11/50*10/49*9/48) * 3!  3! takes into considerations all different combinations you can arrange 3 cards ...e.g. ABCD can be arranged 4! ways ...1*2*3*4 = 24 and we do not want to double count those cases                                   #10     1st September 2009, 12:20 AM              SavagePenguin [7,598]         Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: NLH              re: Poker & straight flush odds       I suck at math.  Obviously your odds will be better with 6/7s than they would be with A/Ks.  According to here , the odds of flopping a straight flush with two suited connectors is 4,899:1.  So getting it by the river will be substantially less than that.  And the flop gives you 60% of your community cards.  I can't seem to find someone posting the odds.  (Getting quads by the river with a PP is 1 in 122 but that does us no good)                                      #11     1st September 2009, 5:32 AM           Ben_Dover [34]         Game: holdem              This guy really is an absolute wizard: askthewizard  He'd probably say something like... the probabilty of hitting exactly the 7,8,9 of diamonds with 5 cards to draw equals:  (47 choose 2)*(3*2*1) / (50 choose 5) = 6486/2118760 = .31%  So with 4 different ways to hit it gives 4*.31 = 1.2% or 82-to-1.  Just a guess. -Ben                                   #12     2nd September 2009, 12:26 AM           chris_the_terrible [7]                     I got it. the mistake I made was the following... I assumed that I need to mix up the 5 cards (5!) ..but I never included them in the calculation...so knowing that per  Chances of Flopping...  http://www.pokerchipsupplystore.com/Texas_Hold_Em_Odds-c1353-wp5957.htm  Straight Flush holding suited connectors  4,899-1  this is how you should count your odds 1/50 * 1/49 * 1/48 * 4 * 3! = 0.02% or 1 to 4900   so 3! not 5! should be there ...3! = 1*2*3 = 6 - > this is how many ways u can mix the 3 cards on the board..the other 2 cards are irrelevant .. I do not include them in the calculation (1/50 * 1/49 * 1/48) so ...I do not need to mix them up  4 is for the 4 cases (that I described above) the outcome is 0.02% or 1 to 4900 it all make sense now                                   #13     2nd September 2009, 1:55 AM           Alwinpos [18]                     And lets not forget that in most cases you'll be folding that straight flush as its less likely your going to call with 5/6 suited on a 9 table when people raised before the flop.  Unless your a loose player and willing to take more riscs.                                   #14     2nd September 2009, 2:48 AM           Ben_Dover [34]         Game: holdem                    Originally Posted by chris_the_terrible   this is how you should count your odds 1/50 * 1/49 * 1/48 * 4 * 3! = 0.02% or 1 to 4900         Ah, those are the odds to FLOP it.  I did the odds to hit it by last card.  (82-to-1)      I wonder if that's right...                                   #15     2nd September 2009, 3:57 AM           chris_the_terrible [7]                     re: Poker & straight flush odds       >He'd probably say something like... the probabilty of hitting exactly the >7,8,9 of diamonds with 5 cards to draw equals:  >(47 choose 2)*(3*2*1) / (50 choose 5) = 6486/2118760 = .31%  >So with 4 different ways to hit it gives 4*.31 = 1.2% or 82-to-1.  that's much too high .. if we know that odds of flapping sf are 1:4900 then odds of having the sf by the river would be around  1:1500..maybe 1:1000...but not 1:82...  what do u think of :  4* [(1,1)*(1,1)*(1,1)]*[(47,2)]  / (50,5) = 0.2% = 1: 490  where e.g. (47,2) is newton binomial not permutation (which counts the order in which cards are dealt)  if you apply (50,5) and get 2118760  it means you do not take order into consideration ...well then ..let;s forget about 3! at the top as well ..to be consistent                                  #16     2nd September 2009, 5:00 AM           Ben_Dover [34]         Game: holdem              Yer right!  I might have a newton binomial nightmare tonight. It's really 3 choose 3 and that works out nicely:  4*(47 choose 2)*(3 choose 3)/(50 choose 5) = .002  p.s I strive for maximum ****tails and minimal math at the table.

Originally Posted by slipknot4life   1080 to 1, Super System         This is close but doesn't account for knowing your opponents hole cards like in our scenario.

A List of Long-Shot Odds in Texas Holdem    Share:         18 April 2017  By  Arved KlÃ¶hn               Connor Drinan knows how it feels when a longshot comes in.     Related Articles   Poker Tips from Pros: Jonathan Little Makes Basic Poker Math Easy  26 January 2015      Quads over quads? Set over set over set? Hitting the bad beat jackpot?   If you've played poker live or online for any stretch of time - even a very, very short amount of time - you've seen hands play out you never thought possible.  Runner-runner flush draws. Runner-runner straight draws. One-outers on the river to crush your massive favorite.  But how often do these "long-shots" really come in? And how often should we expect it?  Below we've compiled a comprehensive list of unusual long-shot odds for Texas Hold'em â numbers and percentages to impress (or possibly annoy) your fellow players at the table.  And, importantly, to unmask ruthless exaggerators who claim the most unlikely things happened to them just the other day.   Aces over aces?   Odds of Aces v. Aces  Let's start with some rather simple but quite important odds: being dealt aces.  There are 1,326 different hole-card combinations in Texas Hold'em and 6 of them are aces.  Thus the odds of being dealt aces in any hand are 6 to 1,320 or 1 to 221 (or 0.45%).  You probably already knew that. But what are the odds that one of your opponents is dealt aces as well?  At a full-ring table (for this article âfull ringâ means 9 players per table) this should happen only once every 154 times you're dealt aces.  A spectacular scenario, but quite unlikely.  The odds it happens in a $1m buy-in tournament? Too painful to even calculate , but itÂ happened to Connor Drinan inÂ the 2014 WSOP Big One for One Drop .Â Here's the Aces-vs-Aces Hand with Drinan and Cary Katz:   Running into Aces with Kings  With aces you have nothing to fear before the flop . But with pocket kings there is always this nagging thought in the back of your head that maybe, just maybe, one of your opponents has aces.   He folded Kings in the Main Event!   Is that a likely scenario?Â The answer is, as it often is in poker, âit depends."  If you're playing heads-up you're only up against one opponent. That opponent only has aces roughly once every 220 hands.  So, no. It's not likely he has your kings beat.  But at a full-ring table (9 players) with 8 opponents, it's suddenly much more likely â albeit still a long-shot â that someone has aces against your kings.  The odds for that to happen are 1 in 26 . You're almost always better off disregarding this worst-case scenario, but sometimes really good players can make impressive folds with kings before the flop.  Here's German young gun Christopher Frank doing exactly that during the 2016 WSOP Main Event:   Queens into Kings (and Aces)   So unlikely, so painful.   With kings it's possible, but unlikely, to run into a better hand pre-flop . But what about queens?  Queens are much more vulnerable and, while it's still much more likely that you're ahead pre-flop, you should consider the scenario that one of your opponents has kings or aces.  At a full-ring table the odds for that to happen are 1 in 13.  A raise, re-raise and an all-in in front of you might be a decent indicator that this 1 in 13 event is unfolding and that you're better off folding your hand.  Important Odds for Big Pairs  Scenario  Probability  Odds  Being dealt aces preflop  0.4525%  1:220  If you have aces heads-up, your opponent has aces as well  0.0816%  1:1,224  If you have aces at a full ring table, one opponent has aces as well  0.6512%  1:153  If you have kings heads-up, your opponent has aces  0.4898%  1:203  If you have kings at a full ring table, one opponent has aces  3.8518%  1:25  If you have queens heads-up, your opponent has kings or aces  0.9796%  1:101  If you have queens at a full ring table, at least one opponent has kings or aces  7.5732%  1:12  Set Over Set  Let's move on to some post-flop odds -- specifically sets, meaning trips with a pocket pair.  How often do you flop a set ? Every ambitious poker player should know this number by heart: roughly 12% of the time or once every 9 times you see a flop with your pair.   Set over set, baby.   A scenario many poker players are afraid of is the dreaded set over set: you flop a set but one of your opponents flops a better set.  Although quite unlikely this scenario is not that uncommon. If two players have pocket pairs, both will flop a set simultaneously roughly once every 100 flops .  You still need two players to have a pocket pair at the same time for that to happen. At a full-ring table you can expect to see a set-over-set scenario roughly once every 1,200 hands (assuming all players with pocket pairs always see a flop).  Heads-up this scenario is much more unlikely, though. It should happen only once every 42,000 hands . So there's no need to worry about better sets with only one opponent â unless of course you're Phil Ivey playing Scotty Nguyen in one of the biggest heads-up tournaments on TV:   Set Over Set Over Set  Set over set situations are already very uncommon. But what about some truly long-shot scenarios? What about three players all flopping a set at the same time?  The math shows this scenario is extremely unlikely. At a full-ring table you'll only see that every 166k hands. With only three players at the table, this number increases to once every 14 million hands . A true long-shot!  Important Set Over Set Odds  Scenario  Probability  Odds  If you have a pair, you hit a set (trips) on the flop  11.7551%  1:8  Being dealt a pair and flopping a set  0.6915%  1:144  If two players have pair, both flop a set  1.0176%  1:97  Heads-up both players are dealt a pair and flop a set  0.0024%  1:42,305  Two players at a 6-max-table are dealt a pair and both flop a set  0.0355%  1:2,819  Two players at a full ring table are dealt a pair and both flop a set  0.0851%  1:1,174  Three players at a 3-max-table are dealt and pair and all three flop a set  0.0000%  1:13,960,821  Three players at a 6-max-table are dealt and pair and all three flop a set  0.0001%  1:698,040  Three players at a full ring table are dealt and pair and all three flop a set  0.0006%  1:166,199  How Often Do You Hit Quads?  While sets are great hands, letâs now look at even better poker hands: quads. Only bested by straight flushes, quads are the second-best possible holding in Texas Holdâem and occur only very infrequently.   Quads over quads!   How infrequently?  Well, if you hold a pocket pair and go all the way with it, youâll hit a set by the river once every 123 attempts â infrequently, but still more likely than being dealt aces before the flop.  Quads over Quads: Does it Happen?  Set over set is already quite unlikely but what about one step further? What are the odds of two players hitting quads when both start out with a pocket pair ?  This scenario infamously happened to Andrew Robl and Toby Lewis during the Party Poker World Open some years ago:   Well, the odds for that are pretty slim: With two players holding a pocket pair both will hit quads by the river roughly once every 39,000 attempts .  Factoring in the odds of having two players being dealt pocket pairs before the flop, youâll see such a scenario at a full-ring table only once every 313k hands â for most live poker players, this already is a once-in-a-lifetime scenario.  Odds for Making Quads in Poker  Scenario  Probability  Odds  If you have a pair, you hit quads until the river  0.8163%  1:122  If two players have a pair, both hit quads until the river  0.0026%  1:38,915  Heads-up both players are dealt a pair and both hit quads  0.00000008%  1: 11,255,911  Two players at a 6-max-table are dealt a pair and both hit quads  0.0001%  1:750,393  Two players at a full ring table are dealt a pair and both hit quads  0.0003%  1:312,663  How Often Do You Flop a Flush?  Letâs take a look at some more post-flop odds.   Flushed.   If you hold two suited cards, flopping three cards of your suit is your dream scenario . But usually this doesnât happen.  Actually youâll only flop a flush once every 119 attempts if you start with two suited cards.  How Likely is Flush over Flush?  Your dream scenario of flopping a flush can occasionally turn into a nightmare if one of your opponents flops a better flush with you.  WSOP Champion Joe McKeehen probably still has the occasional night terror from a flush-over-flush hand where he was on the receiving end of a bad beat against Fedor Holz during the WSOP $111k High Roller in 2016:   But what are the odds? As a matter of fact, if two players start out with two suited cards of the same suit, the odds of both flopping a flush are not as small as one might think.   Once every 206 attempts the flop will show three cards of the same suit.Â Even flush over flush over flush is not that unlikely.  If three players have suited cards of identical suits, theyâll all flop a flush once every 434 attempts .  If you want to know how often this happens at a table, you still have to factor in the odds of all those players being dealt matching suited cards.  Considering those odds (and assuming every player with suited cards sees the flop â admittedly a bold assumption) youâll witness a flopped flush over flush once every 540 hands at a full ring table.  The triple flush is much more unlikely though and should happen only once every 29k attempts .  Odds for Flushes in Texas Hold'em  Scenario  Probability  Odds  If you have suited cards, you flop a flush  0.8418%  1:118  If two players have suited cards, both flop a flush  0.4857%  1:205  If three players have suited cards, all three flop a flush  0.2306%  1:433  Heads-Up, both players are dealt suited cards and flop a flush  0.0051%  1:19,490  Two players at a 6-max-table are dealt suited cards and both flop a flush  0.0770%  1:1,298  Two players at a full ring table are dealt suited cards and both flop a flush  0.1847%  1:540  Three players at a 6-max-table are dealt suited cards and all three flop a flush  0.0012%  1:85,758  Three players at a full ring table are dealt suited cards and all three flop a flush  0.0035%  1:28,585  Unlucky Streaks in Poker  Have you ever sat at a poker table for hours and not been dealt a single playable hand? Have you ever had someone claim he wasnât dealt a single ace over dozens - or even hundreds! - of hands ?   The unluckiest man in poker?   Letâs run some probabilities!  The probability of not being dealt a single pocket pair over 50 hands is a little bit under 5% â unlikely, but very possible. Expand the streak to 200 hands and the probability drops to less 0.0005%.  The guy to your right is claiming he hasnât seen a pair over the last two days? Heâs almost certainly bullshitting you.  Now most pocket pairs are only really good if you flop a set with them. Letâs take a look at some probabilities and assume youâll always see a flop with your pocket pairs.  The probability of hitting at least one set (i.e. youâre dealt a pair and you flop a set with it) over 100 hands is almost exactly 50% . So over 100 hands youâre as likely to hit at least one set as you are to not hit one.  Over 500 hands the probability of not hitting a single set drops to only 3%. Over 1,000 hands this number drops to less than 0.1% . So, over a long enough sample, you're practically guaranteed to flop one of those powerhouse hands.  Odds for Streaks in Poker  Scenario  Probability  Odds  Being dealt no pocket pair over 50 hands  4.8256%  1:20  Being dealt no pocket pair over 100 hands  0.2329%  1:428  Being dealt no pocket pair over 200 hands  0.0005%  1:184,410  Not hitting a set over 100 hands  49.9635%  1:1  Not hitting a set over 500 hands  3.1136%  1:31  Not hitting a set over 1000 hands  0.0969%  1:1,031  Being dealt no ace and no pocket pair over one full ring orbit  17.4226%  1:5  Being dealt no ace and no pocket pair over 25 hands  0.7798%  1:127  Being dealt no premium hand (A-K, JJ+) over 100 hands  4.6746%  1:20  Probability of a Royal Flush  Letâs return to individual poker hands once more, namely to the single best poker hand -- the royal flush . A hand so rare most poker players will remember every single one they are dealt for their entire life.   Royaled.   It's already quite unlikely for the board to allow for a royal flush (by featuring at least three cards ten or higher of the same suit).  This happens only once every 60 hands that go to the river.  Letâs say youâre playing at a full-ring table where each player tries his or her best to hit a royal flush.  That means they never fold their hand until itâs impossible for them to make that royal flush.  Then youâll see a royal flush roughly once every 3,600 hands . In real life the odds are certainly a bit lower since sometimes people fold hands like QTs before the flop.  Not everybody chases backdoor-royal-flush draws if there are bets and raises in front of them.  But letâs stay at this table where everyone does their best to make a royal flush. If you stood besides this table for 100 hands, the probability of witnessing at least one royal flush is already 2.7% â still unlikely, but not unheard of.  If you stood there for 2,500 hands (or roughly 100 hours of live poker) this probability increased to almost 50% .Â Here we can offer three royal flushes (and Phil Hellmuth winning one of them) in under 10 minutes:   All Important Royal Flush Probabilities  The board shows a royal flush  0.0002%  1:649,739  The board allows for a royal flush  1.6637%  1:59  One player makes a royal flush at a full ring table  0.0276%  1:3,628  Witnessing a royal flush over 100 hands at a full ring table  2.7184%  1:36  Witnessing a royal flush over 2500 hands at a full ring table  49.7922%  1:1  Witnessing two or more royal flushes over 100 hands at a full ring table  0.0369%  1:2,708  Odds of Hitting the Bad Beat Jackpot?  Many local card rooms and some online poker providers offer bad beat jackpots. If you lose with a very strong hand, you and the entire table receive a share of a significant jackpot.   Oh no.   Sometimes those jackpots are worth more than $1m and some people become rich by losing a single hand of poker.  Thereâs one caveat though: hitting those bad beat jackpots is really, really unlikely .  Card rooms also have strict requirements about which hands qualify for a bad beat jackpot.  One of the most frequently used rule sets for those jackpots is: One player must lose with quad eights (or better) and both him and the player with the winning hand must use both hole cards.  Hereâs a prime example of a hand that qualifies for such a bad beat jackpot:   Unfortunately for Motoyuki Mabuchi , who just lost with quad aces against a royal flush, this hand occurred during the WSOP which doesnât offer bad beat jackpots.  Letâs talk numbers: If youâre playing heads up and both you and your opponent do the best to hit the bad beat jackpot (i.e. not folding pockets eights or better and not folding possible straight flushes), youâll have a qualifying hand once every 7 million attempts . Talk about unlikely!  The odds improve considerably if you increase the number of players at the table since now more players can make a qualifying hand. At a full-ring table the odds of any two players hitting the bad beat jackpot are 1 to 194,000 .  How Likely is a Bad Beat Jackpot in Poker?  Scenario  Probability  Odds  Hitting quad eights or better and lose (heads-up)  0.0000%  1:6,974,878  Hitting quad eights or better and lose (6-max)  0.0002%  1:464,991  Hitting quad eights or better and lose (full ring)  0.0005%  1:193,746  Witnessing such a bad beat over 1,000 hands at a full ring table  0.5148%  1:193  Witnessing such a bad beat over 100,000 hands at a full ring table  40.3180%  1:1  Being Dealt the Same Hand Twice?  Now that we've covered most of the important long-shot odds, letâs look at some more streaks.  Have you had a dÃ©jÃ  vu when looking at your hole cards because you had the exact same cards (down to the suits) just the last hand? Sounds like the dealer is pretty bad at shuffling, no?   Didn't I just have this?   Actually, it doesn't. With a perfect shuffle the odds of you getting the same hand as you had the hand before is 1 in 1,326 â unlikely, but not impossible.  The gist with small probabilities is that they quickly become more and more likely if you repeat the event often enough. Over 100 hands itâs already 1 to 13 to be dealt the same two cards in a row at least once. And over 1,000 hands itâs already more likely for this happen at least once than for this to not happen.  Pocket Aces Back-to-Back  Now anyone can be dealt 83o twice in row and might not even notice this coincidence (because, who cares about those low cards). But if youâ re dealt pocket aces back-to-back, youâll probably remember this feat for months.  Surprisingly this scenario is not as unlikely as you might think. Over 100 hands the odds are roughly 1 to 500; over 1,000 hands already 1 to 50. Over 34,000 hands youâre 50/50 to have been dealt pocket aces twice in a row at least once.  Someone who has certainly played more than 34,000 hands is Phil Hellmuth . And the Poker Brat just recently managed to get dealt pocket aces back-to-back live on television during Poker Night in America .  But, of course, getting aces is not everything. You first need to get your stack in and you need your hand to hold up. Hellmuth seems to struggle with the latter in this clip:     Probabilities of Back-to-Back Hands and Streaks in Hold'em  Being dealt the exact same cards in a row at least once over 100 hands  7.1968%  1:13  Being dealt the exact same cards in a row at least once over 1,000 hands  52.9368%  1:1  Being dealt pocket aces twice in a row at least once over 100 hands  0.2016%  1:495  Being dealt pocket aces twice in a row at least once over 1,000 hands  2.0157%  1:49  Being dealt pocket aces twice in a row at least once over 34,000 hands  49.9927%  1:1  Being dealt pocket aces twice within one full ring orbit  0.0722%  1:1,385  Being dealt pocket aces three times within one full ring orbit  0.0008%  1:131,144  Being dealt pocket kings or better twice within one full ring orbit  0.2826%  1:353  Being dealt a premium hand (A-K, JJ+) twice within one full ring orbit  2.8448%  1:34  Being dealt a premium hand (A-K, JJ+) 10 or more times over 100 hands  0.0911%  1:1,097  Hitting at least 5 sets over 100 hands  0.0690%  1:1,447  How Many Ways to Shuffle the Deck?  Lastly, let's take a look at some rather big numbers: How many ways are there to shuffle a deck of 52 cards?   Let me count the ways.   For the first card you have 52 options, for the second 51, for the third 50 and so on. Thus the total number of different ways a deck can be shuffled is 52 Ã 51 Ã 50 Ã â¦ Ã 1 â or 52! (factorial).  This number is mindbogglingly huge.  It has 68 digits and if you like tongue twisters, please try to pronounce it: 80 unvigintillion 658 vigintillion 175 novemdecillion 170 octodecillion 943 septendecillion 900 sexdecillion.  Here's the full number:  80,658,175,170,943,900,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000  The number of ways to shuffle a single deck of cards is so huge that whenever you shuffle a deck you are virtually guaranteed to have a shuffle that has never been played before and never will be played again.  YouTuber Vsauce produced a great video which demonstrates how absurdly huge the number of ways to shuffle a deck actually is:   Number of Possible Different Poker Games  Interestingly enough, the number of different card distributions for a poker game is much smaller.  The bottom cards of the deck are not used and thus it doesn't matter how they are shuffled. As a matter of fact, for a heads-up game of Holdâem, you only use 9 cards â 4 hole cards and 5 for the board.  The total number of different distributions for a heads-up Hold'em game is a bit over 1 trillion: 1,390,690,501,200 â a number much smaller than 52!, but still large enough that you'll never see the same heads-up game twice in your lifetime.  Possible Distributions for Texas Hold'em Games  Number of different heads-up deals  1,390,690,501,200  Number of different 6-max deals  1,411,633,731,355,660,000,000  Number of different full ring deals  874,314,668,608,292,000,000,000,000  Number of ways to shuffle the deck  806,581,751,709,439 * 10^53  All Long-Shot Odds in Poker  Below we've listed all odds and probabilities mentioned in this article. Below each scenario we have provided the mathematical formula for how to calculate the probability. Keep in mind that all probabilities assume that each player stays in the hand until the mentioned scenario can no longer be reached. For example, the probabilities for sets assume that no player ever folds pocket pairs.  #  Scenario  Probability  Odds  1  Being dealt aces preflop  0.4525%  1:220    6/52c2  2  If you have aces

Is there anyone could calculate the odds of 3 people getting pocket pairs, then one of them flopping a quad and someone else getting a full house at the same time and him ending up being beat on the river despite hitting quad himself?

But as someone who has worked in a cardroom full-time for years, I've seen many beats this bad. The worst I remember is from a stud game at San Pablo: two players went all-in on sixth street, showing a 9-high straight flush in diamonds and a 10-high straight flush in spades, celebrating because that qualified them for a jackpot of about $10,000. Dealer burns, and turns....10 of diamonds. Split pot, no jackpot. â Lee Daniel Crocker  Aug 28 '15 at 16:07            The odds for one getting a pair is around 6% . This is all you need to account for. If you hit a set, you don't really care about the odds of the Villain hitting boat or quads. That's the rarest thing and just a cooler . Lose your stack and move on. â user1165  Aug 28 '15 at 21:24             Well they aren't that wrong... bad beats do happen "all the time". â user1934  Feb 21 '16 at 17:58            No, player 1 did not slow play.

Or well my maths anyway.  With 7 cards to choose from in hold'em, your hole cards and the board, the odds of making quads is about 1 in 595. (13 * (48 choose 3)) / (52 choose 7) which = 0.00168067227 or 1 in 595. This is over the entire 7 cards.  So for another person to have quads in the same hand we figure out how many possible hands are left. We know the player who has quads has 4 of the same cards, 2 in his hand 2 from the board. Leaving 2 from the other players hand and 3 more from the board giving 5 cards. This leaves 1,712,304 possible hands with 5 more cards. (48 choose 5) / 5! = 1,712,304.  So player one has effectively knocked out a card from the original calculation to get quads, so rather than 13 quads to choose from there is only 12 possible quads left. We can work out the odds of this player getting quads, which gives up 528 possible hands to give him quads in this situation, 12 types of quads left, 44 cards to choose from 12 * 44 = 528.  So now that we know the other player has 528 possible hands to give him quads over 5 cards, and we know the total number of possible hands left to be dealt, 528 / 1,712,304 = 0.031% or 1 in 3243.  This situation only factors in heads up like the above hand, and if both players have pocket pairs. It would change if the second player needed 3 cards on the board for their quads.     share | improve this answer     answered Aug 29 '15 at 12:04       Grinch91   2,725 1 4 22              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Yes, the probability of that is very low: <0.01%.

ANONYMOUS  Between two players there are 9 total cards. These must consist of two four of a kinds and one singleton. The number of combinations for this is combin(13,2)*44 = 3432. The total number of ways to pick 9 cards out of 52 is combin(52,9) = 3,679,075,400. So the probability you have the right cards, but not necessarily in the right order, is 3432/3,679,075,400 = 1 in 1,071,992.  However just because the cards are AAAABBBBC doesnât mean both players will have different four of a kinds. The number of ways to arrange them into a 5-card hand and two 2-card hands is 9!/(5!*2!*2!) = 756. Following are the ways those 9 cards can fall.  Four of a Kind Bad Beat Combinations
36  Player 1  Player 2  Flop  Mirror Patterns  Combinations per Pattern  Total Combinations  AA  BB  AABBC  2  72  AA  AB  ABBBC  4  48  192  AA  AA  BBBBC  2  6  12  AA  AC  ABBBB  4  12  48  AA  BC  AABBB  4  24  96  AB  AB  AABBC  1  144  144  AB  AC  AABBB  4  48  192  Of these only the first and the fifth group result in both players having a different four of a kind. So the probability that an AAAABBBBC set of cards results in two different four of a kinds is 168/756 = 22.22%.  So the answer to your question is (3432/3,679,075,400)*(168/756) = 1 in 4,823,963. On a more practical note Party Poker has a bad beat jackpot for a losing hand of four eights. Given that there are two four of a kinds the probability that both are eights or greater is combin(7,2)/combin(13,2) = 21/78 = 26.92%. So the probability that any one hand of two players will result in this bad beat jackpot is 1 in 17,917,577.     share | improve this answer     answered Aug 27 '16 at 16:36       Scot   1              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      My quad kings on the flop of (KKA) were beaten by pocket aces for AAAA over KKKK.
I calculated the odds of that happening were @1:56,000,000.
It's one hand I'll never forget just because of the outlandish probabilities involved.
However, I did also, in a live cash game, play 57 suited to straight flush a rival A hi flush AND a full house just like James Bond years before the movie came out. So it's not impossible.
I've played over 2 million hands of poker and the game has never lost intrigue.     share | improve this answer     answered Sep 4 '17 at 20:24       user5467   13 4              add a comment |            Your Answer            draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Suffice to say, the chances of what you've described are very very very small and I would suggest you consider investigating the shuffling and dealing technique in this game. â 3N1GM4  Dec 7 '16 at 13:27        add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  -1  down vote      Assuming that everyone goes to showdown every hand (which is obviously a massive and unrealistic assumption, but makes the calculation much easier), the chances of at least one player in your 7-handed game makes quads on any given hand is:  0.168% * 7 = 1.176%  For someone to get the same quads on another hand is:  (0.168% / 13) * 7 = 0.0905%  So for these two events to both occur would be:  1.176% * 0.0905% = 0.00106428%  For someone to additionally then get any other 4OAK on the 3rd hand:  0.00106428% * (0.168% * 7) = 0.000000125159328%  or roughly 1 in 8 million .  To be any more accurate, we need to model player behaviour and figure out chances that particular hands get to showdown etc, which makes the calculation non-trivial.     share | improve this answer      edited May 5 '17 at 13:30             answered Dec 7 '16 at 13:40       3N1GM4   1,645 2 24              add a comment |            Your Answer            draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

0.013183% or ~ once every 7586 hands  2) For your bonus question, I am not quite sure if that's what you are looking for, but have a look in here: http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/25/probability/quads-over-quads-odds-866086/ (assuming that 2 players start with 2 pocket pairs,and they're going to see all 5 community cards) it is calculated:
 ~ 1 in 38,916 hands   ++ Quick tip by the way: I would't worry too much if I ever won/lost a big pot with/to quads. Since it happens that rarely, it doesn't make much of a difference in your gameplay, winrate etc. I would focus more on "everyday" stuff, like cbet frequency, opening range, calling down frequencies etc and minimize my leaks in those sections.     share | improve this answer      edited May 24 '16 at 9:20             answered May 24 '16 at 8:59       koita_pisw_sou   648 1 7                  Hi koita, thanks for answering. I assume the odds for getting 4 of a kind are for 1 player? Do you know enough about statistics to tell me if for 9 players it would be 0.013183% x 9? Thanks for finding the odds on 4oak over 4oak, it's not that I'm worried about losing with 4oak, it's just it happened to me and I wanted to know the odds of it happening, but I couldn't find them anywhere. If I can get a second opinion to confirm the odds in #1 I'll upvote and accept - basically waiting to see if someone comments in agreement. :) â Dom  May 24 '16 at 9:10             The 0.013183% is for 9 players. In the link I provided, there is a table with all probabilities from 2 to 9 players if you want to get similar data. â koita_pisw_sou  May 24 '16 at 9:19            It seems a bit small for 9 players, and smaller than I expected for even a single player. Are you sure it's not for a single player in a 9 handed game? The link doesn't have much of a description above the table, and what it does have is ambiguous and could be interpreted in more than one way. â Dom  May 24 '16 at 9:30        1      The thing about probability is that it never said when you'll see those hands. It may be once every 7586 hands mathematically but you could play say 21,000 hands without seeing quads and then you might see quads three times over the next 2,000 hands or so or in a short amount of time. Also that 0.013183% is the percentage chance of it occurring for one player in a 9 handed table. Odds of quads vs quads is even smaller, see here for bad beat odds for quads: wizardofodds.com/games/texas-hold-em/bad-beat-jackpots . I know it seems small but its really not as common as some players believe. â Grinch91  May 24 '16 at 9:39            *Or rather I should say odds of quads being beaten, not necessarily just quads over quads. â Grinch91  May 24 '16 at 9:40        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Just anecdotal but I was playing live at a casino last week and I flopped quads twice and hit quads on the turn another time in a 5 hour session. That probably represents about 160 - 175 hands. Sometimes the laws of probability can seem to be violated over a small sample size.  On one of these hands, BTW, I came close to hitting the bad beat jackpot ($250K). I had JcJs and the flop was KhJhJd. Of course I didn't know it until the hand was over but one of the other players had Qh10h. That works out to about a 9% chance after the flop of me winning the lion's share of the jackpot. Why can't someone hit a 2-outer on me when I really need it ?!?     share | improve this answer     answered May 31 '16 at 19:56       Philip Hall   1 2              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote       How often statistically, should any player at a 9 seat table be getting 4 of a kind? Even if they fold and I don't see it, what's the general odds of 1 in 9 players making 4 of a kind?   The cardinality (whole possible hole + commie cards) is 52 taking 7: 133784560 The desired scenarios for you involve freezing 4 cards being equal (13 scenarios) and 3 out of the remaining 48 cards: 13 * 17296 = 224848 .  The odds are like 0.0017 by dividing desired / cardinality, but this will include situations of 4oak being community cards.  If you want to exclude the in-table 4-of-a-kind (you want it only for you), then you will have to calculate like this:   cardinality: 674274182400 (52 taking 7 in certain order).  scenarios: 13 * 17296 * 5040 (13 pokers, 48 taking 3 free cards, 5040 stands for 7! which contemplates arbitrary sort) - 48 * 47 * 13 * 46 * 120 (scenarios where you don't have one of those cards in your hand, but anyway it is 4oak, while the latter 120 is 5! which contemplates arbitrary sort in the commie cards; arbitrary sort is already contemplated in the hole cards when multiplying 48 * 47 ).   The result is 0.0014 here.  In this 0.0014 , however, another player (only one!) could also have 4oak, if that happens, scenarios are like this:   XX vs YY with XXYY? : 13 * 6 * 12 * 6 * 44 * 120 (which stands for: 44 as the ?, 120 as 5! for arbitrary flop order, 6 in both cases for suit combination in hands) = 29652480 .  ?X vs YY with XXXYY : 13 * 4 * 44 * 12 * 6 * 120 (which stands for: 44 as the ?, 120 as 5! for arbitrary flop order, 4 and 6 for suit combination in hands) = 19768320 .  XX vs ?Y with XXYYY : 19768320 same situation but reciprocal.   The question marks replace bricks . So you want to discard those scenarios when another one has a different 4oak:   cardinality: 674274182400 (52 taking 7 in certain order; this one did not change).  scenarios: 13 * 17296 * 5040 - 29652480 - 19768320 - 19768320 = 902154240 .   Your odds of getting exclusive 4oak and nobody else getting another 4oak is: 0.0013. In the other 0.0001 case the other one will get another 4oak, so by having an exclusive 4oak there's a 1/14 chance the other one has another exclusive 4oak as well.  Please I need a cross-review in this point! I'd like to check if 0.0013 is a good result or I screwed with the calc application. I admit it looks pretty weird to me this 1/14 difference   As a bonus question, if I may, what are the odds of losing with 4 of a kind to a better 4 of a kind?   Now focusing on the conditional analysis on the game table. If your hand/commie already look like this:   XX with XXYYY: One arbitrary opponent has a chance of having 4oak in 44 / 45 * 22 = 0.04444  ?X with XXXYY: One arbitrary opponent has a chance of having 4oak in 1 / 45 * 22 = 0.00101  XX with XXYY?: One arbitrary opponent has a chance of having 4oak in 1 / 45 * 22 = 0.00101   By having those scenario configurations, you have to map the value of X like this:   2 is worth 0, 10 is worth 8.  J Q K A is worth 9 10 11 12.  Lets call MAP(X) this mapping that converts the values like I told.  12 will be the maximum value here.   Given those three scenarios which could risk of having another 4oak from only one arbitrary opponent, you require an additional condition: AND the other player beats me with an Y-valued poker , so the values are:   0.04444 * (12 - MAP(X)) / 12 for scenario XX XXYYY.  0.00101 * (12 - MAP(X)) / 12 for scenario XX XXYY?.  0.00101 * (12 - MAP(X)) / 12 for scenario ?X XXXYY.   Disclaimer: These results are probabilistic fractions, which are always in closed interval [0..1]. Since none of these values is zero, you can calculate  H = 1 / value  and later say "the chances are 1 in H hands" .     share | improve this answer      edited Jun 30 '16 at 23:40             answered Jun 30 '16 at 21:57       Luis Masuelli   300 3 12              add a comment |             up vote  -3  down vote      Yes you are ranting.  Really you are counting and seeing 4 of a kind once every 100 - 150 hands.   If you are counting then you would have a number not a range.  The chance of 4 of a kind in 5 cards is 4,164 : 1  You are not playing with 5 cards you are playing with 7 The chance of 4 or a kind in 7 cards is 594 : 1  9 players is 9 hands so roughly 65 : 1 for a table of nine  It is covered in this wiki that I have linked in several of my answers. If you google "poker hands probability" it is the top hit.  As a bonus answer stop ranting.  If you have 4 of a kind assume it is good and get all you chips in the pot and hope for a call.  If there is not another pair on the board and not a straight flush then it is the nuts. It is the right statistical call every time even if the board has another pair or a straight flush.

Absolutely unnecessary rudeness. No I'm not ranting. I've been playing poker for 12 years and I've never seen 4 of a kind anywhere near as often as I've seen it recently. I've asked for the odds of a player getting it so that I can work out whether it's as unlikely as my gut feeling says it is, as it turns out, it appears to be more common than I thought it was. I assume the reason I'm seeing it more often lately is because I'm playing stakes where people play anything and call everything to showdown. Why would I be sitting there counting every hand and every 4 of a kind? :/ â Dom  May 24 '16 at 5:37            If you are not counting then just how do you know 100 - 150.  I read rant.  An answer to your question and -1.  You are welcome. â paparazzo  May 24 '16 at 5:39             Right.  So you count to 221 for aces but don't count 4 of a kind.  An answer to the stated question and you gave it down vote.   Fine, you will never get another answer from me. â paparazzo  May 24 '16 at 5:46        1      Not to get in between you two, but I don't think this is how statistics work :"I know that when I haven't seen aces or kings for over 221 hands they should be along soon" â Chad Mattox  May 24 '16 at 21:10        1      No. I discussed the context of the question. Discussing the user is discussing topics aside of the asked ones, picking aggressive / rude / bully behavior wrt what a user does, picking a fight or flamewar, and starting an answer like you did (without editing it, if the user edited). Accusing a user of bare ranting without the user asking for it, is discussing the user and not the question. That overall behavior is harmful for this community. â Luis Masuelli  Jul 1 '16 at 0:04        |  show 17 more comments           Your Answer            draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

I had pocket sixes, and ended up turning those into quads. Then, the very next hand -- from a different, auto-shuffled deck -- I got pocket sixes again, which again turned into quads! I got the same four-of-a-kind two hands in a row. I figure the odds against that are astronomical.  And I want to know, just how astronomical are they? Just what exactly are the odds of getting the same four-of-a-kind twice in a row in Hold'em?    texas-hold-em  odds     share | improve this question     asked Jan 24 '12 at 22:34       SkippyKawakami   28 1 3              add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  6  down vote  accepted      The odds of getting a 4 of a kind given 7 cards (2 in your hand and 5 on the board) are (13 * (48 choose 3)) / (52 choose 7) or 0.00168067227. The probability of getting that specific 4 of a kind again are now (48 choose 3) / (52 choose 7) or 0.000129282482.  The probability of both events occurring is 0.00168067227* 0.000129282482, which is 0.000000217281482.  Note that this leaves open the possibility that other people at the table would also still have the four of a kind (as in, it includes those situations where there is a four of a kind on the board.) Presumably, you'd want to exclude those.  For this, we have to multiply the probability of getting 3 of a kind on the board while having an unpaired hand with the probability of getting 2 of a kind on the board while having a paired hand.   Probability of a pocket pair = 78/1326  Probability of matching 2 of a kind on the board: (48 choose 3)/(50 choose 5)  Probability of no pocket pair: 1248/1326  Probability of matching 3 of a kind on the board: (47 choose 2)/(50 choose 5)   So the probability of an exclusive four of a kind is:  (48 choose 3)/(50 choose 5) * (78/1326) + (47 choose 2)/(50 choose 5) * (1248/1326) = 0.000960384154  The probability of getting the same exact four of a kind is then:   Probability of same pocket pair = 6/1326  Probability of matching 2 of a kind on the board: (48 choose 3)/(50 choose 5)  Probability of no pocket pair that matches that 4 of a kind: 208/1326  Probability of matching 3 of a kind on the board: (47 choose 2)/(50 choose 5)   This is:  (48 choose 3)/(50 choose 5) * (6/1326) + (47 choose 2)/(50 choose 5) * (208/1326) = 0.000116969865.  So the final probability is 0.000116969865 * 0.000960384154 = 0.000000112336005.  So basically: 8,901,864 : 1 odds of you getting the same four of a kind assuming you are the only one with the four of a kind each time. Otherwise, 4,602,324 : 1 odds of you getting the same four of a kind twice.     share | improve this answer     answered Jan 24 '12 at 23:49       Sasha   184 3                  Thank you! This explains it really well. So, if I wanted to limit it to four-of-a-kind starting with a pocket pair for both hands, it would be the same process, except not adding in the no-pocket-pair odds, right? I think if I'm doing my math right, the odds against this were 56,378,480:1 ... or to put it another way, I was more likely to win the California Super Lotto jackpot than I was to get this sequence of hands. â SkippyKawakami  Jan 27 '12 at 0:41             @SkippyKawakami: If only you could play the lottery as often as you play a poker hand...

I was really alluding to the conceptual broadness of the question. You could equally ask the same thing and substitute "four-of-a-kind" with any other combination of hand types, like two-pair, sets, etc. The conceptual scope of an odds question like this covers so much, and yet your specific question covers so little to be of any use to many others.

See All Sportsbook Reviews You are here Home Â» Four of a Kind Odds  Four of a Kind Odds  Facebook Twitter Reddit Getting four of a kind in Texas Holdâem wonât happen to you very often. You have roughly a 1 in 4,100 chance to hit this monster hand on the flop, but this big hand isnât always the best way to get chips from your opponents. Hitting four of a kind means that the only hand in poker that can beat you is a straight flush. The odds of being up against a straight flush when youâve hit four of a kind are over 1 in 88 million, and itâs unlikely that youâll even see this happen âÂ let alone be involved in a hand where it does occur. Just because you hit a big hand like four of a kind doesnât mean that youâre going to win a big pot. In order for you to have four of a kind, there has to be at least two of your cards on the board, and more often there will be three of them with the community cards. Because you have all four of them, your opponentsâÂ hands are going to be inferior, and when you have a big hand against a bunch of weak hands, itâs hard to get chips out of your opponents. They will see the likelihood of you having a big hand and will often get out of the way. The best way to play a monster hand like four of a kind is to let your opponents catch up a bit. You do this by not betting your big hand. That lets the other players in the hand improve and it makes them think that you donât have very much, especially a monster like four of a kind. You want to induce the other players at the table to make a bet at the pot. If someone does, you should only call their bets, and only raise the action after the last card has been dealt out. That will give you the best chance to get paid on your four of a kind, otherwise your monster hand will be wasted and all you will win will be a small pot.

Probability - General      Texas Hold âem - Probability - General   What are the odds of having two four of a kinds and a straight flush dealt to the same player in a Texas hold 'em game with ten players in 50 hands?  Paul from Toronto, Canada   The probability of a four of a kind in seven cards is 0.00168067, the probability of a straight flush is 0.00027851. If x is the probability of a four of a kind and y is the probability of a straight flush then the probability you ask for is combin(50,2)*48*x 2 *y*(1-x-y) 47 . The answer comes out to .0000421845, or 1 in 23,705.     What are the statistical odds of getting a flush in Texas hold âem. Is it easier to get a flush in 7-card stud or in holdem as a player.  Kevin from Richmond, USA   You can refer to my section on probabilities in poker to see the probability is 3.03%. The odds are the same in both Texas hold âem and 7-card stud.     What are the odds of making a royal flush in Texas hold-em on the river?  John from Trinity, Texas   For those readers who donât know, the river is the fifth and last community card in Texas hold-em. The player must make the best poker hand between his own two cards and the five community cards. So youâre asking what is the probability that a player will form a royal flush in seven cards, and that the seventh card dealt will be part of the royal. The probability of forming a 5-card royal flush out of 7 cards, before considering card, is 4*combin(47,2)/combin(52,7) = 4324/133784560, or 1 in 30940. The probability that the seventh card will be part of the royal flush is 5/7. So the final probability is 21620/936491920, or 1 in 43316.     In Texas Hold em, what are the odds of making a one gap or two gap inside straight by fifth street starting from the flop?  Mr. D from Cherry Hill, USA   For the benefit of my readers, this question asks what is the probability of filling in a one or two gap inside straight with two more cards, with 47 left in the deck. With one gap the probability is 1-combin(43,2)/combin(47,2) = 0.164662. With two gaps the probability is 4 2 /combin(47,2)=0.0148.     In Texas Hold âem if the flop cards are all the same suit what is the probability any given player will hold two more cards of the same suit?  Dr. Don   There are 10 cards left of the same suit, and 49 left in the deck. So the probability is combin(9,2)/combin(49,2) = 36/1176 = 0.0306.     Are the probabilities for the various hands the same in Texas Hold âem as in Seven-card stud or are they different somehow due to the community cards? Could you please explain why or why not?  Anonymous   Yes, the probabilities are the same. Seven random cards out of 52 have the same odds regardless of how they are taken out of the deck or whom you share them with.     In the initial two cards can you tell me what the odds are of receiving 7 hands of Ace King or better at holdâem in 35 hands?  Anonymous   The probability of receiving ace/king is (8/52)*(4/51) = 0.012066. The probability of receiving any pair is (3/51) = 0.058824. So the probability of a pair or better is 0.07089. The probability of receiving exactly seven hands of ace/king or better is combin(35,7)*(.07089)^7*(1-.07089)^28 = 0.00772. To work out the probability of 7 or more we would have to go through a total of 7 to 35 one at a time. This adds up to 0.010366551.     How would you figure the probability of getting a 4 card flush or better on the flop in holdem, if your hole cards are suited.  Anonymous   The probability of getting 2 more of the same suit is 39*combin(11,2)/combin(50,3) = 0.109439.  The probability of getting 3 more of the same suit is combin(11,3)/combin(50,3) = 0.008418.  So the probability of getting at least 2 more of the same suit is 0.117857.     Mr. Wizard, First, let me say you have a terrific site! Iâve been reading it for a while now. I checked the poker questions, and didnât see this one. Another site claims this, "In Texas Holdâem, the probability of AK dealt pre-flop and hitting an A or K by the river is 1 in 2 (even)." This seems intuitively way too high. What are your thoughts? Thanks again!  John   Thanks to you too for the kind words. For those not familiar with holdâem this question is akin to asking if a player were dealt an ace and a king plus five random cards from the remaining 50 cards, what is the probability the player would pair up the king and/or ace. Of the other 50 cards 44 of them are not kings or aces. The number of ways to draw any five cards out of 44 is combin(44,5) = 1,086,088. The number of ways to draw any five cards out of all 50 is combin(50,5) = 2,118,760. So the probability of not pairing up the ace and/or king is 1086088/2118760 = 51.26%. Thus the probability you will pair up is 1-51.26% = 48.74%. This is pretty close to 1 in 2.     What is the probability that two players will have different four-of-a-kinds in Texas Holdâem?  Anonymous   Between two players there are 9 total cards. These must consist of two four of a kinds and one singleton. The number of combinations for this is combin(13,2)*44 = 3432. The total number of ways to pick 9 cards out of 52 is combin(52,9) = 3,679,075,400. So the probability you have the right cards, but not necessarily in the right order, is 3432/3,679,075,400 = 1 in 1,071,992. However just because the cards are AAAABBBBC doesnât mean both players will have different four of a kinds. The number of ways to arrange them into a 5-card hand and two 2-card hands is 9!/(5!*2!*2!) = 756. Following are the ways those 9 cards can fall.   Four of a Kind Bad Beat Combinations   Player 1  Player 2  Flop  Mirror Patterns  Combinations per Pattern  Total Combinations   AA  BB  AABBC  2  36 72  AA  AB  ABBBC  4  48  192   AA  AA  BBBBC  2  6  12   AA  AC  ABBBB  4  12  48   AA  BC  AABBB  4  24  96   AB  AB  AABBC  1  144  144   AB  AC  AABBB  4  48  192  Of these only the first and the fifth group result in both players having a different four of a kind. So the probability that an AAAABBBBC set of cards results in two different four of a kinds is 168/756 = 22.22%. So the answer to your question is  (3432/3,679,075,400)*(168/756) = 1 in 4,823,963. On a more practical note Party Poker has a bad beat jackpot for a losing hand of four eights. Given that there are two four of a kinds the probability that both are eights or greater is combin(7,2)/combin(13,2) = 21/78 = 26.92%. So the probability that any one hand of two players will result in this bad beat jackpot is 1 in 17,917,577.  Last night a player offered me a side wager in Texas Hold âem. He said that at least one face card (or any three ranks) would appear on the flop and offered even money? Should I have accepted the bet?  Anonymous   The number of ways you can choose 3 cards out of the 40 non-face cards is (40*39*38)/(1*2*3) = 9880. The number of ways you can choose 3 cards out of 52 is (52*51*50)/(1*2*3) = 22100. So the probability of not getting a face card is 9880/22100 = 44.71%. Thus the probability of getting a face is 55.29%. His side of the bet had a 10.58% advantage.    Playing Texas Holdâem with 10 players using a standard 52-card deck, after the first two cards are dealt to each player, what are the odds that the "flop" (the next three cards) will all be the same suit? Does it make a difference if my hand has both cards of the same suit and/or each one a different suit?  Mark from Milford   Before considering your own cards the probability is 4Ã combin (13,3)/combin(52,3) = 5.1764706%. Another way to look at it is the probability second card in the flop will match the first in suit is (12/51).  The probability third card in the flop will match it is (11/50).  (12/51)Ã(11/50)=5.1764706%. The odds change a little if you consider your own cards.  If you have two cards of the same suit, then the probability of a suited flop is pr(flush in same suit) + pr(flush in a different suit) = combin(11,3)/combin(50,3) + 3Ãcombin(13,3)/combin(50,3) = 5.2193878%. If you have two cards of a different suit, then the probability of a suited flop is pr(flush in suit in common) + pr(flush in a different suit) = 2Ãcombin(12,3)/combin(50,3) + 2Ãcombin(13,3)/combin(50,3) = 5.1632653%.    Dear wiz, I wish I had your brain. In any event, my struggle with stats continues. I am trying to figure out a formula to figure out the probability of getting a flush on the flop, by the turn and by the river (texas holdem) crossed by whether my hole cards are suited or not.  I tried C(50,2) / C(47,5) but that didnât work out for a suited pair by the river...I should have paid more attention in school !  Thanks ! Your biggest fan  Eric from Toronto   Thanks for the kind words but I'm not that smart.  A couple years ago I took the Mensa entrance exam, and didn't make the requisite top 2%.  I'm still upset that they refused to tell me how well I did do.  On January 13 Jeopardy tryouts are coming to Vegas, for which I have an appointment, and am sure I'll blow that too.   Anyway, to answer your question here you go: With suited hole cards:  Flush after flop: combin (11,3)/combin(50,3) = 165/19600 = 0.842%. Flush after turn: (combin(11,2)*39/combin(50,3))*(9/47) = 2.096%. Flush after river: (combin(11,2)*combin(39,2)/combin(50,4))*(9/46) = 3.462%. With unsuited hole cards: Flush after flop: 0% Flush after turn: 2*combin(12,4)/combin(50,4) = 0.430%. Flush after river: (2*combin(12,3)*39/combin(50,4))*(9/46) = 1.458%. Here are the commulative probabilities. With suited hole cards: Flush by flop:  0.842%. Flush by turn:  2.937%. Flush by river:  6.400%. With unsuited hole cards: Flush by flop: 0.000% Flush by turn:  0.430%. Flush by river:  1.888%.    Hi Wizard, First off Iâd like to say I love the precise, fluff-free answers you give. Anyway if the pocket cards in Holdem are AA and the flop cards are KQ9, what is the probability of completing to a full house? Iâve worked on this for ages :( and still dont have an answer I trust.  Michael from Perth   You could complete the full house with an ace and a K, Q, or 9.  There are 2 aces left and 3 each of K,Q, an 9.  So there are 2*3*3=18 such combinations.  The only other way would be a K, Q, or 9 pair.  There are 3*combin(3,2)=9 such combination.  The number of all combinations is 47*46/2 = 1081.  So the probability is (18+9)/1081 = 2.50%.    Iâve been a huge fan for many years (even before you got interested in poker and sports betting) and looked forward to every Ask The Wizard column. Itâs great to see youâre doing them again!  My question is this: at my local card room, they offer Aces Cracked, Win A Rack during certain hours. That is, if you have pocket Aces in one of their 3-6 or 4-8 Texas Hold âEm games and you lose the pot, the casino will give you a rack of chips ($100). Iâm trying to figure out how often a)I get pocket Aces b)how often they would lose if I played them aggressively as Iâm supposed to and c)whether itâs not better to just check all the way down and hope to lose, as $100 is usually better than what the pot would have been anyway.  Any stats you may have at the ready would be wonderful and forever appreciated!  Thanks again and keep up enlightening the masses!  Shane from Santa Rosa   Thanks for the kind words.  The probability you will get pocket aces in any one hand is 6/1326, or once every 221 hands.  According to my 10-player Texas Hold âem section (/games/texas-hold-em/10players.html) the probability of winning with pocket aces is 31.36%, assuming all players stay in until the end.  However that is a big if.  If forced to make a guess Iâd estimate the probability of winning with aces in a real 10-player game is about 70%.  So the probability of getting pocket aces and then losing is 0.3*(1/221) = 0.1357%.  So, at $100 per incident that is worth 13.57 cents per hand.  Over ten people that costs the poker room $1.36 per hand on average, which cuts into the rake quite a bit.  I tend to agree with your strategy of calling, which will keep more players in the hand, and increase your chance of losing.    First of all Iâd like to thank you for an awsome site. Now hereâs my question: Weâre playing Texas holdâem and flop a flushdraw with two small cards. We all know the % of hitting the flush. but what we really want is the % of winning the hand. And letâs say that we are sure that somebody has a higher card of that suit than us. So my question is what are the % of only one card of that suit shows and not two? Regards  Henrik from Sweden   Youâre welcome.  So you have four to a flush with two on the board after the flop.  The probability of getting exactly one of the needed suit is 9*38/ combin (47,2) = 342/1081 = 31.64%.    In Texas Hold âem, Iâd like to know the probability that another player may have been dealt two suited cards to make a higher flush than my own when there are exactly 3 suited community cards at the river.  So, for example, if Iâve got 89 of spades and the community cards include the 3 7 and K of spades, there are 4 spades larger than my 9 in the deck (TJQA).  Whatâs the chance that someone was dealt a hand with two spades including at least one of the higher spades (assuming a 9 handed game)?  What if there are only 2 (or 3 or x) spades larger than my largest hole card?  Thanks for your help and the great site.  Bob B. from Scottsdale   The following table shows the probability for 1 to 8 higher ranks and 2 to 10 players, including yourself. In the case of your example of 4 higher ranks and 9 total players, the probability is 16.45%. The way I calculated these probabilities assumed independence between hands, which is not a correct assumption, but the results should be a close estimate.

Asking this for my own personal knowledge. I was playing a 4 person game of texas holdâem. I was dealt pocket aces. I got the royal flush on the river. I was wondering what the odds are of making the royal flush on the river with aces to start?  Rhythmic from Hoquiam, WA   Thanks.  Assuming the royal consists of one of your two aces, the number of ways to make a royal by the river is 2*46=92.  This would be the two suits in your pocket aces and the 46 possibilities for the extra card.  There are combin (50,5) = 2,118,760 ways to deal 5 cards out of 50.  So the probability is 92/2,118,760 = 1 in 23,030.    If the flop comes up three of the same suit and I do not have a suit that matches the flop, and there are ten players left at the table, what is the probability of someone having a flush?  David from Seattle   The probability of any one player having a flush is combin (11,2)/combin(49,2) = 55/1176 = 4.68%.  Assuming independence between hands, which is not the case, the probability of 9 players not having a flush is (1 â 0.0468%) 9 = 64.98%.  So the probability of at least one player having a flush is 1-0.6498 = 35.02%.  This is just a quick estimate.  If I did a random simulation I think the probability would be just a little bit higher, because of the dependence between hands.    Dear Mr. Wizard, I have been recently trying to calculate the probability of getting a flush in Texas Hold 'Em if dealt two suited hole cards? My answer keeps on coming out to be 5.8% but this seems ulimately incorrect, your help would be much appreciated thanks  Nathan S. from New Plymouth   The probability of making a flush, with exactly three cards to the same suit as your hole cards, is combin (11,3)Ãcombin(39,2)/combin(50,5) = 122265/2598960 = 0.057706. The probability of making a flush, with four more cards to the same suit as your hole cards, is combin(11,4)Ãcombin(39,1)/combin(50,5) = 2145/2118760 = 0.001012. The probability of making a flush, with five more cards to the same suit as your hole cards, is combin(11,5)/combin(50,5) = 462/2118760 = 0.000218.  The probability of making a flush on the board in another suit is 3Ãcombin(13,5)/combin(50,5) = 3861/2118760 = 0.001822.  Add this all up and you get 0.057706 + 0.001012 + 0.000218 + 0.001822 = 0.060759.    What is the probability of seeing a "broken board" in Texas HoldâEm?  That is, five cards on the board where no pair exists, no flush is possible and no straight is possible.  Tim from Arcata   The number of combinations of five different ranks on the board is combin (13,5)*4 5 = 1287 Ã 1024 = 1,317,888. The probability that these five ranks will represent three suits, two of two, and one of one, is combin(4,2)*2*combin(5,2)*combin(3,2)=360. Combin(4,2) is the number of ways to choose two suits out of four for the suits represented twice. 2 for the two ways to choose the suit represented once. Combin(5,2) for the number of ways to choose two ranks out of five for the first suit of two cards. 4 5 for the number of ways to choose two ranks out of the three left for the other suit of two. The probability these five ranks will represent four suits, one of two, and three of one, is 4*combin(5,2)*3*2=240. 4 is the number of ways to choose one suit out of four for the suits represented twice. Combin(5,2) is the number of ways to choose two ranks out of five for that suit of two cards. 3 is the number of ways to choose one rank out of the three left for the first suit of one. 2 is the number of ways to choose one rank out of two for the second suit of one. There are 4 5 =1024 ways to arrange four suits on five different ranks. So the probability that no more than two of one suit will be present is (360+240)/1024 = 600/1024 = 58.59%. There are combin(13,5)=1287 ways to arrange 5 ranks out of 13. The number of these combinations in which no three ranks are within a span of 5 is 79. There is no easy formula for this one. I had to cycle through every combination. So the probability the ranks will be sufficiently spaced apart is 79/1287 = 6.14%. So, the probability of a broken board is (1317888/2596960)*(600/1024)*(79/1287) = 1.825211%.  I have been challenged on my number of broken straights. Here is a list of all 79 possible.    2378Q 2378K 2379Q 2379K 237TQ 237TK 237JQ 237JK 237QK 2389K 238TK 238JK 238QK 2479Q 2479K 247TQ 247TK 247JQ 247JK 247QK   2489K 248TK 248JK 248QK 257TQ 257TK 257JQ 257JK 257QK 258TK 258JK 258QK 267JQ 267JK 267JA 267QK 267QA 267KA 268JK 268JA   268QK 268QA 268KA 269JA 269QA 269KA 278QK 278QA 278KA 279QA 279KA 289KA 3489K 348TK 348JK 348QK 358TK 358JK 358QK 368JK   368JA 368QK 368QA 368KA 369JA 369QA 369KA 378QK 378QA 378KA 379QA 379KA 389KA 469JA 469QA 469KA 479QA 479KA 489KA    I play Texas Hold âEm at Caesars Indiana.  They have a Bad Beat Jackpot, which is now quads or better being beat.  Both players have to play both hole cards, and there must be four players dealt cards.  My question is, what is the probability of any hand being a bad beat hand, assuming all players stay until the end?  Danielle from Louisville   My new Bad Beat Jackpot section shows the probability of this kind of bad beat in a 10-player game to be 0.0000108, or about 1 in 93,000.    In your Ultimate Texas Hold âEm return table why is a large raise recommended for two-card hands listed in the table that have a negative expected return?  For example, suited K/2.  Charlie Masterson from Quincy, MA   According to my two-player Texas Hold âEm probabilities , the following are the possible outcomes with suited K/2: Win  51.24% Lose  44.82% Draw  3.94% My table on Ultimate Texas Hold âEm shows that the player has the advantage on the Play bet, but a disadvantage on the Ante and Blind bets.  In this case, the player is stuck with bad odds on the Ante and Blind.  However, his odds are favorable on the Play.  So, by making the maximum raise he is getting the most value out of his better than 50% chance of winning.  The bad odds on the other two bets bring the overall value under 50%.  That value would be even less with  a smaller raise.    In the 2008 World Series of Poker Motoyuki Mabuchi's quad aces were beaten by Justin Phillip's Royal flush.  I have a simple question about the odds of this occurring.  ESPN and others quoted it as 1 in approximately 2.7 billion.  It appears to me that they simply took the published odds of quads occurring, and multiplied them by the odds of a royal flush occurring.  Is this the correct method of calculation?  Wade   I disagree with the 1 in 2.7 billion figure too.  As you said, they seemed to calculate the probabilities independently for each player, for just the case where both players use both hole cards, and multiplied.  Using this method I get a probability of 0.000000000341101, or about in 1 in 2.9 billion.  Maybe the one in 2.7 billion also involves compounding a rounding error on both player probabilities.  They also evidently forgot to multiply the probability by 2, for reasons I explain later.  There are three ways four aces could lose to a royal flush, as follows.  Case 1 :  One player has two to a royal flush, the other has two aces, and the board contains the other two aces, the other two cards to the royal, and any other card.  Example:  Player 1:   Player 2:   Board:       In most poker rooms, to qualify for a bad-beat jackpot, both winning and losing player must make use of both hole cards.  This was also the type of bad beat in the video; in fact, these were the exact cards. Case 2:  One player has two to a royal flush (T-K), the other has one ace and a "blank" card, and the board contains the other three aces and the other two cards to the royal.  Example:  Player 1:   Player 2:   Board:       Case 3:  One player has one to a royal flush (T-K) and a blank card, the other has two aces, and the board contains the other two aces and the other three cards to the royal flush. Example: Player 1:   Player 2:   Board:       The following table shows the number of combinations for each case for both players and the board.  The lower right cell shows the total number of combinations is 16,896.   Bad Beat Combinations    Case  Player 1  Player 2  Board  Product    1  24  3  44  3,168   2  24  132  1  3,168   3  704  3  1  2,112   Total     8,448    However, we could reverse the cards of the two players, and still have a bad beat.  So, we should multiply the number of combinations by 2.  Adjusting for that, the total qualifying combinations is 2 Ã 8,448 = 16,896. The total number of all combinations in two-player Texas Hold âEm is combin (52,2) Ã combin(50,2) Ã combin(48,5) =  2,781,381,002,400.  So, the probability of a four aces losing to a royal flush is 8,448/2,781,381,002,400 =  0.0000000060747, or about 1 in 165 million.  The probability of just a case 1 bad beat is 1 in 439 million.  The simple reason the odds are not as long as reported in that video is that the two hands overlap, with the shared ace.  In other words, the two events are positively correlated. It is my understanding that the "racinos" at Monticello and Yonkers, New York, are known as "Video Lottery Terminals."  I read that they are not true slot/video poker machines, because they do not use a random number generator, but are connected to a central computer in Albany, that controls the outcome of the game.  For example, in video poker if you are initially dealt a four of a kind and you discard them all, it will reappear as a winner, since the central computer was programmed for your machine to get a four of a kind.  Therefore, any strategy is useless.  Is this correct?  You are absolutely right, according to the paper Telling the Truth about New York Video Poker .  The playerâs outcome is indeed predestined.  Regardless of what cards the player keeps, he can not avoid his fate.  If the player tries to deliberately avoid his fate, the game will make use of a guardian angel feature to correct the player's mistake.  I completely agree with the author that such games should warn the player that they are not playing real video poker, and the pay table is a meaningless measure of the player's actual odds.  It also also be noted these kinds of fake video poker machines are not confined to New York.   Hello, I am a seventh grader from Hawaii.  I am doing a science fair project on poker and shuffling.  I am using your charts about the win percentage of pocket Texas Hold âEm hands, according to the number of players in the game.  I was hoping you could answer a few questions that would help me with my project:   How did you come up with the percentages found in the charts? If you used a computer program, how did you develop it and how long did it take? You stated that you started the Wizard of Odds as a hobby.  Did experimenting change as your site became more well-known? Why or why not?  Anonymous    The two-player table was done by a brute-force looping program, that cycled through all 1225 possible opponent cards, and 1,712,304 possible community cards.  For three to eight players, looping would have taken a prohibitive amount of time, so I did a random simulation. I write almost all my programs in C++, including both programs I just mentioned.  The rest are in Java or PERL.  I mostly copied and pasted code from other poker-based programs.  The new code only look about a day to write. Yes, I started my site as a hobby in June 1997.  It wasnât until January 2000 that I accepted advertising, and tried to make a business out of it.  It has gone through three different domains over the years.

Through the years, I have just been adding more games and material.  One experiment was providing my NFL picks for the 2005 season , which was an abject failure.    Hello, Wizard.  I read your Texas Hold âEm questions, and I noticed you calculated a 59.85% chance of seeing an ace or king on the board, while holding pocket Queens.  How did you come up with that figure?  Jacob from Atwater, CA   There are combin (50,5)=2,118,760 combinations of five cards out of the remaining 50 in the deck.  42 of those cards are 2-Q.  The number of combinations of 5 cards out of 42 is combin(42,5)=850,668.  So, the probability of not getting a king or ace is 850,668/2,118,760 = 40.15%.  Thus, the probability of getting at least one ace or king is 1-40.15% = 59.85%. An alternative calculation is 1 - pr(first card in flop is not ace or king) Ã  pr(second card in flop is not ace or king) Ã  pr(third card in flop is not ace or king) Ã  pr(fourth card in flop is not ace or king) Ã  pr(fifth card in flop is not ace or king) = 1 -  (42/50) Ã (41/49) Ã (40/48) Ã (39/47) Ã (38/46) = 59.85%.    Holding two suited cards in Texas Hold âem, what are my odds of getting exactly two more cards of the same suit on the flop?  Jack H. from Duncanville, TX   There are combin (11,2)=55 ways to get two more cards of the same suit, and 39 for the unsuited card.  There are combin(50,3)=19,600 total possible combinations of cards on the flop.  So, the probability of having exactly four to a flush after the flop is 55Ã39/19,600 = 10.94%.    I was involved in a hand of online poker and would like to know the odds of this happening, please:    David T. from Montego Bay  Normally I'm sick of bad beat questions, but this one was too painful to ignore.  Before the first card is dealt, the probability of four kings being beaten by four aces, in a two-player game, with both players having pocket pairs, is 2* combin (4,2)*combin(4,2)*44/(combin(52,2)*combin(50,2)*combin(48,5)) =  2*6*6*44/(1326*1225*1712304) = 1 in 877,961,175.  This was a six-player game, so there are combin(6,2) = 15 different player pairs.  In a six-player game, the probability is 15 times higher, or 1 in 58,530,745.  After the indicated hole cards are dealt, and before the flop, the probability is 1 in 38,916 that the hand will finish as it did.   There is a promotion being advertised by a Las Vegas card room: Make a flush in all four suits and you get $400.  You have to use both of your hole cards, and there is a five-hour time limit.  Assuming 35 hands per hour, and that the clock starts with the first flush, what is the probability of achieving the other three flushes within five hours? Thanks.  Annie   Letâs say your first flush is in spades.  At 35 hands per hour, in five hours 175 hands could be played.  You then have 175 hands to make a flush in hearts, diamonds, and clubs.  Iâm going to assume the player never folds a hand that has a possibility of attaining a flush in one of the suits he needs. The probability of a flush of a specific suit, letâs say hearts, using both hole cards is combin(13,2)Ã[combin(11,3)Ãcombin(39,2) + combin(11,4)Ã39 + combin(11,5)]/(combin(52,2)Ãcombin(50,5)) =  10576566/2809475760=0.003764605. In the next 175 hands the probability of missing a heart flush would be (1-0.003764605) 175 =0.51682599. It would be incorrect to say the probability of failing to make the other three suits would be pr(no heart flush)+pr(no dimaond suit) + pr(no club flush), because you would double counting the probability of faling to make two of them.  So you should add back in pr(no heart or diamond flush) + pr(no heart or club flush) +pr(no club or diamond flush).  However, that would incorrectly over-subtract the probability of not making all three flushes.  So you should add back in pr(no club, diamond, or heart flush). The probability of going 175 hands and never get either of two specific suits is (1-2Ã0.003764605) 175 =0.266442448. The probability of going 175 hands and never getting any of the three suits left is (1-3Ã0.003764605) 175 =0.137015266. So the answer is 1-3Ã0.51682599 + 3Ã0.266442448 - 0.137015266 = 0.111834108. I would like to thank dwheatley for his help with this problem.  It is discussed on my bulletin board at Wizard of Vegas .    Doyle Brunson famously won the Main Event in the World Series of Poker in both 1976 and 1977.  Each time he held 10-2 as hole cards, and both times he made a full house on the river.  What are the odds of that?  Jonathan F.   Given two cards of different ranks, the probability of making a full house are 1 in 121.6.  The odds of making it on the river are 1 in 207. The odds of making such a hand on the river two out of two times is 1 in 43,006. The odds of this happening with the same two starting cards, in rank only, are 1 in 3,564,161. The odds of this happening with exactly 10-2 both times is 1 in 295,379,826.

The term can be used in any form of gambling but is most commonly applied to poker. Many poker rooms offer a progressive jackpot for very unlikely bad beats. Various other rules are added to ensure that only surprising bad beats win. Below I present tables of bad beat probabilities, starting with the most liberal rules, and ending with the most stringent. The most stringent rules, the "Bad Beat Type 3", are the most common, in my experience.  Following are the rules for a type 1 bad beat.  Both the bad beat and winning hand must be the best possible combination of five cards. In cases where the same hand can be created multiple ways (for example player has AK and the board shows AAKKQ) the player's hole cards will take priority. Both the bad beat and winning hand must make use of both hole cards. A full house must be beaten by a four of a kind or higher.   The rules for a type 2 bad beat are the same as type 1, plus any four of a kind, whether the bad beat hand or winning hand, must contain a pocket pair.  The rules for a type 3 bad beat are the same as type 2, plus a full house may not make use of a three of a kind entirely on the board.  In my experience, is the most common format for bad beat rules is type 3. The additional rule for type 3 makes very little difference, compared to type 2.  The following table shows the probability of each bad beat hand under all three types of rules. The table is based on a ten-player game in which nobody ever folds. The probabilities are for any pair of players meeting the qualifying rules. If you want to know YOUR probability of winning, you should divide the probability in the table by 10.

Gambling led to the development of probability theory in the late 1400s. When playing a game with high stakes, players wanted to know what the chance of winning would be. In 1494, Fra Luca Paccioli released his work Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni e proportionalita which was the first written text on probability. Motivated by Paccioliâs work, Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) made further developments in probability theory. His work from 1550, titled Liber de Ludo Aleae , discussed the concepts of probability and how they directly related to gambling. However, his work did not receive any recognition because it was not published until after his death. Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) also contributed to probability theory. His friend, Chevalier de MÃ©rÃ©, was an avid gambler with the goal to become wealthy from it. De MÃ©rÃ© tried a new mathematical approach to a gambling game but did not get the desired results. Determined to know why his strategy was unsuccessful, he consulted with Pascal. Pascalâs work on this problem began an important correspondence between him and fellow mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Communicating through letters, the two continued to exchange their ideas and thoughts. These interactions led to the conception of basic probability theory. To this day, many gamblers still rely on the basic concepts of probability theory in order to make informed decisions while gambling. [1]  [2]  Frequency of 5-card poker hands [ edit ]     A Venn diagram depicting poker hands and their odds from a typical American 9/6 Jacks or Better machine    The following chart enumerates the (absolute) frequency of each hand, given all combinations of 5 cards randomly drawn from a full deck of 52 without replacement. Wild cards are not considered. In this chart:   Distinct hands is the number of different ways to draw the hand, not counting different suits.  Frequency is the number of ways to draw the hand, including the same card values in different suits.  The Probability of drawing a given hand is calculated by dividing the number of ways of drawing the hand ( Frequency ) by the total number of 5-card hands (the sample space ;             (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle \,{\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   ). For example, there are 4 different ways to draw a royal flush (one for each suit), so the probability is 4 / 2,598,960 , or one in 649,740. One would then expect to draw this hand about once in every 649,740 draws, that's nearly 0.000154% of the time.  Cumulative probability refers to the probability of drawing a hand as good as or better than the specified one. For example, the probability of drawing three of a kind is approximately 2.11%, while the probability of drawing a hand at least as good as three of a kind is about 2.87%. The cumulative probability is determined by adding one hand's probability with the probabilities of all hands above it.  The Odds are defined as the ratio of the number of ways not to draw the hand, to the number of ways to draw it. For instance, with a royal flush, there are 4 ways to draw one, and 2,598,956 ways to draw something else (2,598,960 - 4), so the odds against drawing a royal flush are 2,598,956Â : 4, or 649,739Â : 1. The formula for establishing the odds can also be stated as (1/p) - 1Â : 1 , where p is the aforementioned probability.  The values given for Probability , Cumulative probability , and Odds are rounded off for simplicity; the Distinct hands and Frequency values are exact.   The nCr function on most scientific calculators can be used to calculate hand frequencies; entering nCr with 52 and 5 , for example, yields            (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   as above.

It can be formed 4 ways (one for each suit), giving it a probability of 0.000154% and odds of 649,739Â : 1.  When ace-low straights and ace-low straight flushes are not counted, the probabilities of each are reduced: straights and straight flushes each become 9/10 as common as they otherwise would be. The 4 missed straight flushes become flushes and the 1,020 missed straights become no pair.  Note that since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. For example, the hand 3â£ 7â£ 8â£ Qâ  Aâ  is identical to 3â¦ 7â¦ 8â¦ Qâ¥ Aâ¥ because replacing all of the clubs in the first hand with diamonds and all of the spades with hearts produces the second hand. So eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values, there are only 134,459 distinct hands.  The number of distinct poker hands is even smaller. For example, 3â£ 7â£ 8â£ Qâ  Aâ  and 3â¦ 7â£ 8â¦ Qâ¥ Aâ¥ are not identical hands when just ignoring suit assignments because one hand has three suits, while the other hand has only twoâthat difference could affect the relative value of each hand when there are more cards to come. However, even though the hands are not identical from that perspective, they still form equivalent poker hands because each hand is an A-Q-8-7-3 high card hand. There are 7,462 distinct poker hands.  Frequency of 7-card poker hands [ edit ]  In some popular variations of poker, a player uses the best five-card poker hand out of seven cards. The frequencies are calculated in a manner similar to that shown for 5-card hands, except additional complications arise due to the extra two cards in the 7-card poker hand. The total number of distinct 7-card hands is            (    52  7    )     =  133  ,  784  ,  560        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 7}=133,784,560\end{matrix}}}   . It is notable that the probability of a no-pair hand is less than the probability of a one-pair or two-pair hand.  The Ace-high straight flush or royal flush is slightly more frequent (4324) than the lower straight flushes (4140 each) because the remaining two cards can have any value; a King-high straight flush, for example, cannot have the Ace of its suit in the hand (as that would make it ace-high instead).      Hand  Frequency  Probability  Cumulative  Odds    Royal flush  4,324  0.0032%  0.0032%  30,939Â : 1    Straight flush (excl. royal flush)  37,260  0.0279%  0.0311%  3,589.6Â : 1    Four of a kind  224,848  0.168%  0.199%  594Â : 1    Full house  3,473,184  2.60%  2.80%  37.5Â : 1    Flush  4,047,644  3.03%  5.82%  32.1Â : 1    Straight  6,180,020  4.62%  10.4%  20.6Â : 1    Three of a kind  6,461,620  4.83%  15.3%  19.7Â : 1    Two pair  31,433,400  23.5%  38.8%  3.26Â : 1    One pair  58,627,800  43.8%  82.6%  1.28Â : 1    No pair  23,294,460  17.4%  100%  4.74Â : 1    Total  133,784,560  100%  100%  0Â : 1      (The frequencies given are exact; the probabilities and odds are approximate.)  Since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. Eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values leaves 6,009,159 distinct 7-card hands.  The number of distinct 5-card poker hands that are possible from 7 cards is 4,824. Perhaps surprisingly, this is fewer than the number of 5-card poker hands from 5 cards because some 5-card hands are impossible with 7 cards (e.g. 7-high).  Frequency of 5-card lowball poker hands [ edit ]  See also: Lowball (poker)  Some variants of poker, called lowball , use a low hand to determine the winning hand. In most variants of lowball, the ace is counted as the lowest card and straights and flushes don't count against a low hand, so the lowest hand is the five-high hand A-2-3-4-5 , also called a wheel . The probability is calculated based on            (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   , the total number of 5-card combinations.

I was playing a NLHE tourney on pokerstars earlier tonight (UK) and I lost to quad queens after I had flopped quad jacks.  The flop came QJJ - I check and he checks behind - turn comes Q - he bets - I raise - he pushes - I snap call and the river comes Q - he turns over Q9  Either way it was a pretty damn bad beat.  I checked the odds out and got the following as indicated below.  Has anyone else on here ever lost to higher quads?  probability of first person being dealt a pair is (78/1326). Probability of 2nd person making a different pair is now (72/1225). After being dealt these pairs, the probability of dealing quads over quads by the river is (2/48)(1/47)(2/46)(1/45)(44/44)(120). The reason you multiply by 120 is because the since we're seeing it to the river, the order in which the cards doesn't matter. There are 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120 different ways of dealing those particular 5 cards.  So the probability of being dealt quads over quads in a pair vs pair situation is (78/1326)(72/1225)(2/48)(1/47)(2/46)(1/45)(44/44)(120) ~ 0.00003555%  Probability of getting dealt a non pair hand is (1248/1326). The probability of getting dealt a pp that doesn't match a card from the first hand is (66/1225). The probability of dealing quads over quads by the river is (2/48)(1/47)(3/46)(2/45)(1/44)(120) So the probability of being dealt quads over quads in a pair vs non pair situation is (1248)(1326)(66/1225)(2/48)(1/47)(3/46)(2/45)(1/44)(120) ~ 0.00003555% Same as pair vs pair. This should not come as a surprise since we're seeing all 7 cards.  So the probability of being dealt quads is 0.00003555 + 0.00003555 = 0.0000711% This translates to about 1,406,988.063 - 1 odds  Cheers             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                             Farrellwannabe    0    Grand master        Members    0   950 posts           Posted December 11, 2009 Â· Report post      ouch             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                             Farrellwannabe    0    Grand master        Members    0   950 posts           Posted December 11, 2009 Â· Report post      side bet 100000000000000000 that was on full tilt             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                             iatrest    0    Member        Members    0   210 posts           Posted December 11, 2009 Â· Report post      You aren't calculating the odds right. Once one person has quads the odds are 1:1. It is true preflop those are the odds, so those are the odds it will happen on any specific hand. Here is my own  bad beat story with the same odds.

Have learnt to play within my BR so those silly beats don't become too damaging.  I think that's clearly the key for long term success, no matter how big or small.

I made a straight flush in an omaha tourney with 45 of hearts vs quads and the idiot never raised one time - we both had about 150 big blinds. I am sure it was a bot based on previous play etc.... it was a 10 dollar buy in with about 1500 for 1st place - flop 3 6 7 hearts turn 7  river king - he never put a chip in the pot other than to call and yes I bet every street but with it being pot limit I could have made about 100k more versus a living breathing opponent...........................

Gambling led to the development of probability theory in the late 1400s. When playing a game with high stakes, players wanted to know what the chance of winning would be. In 1494, Fra Luca Paccioli released his work Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni e proportionalita which was the first written text on probability. Motivated by Paccioliâs work, Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) made further developments in probability theory. His work from 1550, titled Liber de Ludo Aleae , discussed the concepts of probability and how they directly related to gambling. However, his work did not receive any recognition because it was not published until after his death. Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) also contributed to probability theory. His friend, Chevalier de MÃ©rÃ©, was an avid gambler with the goal to become wealthy from it. De MÃ©rÃ© tried a new mathematical approach to a gambling game but did not get the desired results. Determined to know why his strategy was unsuccessful, he consulted with Pascal. Pascalâs work on this problem began an important correspondence between him and fellow mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Communicating through letters, the two continued to exchange their ideas and thoughts. These interactions led to the conception of basic probability theory. To this day, many gamblers still rely on the basic concepts of probability theory in order to make informed decisions while gambling. [1]  [2]  Frequency of 5-card poker hands [ edit ]     A Venn diagram depicting poker hands and their odds from a typical American 9/6 Jacks or Better machine    The following chart enumerates the (absolute) frequency of each hand, given all combinations of 5 cards randomly drawn from a full deck of 52 without replacement. Wild cards are not considered. In this chart:   Distinct hands is the number of different ways to draw the hand, not counting different suits.  Frequency is the number of ways to draw the hand, including the same card values in different suits.  The Probability of drawing a given hand is calculated by dividing the number of ways of drawing the hand ( Frequency ) by the total number of 5-card hands (the sample space ;             (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle \,{\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   ). For example, there are 4 different ways to draw a royal flush (one for each suit), so the probability is 4 / 2,598,960 , or one in 649,740. One would then expect to draw this hand about once in every 649,740 draws, that's nearly 0.000154% of the time.  Cumulative probability refers to the probability of drawing a hand as good as or better than the specified one. For example, the probability of drawing three of a kind is approximately 2.11%, while the probability of drawing a hand at least as good as three of a kind is about 2.87%. The cumulative probability is determined by adding one hand's probability with the probabilities of all hands above it.  The Odds are defined as the ratio of the number of ways not to draw the hand, to the number of ways to draw it. For instance, with a royal flush, there are 4 ways to draw one, and 2,598,956 ways to draw something else (2,598,960 - 4), so the odds against drawing a royal flush are 2,598,956Â : 4, or 649,739Â : 1. The formula for establishing the odds can also be stated as (1/p) - 1Â : 1 , where p is the aforementioned probability.  The values given for Probability , Cumulative probability , and Odds are rounded off for simplicity; the Distinct hands and Frequency values are exact.   The nCr function on most scientific calculators can be used to calculate hand frequencies; entering nCr with 52 and 5 , for example, yields            (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   as above.

It can be formed 4 ways (one for each suit), giving it a probability of 0.000154% and odds of 649,739Â : 1.  When ace-low straights and ace-low straight flushes are not counted, the probabilities of each are reduced: straights and straight flushes each become 9/10 as common as they otherwise would be. The 4 missed straight flushes become flushes and the 1,020 missed straights become no pair.  Note that since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. For example, the hand 3â£ 7â£ 8â£ Qâ  Aâ  is identical to 3â¦ 7â¦ 8â¦ Qâ¥ Aâ¥ because replacing all of the clubs in the first hand with diamonds and all of the spades with hearts produces the second hand. So eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values, there are only 134,459 distinct hands.  The number of distinct poker hands is even smaller. For example, 3â£ 7â£ 8â£ Qâ  Aâ  and 3â¦ 7â£ 8â¦ Qâ¥ Aâ¥ are not identical hands when just ignoring suit assignments because one hand has three suits, while the other hand has only twoâthat difference could affect the relative value of each hand when there are more cards to come. However, even though the hands are not identical from that perspective, they still form equivalent poker hands because each hand is an A-Q-8-7-3 high card hand. There are 7,462 distinct poker hands.  Frequency of 7-card poker hands [ edit ]  In some popular variations of poker, a player uses the best five-card poker hand out of seven cards. The frequencies are calculated in a manner similar to that shown for 5-card hands, except additional complications arise due to the extra two cards in the 7-card poker hand. The total number of distinct 7-card hands is            (    52  7    )     =  133  ,  784  ,  560        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 7}=133,784,560\end{matrix}}}   . It is notable that the probability of a no-pair hand is less than the probability of a one-pair or two-pair hand.  The Ace-high straight flush or royal flush is slightly more frequent (4324) than the lower straight flushes (4140 each) because the remaining two cards can have any value; a King-high straight flush, for example, cannot have the Ace of its suit in the hand (as that would make it ace-high instead).      Hand  Frequency  Probability  Cumulative  Odds    Royal flush  4,324  0.0032%  0.0032%  30,939Â : 1    Straight flush (excl. royal flush)  37,260  0.0279%  0.0311%  3,589.6Â : 1    Four of a kind  224,848  0.168%  0.199%  594Â : 1    Full house  3,473,184  2.60%  2.80%  37.5Â : 1    Flush  4,047,644  3.03%  5.82%  32.1Â : 1    Straight  6,180,020  4.62%  10.4%  20.6Â : 1    Three of a kind  6,461,620  4.83%  15.3%  19.7Â : 1    Two pair  31,433,400  23.5%  38.8%  3.26Â : 1    One pair  58,627,800  43.8%  82.6%  1.28Â : 1    No pair  23,294,460  17.4%  100%  4.74Â : 1    Total  133,784,560  100%  100%  0Â : 1      (The frequencies given are exact; the probabilities and odds are approximate.)  Since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. Eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values leaves 6,009,159 distinct 7-card hands.  The number of distinct 5-card poker hands that are possible from 7 cards is 4,824. Perhaps surprisingly, this is fewer than the number of 5-card poker hands from 5 cards because some 5-card hands are impossible with 7 cards (e.g. 7-high).  Frequency of 5-card lowball poker hands [ edit ]  See also: Lowball (poker)  Some variants of poker, called lowball , use a low hand to determine the winning hand. In most variants of lowball, the ace is counted as the lowest card and straights and flushes don't count against a low hand, so the lowest hand is the five-high hand A-2-3-4-5 , also called a wheel . The probability is calculated based on            (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   , the total number of 5-card combinations.

(50.7%)  If aces are not low, simply rotate the hand descriptions so that 6-high replaces 5-high for the best hand and ace-high replaces king-high as the worst hand.

Although you donât need to be a math genius to play poker, a solid understanding of probability will serve you well and knowing the odds is what itâs all about in poker. It has also been said that in poker, there are good bets and bad bets. The game just determines who can tell the difference. That statement relates to the importance of knowing and understanding the math of the game.  In this lesson weâre going to focus on drawing odds in poker and how to calculate your chances of hitting a winning hand. Weâll start with some basic math before showing you how to correctly calculate your odds. Donât worry about any complex math â we will show you how to crunch the numbers, but weâll also provide some simple and easy shortcuts that you can commit to memory.  Basic Math â Odds and Percentages  Odds can be expressed both âforâ and âagainstâ. Letâs use a poker example to illustrate. The odds against hitting a flush when you hold four suited cards with one card to come is expressed as approximately 4-to-1. This is a ratio, not a fraction. It doesnât mean âa quarterâ. To figure the odds for this event simply add 4 and 1 together, which makes 5. So in this example you would expect to hit your flush 1 out of every 5 times. In percentage terms this would be expressed as 20% (100 / 5).  Here are some examples:   2-to-1 against = 1 out of every 3 times = 33.3%  3-to-1 against = 1 out of every 4 times = 25%  4-to-1 against = 1 out of every 5 times= 20%  5-to-1 against = 1 out of every 6 times = 16.6%   Converting odds into a percentage:   3-to-1 odds: 3 + 1 = 4. Then 100 / 4 = 25%  4-to-1 odds: 4 + 1 = 5. Then 100 / 5 = 20%   Converting a percentage into odds:   25%: 100 / 25 = 4. Then 4 â 1 = 3, giving 3-to-1 odds.  20%: 100 / 20 = 5. Then 5 â 1 = 4, giving 4-to-1 odds.   Another method of converting percentage into odds is to divide the percentage chance when you donât hit by the percentage when you do hit. For example, with a 20% chance of hitting (such as in a flush draw) we would do the following; 80% / 20% = 4, thus 4-to-1. Here are some other examples:   25% chance = 75 / 25 = 3 (thus, 3-to-1 odds).  30% chance = 70 / 30 = 2.33 (thus, 2.33-to-1 odds).   Some people are more comfortable working with percentages rather than odds, and vice versa. Whatâs most important is that you fully understand how odds work, because now weâre going to apply this knowledge of odds to the game of poker.  Counting Your Outs  Before you can begin to calculate your poker odds you need to know your âoutsâ. An out is a card which will make your hand. For example, if you are on a flush draw with four hearts in your hand, then there will be nine hearts (outs) remaining in the deck to give you a flush. Remember there are thirteen cards in a suit, so this is easily worked out; 13 â 4 = 9.  Another example would be if you hold a hand like and hit two pair on the flop of . You might already have the best hand, but thereâs room for improvement and you have four ways of making a full house. Any of the following cards will help improve your hand to a full house; .  The following table provides a short list of some common outs for post-flop play. I recommend you commit these outs to memory:  Table #1 â Outs to Improve Your Hand   The next table provides a list of even more types of draws and give examples, including the specific outs needed to make your hand. Take a moment to study these examples:  Table #2 â Examples of Drawing Hands (click to enlarge)   Counting outs is a fairly straightforward process. You simply count the number of unknown cards that will improve your hand, right? Waitâ¦ there are one or two things you need to consider:  Donât Count Outs Twice  There are 15 outs when you have both a straight and flush draw. You might be wondering why itâs 15 outs and not 17 outs, since there are 8 outs to make a straight and 9 outs for a flush (and 8 + 9 = 17). The reason is simpleâ¦ in our example from table #2 the and the will make a flush and also complete a straight. These outs cannot be counted twice, so our total outs for this type of draw is 15 and not 17.  Anti-Outs and Blockers  There are outs that will improve your hand but wonât help you win. For example, suppose you hold on a flop of . Youâre drawing to a straight and any two or any seven will help you make it. However, the flop also contains two hearts, so if you hit the or the you will have a straight, but could be losing to a flush. So from 8 possible outs you really only have 6 good outs.  Itâs generally better to err on the side of caution when assessing your possible outs. Donât fall into the trap of assuming that all your outs will help you. Some wonât, and they should be discounted from the equation. There are good outs, no-so good outs, and anti-outs. Keep this in mind.  Calculating Your Poker Odds  Once you know how many outs youâve got (remember to only include âgood outsâ), itâs time to calculate your odds. There are many ways to figure the actual odds of hitting these outs, and weâll explain three methods. This first one does not require math, just use the handy chart below:  Table #3 â Poker Odds Chart   As you can see in the above table, if youâre holding a flush draw after the flop (9 outs) you have a 19.1% chance of hitting it on the turn or expressed in odds, youâre 4.22-to-1 against. The odds are slightly better from the turn to the river, and much better when you have both cards still to come. Indeed, with both the turn and river you have a 35% chance of making your flush, or 1.86-to-1.  We have created a printable version of the poker drawing odds chart whichÂ will load as a PDF documentÂ Â (in a new window).Â Youâll need to have Adobe Acrobat on your computer to be able to view the PDF,Â but this isÂ installed onÂ most computers by default.Â We recommend you print the chart andÂ use it as a source of reference. It should come in very handy.  Doing the Math â Crunching Numbers  There are a couple of ways to do the math. One is complete and totally accurate and the other, a short cut which is close enough.  Letâs again use a flush draw as an example. The odds against hitting your flush from the flop to the river is 1.86-to-1. How do we get to this number? Letâs take a lookâ¦  With 9 hearts remaining there would be 36 combinations of getting 2 hearts and making your flush with 5 hearts. This is calculated as follows:  (9 x 8 / 2 x 1) = (72 / 2) â 36.  This is the probability of 2 running hearts when you only need 1 but this has to be figured. Of the 47 unknown remaining cards, 38 of them can combine with any of the 9 remaining hearts:  9 x 38 â 342.  Now we know there are 342 combinations of any non heart/heart combination. So we then add the two combinations that can make you your flush:  36 + 342 â 380.  The total number of turn and river combos is 1081 which is calculated as follows:  (47 x 46 / 2 x 1) = (2162 / 2) â 1081.  Now you take the 380 possible ways to make it and divide by the 1081 total possible outcomes:  380 / 1081 = 35.18518%  This number can be rounded to .352 or just .35 in decimal terms. You divide .35 into its reciprocal of .65:  0.65 / 0.35 = 1.8571428  And voila, this is how we reach 1.86. If that made you dizzy, here is the short hand method because you do not need to know it to 7 decimal points.  The Rule of Four and Two  A much easier way of calculating poker odds is the 4 and 2 method, which states you multiply your outs by 4 when you have both the turn and river to come â and with one card to go (i.e. turn to river) you would multiply your outs by 2 instead of 4.  Imagine a player goes all-in and by calling youâre guaranteed to see both the turn and river cards. If you have nine outs then itâs just a case of 9 x 4 = 36. It doesnât match the exact odds given in the chart, but itâs accurate enough.  What about with just one card to come? Well, itâs even easier. Using our flush example, nine outs would equal 18% (9 x 2). For a straight draw, simply count the outs and multiply by two, so thatâs 16% (8 x 2) â which is almost 17%. Again, itâs close enough and easy to do â you really donât have to be a math genius.  Conclusion  In this lesson weâve covered a lot of ground. We havenât mentioned the topic of pot odds yet â which is when we calculate whether or not itâs correct to call a bet based on the odds. This lesson was step one of the process, and in our pot odds lesson weâll give some examples of how the knowledge of poker odds is applied to making crucial decisions at the poker table.  As for calculating your oddsâ¦. have faith in the tables, they are accurate and the math is correct. Memorize some of the common draws, such as knowing that a flush draw is 4-to-1 against or 20%. The reason this is easier is that it requires less work when calculating the pot odds, which weâll get to in the next lesson.

List of poker hands   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Jump to: navigation , search      An ace-high straight flush, commonly known as a royal flush , is the best possible hand in many variants of poker.    In poker , players construct sets of five playing cards , called hands , according to the rules of the game being played. [1] Each hand has a rank , which is compared against the ranks of other hands participating in the showdown to determine who wins the pot . [2] In high games, like Texas hold 'em and seven-card stud , the highest-ranking hands win. In low games, like razz , the lowest-ranking hands win. In high-low split games, both the highest-ranking and lowest-ranking hands win, though different rules are used to rank the high and low hands. [3] [4]  Each hand falls into a hand-ranking category determined by the patterns formed by its cards. Hands in a higher-ranking category always rank higher than hands in a lower-ranking category. Hands in the same category are ranked relative to each other by comparing the ranks of their respective cards. [5] Suits are not ranked in poker, so hands in the same category that differ by suit alone are of equal rank. [6] Cards in poker are ranked, from highest to lowest: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2. [7] However, aces have the lowest rank under high rules when forming part of a five-high straight or straight flush, or when playing ace-to-five low or ace-to-six low rules. [8] [9]  There are nine hand-ranking categories when using a standard 52-card deck , except under ace-to-five low rules where straights, flushes and straight flushes are not recognized. An additional category, five of a kind, is introduced when using one or more wild cards . The fewer hands a category contains, the higher its rank. [10] There are 311,875,200 ways to deal five cards from the deck but only 2,598,960 distinct hands, because the order in which cards are dealt or arranged in a hand does not matter. [11] Moreover, since hands differing only by suit are of equal rank, there are only 7,462 distinct hand ranks when using nine hand categories. [12] [13]     Contents    1  Hand-ranking categories   1.1  Five of a kind  1.2  Straight flush  1.3  Four of a kind  1.4  Full house  1.5  Flush  1.6  Straight  1.7  Three of a kind  1.8  Two pair  1.9  One pair  1.10  High card    2  See also  3  References  4  External links     Hand-ranking categories [ edit ]    *  Only possible when using one or more wild cards    **  Category does not exist under ace-to-five low rules      Rank  Name  Example    0  Five of a kind *     1  Straight flush **     2  Four of a kind     3  Full house     4  Flush **     5  Straight **     6  Three of a kind     7  Two pair     8  One pair     9  High card     Five of a kind [ edit ]      Five of a kind, aces    Five of a kind is a poker hand containing five cards of the same rank, such as 3 â¥  3 â¦  3 â£  3 â   3 ("five of a kind, threes"). It ranks above a straight flush but is only possible when using one or more wild cards, as there are only four cards of each rank in a standard 52-card deck. [8] A five of a kind becomes possible when a joker is added to the deck as a bug , a form of wild card that may either act as a fifth ace or be used to complete any straight, flush or straight flush. Under these rules, the only possible five of a kind is five aces, A â¥  A â¦  A â£  A â   Jkr . [7] Other wild card rules allow jokers or other designated wild cards to represent any card in the deck, enabling the formation of five of a kind of any rank. [ citation needed ]  Each five of a kind is ranked by the rank of its quintuplet. For example, Q â   Q â¥  Q â£  Q â¦  Q ranks higher than 6 â£  6 â   6 â¦  6 â¥  6 . [8] [14]   Straight flush [ edit ]   "Straight flush" redirects here. For other uses, see Straight flush (disambiguation) .     A jack-high straight flush    A straight flush is a poker hand containing five cards of sequential rank, all of the same suit, such as Q â¥  J â¥  10 â¥  9 â¥  8 â¥ (a "queen-high straight flush"). [4] It ranks below five of a kind and above four of a kind. [7] As part of a straight flush, an ace can rank either above a king or below a two, depending on the rules of the game. Under high rules, an ace can rank either high (e.g. A â¥  K â¥  Q â¥  J â¥  10 â¥ is an ace-high straight flush) or low (e.g. 5 â¦  4 â¦  3 â¦  2 â¦  A â¦ is a five-high straight flush), but cannot rank both high and low in the same hand (e.g. Q â£  K â£  A â£  2 â£  3 â£ is an ace-high flush, not a straight flush). [8] [14] Under deuce-to-seven low rules, aces can only rank high, so a hand such as 5 â   4 â   3 â   2 â   A â  is actually an ace-high flush. Under ace-to-six low rules, aces can only rank low, so a hand such as A â¥  K â¥  Q â¥  J â¥  10 â¥ is actually a king-high flush. [15] Under ace-to-five low rules, straight flushes are not recognized, and a hand that would be categorized as a straight flush is instead a high card hand. [9]  There are 40 possible straight flush hands and 10 distinct ranks of straight flush under high rules when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each straight flush is ranked by the rank of its highest-ranking card. For example, 10 â£  9 â£  8 â£  7 â£  6 â£ ranks higher than 8 â¥  7 â¥  6 â¥  5 â¥  4 â¥ , which ranks higher than 6 â   5 â   4 â   3 â   2 â  . Straight flush hands that differ by suit alone, such as 7 â¦  6 â¦  5 â¦  4 â¦  3 â¦ and 7 â   6 â   5 â   4 â   3 â  , are of equal rank. [8] [14]  An ace-high straight flush, such as A â¦  K â¦  Q â¦  J â¦  10 â¦ , is commonly known as a royal flush or royal straight flush and is the best possible hand in high games when not using wild cards. [7] [16] [17] A five-high straight flush, such as 5 â¥  4 â¥  3 â¥  2 â¥  A â¥ , is called a steel wheel and is significant in ace-to-five high-low split games for being both the best low hand and usually the best high hand of the showdown. [4]   Four of a kind [ edit ]      Four of a kind, fives    Four of a kind , also known as quads , is a poker hand containing four cards of the same rank and one card of another rank (the kicker ), such as 9 â£  9 â   9 â¦  9 â¥  J â¥ ("four of a kind, nines"). It ranks below a straight flush and above a full house. [7]  There are 624 possible four of a kind hands and 156 distinct ranks of four of a kind when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each four of a kind is ranked first by the rank of its quadruplet, and then by the rank of its kicker. For example, K â   K â¥  K â£  K â¦  3 â¥ ranks higher than 7 â¥  7 â¦  7 â   7 â£  Q â¥ , which ranks higher than 7 â¥  7 â¦  7 â   7 â£  10 â  . Four of a kind hands that differ by suit alone, such as 4 â£  4 â   4 â¦  4 â¥  9 â£ and 4 â£  4 â   4 â¦  4 â¥  9 â¦ , are of equal rank. [8] [14]   Full house [ edit ]      A full house, sixes over kings    A full house , also known as a full boat (and originally called a full hand ), is a poker hand containing three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as 3 â£  3 â   3 â¦  6 â£  6 â¥ (a "full house, threes over sixes" or "threes full of sixes" or "threes full"). [18] [19] It ranks below four of a kind and above a flush. [7]  There are 3,744 possible full house hands and 156 distinct ranks of full house when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each full house is ranked first by the rank of its triplet, and then by the rank of its pair. For example, 8 â   8 â¦  8 â¥  7 â¦  7 â£ ranks higher than 4 â¦  4 â   4 â£  9 â¦  9 â£ , which ranks higher than 4 â¦  4 â   4 â£  5 â£  5 â¦ . Full house hands that differ by suit alone, such as K â£  K â   K â¦  J â£  J â  and K â£  K â¥  K â¦  J â£  J â¥ , are of equal rank. [8] [14]   Flush [ edit ]      A jack-high flush    A flush is a poker hand containing five cards all of the same suit, not all of sequential rank, such as K â£  10 â£  7 â£  6 â£  4 â£ (a "king-high flush" or "king-ten-high flush"). [20] It ranks below a full house and above a straight. [7] Under ace-to-five low rules, flushes are not recognized, and a hand that would be categorized as a flush is instead a high card hand. [9]  There are 5,108 possible flush hands and 1,277 distinct ranks of flush under high rules when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each flush is ranked first by the rank of its highest-ranking card, then by the rank of its second highest-ranking card, then by the rank of its third highest-ranking card, then by the rank of its fourth highest-ranking card, and finally by the rank of its lowest-ranking card. For example, K â¦  J â¦  9 â¦  6 â¦  4 â¦ ranks higher than Q â£  J â£  7 â£  6 â£  5 â£ , which ranks higher than J â¥  10 â¥  9 â¥  4 â¥  2 â¥ , which ranks higher than J â   10 â   8 â   6 â   3 â  , which ranks higher than J â¥  10 â¥  8 â¥  4 â¥  3 â¥ , which ranks higher than J â£  10 â£  8 â£  4 â£  2 â£ . Flush hands that differ by suit alone, such as 10 â¦  8 â¦  7 â¦  6 â¦  5 â¦ and 10 â   8 â   7 â   6 â   5 â  , are of equal rank. [8] [14]   Straight [ edit ]      A ten-high straight    A straight is a poker hand containing five cards of sequential rank, not all of the same suit, such as 7 â£  6 â   5 â   4 â¥  3 â¥ (a "seven-high straight"). It ranks below a flush and above three of a kind. [7] As part of a straight, an ace can rank either above a king or below a two, depending on the rules of the game. Under high rules, an ace can rank either high (e.g. A â¦  K â£  Q â£  J â¦  10 â  is an ace-high straight) or low (e.g. 5 â£  4 â¦  3 â¥  2 â¥  A â  is a five-high straight), but the ace cannot rank both high and low in the same hand (e.g. Q â   K â   A â£  2 â¥  3 â¦ is an ace-high high-card hand, not a straight). [8] [14] Under deuce-to-seven low rules, aces can only rank high, so a hand such as 5 â¥  4 â   3 â¥  2 â£  A â¦ is actually an ace-high high-card hand. Under ace-to-six low rules, aces can only rank low, so a hand such as A â£  K â   Q â   J â¦  10 â  is actually a king-high high-card hand. [15] Under ace-to-five low rules, straights are not recognized, and a hand that would be categorized as a straight is instead a high-card hand. [9]  There are 10,200 possible straight hands and 10 distinct ranks of straight under high rules when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each straight is ranked by the rank of its highest-ranking card. For example, J â¥  10 â¥  9 â£  8 â   7 â¥ ranks higher than 10 â   9 â   8 â£  7 â¥  6 â  , which ranks higher than 6 â£  5 â   4 â¥  3 â   2 â¦ . Straight hands that differ by suit alone, such as 9 â£  8 â£  7 â£  6 â¦  5 â¦ and 9 â   8 â   7 â   6 â¥  5 â¥ , are of equal rank. [8] [14]  An ace-high straight, such as A â£  K â£  Q â¦  J â   10 â  , is otherwise known as a broadway straight , [21] while a five-high straight, such as 5 â   4 â¦  3 â¦  2 â   A â¥ , is otherwise known as a baby straight , [22]  bicycle or wheel and is the best possible hand in ace-to-five low games, where it is instead categorized as a high card hand. [23] [24]   Three of a kind [ edit ]      Three of a kind, queens    Three of a kind , also known as trips or a set , is a poker hand containing three cards of the same rank and two cards of two other ranks (the kickers), such as 2 â¦  2 â   2 â£  K â   6 â¥ ("three of a kind, twos" or "trip twos" or a "set of twos"). It ranks below a straight and above two pair. [7]  There are 54,912 possible three of a kind hands and 858 distinct ranks of three of a kind when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each three of a kind is ranked first by the rank of its triplet, then by the rank of its highest-ranking kicker, and finally by the rank of its lowest-ranking kicker. For example, 6 â¥  6 â¦  6 â   Q â£  4 â  ranks higher than 3 â¦  3 â   3 â£  K â   2 â  , which ranks higher than 3 â¦  3 â   3 â£  J â£  7 â¥ , which ranks higher than 3 â¦  3 â   3 â£  J â   5 â¦ . Three of a kind hands that differ by suit alone, such as 9 â   9 â¥  9 â¦  10 â¦  8 â¥ and 9 â£  9 â   9 â¥  10 â¦  8 â¦ , are of equal rank. [8] [14]  In community card games, such as Texas hold 'em, three of a kind is called a set only when it comprises a pocket pair and a third card on the board . [25]   Two pair [ edit ]      Two pair, jacks and threes    Two pair is a poker hand containing two cards of the same rank, two cards of another rank and one card of a third rank (the kicker), such as J â¥  J â£  4 â£  4 â   9 â¥ ("two pair, jacks and fours" or "two pair, jacks over fours" or "jacks up"). [18] [26] It ranks below three of a kind and above one pair. [7]  There are 123,552 possible two pair hands and 858 distinct ranks of two pair when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each two pair is ranked first by the rank of its highest-ranking pair, then by the rank of its lowest-ranking pair, and finally by the rank of its kicker. For example, 10 â¦  10 â   2 â   2 â£  K â£ ranks higher than 5 â£  5 â   4 â¦  4 â¥  10 â¥ , which ranks higher than 5 â£  5 â   3 â£  3 â¦  Q â  , which ranks higher than 5 â£  5 â   3 â£  3 â¦  J â  . Two pair hands that differ by suit alone, such as K â¦  K â   7 â¦  7 â¥  8 â¥ and K â£  K â   7 â£  7 â¥  8 â£ , are of equal rank. [8] [14]   One pair [ edit ]      One pair, tens    One pair , or simply a pair , is a poker hand containing two cards of the same rank and three cards of three other ranks (the kickers), such as 4 â¥  4 â   K â   10 â¦  5 â  ("one pair, fours" or a "pair of fours"). It ranks below two pair and above high card. [7]  There are 1,098,240 possible one pair hands and 2,860 distinct ranks of one pair when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each one pair is ranked first by the rank of its pair, then by the rank of its highest-ranking kicker, then by the rank of its second highest-ranking kicker, and finally by the rank of its lowest-ranking kicker. For example, 9 â£  9 â¦  Q â   J â¥  5 â¥ ranks higher than 6 â¦  6 â¥  K â   7 â¥  4 â£ , which ranks higher than 6 â¦  6 â¥  Q â¥  J â   2 â£ , which ranks higher than 6 â¦  6 â¥  Q â   8 â£  7 â¦ , which ranks higher than 6 â¦  6 â¥  Q â¦  8 â¥  3 â  . One pair hands that differ by suit alone, such as 8 â   8 â¦  10 â¥  6 â£  5 â  and 8 â¥  8 â£  10 â£  6 â   5 â£ , are of equal rank. [8] [14]   High card [ edit ]      High card, king    High card , also known as no pair or simply nothing , is a poker hand containing five cards not all of sequential rank or of the same suit, and none of which are of the same rank, such as K â¥  J â¥  8 â£  7 â¦  4 â  ("high card, king" or "king-jack-high" or "king-high"). [18] [27] Under ace-to-five low rules, where straights, flushes and straight flushes are not recognized, hands that would fall into these categories are also high card hands. [9] It ranks below one pair. [7]  There are 1,302,540 possible high cards hands and 1,277 distinct ranks of high card hand under high rules when using a standard 52-card deck. [12] Each high card hand is ranked first by the rank of its highest-ranking card, then by the rank of its second highest-ranking card, then by the rank of its third highest-ranking card, then by the rank of its fourth highest-ranking card, and finally by the rank of its lowest-ranking card. For example, K â   6 â£  5 â¥  3 â¦  2 â£ ranks higher than Q â   J â¦  6 â£  5 â¥  3 â£ , which ranks higher than Q â   10 â¦  8 â£  7 â¦  4 â  , which ranks higher than Q â¥  10 â¥  7 â£  6 â¥  4 â  , which ranks higher than Q â£  10 â£  7 â¦  5 â£  4 â¦ , which ranks higher than Q â¥  10 â¦  7 â   5 â   2 â¥ . High card hands that differ by suit alone, such as 10 â£  8 â   7 â   6 â¥  4 â¦ and 10 â¦  8 â¦  7 â   6 â£  4 â£ , are of equal rank. [8] [14]  Under deuce-to-seven low rules, a seven-five-high hand, such as 7 â   5 â£  4 â¦  3 â¦  2 â£ , is the best possible hand. [28] Under ace-to-six low rules, where aces have the lowest rank, a six-four-high hand, such as 6 â£  4 â   3 â¥  2 â¥  A â¦ , is the best possible hand. [29] Under ace-to-five low rules, where aces have the lowest rank and straights, flushes and straights are not recognized, a five-high hand, such as 5 â£  4 â   3 â¥  2 â¥  A â¦ or 5 â   4 â   3 â   2 â   A â  , commonly known as a bicycle or wheel , is the best possible hand.

(July 2008)  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     In poker , bad beat is a subjective term for a hand in which a player with what appear to be strong cards nevertheless loses. It most often occurs where one player bets the clearly stronger hand and their opponent makes a poor call that eventually "sucks out" and wins. There is no consensus among poker players as to what exactly constitutes a bad beat and often players will disagree about whether a particular hand was a bad beat. A few examples are: quads over full house, quads over quads, straight flush over quads, small full house vs. bigger full house or better.     Contents    1  Types of bad beats  2  Reacting to bad beats  3  Bad beats online  4  Bad beat jackpot  5  See also  6  Notes  7  Books     Types of bad beats [ edit ]  Any hand that looked like a favorite to win can end up losing as more cards are dealt (with the nuts being the exception), but bad beats usually involve one of two not mutually exclusive scenarios:   The player who wins on a bad beat is rewarded for mathematically unsound play. Calling a bet despite having neither the best hand nor the right pot odds or implied odds to call, then winning anyway, is characteristic of this type of bad beat. It can also involve the inferior hand catching running cards when it requires two cards in a row to come from behind to win the pot. For example, catching cards on both the turn and the river in Texas hold 'em that complete a straight or flush.  A very strong hand loses to an even stronger one, better known as "cooler". This type of beat occurs with some frequency in movies. In the films The Cincinnati Kid and Casino Royale , The Kid and Le Chiffre each lose with a full house to a straight flush. In this situation, it is possible that both players have played their cards well, and avoiding the bad beat could not have been achieved without committing a mistake.   Reacting to bad beats [ edit ]  A bad beat can be a profound psychological blow, and can easily lead to a player going on tilt . Professional player Phil Hellmuth , among others, is notorious for his pronounced reactions to bad beats. However, suffering a bad beat means that the losing player was "getting the money in good" and in most instances would win by playing the same hand the same way. Thus, the more stoic poker players accept bad beats as an unpleasant but necessary drawback to a tactic that works the vast majority of the time.  Bad beats online [ edit ]  In online poker rooms, bad beats often lead to accusations that the random number generator is "rigged", even though such beats also occur in offline games. Many online poker rooms post statistical data to demonstrate the randomness of the hands generated. [1] In online poker games players have an opportunity to play in "bad beat" tables where the player who has the best losing hand receives an accumulated prize pool. An additional amount of rake is taken from each hand to fund the jackpot. The largest online jackpot to date was â¬1.25 million, hit in July 2011 with â¬443,000 going to the loser of the hand. [2]  Players are statistically more likely to experience bad beats online, since playing using a computer allows for more hands played per hour. Also, online players may play multiple cash game tables and/or tournaments at the same time, also increasing the frequency of hands dealt. Also, tells are rendered moot, so players are incapable of reading clues such as body language in aid of deriving the strength of an opponent's hand. Finally, online poker games (especially freeroll tournaments)are far more accessible to the average player who, being average, is less likely to be knowledgeable regarding the techniques of the game, in turn making it more likely they will bet from the gut or intuition rather than experience.  Bad beat jackpot [ edit ]  A bad beat jackpot is a prize that is paid when a sufficiently strong hand is shown down and loses to an even stronger hand held by another player. [3] Not all poker games offer bad beat jackpots, and those that do have specific requirements for how strong a losing hand must be to qualify for the jackpot. For example, the losing hand may be required to be four-of-a-kind or better. There may be additional requirements as well. For example, in Texas hold 'em there is usually a requirement that both hole cards play in both the losing and winning hands, or that where a full house is the minimum (usually aces full of jacks or higher), both hole cards must be used to make the three-of-a-kind in the full house.  Bad beat jackpots are usually progressive , often with a small rake being taken out of each pot to fund the jackpot (in addition to the regular rake). When a jackpot is won, it is usually split among all players sitting at the table at the time of the bad beat with the losing hand getting the largest share, followed by the winning hand, and all the other players dividing the remainder. Generally, only the best losing hand is eligible to win the largest share, even if another hand would also qualify.  Specific rules, collections, payout percentages, and amounts vary greatly from one casino or cardroom to the next, and are sometimes changed.

Hi everyone,   I'm looking for the specific odds of making quads with a pocket pair by the river. If you ran out all the community cards.  Also, odds of making quads on the flop. Thank you.                                      #2     12th May 2016, 7:17 AM             Shaetano [84]         Online Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: Holdem              Hey, here you go  Draw Probabilities for obtaining quads with pocket pair hole cards Complete on Flop: 0.245% Complete on Turn: 2.128% Complete on River: 2.174%                                   #3     12th May 2016, 7:26 AM              Aaron Soto [250]         Poker at: Bovada  Game: NL HOLDEM              Okay, so basically, your saying its about 1 in 50 I make quads by the turn? With a pocket pair? That can't be right.....I need the 1/10 type not percents. 0.245% on flop equates to about what? 1 in 400 which actually, seems correct. I can't see that by adding one more card (the turn) it becomes 1 in 50 no way.....                                   #4     12th May 2016, 9:24 AM           Excomm [30]         Online Poker at: BOL / ACR  Game: NLHE              It may be surprising, but that is the probability of drawing to 1 out on the turn (46:1) and the river (45:1).  It is the same probability of completing a straight flush draw as well.  The probabilities that Shaetano posted above are correct.  Think of it this way.  To make quads...  On the flop you are trying to draw 2 cards out of 50 and then 1 card out of 49 OR 2 cards out of 50 and then 1 card out of 48 OR 2 cards out of 49 and then 1 card out of 48.  On the Turn you are trying to draw just 1 card out of 47 (not that hard).  On the River you are trying to draw 1 card out of 46 (only a little worse than trying to get a powerball match  )                                   #5     12th May 2016, 9:46 AM              TimovieMan [2,264]         Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: Texas Holdem                   Originally Posted by Aaron Soto   I need the 1/10 type not percents.

Incorrect.  I hope my wording will be clear.  You subtract 1 from the 408.1633 to get the accurate number. It happens once in 408 hands, so the odds of it happening are 407:1.  Odds of 25% are 3:1, not 4:1 (as that would be 20%). It'll happen 25% of the time, or once in 4, but the odds are 3:1.   So it's ((100 / odds %) - 1 ) : 1.                                   #9     12th May 2016, 4:31 PM              SuzdalDEcor [511]                          Originally Posted by TimovieMan   Because converting is hard?

And the River probability is also misleading.        Fair enough.  It's true that the odds of making quads only improve significantly if you flop a set.  These are the odds of getting quads (when dealt a pocket pair) (or a straight flush with two suited and connected cards) WITHOUT assuming that you flopped a set.  *edit* Note that the odds for the turn include quads made on the flop, and the odds for the river include quads made on the flop and the turn.  Later today if I have time I'll figure out the odds of making these hands EXACTLY on the turn and river.  on Flop:  0.145 (407.33:1) by Turn:  0.490 (203.17:1) by River: 0.816 (121.50:1)  My bad for misinterpreting the original question.                                   #14     13th May 2016, 10:01 PM              Dutchtegon [155]         Online Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: holdem              Its nice to know such little facts, but I guess you are not going to play for those kind of things.

I just saw quad fours on the flop busted by a straight flush on the river. it was free roll on sports betting but painful to see lol                                  #17     27th December 2017, 10:23 AM             Mikeisanace777 [84]                     All the other answers are based on false Data mostly..       These odds are based on similar video poker data not real live poker ,or even online .The reason for this is sometimes,or a lot of times you have 0% whereas video poker it's always the same there are no hole cards and no burn cards which influence the unknown variables of quads and all hands in holdem poker by a lot!! Sometimes to hit the quads the card you need is burned,or usually folded or in play therefore it's not predictable at all. Same goes for a set it may be 1/8 chance to flop it or sometimes based on a 9 ring game and 3 burn cards could be 0% it's always fluctuates and this goes for flush draws,and all draws. In fact if you knew the remaining 31 cards in the deck vs other players hands you would always know what to do right? Say you got A/7 of spades in a limit game and you knew your up against KA off AQ off and jj but you somehow magically could see the remaining 31 cards and the burns then you would continue even after the flop. For instance say the flop came 9-A-8 with 2 spades vs the previous match ups I described in a good size pot,but you knew the remaining cards contained 3 sevens-2 aces and 2 eights, and to go with that the full match up of spades in the deck vs AK this is a huge beni factor for you as you got many cards to fill up,chop and 9 outs to flush out in your spade draw. Of course you never actually know this this is why Holdem poker is an incomplete data game there is no good cards in holdem especially limit holdem. As I said before you never know what could occur! Say you have kk vs 10-j and 67 with the remaining cards to be seen as 89-9 a load of 7's 10's and 2 fives all within that spectrum of the top of the deck,what makes matters worse even in the 31 random deck scenario vs these types of hands sometimes your kings aren't even in there and no running pairs to give you a counterfeit 2 pair either so your essentially dead in the water vs probable 2 pair flops like 8-10-4 -Q-5-10 etc.. It doesn't mean your one pair won't be gold it just means your hoping to hold up with no chance of improving. So to hit Quads on a flopped set of 99 all the stars have to line up right just the even have the true odds to make it in that scenario. Iv'e seen your previous posts and you enjoy 3/6 limit and play a lot you check on my post on advanced 3/6 theory gl man.

Combinations for 5 cards on the board (5! = 1*2*3*4*5) = 120 And there are 4 cases (above)  So we have (1/50 * 1/49*1/48 )* 120 * 4 = 0.4% = 1/245  Meaning 1 out of 245 hand  will hit straight flush ?                                      #2     31st August 2009, 1:11 PM             cha4zz [80]         Poker at: Tilt  Game: NLH              Not that, because some of the time, opponents will hold the 7,8,9 of diamonds as well, meaning that it is impossible for you to hit your straight flush.  I don't know how to work it out, but I know that it is higher than 1 in 245 for a straight flush.                                   #3     31st August 2009, 1:19 PM           mimi [119]         Online Poker at: FullTilt  Game: NLHE              How did you come up with this equation?  I don't understand how it is less likely for a 9 or 8 to come up than a 7 since each deck should have the same number of cards in each suit?                                   #4     31st August 2009, 1:28 PM           chris_the_terrible [7]                     because the population changes (decreases) every time you draw. lets assume there are 10 disctint cards and you draw one card let' assume you are looking for A of spades the first time the odds are 1/10 - > you draw the card and put it on the table the secend time ..well u have 9 cards left in the deck ..so it is 1/9 let's assume you drew 8 times and A did not come up ..you are left with 2 cards ...what are the odds now .. 1/10 or 1/2 ? that's why the odds change every time you draw a card (unless you return the card to the deck, which you shuffle)                                   #5     31st August 2009, 1:30 PM           chris_the_terrible [7]                     re: Poker & straight flush odds             Originally Posted by cha4zz   Not that, because some of the time, opponents will hold the 7,8,9 of diamonds as well, meaning that it is impossible for you to hit your straight flush.

If you put your opponent on 78 and you pretty sure ur opponent got it .. then yes .. u should adjust the odds .. otherwise the only cards that are known to u is ur hand                                   #6     31st August 2009, 1:31 PM              Maid Marian [11,669]         Poker at: BCP, ACR,  Game: holdem/Razz              I don't play by the numbers as far as a flush is concerned...all I know is if you have no higher than a K of any suite, you must assume that one opponent may be holding the A same suite & is waiting to go all-in against you! I had nearly 35,000 chips not long ago on Full Tilt And was confident that my K high flush would win...went all-in and LOST to an A high flush! That's what I would call a 'bad-beat'!

P(1st spade)*P(2nd spade)*P(3rd spade) = (11/50)*(10/49)*(9/48) = 33/3920 = %0.84 (...)  this assumes we care about the order of the spades  in poker it does not matter what's the exact order of the cards hence the calculations needs to be multiplied by 3! = 1*2*3 = 6  (11/50*10/49*9/48) * 3!  3! takes into considerations all different combinations you can arrange 3 cards ...e.g. ABCD can be arranged 4! ways ...1*2*3*4 = 24 and we do not want to double count those cases                                   #10     1st September 2009, 12:20 AM              SavagePenguin [7,598]         Poker at: Pokerstars  Game: NLH              re: Poker & straight flush odds       I suck at math.  Obviously your odds will be better with 6/7s than they would be with A/Ks.  According to here , the odds of flopping a straight flush with two suited connectors is 4,899:1.  So getting it by the river will be substantially less than that.  And the flop gives you 60% of your community cards.  I can't seem to find someone posting the odds.  (Getting quads by the river with a PP is 1 in 122 but that does us no good)                                      #11     1st September 2009, 5:32 AM           Ben_Dover [34]         Game: holdem              This guy really is an absolute wizard: askthewizard  He'd probably say something like... the probabilty of hitting exactly the 7,8,9 of diamonds with 5 cards to draw equals:  (47 choose 2)*(3*2*1) / (50 choose 5) = 6486/2118760 = .31%  So with 4 different ways to hit it gives 4*.31 = 1.2% or 82-to-1.  Just a guess. -Ben                                   #12     2nd September 2009, 12:26 AM           chris_the_terrible [7]                     I got it. the mistake I made was the following... I assumed that I need to mix up the 5 cards (5!) ..but I never included them in the calculation...so knowing that per  Chances of Flopping...  http://www.pokerchipsupplystore.com/Texas_Hold_Em_Odds-c1353-wp5957.htm  Straight Flush holding suited connectors  4,899-1  this is how you should count your odds 1/50 * 1/49 * 1/48 * 4 * 3! = 0.02% or 1 to 4900   so 3! not 5! should be there ...3! = 1*2*3 = 6 - > this is how many ways u can mix the 3 cards on the board..the other 2 cards are irrelevant .. I do not include them in the calculation (1/50 * 1/49 * 1/48) so ...I do not need to mix them up  4 is for the 4 cases (that I described above) the outcome is 0.02% or 1 to 4900 it all make sense now                                   #13     2nd September 2009, 1:55 AM           Alwinpos [18]                     And lets not forget that in most cases you'll be folding that straight flush as its less likely your going to call with 5/6 suited on a 9 table when people raised before the flop.

I might have a newton binomial nightmare tonight. It's really 3 choose 3 and that works out nicely:  4*(47 choose 2)*(3 choose 3)/(50 choose 5) = .002  p.s I strive for maximum ****tails and minimal math at the table.

Game: Da Bears              Or in case you'd like to know how to actually calculate this scenario, assuming we know both players' hands and the flop as shown and you want the running nines to make your quads: 2/45*1/44 = 0.1010101010101...%, which is about 1000 to 1.        Originally Posted by slipknot4life   1080 to 1, Super System         This is close but doesn't account for knowing your opponents hole cards like in our scenario.

A List of Long-Shot Odds in Texas Holdem    Share:         18 April 2017  By  Arved KlÃ¶hn               Connor Drinan knows how it feels when a longshot comes in.     Related Articles   Poker Tips from Pros: Jonathan Little Makes Basic Poker Math Easy  26 January 2015      Quads over quads? Set over set over set? Hitting the bad beat jackpot?   If you've played poker live or online for any stretch of time - even a very, very short amount of time - you've seen hands play out you never thought possible.  Runner-runner flush draws. Runner-runner straight draws. One-outers on the river to crush your massive favorite.  But how often do these "long-shots" really come in? And how often should we expect it?  Below we've compiled a comprehensive list of unusual long-shot odds for Texas Hold'em â numbers and percentages to impress (or possibly annoy) your fellow players at the table.  And, importantly, to unmask ruthless exaggerators who claim the most unlikely things happened to them just the other day.   Aces over aces?   Odds of Aces v. Aces  Let's start with some rather simple but quite important odds: being dealt aces.  There are 1,326 different hole-card combinations in Texas Hold'em and 6 of them are aces.  Thus the odds of being dealt aces in any hand are 6 to 1,320 or 1 to 221 (or 0.45%).  You probably already knew that. But what are the odds that one of your opponents is dealt aces as well?  At a full-ring table (for this article âfull ringâ means 9 players per table) this should happen only once every 154 times you're dealt aces.  A spectacular scenario, but quite unlikely.  The odds it happens in a $1m buy-in tournament? Too painful to even calculate , but itÂ happened to Connor Drinan inÂ the 2014 WSOP Big One for One Drop .Â Here's the Aces-vs-Aces Hand with Drinan and Cary Katz:   Running into Aces with Kings  With aces you have nothing to fear before the flop . But with pocket kings there is always this nagging thought in the back of your head that maybe, just maybe, one of your opponents has aces.   He folded Kings in the Main Event!   Is that a likely scenario?Â The answer is, as it often is in poker, âit depends."  If you're playing heads-up you're only up against one opponent. That opponent only has aces roughly once every 220 hands.  So, no. It's not likely he has your kings beat.  But at a full-ring table (9 players) with 8 opponents, it's suddenly much more likely â albeit still a long-shot â that someone has aces against your kings.  The odds for that to happen are 1 in 26 . You're almost always better off disregarding this worst-case scenario, but sometimes really good players can make impressive folds with kings before the flop.  Here's German young gun Christopher Frank doing exactly that during the 2016 WSOP Main Event:   Queens into Kings (and Aces)   So unlikely, so painful.   With kings it's possible, but unlikely, to run into a better hand pre-flop . But what about queens?  Queens are much more vulnerable and, while it's still much more likely that you're ahead pre-flop, you should consider the scenario that one of your opponents has kings or aces.  At a full-ring table the odds for that to happen are 1 in 13.  A raise, re-raise and an all-in in front of you might be a decent indicator that this 1 in 13 event is unfolding and that you're better off folding your hand.  Important Odds for Big Pairs  Scenario  Probability  Odds  Being dealt aces preflop  0.4525%  1:220  If you have aces heads-up, your opponent has aces as well  0.0816%  1:1,224  If you have aces at a full ring table, one opponent has aces as well  0.6512%  1:153  If you have kings heads-up, your opponent has aces  0.4898%  1:203  If you have kings at a full ring table, one opponent has aces  3.8518%  1:25  If you have queens heads-up, your opponent has kings or aces  0.9796%  1:101  If you have queens at a full ring table, at least one opponent has kings or aces  7.5732%  1:12  Set Over Set  Let's move on to some post-flop odds -- specifically sets, meaning trips with a pocket pair.  How often do you flop a set ? Every ambitious poker player should know this number by heart: roughly 12% of the time or once every 9 times you see a flop with your pair.   Set over set, baby.   A scenario many poker players are afraid of is the dreaded set over set: you flop a set but one of your opponents flops a better set.  Although quite unlikely this scenario is not that uncommon. If two players have pocket pairs, both will flop a set simultaneously roughly once every 100 flops .  You still need two players to have a pocket pair at the same time for that to happen. At a full-ring table you can expect to see a set-over-set scenario roughly once every 1,200 hands (assuming all players with pocket pairs always see a flop).  Heads-up this scenario is much more unlikely, though. It should happen only once every 42,000 hands . So there's no need to worry about better sets with only one opponent â unless of course you're Phil Ivey playing Scotty Nguyen in one of the biggest heads-up tournaments on TV:   Set Over Set Over Set  Set over set situations are already very uncommon. But what about some truly long-shot scenarios? What about three players all flopping a set at the same time?  The math shows this scenario is extremely unlikely. At a full-ring table you'll only see that every 166k hands. With only three players at the table, this number increases to once every 14 million hands . A true long-shot!

While sets are great hands, letâs now look at even better poker hands: quads. Only bested by straight flushes, quads are the second-best possible holding in Texas Holdâem and occur only very infrequently.   Quads over quads!   How infrequently?  Well, if you hold a pocket pair and go all the way with it, youâll hit a set by the river once every 123 attempts â infrequently, but still more likely than being dealt aces before the flop.  Quads over Quads: Does it Happen?  Set over set is already quite unlikely but what about one step further? What are the odds of two players hitting quads when both start out with a pocket pair ?  This scenario infamously happened to Andrew Robl and Toby Lewis during the Party Poker World Open some years ago:   Well, the odds for that are pretty slim: With two players holding a pocket pair both will hit quads by the river roughly once every 39,000 attempts .  Factoring in the odds of having two players being dealt pocket pairs before the flop, youâll see such a scenario at a full-ring table only once every 313k hands â for most live poker players, this already is a once-in-a-lifetime scenario.  Odds for Making Quads in Poker  Scenario  Probability  Odds  If you have a pair, you hit quads until the river  0.8163%  1:122  If two players have a pair, both hit quads until the river  0.0026%  1:38,915  Heads-up both players are dealt a pair and both hit quads  0.00000008%  1: 11,255,911  Two players at a 6-max-table are dealt a pair and both hit quads  0.0001%  1:750,393  Two players at a full ring table are dealt a pair and both hit quads  0.0003%  1:312,663  How Often Do You Flop a Flush?  Letâs take a look at some more post-flop odds.   Flushed.   If you hold two suited cards, flopping three cards of your suit is your dream scenario . But usually this doesnât happen.  Actually youâll only flop a flush once every 119 attempts if you start with two suited cards.  How Likely is Flush over Flush?  Your dream scenario of flopping a flush can occasionally turn into a nightmare if one of your opponents flops a better flush with you.  WSOP Champion Joe McKeehen probably still has the occasional night terror from a flush-over-flush hand where he was on the receiving end of a bad beat against Fedor Holz during the WSOP $111k High Roller in 2016:   But what are the odds? As a matter of fact, if two players start out with two suited cards of the same suit, the odds of both flopping a flush are not as small as one might think.   Once every 206 attempts the flop will show three cards of the same suit.Â Even flush over flush over flush is not that unlikely.  If three players have suited cards of identical suits, theyâll all flop a flush once every 434 attempts .  If you want to know how often this happens at a table, you still have to factor in the odds of all those players being dealt matching suited cards.  Considering those odds (and assuming every player with suited cards sees the flop â admittedly a bold assumption) youâll witness a flopped flush over flush once every 540 hands at a full ring table.  The triple flush is much more unlikely though and should happen only once every 29k attempts .  Odds for Flushes in Texas Hold'em  Scenario  Probability  Odds  If you have suited cards, you flop a flush  0.8418%  1:118  If two players have suited cards, both flop a flush  0.4857%  1:205  If three players have suited cards, all three flop a flush  0.2306%  1:433  Heads-Up, both players are dealt suited cards and flop a flush  0.0051%  1:19,490  Two players at a 6-max-table are dealt suited cards and both flop a flush  0.0770%  1:1,298  Two players at a full ring table are dealt suited cards and both flop a flush  0.1847%  1:540  Three players at a 6-max-table are dealt suited cards and all three flop a flush  0.0012%  1:85,758  Three players at a full ring table are dealt suited cards and all three flop a flush  0.0035%  1:28,585  Unlucky Streaks in Poker  Have you ever sat at a poker table for hours and not been dealt a single playable hand? Have you ever had someone claim he wasnât dealt a single ace over dozens - or even hundreds! - of hands ?   The unluckiest man in poker?   Letâs run some probabilities!  The probability of not being dealt a single pocket pair over 50 hands is a little bit under 5% â unlikely, but very possible. Expand the streak to 200 hands and the probability drops to less 0.0005%.  The guy to your right is claiming he hasnât seen a pair over the last two days? Heâs almost certainly bullshitting you.  Now most pocket pairs are only really good if you flop a set with them. Letâs take a look at some probabilities and assume youâll always see a flop with your pocket pairs.  The probability of hitting at least one set (i.e. youâre dealt a pair and you flop a set with it) over 100 hands is almost exactly 50% . So over 100 hands youâre as likely to hit at least one set as you are to not hit one.  Over 500 hands the probability of not hitting a single set drops to only 3%. Over 1,000 hands this number drops to less than 0.1% . So, over a long enough sample, you're practically guaranteed to flop one of those powerhouse hands.  Odds for Streaks in Poker  Scenario  Probability  Odds  Being dealt no pocket pair over 50 hands  4.8256%  1:20  Being dealt no pocket pair over 100 hands  0.2329%  1:428  Being dealt no pocket pair over 200 hands  0.0005%  1:184,410  Not hitting a set over 100 hands  49.9635%  1:1  Not hitting a set over 500 hands  3.1136%  1:31  Not hitting a set over 1000 hands  0.0969%  1:1,031  Being dealt no ace and no pocket pair over one full ring orbit  17.4226%  1:5  Being dealt no ace and no pocket pair over 25 hands  0.7798%  1:127  Being dealt no premium hand (A-K, JJ+) over 100 hands  4.6746%  1:20  Probability of a Royal Flush  Letâs return to individual poker hands once more, namely to the single best poker hand -- the royal flush . A hand so rare most poker players will remember every single one they are dealt for their entire life.   Royaled.   It's already quite unlikely for the board to allow for a royal flush (by featuring at least three cards ten or higher of the same suit).  This happens only once every 60 hands that go to the river.  Letâs say youâre playing at a full-ring table where each player tries his or her best to hit a royal flush.  That means they never fold their hand until itâs impossible for them to make that royal flush.  Then youâll see a royal flush roughly once every 3,600 hands . In real life the odds are certainly a bit lower since sometimes people fold hands like QTs before the flop.  Not everybody chases backdoor-royal-flush draws if there are bets and raises in front of them.  But letâs stay at this table where everyone does their best to make a royal flush. If you stood besides this table for 100 hands, the probability of witnessing at least one royal flush is already 2.7% â still unlikely, but not unheard of.  If you stood there for 2,500 hands (or roughly 100 hours of live poker) this probability increased to almost 50% .Â Here we can offer three royal flushes (and Phil Hellmuth winning one of them) in under 10 minutes:   All Important Royal Flush Probabilities  The board shows a royal flush  0.0002%  1:649,739  The board allows for a royal flush  1.6637%  1:59  One player makes a royal flush at a full ring table  0.0276%  1:3,628  Witnessing a royal flush over 100 hands at a full ring table  2.7184%  1:36  Witnessing a royal flush over 2500 hands at a full ring table  49.7922%  1:1  Witnessing two or more royal flushes over 100 hands at a full ring table  0.0369%  1:2,708  Odds of Hitting the Bad Beat Jackpot?  Many local card rooms and some online poker providers offer bad beat jackpots. If you lose with a very strong hand, you and the entire table receive a share of a significant jackpot.   Oh no.   Sometimes those jackpots are worth more than $1m and some people become rich by losing a single hand of poker.  Thereâs one caveat though: hitting those bad beat jackpots is really, really unlikely .  Card rooms also have strict requirements about which hands qualify for a bad beat jackpot.  One of the most frequently used rule sets for those jackpots is: One player must lose with quad eights (or better) and both him and the player with the winning hand must use both hole cards.  Hereâs a prime example of a hand that qualifies for such a bad beat jackpot:   Unfortunately for Motoyuki Mabuchi , who just lost with quad aces against a royal flush, this hand occurred during the WSOP which doesnât offer bad beat jackpots.  Letâs talk numbers: If youâre playing heads up and both you and your opponent do the best to hit the bad beat jackpot (i.e. not folding pockets eights or better and not folding possible straight flushes), youâll have a qualifying hand once every 7 million attempts . Talk about unlikely!  The odds improve considerably if you increase the number of players at the table since now more players can make a qualifying hand. At a full-ring table the odds of any two players hitting the bad beat jackpot are 1 to 194,000 .  How Likely is a Bad Beat Jackpot in Poker?  Scenario  Probability  Odds  Hitting quad eights or better and lose (heads-up)  0.0000%  1:6,974,878  Hitting quad eights or better and lose (6-max)  0.0002%  1:464,991  Hitting quad eights or better and lose (full ring)  0.0005%  1:193,746  Witnessing such a bad beat over 1,000 hands at a full ring table  0.5148%  1:193  Witnessing such a bad beat over 100,000 hands at a full ring table  40.3180%  1:1  Being Dealt the Same Hand Twice?  Now that we've covered most of the important long-shot odds, letâs look at some more streaks.  Have you had a dÃ©jÃ  vu when looking at your hole cards because you had the exact same cards (down to the suits) just the last hand? Sounds like the dealer is pretty bad at shuffling, no?   Didn't I just have this?   Actually, it doesn't. With a perfect shuffle the odds of you getting the same hand as you had the hand before is 1 in 1,326 â unlikely, but not impossible.  The gist with small probabilities is that they quickly become more and more likely if you repeat the event often enough. Over 100 hands itâs already 1 to 13 to be dealt the same two cards in a row at least once. And over 1,000 hands itâs already more likely for this happen at least once than for this to not happen.  Pocket Aces Back-to-Back  Now anyone can be dealt 83o twice in row and might not even notice this coincidence (because, who cares about those low cards). But if youâ re dealt pocket aces back-to-back, youâll probably remember this feat for months.  Surprisingly this scenario is not as unlikely as you might think. Over 100 hands the odds are roughly 1 to 500; over 1,000 hands already 1 to 50. Over 34,000 hands youâre 50/50 to have been dealt pocket aces twice in a row at least once.  Someone who has certainly played more than 34,000 hands is Phil Hellmuth . And the Poker Brat just recently managed to get dealt pocket aces back-to-back live on television during Poker Night in America .  But, of course, getting aces is not everything. You first need to get your stack in and you need your hand to hold up. Hellmuth seems to struggle with the latter in this clip:     Probabilities of Back-to-Back Hands and Streaks in Hold'em  Being dealt the exact same cards in a row at least once over 100 hands  7.1968%  1:13  Being dealt the exact same cards in a row at least once over 1,000 hands  52.9368%  1:1  Being dealt pocket aces twice in a row at least once over 100 hands  0.2016%  1:495  Being dealt pocket aces twice in a row at least once over 1,000 hands  2.0157%  1:49  Being dealt pocket aces twice in a row at least once over 34,000 hands  49.9927%  1:1  Being dealt pocket aces twice within one full ring orbit  0.0722%  1:1,385  Being dealt pocket aces three times within one full ring orbit  0.0008%  1:131,144  Being dealt pocket kings or better twice within one full ring orbit  0.2826%  1:353  Being dealt a premium hand (A-K, JJ+) twice within one full ring orbit  2.8448%  1:34  Being dealt a premium hand (A-K, JJ+) 10 or more times over 100 hands  0.0911%  1:1,097  Hitting at least 5 sets over 100 hands  0.0690%  1:1,447  How Many Ways to Shuffle the Deck?  Lastly, let's take a look at some rather big numbers: How many ways are there to shuffle a deck of 52 cards?   Let me count the ways.   For the first card you have 52 options, for the second 51, for the third 50 and so on. Thus the total number of different ways a deck can be shuffled is 52 Ã 51 Ã 50 Ã â¦ Ã 1 â or 52! (factorial).  This number is mindbogglingly huge.  It has 68 digits and if you like tongue twisters, please try to pronounce it: 80 unvigintillion 658 vigintillion 175 novemdecillion 170 octodecillion 943 septendecillion 900 sexdecillion.  Here's the full number:  80,658,175,170,943,900,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000  The number of ways to shuffle a single deck of cards is so huge that whenever you shuffle a deck you are virtually guaranteed to have a shuffle that has never been played before and never will be played again.  YouTuber Vsauce produced a great video which demonstrates how absurdly huge the number of ways to shuffle a deck actually is:   Number of Possible Different Poker Games  Interestingly enough, the number of different card distributions for a poker game is much smaller.  The bottom cards of the deck are not used and thus it doesn't matter how they are shuffled. As a matter of fact, for a heads-up game of Holdâem, you only use 9 cards â 4 hole cards and 5 for the board.  The total number of different distributions for a heads-up Hold'em game is a bit over 1 trillion: 1,390,690,501,200 â a number much smaller than 52!, but still large enough that you'll never see the same heads-up game twice in your lifetime.  Possible Distributions for Texas Hold'em Games  Number of different heads-up deals  1,390,690,501,200  Number of different 6-max deals  1,411,633,731,355,660,000,000  Number of different full ring deals  874,314,668,608,292,000,000,000,000  Number of ways to shuffle the deck  806,581,751,709,439 * 10^53  All Long-Shot Odds in Poker  Below we've listed all odds and probabilities mentioned in this article. Below each scenario we have provided the mathematical formula for how to calculate the probability. Keep in mind that all probabilities assume that each player stays in the hand until the mentioned scenario can no longer be reached. For example, the probabilities for sets assume that no player ever folds pocket pairs.  #  Scenario  Probability  Odds  1  Being dealt aces preflop  0.4525%  1:220    6/52c2  2  If you have aces

Is there anyone could calculate the odds of 3 people getting pocket pairs, then one of them flopping a quad and someone else getting a full house at the same time and him ending up being beat on the river despite hitting quad himself?

But as someone who has worked in a cardroom full-time for years, I've seen many beats this bad. The worst I remember is from a stud game at San Pablo: two players went all-in on sixth street, showing a 9-high straight flush in diamonds and a 10-high straight flush in spades, celebrating because that qualified them for a jackpot of about $10,000. Dealer burns, and turns....10 of diamonds. Split pot, no jackpot. â Lee Daniel Crocker  Aug 28 '15 at 16:07            The odds for one getting a pair is around 6% . This is all you need to account for. If you hit a set, you don't really care about the odds of the Villain hitting boat or quads. That's the rarest thing and just a cooler . Lose your stack and move on. â user1165  Aug 28 '15 at 21:24             Well they aren't that wrong... bad beats do happen "all the time". â user1934  Feb 21 '16 at 17:58            No, player 1 did not slow play.

Or well my maths anyway.  With 7 cards to choose from in hold'em, your hole cards and the board, the odds of making quads is about 1 in 595. (13 * (48 choose 3)) / (52 choose 7) which = 0.00168067227 or 1 in 595. This is over the entire 7 cards.  So for another person to have quads in the same hand we figure out how many possible hands are left. We know the player who has quads has 4 of the same cards, 2 in his hand 2 from the board. Leaving 2 from the other players hand and 3 more from the board giving 5 cards. This leaves 1,712,304 possible hands with 5 more cards. (48 choose 5) / 5! = 1,712,304.  So player one has effectively knocked out a card from the original calculation to get quads, so rather than 13 quads to choose from there is only 12 possible quads left. We can work out the odds of this player getting quads, which gives up 528 possible hands to give him quads in this situation, 12 types of quads left, 44 cards to choose from 12 * 44 = 528.  So now that we know the other player has 528 possible hands to give him quads over 5 cards, and we know the total number of possible hands left to be dealt, 528 / 1,712,304 = 0.031% or 1 in 3243.  This situation only factors in heads up like the above hand, and if both players have pocket pairs. It would change if the second player needed 3 cards on the board for their quads.     share | improve this answer     answered Aug 29 '15 at 12:04       Grinch91   2,725 1 4 22              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Yes, the probability of that is very low: <0.01%.

ANONYMOUS  Between two players there are 9 total cards. These must consist of two four of a kinds and one singleton. The number of combinations for this is combin(13,2)*44 = 3432. The total number of ways to pick 9 cards out of 52 is combin(52,9) = 3,679,075,400. So the probability you have the right cards, but not necessarily in the right order, is 3432/3,679,075,400 = 1 in 1,071,992.  However just because the cards are AAAABBBBC doesnât mean both players will have different four of a kinds. The number of ways to arrange them into a 5-card hand and two 2-card hands is 9!/(5!*2!*2!) = 756. Following are the ways those 9 cards can fall.  Four of a Kind Bad Beat Combinations
36  Player 1  Player 2  Flop  Mirror Patterns  Combinations per Pattern  Total Combinations  AA  BB  AABBC  2  72  AA  AB  ABBBC  4  48  192  AA  AA  BBBBC  2  6  12  AA  AC  ABBBB  4  12  48  AA  BC  AABBB  4  24  96  AB  AB  AABBC  1  144  144  AB  AC  AABBB  4  48  192  Of these only the first and the fifth group result in both players having a different four of a kind. So the probability that an AAAABBBBC set of cards results in two different four of a kinds is 168/756 = 22.22%.  So the answer to your question is (3432/3,679,075,400)*(168/756) = 1 in 4,823,963. On a more practical note Party Poker has a bad beat jackpot for a losing hand of four eights. Given that there are two four of a kinds the probability that both are eights or greater is combin(7,2)/combin(13,2) = 21/78 = 26.92%. So the probability that any one hand of two players will result in this bad beat jackpot is 1 in 17,917,577.     share | improve this answer     answered Aug 27 '16 at 16:36       Scot   1              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      My quad kings on the flop of (KKA) were beaten by pocket aces for AAAA over KKKK.
I calculated the odds of that happening were @1:56,000,000.
It's one hand I'll never forget just because of the outlandish probabilities involved.
However, I did also, in a live cash game, play 57 suited to straight flush a rival A hi flush AND a full house just like James Bond years before the movie came out. So it's not impossible.
I've played over 2 million hands of poker and the game has never lost intrigue.     share | improve this answer     answered Sep 4 '17 at 20:24       user5467   13 4              add a comment |            Your Answer            draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

Suffice to say, the chances of what you've described are very very very small and I would suggest you consider investigating the shuffling and dealing technique in this game. â 3N1GM4  Dec 7 '16 at 13:27        add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  -1  down vote      Assuming that everyone goes to showdown every hand (which is obviously a massive and unrealistic assumption, but makes the calculation much easier), the chances of at least one player in your 7-handed game makes quads on any given hand is:  0.168% * 7 = 1.176%  For someone to get the same quads on another hand is:  (0.168% / 13) * 7 = 0.0905%  So for these two events to both occur would be:  1.176% * 0.0905% = 0.00106428%  For someone to additionally then get any other 4OAK on the 3rd hand:  0.00106428% * (0.168% * 7) = 0.000000125159328%  or roughly 1 in 8 million .  To be any more accurate, we need to model player behaviour and figure out chances that particular hands get to showdown etc, which makes the calculation non-trivial.     share | improve this answer      edited May 5 '17 at 13:30             answered Dec 7 '16 at 13:40       3N1GM4   1,645 2 24              add a comment |            Your Answer            draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

This has happened in the region of 20+ times over the course of 2 weeks. I used to see 4 of a kind once every 1000 - 2000 hands.  I'm finding it quite odd, I've had it about 6 times myself in the past 2 weeks. In the period of seeing all of these 4 of a kinds, I've played about 2000 - 2500 hands at most.  How often statistically, should any player at a 9 seat table be getting 4 of a kind? Even if they fold and I don't see it, what's the general odds of 1 in 9 players making 4 of a kind?  As a bonus question, if I may, what are the odds of losing with 4 of a kind to a better 4 of a kind?    texas-hold-em  odds  hand     share | improve this question      edited May 24 '16 at 5:56             asked May 23 '16 at 20:19       Dom   686 8 17                  I added a detailed answer for you.

0.013183% or ~ once every 7586 hands  2) For your bonus question, I am not quite sure if that's what you are looking for, but have a look in here: http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/25/probability/quads-over-quads-odds-866086/ (assuming that 2 players start with 2 pocket pairs,and they're going to see all 5 community cards) it is calculated:
 ~ 1 in 38,916 hands   ++ Quick tip by the way: I would't worry too much if I ever won/lost a big pot with/to quads. Since it happens that rarely, it doesn't make much of a difference in your gameplay, winrate etc. I would focus more on "everyday" stuff, like cbet frequency, opening range, calling down frequencies etc and minimize my leaks in those sections.     share | improve this answer      edited May 24 '16 at 9:20             answered May 24 '16 at 8:59       koita_pisw_sou   648 1 7                  Hi koita, thanks for answering. I assume the odds for getting 4 of a kind are for 1 player? Do you know enough about statistics to tell me if for 9 players it would be 0.013183% x 9? Thanks for finding the odds on 4oak over 4oak, it's not that I'm worried about losing with 4oak, it's just it happened to me and I wanted to know the odds of it happening, but I couldn't find them anywhere. If I can get a second opinion to confirm the odds in #1 I'll upvote and accept - basically waiting to see if someone comments in agreement. :) â Dom  May 24 '16 at 9:10             The 0.013183% is for 9 players. In the link I provided, there is a table with all probabilities from 2 to 9 players if you want to get similar data. â koita_pisw_sou  May 24 '16 at 9:19            It seems a bit small for 9 players, and smaller than I expected for even a single player. Are you sure it's not for a single player in a 9 handed game? The link doesn't have much of a description above the table, and what it does have is ambiguous and could be interpreted in more than one way. â Dom  May 24 '16 at 9:30        1      The thing about probability is that it never said when you'll see those hands. It may be once every 7586 hands mathematically but you could play say 21,000 hands without seeing quads and then you might see quads three times over the next 2,000 hands or so or in a short amount of time. Also that 0.013183% is the percentage chance of it occurring for one player in a 9 handed table. Odds of quads vs quads is even smaller, see here for bad beat odds for quads: wizardofodds.com/games/texas-hold-em/bad-beat-jackpots . I know it seems small but its really not as common as some players believe. â Grinch91  May 24 '16 at 9:39            *Or rather I should say odds of quads being beaten, not necessarily just quads over quads. â Grinch91  May 24 '16 at 9:40        add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote      Just anecdotal but I was playing live at a casino last week and I flopped quads twice and hit quads on the turn another time in a 5 hour session. That probably represents about 160 - 175 hands. Sometimes the laws of probability can seem to be violated over a small sample size.  On one of these hands, BTW, I came close to hitting the bad beat jackpot ($250K). I had JcJs and the flop was KhJhJd. Of course I didn't know it until the hand was over but one of the other players had Qh10h. That works out to about a 9% chance after the flop of me winning the lion's share of the jackpot. Why can't someone hit a 2-outer on me when I really need it ?!?     share | improve this answer     answered May 31 '16 at 19:56       Philip Hall   1 2              add a comment |             up vote  0  down vote       How often statistically, should any player at a 9 seat table be getting 4 of a kind? Even if they fold and I don't see it, what's the general odds of 1 in 9 players making 4 of a kind?   The cardinality (whole possible hole + commie cards) is 52 taking 7: 133784560 The desired scenarios for you involve freezing 4 cards being equal (13 scenarios) and 3 out of the remaining 48 cards: 13 * 17296 = 224848 .  The odds are like 0.0017 by dividing desired / cardinality, but this will include situations of 4oak being community cards.  If you want to exclude the in-table 4-of-a-kind (you want it only for you), then you will have to calculate like this:   cardinality: 674274182400 (52 taking 7 in certain order).  scenarios: 13 * 17296 * 5040 (13 pokers, 48 taking 3 free cards, 5040 stands for 7! which contemplates arbitrary sort) - 48 * 47 * 13 * 46 * 120 (scenarios where you don't have one of those cards in your hand, but anyway it is 4oak, while the latter 120 is 5! which contemplates arbitrary sort in the commie cards; arbitrary sort is already contemplated in the hole cards when multiplying 48 * 47 ).   The result is 0.0014 here.  In this 0.0014 , however, another player (only one!) could also have 4oak, if that happens, scenarios are like this:   XX vs YY with XXYY? : 13 * 6 * 12 * 6 * 44 * 120 (which stands for: 44 as the ?, 120 as 5! for arbitrary flop order, 6 in both cases for suit combination in hands) = 29652480 .  ?X vs YY with XXXYY : 13 * 4 * 44 * 12 * 6 * 120 (which stands for: 44 as the ?, 120 as 5! for arbitrary flop order, 4 and 6 for suit combination in hands) = 19768320 .  XX vs ?Y with XXYYY : 19768320 same situation but reciprocal.   The question marks replace bricks . So you want to discard those scenarios when another one has a different 4oak:   cardinality: 674274182400 (52 taking 7 in certain order; this one did not change).  scenarios: 13 * 17296 * 5040 - 29652480 - 19768320 - 19768320 = 902154240 .   Your odds of getting exclusive 4oak and nobody else getting another 4oak is: 0.0013. In the other 0.0001 case the other one will get another 4oak, so by having an exclusive 4oak there's a 1/14 chance the other one has another exclusive 4oak as well.  Please I need a cross-review in this point! I'd like to check if 0.0013 is a good result or I screwed with the calc application. I admit it looks pretty weird to me this 1/14 difference   As a bonus question, if I may, what are the odds of losing with 4 of a kind to a better 4 of a kind?   Now focusing on the conditional analysis on the game table. If your hand/commie already look like this:   XX with XXYYY: One arbitrary opponent has a chance of having 4oak in 44 / 45 * 22 = 0.04444  ?X with XXXYY: One arbitrary opponent has a chance of having 4oak in 1 / 45 * 22 = 0.00101  XX with XXYY?: One arbitrary opponent has a chance of having 4oak in 1 / 45 * 22 = 0.00101   By having those scenario configurations, you have to map the value of X like this:   2 is worth 0, 10 is worth 8.  J Q K A is worth 9 10 11 12.  Lets call MAP(X) this mapping that converts the values like I told.  12 will be the maximum value here.   Given those three scenarios which could risk of having another 4oak from only one arbitrary opponent, you require an additional condition: AND the other player beats me with an Y-valued poker , so the values are:   0.04444 * (12 - MAP(X)) / 12 for scenario XX XXYYY.  0.00101 * (12 - MAP(X)) / 12 for scenario XX XXYY?.  0.00101 * (12 - MAP(X)) / 12 for scenario ?X XXXYY.   Disclaimer: These results are probabilistic fractions, which are always in closed interval [0..1]. Since none of these values is zero, you can calculate  H = 1 / value  and later say "the chances are 1 in H hands" .     share | improve this answer      edited Jun 30 '16 at 23:40             answered Jun 30 '16 at 21:57       Luis Masuelli   300 3 12              add a comment |             up vote  -3  down vote      Yes you are ranting.  Really you are counting and seeing 4 of a kind once every 100 - 150 hands.   If you are counting then you would have a number not a range.  The chance of 4 of a kind in 5 cards is 4,164 : 1  You are not playing with 5 cards you are playing with 7 The chance of 4 or a kind in 7 cards is 594 : 1  9 players is 9 hands so roughly 65 : 1 for a table of nine  It is covered in this wiki that I have linked in several of my answers. If you google "poker hands probability" it is the top hit.  As a bonus answer stop ranting.  If you have 4 of a kind assume it is good and get all you chips in the pot and hope for a call.  If there is not another pair on the board and not a straight flush then it is the nuts. It is the right statistical call every time even if the board has another pair or a straight flush.

A A K K x  Since there is 50% chance of having a block on the flush you are like 20X more likely to get beat by quads and I know how to run those numbers but at this point I am not interested in helping OP.     share | improve this answer      edited May 24 '16 at 15:19             answered May 24 '16 at 2:14       paparazzo   4,877 1 8 31              2      Excuse you. Absolutely unnecessary rudeness. No I'm not ranting. I've been playing poker for 12 years and I've never seen 4 of a kind anywhere near as often as I've seen it recently. I've asked for the odds of a player getting it so that I can work out whether it's as unlikely as my gut feeling says it is, as it turns out, it appears to be more common than I thought it was.

Discussing the user is discussing topics aside of the asked ones, picking aggressive / rude / bully behavior wrt what a user does, picking a fight or flamewar, and starting an answer like you did (without editing it, if the user edited). Accusing a user of bare ranting without the user asking for it, is discussing the user and not the question.

I had pocket sixes, and ended up turning those into quads. Then, the very next hand -- from a different, auto-shuffled deck -- I got pocket sixes again, which again turned into quads! I got the same four-of-a-kind two hands in a row. I figure the odds against that are astronomical.  And I want to know, just how astronomical are they? Just what exactly are the odds of getting the same four-of-a-kind twice in a row in Hold'em?    texas-hold-em  odds     share | improve this question     asked Jan 24 '12 at 22:34       SkippyKawakami   28 1 3              add a comment |           2 Answers 2     active  oldest  votes            up vote  6  down vote  accepted      The odds of getting a 4 of a kind given 7 cards (2 in your hand and 5 on the board) are (13 * (48 choose 3)) / (52 choose 7) or 0.00168067227. The probability of getting that specific 4 of a kind again are now (48 choose 3) / (52 choose 7) or 0.000129282482.  The probability of both events occurring is 0.00168067227* 0.000129282482, which is 0.000000217281482.  Note that this leaves open the possibility that other people at the table would also still have the four of a kind (as in, it includes those situations where there is a four of a kind on the board.) Presumably, you'd want to exclude those.  For this, we have to multiply the probability of getting 3 of a kind on the board while having an unpaired hand with the probability of getting 2 of a kind on the board while having a paired hand.   Probability of a pocket pair = 78/1326  Probability of matching 2 of a kind on the board: (48 choose 3)/(50 choose 5)  Probability of no pocket pair: 1248/1326  Probability of matching 3 of a kind on the board: (47 choose 2)/(50 choose 5)   So the probability of an exclusive four of a kind is:  (48 choose 3)/(50 choose 5) * (78/1326) + (47 choose 2)/(50 choose 5) * (1248/1326) = 0.000960384154  The probability of getting the same exact four of a kind is then:   Probability of same pocket pair = 6/1326  Probability of matching 2 of a kind on the board: (48 choose 3)/(50 choose 5)  Probability of no pocket pair that matches that 4 of a kind: 208/1326  Probability of matching 3 of a kind on the board: (47 choose 2)/(50 choose 5)   This is:  (48 choose 3)/(50 choose 5) * (6/1326) + (47 choose 2)/(50 choose 5) * (208/1326) = 0.000116969865.  So the final probability is 0.000116969865 * 0.000960384154 = 0.000000112336005.  So basically: 8,901,864 : 1 odds of you getting the same four of a kind assuming you are the only one with the four of a kind each time. Otherwise, 4,602,324 : 1 odds of you getting the same four of a kind twice.     share | improve this answer     answered Jan 24 '12 at 23:49       Sasha   184 3                  Thank you! This explains it really well. So, if I wanted to limit it to four-of-a-kind starting with a pocket pair for both hands, it would be the same process, except not adding in the no-pocket-pair odds, right? I think if I'm doing my math right, the odds against this were 56,378,480:1 ... or to put it another way, I was more likely to win the California Super Lotto jackpot than I was to get this sequence of hands. â SkippyKawakami  Jan 27 '12 at 0:41             @SkippyKawakami: If only you could play the lottery as often as you play a poker hand...

Without going through the math exactly, it would be into the 1,000,000+ to 1 region. That may be broad but your question is also! Nice to have you here @SkippyKawakami.

I thought it would have a precise answer, and a precise method of determining that answer. But if I was ambiguous, I'm happy to edit the question for clarity. â SkippyKawakami  Jan 24 '12 at 23:46            You are right to say that this particular question about quads has a precise answer. I was really alluding to the conceptual broadness of the question. You could equally ask the same thing and substitute "four-of-a-kind" with any other combination of hand types, like two-pair, sets, etc. The conceptual scope of an odds question like this covers so much, and yet your specific question covers so little to be of any use to many others. That is unless it helps to plan on hitting back-to-back quads regularly (and I do!). â Toby Booth â¦  Jan 25 '12 at 0:07        add a comment |            Your Answer            draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

See All Sportsbook Reviews You are here Home Â» Four of a Kind Odds  Four of a Kind Odds  Facebook Twitter Reddit Getting four of a kind in Texas Holdâem wonât happen to you very often. You have roughly a 1 in 4,100 chance to hit this monster hand on the flop, but this big hand isnât always the best way to get chips from your opponents. Hitting four of a kind means that the only hand in poker that can beat you is a straight flush. The odds of being up against a straight flush when youâve hit four of a kind are over 1 in 88 million, and itâs unlikely that youâll even see this happen âÂ let alone be involved in a hand where it does occur. Just because you hit a big hand like four of a kind doesnât mean that youâre going to win a big pot. In order for you to have four of a kind, there has to be at least two of your cards on the board, and more often there will be three of them with the community cards. Because you have all four of them, your opponentsâÂ hands are going to be inferior, and when you have a big hand against a bunch of weak hands, itâs hard to get chips out of your opponents. They will see the likelihood of you having a big hand and will often get out of the way. The best way to play a monster hand like four of a kind is to let your opponents catch up a bit. You do this by not betting your big hand. That lets the other players in the hand improve and it makes them think that you donât have very much, especially a monster like four of a kind. You want to induce the other players at the table to make a bet at the pot. If someone does, you should only call their bets, and only raise the action after the last card has been dealt out. That will give you the best chance to get paid on your four of a kind, otherwise your monster hand will be wasted and all you will win will be a small pot.

Probability - General      Texas Hold âem - Probability - General   What are the odds of having two four of a kinds and a straight flush dealt to the same player in a Texas hold 'em game with ten players in 50 hands?  Paul from Toronto, Canada   The probability of a four of a kind in seven cards is 0.00168067, the probability of a straight flush is 0.00027851. If x is the probability of a four of a kind and y is the probability of a straight flush then the probability you ask for is combin(50,2)*48*x 2 *y*(1-x-y) 47 . The answer comes out to .0000421845, or 1 in 23,705.     What are the statistical odds of getting a flush in Texas hold âem. Is it easier to get a flush in 7-card stud or in holdem as a player.  Kevin from Richmond, USA   You can refer to my section on probabilities in poker to see the probability is 3.03%. The odds are the same in both Texas hold âem and 7-card stud.     What are the odds of making a royal flush in Texas hold-em on the river?  John from Trinity, Texas   For those readers who donât know, the river is the fifth and last community card in Texas hold-em. The player must make the best poker hand between his own two cards and the five community cards. So youâre asking what is the probability that a player will form a royal flush in seven cards, and that the seventh card dealt will be part of the royal. The probability of forming a 5-card royal flush out of 7 cards, before considering card, is 4*combin(47,2)/combin(52,7) = 4324/133784560, or 1 in 30940. The probability that the seventh card will be part of the royal flush is 5/7. So the final probability is 21620/936491920, or 1 in 43316.     In Texas Hold em, what are the odds of making a one gap or two gap inside straight by fifth street starting from the flop?  Mr. D from Cherry Hill, USA   For the benefit of my readers, this question asks what is the probability of filling in a one or two gap inside straight with two more cards, with 47 left in the deck. With one gap the probability is 1-combin(43,2)/combin(47,2) = 0.164662. With two gaps the probability is 4 2 /combin(47,2)=0.0148.     In Texas Hold âem if the flop cards are all the same suit what is the probability any given player will hold two more cards of the same suit?  Dr. Don   There are 10 cards left of the same suit, and 49 left in the deck. So the probability is combin(9,2)/combin(49,2) = 36/1176 = 0.0306.     Are the probabilities for the various hands the same in Texas Hold âem as in Seven-card stud or are they different somehow due to the community cards? Could you please explain why or why not?  Anonymous   Yes, the probabilities are the same. Seven random cards out of 52 have the same odds regardless of how they are taken out of the deck or whom you share them with.     In the initial two cards can you tell me what the odds are of receiving 7 hands of Ace King or better at holdâem in 35 hands?  Anonymous   The probability of receiving ace/king is (8/52)*(4/51) = 0.012066. The probability of receiving any pair is (3/51) = 0.058824. So the probability of a pair or better is 0.07089. The probability of receiving exactly seven hands of ace/king or better is combin(35,7)*(.07089)^7*(1-.07089)^28 = 0.00772. To work out the probability of 7 or more we would have to go through a total of 7 to 35 one at a time. This adds up to 0.010366551.     How would you figure the probability of getting a 4 card flush or better on the flop in holdem, if your hole cards are suited.  Anonymous   The probability of getting 2 more of the same suit is 39*combin(11,2)/combin(50,3) = 0.109439.  The probability of getting 3 more of the same suit is combin(11,3)/combin(50,3) = 0.008418.  So the probability of getting at least 2 more of the same suit is 0.117857.     Mr. Wizard, First, let me say you have a terrific site! Iâve been reading it for a while now. I checked the poker questions, and didnât see this one. Another site claims this, "In Texas Holdâem, the probability of AK dealt pre-flop and hitting an A or K by the river is 1 in 2 (even)." This seems intuitively way too high. What are your thoughts? Thanks again!  John   Thanks to you too for the kind words. For those not familiar with holdâem this question is akin to asking if a player were dealt an ace and a king plus five random cards from the remaining 50 cards, what is the probability the player would pair up the king and/or ace. Of the other 50 cards 44 of them are not kings or aces. The number of ways to draw any five cards out of 44 is combin(44,5) = 1,086,088. The number of ways to draw any five cards out of all 50 is combin(50,5) = 2,118,760. So the probability of not pairing up the ace and/or king is 1086088/2118760 = 51.26%. Thus the probability you will pair up is 1-51.26% = 48.74%. This is pretty close to 1 in 2.     What is the probability that two players will have different four-of-a-kinds in Texas Holdâem?  Anonymous   Between two players there are 9 total cards. These must consist of two four of a kinds and one singleton. The number of combinations for this is combin(13,2)*44 = 3432. The total number of ways to pick 9 cards out of 52 is combin(52,9) = 3,679,075,400. So the probability you have the right cards, but not necessarily in the right order, is 3432/3,679,075,400 = 1 in 1,071,992. However just because the cards are AAAABBBBC doesnât mean both players will have different four of a kinds. The number of ways to arrange them into a 5-card hand and two 2-card hands is 9!/(5!*2!*2!) = 756. Following are the ways those 9 cards can fall.   Four of a Kind Bad Beat Combinations   Player 1  Player 2  Flop  Mirror Patterns  Combinations per Pattern  Total Combinations   AA  BB  AABBC  2  36 72  AA  AB  ABBBC  4  48  192   AA  AA  BBBBC  2  6  12   AA  AC  ABBBB  4  12  48   AA  BC  AABBB  4  24  96   AB  AB  AABBC  1  144  144   AB  AC  AABBB  4  48  192  Of these only the first and the fifth group result in both players having a different four of a kind. So the probability that an AAAABBBBC set of cards results in two different four of a kinds is 168/756 = 22.22%. So the answer to your question is  (3432/3,679,075,400)*(168/756) = 1 in 4,823,963. On a more practical note Party Poker has a bad beat jackpot for a losing hand of four eights. Given that there are two four of a kinds the probability that both are eights or greater is combin(7,2)/combin(13,2) = 21/78 = 26.92%. So the probability that any one hand of two players will result in this bad beat jackpot is 1 in 17,917,577.  Last night a player offered me a side wager in Texas Hold âem. He said that at least one face card (or any three ranks) would appear on the flop and offered even money? Should I have accepted the bet?  Anonymous   The number of ways you can choose 3 cards out of the 40 non-face cards is (40*39*38)/(1*2*3) = 9880. The number of ways you can choose 3 cards out of 52 is (52*51*50)/(1*2*3) = 22100. So the probability of not getting a face card is 9880/22100 = 44.71%. Thus the probability of getting a face is 55.29%. His side of the bet had a 10.58% advantage.    Playing Texas Holdâem with 10 players using a standard 52-card deck, after the first two cards are dealt to each player, what are the odds that the "flop" (the next three cards) will all be the same suit? Does it make a difference if my hand has both cards of the same suit and/or each one a different suit?  Mark from Milford   Before considering your own cards the probability is 4Ã combin (13,3)/combin(52,3) = 5.1764706%. Another way to look at it is the probability second card in the flop will match the first in suit is (12/51).  The probability third card in the flop will match it is (11/50).  (12/51)Ã(11/50)=5.1764706%. The odds change a little if you consider your own cards.  If you have two cards of the same suit, then the probability of a suited flop is pr(flush in same suit) + pr(flush in a different suit) = combin(11,3)/combin(50,3) + 3Ãcombin(13,3)/combin(50,3) = 5.2193878%. If you have two cards of a different suit, then the probability of a suited flop is pr(flush in suit in common) + pr(flush in a different suit) = 2Ãcombin(12,3)/combin(50,3) + 2Ãcombin(13,3)/combin(50,3) = 5.1632653%.    Dear wiz, I wish I had your brain. In any event, my struggle with stats continues. I am trying to figure out a formula to figure out the probability of getting a flush on the flop, by the turn and by the river (texas holdem) crossed by whether my hole cards are suited or not.  I tried C(50,2) / C(47,5) but that didnât work out for a suited pair by the river...I should have paid more attention in school !  Thanks ! Your biggest fan  Eric from Toronto   Thanks for the kind words but I'm not that smart.  A couple years ago I took the Mensa entrance exam, and didn't make the requisite top 2%.  I'm still upset that they refused to tell me how well I did do.  On January 13 Jeopardy tryouts are coming to Vegas, for which I have an appointment, and am sure I'll blow that too.   Anyway, to answer your question here you go: With suited hole cards:  Flush after flop: combin (11,3)/combin(50,3) = 165/19600 = 0.842%. Flush after turn: (combin(11,2)*39/combin(50,3))*(9/47) = 2.096%. Flush after river: (combin(11,2)*combin(39,2)/combin(50,4))*(9/46) = 3.462%. With unsuited hole cards: Flush after flop: 0% Flush after turn: 2*combin(12,4)/combin(50,4) = 0.430%. Flush after river: (2*combin(12,3)*39/combin(50,4))*(9/46) = 1.458%. Here are the commulative probabilities. With suited hole cards: Flush by flop:  0.842%. Flush by turn:  2.937%. Flush by river:  6.400%. With unsuited hole cards: Flush by flop: 0.000% Flush by turn:  0.430%. Flush by river:  1.888%.    Hi Wizard, First off Iâd like to say I love the precise, fluff-free answers you give. Anyway if the pocket cards in Holdem are AA and the flop cards are KQ9, what is the probability of completing to a full house? Iâve worked on this for ages :( and still dont have an answer I trust.  Michael from Perth   You could complete the full house with an ace and a K, Q, or 9.  There are 2 aces left and 3 each of K,Q, an 9.  So there are 2*3*3=18 such combinations.  The only other way would be a K, Q, or 9 pair.  There are 3*combin(3,2)=9 such combination.  The number of all combinations is 47*46/2 = 1081.  So the probability is (18+9)/1081 = 2.50%.    Iâve been a huge fan for many years (even before you got interested in poker and sports betting) and looked forward to every Ask The Wizard column. Itâs great to see youâre doing them again!  My question is this: at my local card room, they offer Aces Cracked, Win A Rack during certain hours. That is, if you have pocket Aces in one of their 3-6 or 4-8 Texas Hold âEm games and you lose the pot, the casino will give you a rack of chips ($100). Iâm trying to figure out how often a)I get pocket Aces b)how often they would lose if I played them aggressively as Iâm supposed to and c)whether itâs not better to just check all the way down and hope to lose, as $100 is usually better than what the pot would have been anyway.  Any stats you may have at the ready would be wonderful and forever appreciated!  Thanks again and keep up enlightening the masses!  Shane from Santa Rosa   Thanks for the kind words.  The probability you will get pocket aces in any one hand is 6/1326, or once every 221 hands.  According to my 10-player Texas Hold âem section (/games/texas-hold-em/10players.html) the probability of winning with pocket aces is 31.36%, assuming all players stay in until the end.  However that is a big if.  If forced to make a guess Iâd estimate the probability of winning with aces in a real 10-player game is about 70%.  So the probability of getting pocket aces and then losing is 0.3*(1/221) = 0.1357%.  So, at $100 per incident that is worth 13.57 cents per hand.  Over ten people that costs the poker room $1.36 per hand on average, which cuts into the rake quite a bit.  I tend to agree with your strategy of calling, which will keep more players in the hand, and increase your chance of losing.    First of all Iâd like to thank you for an awsome site. Now hereâs my question: Weâre playing Texas holdâem and flop a flushdraw with two small cards. We all know the % of hitting the flush. but what we really want is the % of winning the hand. And letâs say that we are sure that somebody has a higher card of that suit than us. So my question is what are the % of only one card of that suit shows and not two? Regards  Henrik from Sweden   Youâre welcome.  So you have four to a flush with two on the board after the flop.  The probability of getting exactly one of the needed suit is 9*38/ combin (47,2) = 342/1081 = 31.64%.    In Texas Hold âem, Iâd like to know the probability that another player may have been dealt two suited cards to make a higher flush than my own when there are exactly 3 suited community cards at the river.  So, for example, if Iâve got 89 of spades and the community cards include the 3 7 and K of spades, there are 4 spades larger than my 9 in the deck (TJQA).  Whatâs the chance that someone was dealt a hand with two spades including at least one of the higher spades (assuming a 9 handed game)?  What if there are only 2 (or 3 or x) spades larger than my largest hole card?  Thanks for your help and the great site.  Bob B. from Scottsdale   The following table shows the probability for 1 to 8 higher ranks and 2 to 10 players, including yourself. In the case of your example of 4 higher ranks and 9 total players, the probability is 16.45%. The way I calculated these probabilities assumed independence between hands, which is not a correct assumption, but the results should be a close estimate.

Asking this for my own personal knowledge. I was playing a 4 person game of texas holdâem. I was dealt pocket aces. I got the royal flush on the river. I was wondering what the odds are of making the royal flush on the river with aces to start?  Rhythmic from Hoquiam, WA   Thanks.  Assuming the royal consists of one of your two aces, the number of ways to make a royal by the river is 2*46=92.  This would be the two suits in your pocket aces and the 46 possibilities for the extra card.  There are combin (50,5) = 2,118,760 ways to deal 5 cards out of 50.  So the probability is 92/2,118,760 = 1 in 23,030.    If the flop comes up three of the same suit and I do not have a suit that matches the flop, and there are ten players left at the table, what is the probability of someone having a flush?  David from Seattle   The probability of any one player having a flush is combin (11,2)/combin(49,2) = 55/1176 = 4.68%.  Assuming independence between hands, which is not the case, the probability of 9 players not having a flush is (1 â 0.0468%) 9 = 64.98%.  So the probability of at least one player having a flush is 1-0.6498 = 35.02%.  This is just a quick estimate.  If I did a random simulation I think the probability would be just a little bit higher, because of the dependence between hands.    Dear Mr. Wizard, I have been recently trying to calculate the probability of getting a flush in Texas Hold 'Em if dealt two suited hole cards? My answer keeps on coming out to be 5.8% but this seems ulimately incorrect, your help would be much appreciated thanks  Nathan S. from New Plymouth   The probability of making a flush, with exactly three cards to the same suit as your hole cards, is combin (11,3)Ãcombin(39,2)/combin(50,5) = 122265/2598960 = 0.057706. The probability of making a flush, with four more cards to the same suit as your hole cards, is combin(11,4)Ãcombin(39,1)/combin(50,5) = 2145/2118760 = 0.001012. The probability of making a flush, with five more cards to the same suit as your hole cards, is combin(11,5)/combin(50,5) = 462/2118760 = 0.000218.  The probability of making a flush on the board in another suit is 3Ãcombin(13,5)/combin(50,5) = 3861/2118760 = 0.001822.  Add this all up and you get 0.057706 + 0.001012 + 0.000218 + 0.001822 = 0.060759.    What is the probability of seeing a "broken board" in Texas HoldâEm?  That is, five cards on the board where no pair exists, no flush is possible and no straight is possible.  Tim from Arcata   The number of combinations of five different ranks on the board is combin (13,5)*4 5 = 1287 Ã 1024 = 1,317,888. The probability that these five ranks will represent three suits, two of two, and one of one, is combin(4,2)*2*combin(5,2)*combin(3,2)=360. Combin(4,2) is the number of ways to choose two suits out of four for the suits represented twice. 2 for the two ways to choose the suit represented once. Combin(5,2) for the number of ways to choose two ranks out of five for the first suit of two cards. 4 5 for the number of ways to choose two ranks out of the three left for the other suit of two. The probability these five ranks will represent four suits, one of two, and three of one, is 4*combin(5,2)*3*2=240. 4 is the number of ways to choose one suit out of four for the suits represented twice. Combin(5,2) is the number of ways to choose two ranks out of five for that suit of two cards. 3 is the number of ways to choose one rank out of the three left for the first suit of one. 2 is the number of ways to choose one rank out of two for the second suit of one. There are 4 5 =1024 ways to arrange four suits on five different ranks. So the probability that no more than two of one suit will be present is (360+240)/1024 = 600/1024 = 58.59%. There are combin(13,5)=1287 ways to arrange 5 ranks out of 13. The number of these combinations in which no three ranks are within a span of 5 is 79. There is no easy formula for this one. I had to cycle through every combination. So the probability the ranks will be sufficiently spaced apart is 79/1287 = 6.14%. So, the probability of a broken board is (1317888/2596960)*(600/1024)*(79/1287) = 1.825211%.  I have been challenged on my number of broken straights. Here is a list of all 79 possible.    2378Q 2378K 2379Q 2379K 237TQ 237TK 237JQ 237JK 237QK 2389K 238TK 238JK 238QK 2479Q 2479K 247TQ 247TK 247JQ 247JK 247QK   2489K 248TK 248JK 248QK 257TQ 257TK 257JQ 257JK 257QK 258TK 258JK 258QK 267JQ 267JK 267JA 267QK 267QA 267KA 268JK 268JA   268QK 268QA 268KA 269JA 269QA 269KA 278QK 278QA 278KA 279QA 279KA 289KA 3489K 348TK 348JK 348QK 358TK 358JK 358QK 368JK   368JA 368QK 368QA 368KA 369JA 369QA 369KA 378QK 378QA 378KA 379QA 379KA 389KA 469JA 469QA 469KA 479QA 479KA 489KA    I play Texas Hold âEm at Caesars Indiana.  They have a Bad Beat Jackpot, which is now quads or better being beat.  Both players have to play both hole cards, and there must be four players dealt cards.  My question is, what is the probability of any hand being a bad beat hand, assuming all players stay until the end?  Danielle from Louisville   My new Bad Beat Jackpot section shows the probability of this kind of bad beat in a 10-player game to be 0.0000108, or about 1 in 93,000.    In your Ultimate Texas Hold âEm return table why is a large raise recommended for two-card hands listed in the table that have a negative expected return?  For example, suited K/2.  Charlie Masterson from Quincy, MA   According to my two-player Texas Hold âEm probabilities , the following are the possible outcomes with suited K/2: Win  51.24% Lose  44.82% Draw  3.94% My table on Ultimate Texas Hold âEm shows that the player has the advantage on the Play bet, but a disadvantage on the Ante and Blind bets.  In this case, the player is stuck with bad odds on the Ante and Blind.  However, his odds are favorable on the Play.  So, by making the maximum raise he is getting the most value out of his better than 50% chance of winning.  The bad odds on the other two bets bring the overall value under 50%.  That value would be even less with  a smaller raise.    In the 2008 World Series of Poker Motoyuki Mabuchi's quad aces were beaten by Justin Phillip's Royal flush.  I have a simple question about the odds of this occurring.  ESPN and others quoted it as 1 in approximately 2.7 billion.  It appears to me that they simply took the published odds of quads occurring, and multiplied them by the odds of a royal flush occurring.  Is this the correct method of calculation?  Wade   I disagree with the 1 in 2.7 billion figure too.  As you said, they seemed to calculate the probabilities independently for each player, for just the case where both players use both hole cards, and multiplied.  Using this method I get a probability of 0.000000000341101, or about in 1 in 2.9 billion.  Maybe the one in 2.7 billion also involves compounding a rounding error on both player probabilities.  They also evidently forgot to multiply the probability by 2, for reasons I explain later.  There are three ways four aces could lose to a royal flush, as follows.  Case 1 :  One player has two to a royal flush, the other has two aces, and the board contains the other two aces, the other two cards to the royal, and any other card.  Example:  Player 1:   Player 2:   Board:       In most poker rooms, to qualify for a bad-beat jackpot, both winning and losing player must make use of both hole cards.  This was also the type of bad beat in the video; in fact, these were the exact cards. Case 2:  One player has two to a royal flush (T-K), the other has one ace and a "blank" card, and the board contains the other three aces and the other two cards to the royal.  Example:  Player 1:   Player 2:   Board:       Case 3:  One player has one to a royal flush (T-K) and a blank card, the other has two aces, and the board contains the other two aces and the other three cards to the royal flush. Example: Player 1:   Player 2:   Board:       The following table shows the number of combinations for each case for both players and the board.  The lower right cell shows the total number of combinations is 16,896.   Bad Beat Combinations    Case  Player 1  Player 2  Board  Product    1  24  3  44  3,168   2  24  132  1  3,168   3  704  3  1  2,112   Total     8,448    However, we could reverse the cards of the two players, and still have a bad beat.  So, we should multiply the number of combinations by 2.  Adjusting for that, the total qualifying combinations is 2 Ã 8,448 = 16,896. The total number of all combinations in two-player Texas Hold âEm is combin (52,2) Ã combin(50,2) Ã combin(48,5) =  2,781,381,002,400.  So, the probability of a four aces losing to a royal flush is 8,448/2,781,381,002,400 =  0.0000000060747, or about 1 in 165 million.  The probability of just a case 1 bad beat is 1 in 439 million.  The simple reason the odds are not as long as reported in that video is that the two hands overlap, with the shared ace.  In other words, the two events are positively correlated. It is my understanding that the "racinos" at Monticello and Yonkers, New York, are known as "Video Lottery Terminals."  I read that they are not true slot/video poker machines, because they do not use a random number generator, but are connected to a central computer in Albany, that controls the outcome of the game.  For example, in video poker if you are initially dealt a four of a kind and you discard them all, it will reappear as a winner, since the central computer was programmed for your machine to get a four of a kind.  Therefore, any strategy is useless.  Is this correct?  You are absolutely right, according to the paper Telling the Truth about New York Video Poker .  The playerâs outcome is indeed predestined.  Regardless of what cards the player keeps, he can not avoid his fate.  If the player tries to deliberately avoid his fate, the game will make use of a guardian angel feature to correct the player's mistake.  I completely agree with the author that such games should warn the player that they are not playing real video poker, and the pay table is a meaningless measure of the player's actual odds.  It also also be noted these kinds of fake video poker machines are not confined to New York.   Hello, I am a seventh grader from Hawaii.  I am doing a science fair project on poker and shuffling.  I am using your charts about the win percentage of pocket Texas Hold âEm hands, according to the number of players in the game.  I was hoping you could answer a few questions that would help me with my project:   How did you come up with the percentages found in the charts? If you used a computer program, how did you develop it and how long did it take? You stated that you started the Wizard of Odds as a hobby.  Did experimenting change as your site became more well-known? Why or why not?  Anonymous    The two-player table was done by a brute-force looping program, that cycled through all 1225 possible opponent cards, and 1,712,304 possible community cards.  For three to eight players, looping would have taken a prohibitive amount of time, so I did a random simulation. I write almost all my programs in C++, including both programs I just mentioned.  The rest are in Java or PERL.  I mostly copied and pasted code from other poker-based programs.  The new code only look about a day to write. Yes, I started my site as a hobby in June 1997.  It wasnât until January 2000 that I accepted advertising, and tried to make a business out of it.  It has gone through three different domains over the years.  Here is what it looked like in May 1999 .  The purpose of the site has always remained the same, a resource for mathematically-based gambling strategy.  Through the years, I have just been adding more games and material.  One experiment was providing my NFL picks for the 2005 season , which was an abject failure.    Hello, Wizard.  I read your Texas Hold âEm questions, and I noticed you calculated a 59.85% chance of seeing an ace or king on the board, while holding pocket Queens.  How did you come up with that figure?  Jacob from Atwater, CA   There are combin (50,5)=2,118,760 combinations of five cards out of the remaining 50 in the deck.  42 of those cards are 2-Q.  The number of combinations of 5 cards out of 42 is combin(42,5)=850,668.  So, the probability of not getting a king or ace is 850,668/2,118,760 = 40.15%.  Thus, the probability of getting at least one ace or king is 1-40.15% = 59.85%. An alternative calculation is 1 - pr(first card in flop is not ace or king) Ã  pr(second card in flop is not ace or king) Ã  pr(third card in flop is not ace or king) Ã  pr(fourth card in flop is not ace or king) Ã  pr(fifth card in flop is not ace or king) = 1 -  (42/50) Ã (41/49) Ã (40/48) Ã (39/47) Ã (38/46) = 59.85%.    Holding two suited cards in Texas Hold âem, what are my odds of getting exactly two more cards of the same suit on the flop?  Jack H. from Duncanville, TX   There are combin (11,2)=55 ways to get two more cards of the same suit, and 39 for the unsuited card.  There are combin(50,3)=19,600 total possible combinations of cards on the flop.  So, the probability of having exactly four to a flush after the flop is 55Ã39/19,600 = 10.94%.    I was involved in a hand of online poker and would like to know the odds of this happening, please:    David T. from Montego Bay  Normally I'm sick of bad beat questions, but this one was too painful to ignore.  Before the first card is dealt, the probability of four kings being beaten by four aces, in a two-player game, with both players having pocket pairs, is 2* combin (4,2)*combin(4,2)*44/(combin(52,2)*combin(50,2)*combin(48,5)) =  2*6*6*44/(1326*1225*1712304) = 1 in 877,961,175.  This was a six-player game, so there are combin(6,2) = 15 different player pairs.  In a six-player game, the probability is 15 times higher, or 1 in 58,530,745.  After the indicated hole cards are dealt, and before the flop, the probability is 1 in 38,916 that the hand will finish as it did.   There is a promotion being advertised by a Las Vegas card room: Make a flush in all four suits and you get $400.  You have to use both of your hole cards, and there is a five-hour time limit.  Assuming 35 hands per hour, and that the clock starts with the first flush, what is the probability of achieving the other three flushes within five hours? Thanks.  Annie   Letâs say your first flush is in spades.  At 35 hands per hour, in five hours 175 hands could be played.  You then have 175 hands to make a flush in hearts, diamonds, and clubs.  Iâm going to assume the player never folds a hand that has a possibility of attaining a flush in one of the suits he needs. The probability of a flush of a specific suit, letâs say hearts, using both hole cards is combin(13,2)Ã[combin(11,3)Ãcombin(39,2) + combin(11,4)Ã39 + combin(11,5)]/(combin(52,2)Ãcombin(50,5)) =  10576566/2809475760=0.003764605. In the next 175 hands the probability of missing a heart flush would be (1-0.003764605) 175 =0.51682599. It would be incorrect to say the probability of failing to make the other three suits would be pr(no heart flush)+pr(no dimaond suit) + pr(no club flush), because you would double counting the probability of faling to make two of them.  So you should add back in pr(no heart or diamond flush) + pr(no heart or club flush) +pr(no club or diamond flush).  However, that would incorrectly over-subtract the probability of not making all three flushes.  So you should add back in pr(no club, diamond, or heart flush). The probability of going 175 hands and never get either of two specific suits is (1-2Ã0.003764605) 175 =0.266442448. The probability of going 175 hands and never getting any of the three suits left is (1-3Ã0.003764605) 175 =0.137015266. So the answer is 1-3Ã0.51682599 + 3Ã0.266442448 - 0.137015266 = 0.111834108. I would like to thank dwheatley for his help with this problem.  It is discussed on my bulletin board at Wizard of Vegas .    Doyle Brunson famously won the Main Event in the World Series of Poker in both 1976 and 1977.  Each time he held 10-2 as hole cards, and both times he made a full house on the river.  What are the odds of that?  Jonathan F.   Given two cards of different ranks, the probability of making a full house are 1 in 121.6.  The odds of making it on the river are 1 in 207. The odds of making such a hand on the river two out of two times is 1 in 43,006. The odds of this happening with the same two starting cards, in rank only, are 1 in 3,564,161. The odds of this happening with exactly 10-2 both times is 1 in 295,379,826.

The term can be used in any form of gambling but is most commonly applied to poker. Many poker rooms offer a progressive jackpot for very unlikely bad beats. Various other rules are added to ensure that only surprising bad beats win. Below I present tables of bad beat probabilities, starting with the most liberal rules, and ending with the most stringent. The most stringent rules, the "Bad Beat Type 3", are the most common, in my experience.  Following are the rules for a type 1 bad beat.  Both the bad beat and winning hand must be the best possible combination of five cards. In cases where the same hand can be created multiple ways (for example player has AK and the board shows AAKKQ) the player's hole cards will take priority. Both the bad beat and winning hand must make use of both hole cards. A full house must be beaten by a four of a kind or higher.   The rules for a type 2 bad beat are the same as type 1, plus any four of a kind, whether the bad beat hand or winning hand, must contain a pocket pair.  The rules for a type 3 bad beat are the same as type 2, plus a full house may not make use of a three of a kind entirely on the board.  In my experience, is the most common format for bad beat rules is type 3. The additional rule for type 3 makes very little difference, compared to type 2.  The following table shows the probability of each bad beat hand under all three types of rules. The table is based on a ten-player game in which nobody ever folds. The probabilities are for any pair of players meeting the qualifying rules. If you want to know YOUR probability of winning, you should divide the probability in the table by 10.

Gambling led to the development of probability theory in the late 1400s. When playing a game with high stakes, players wanted to know what the chance of winning would be. In 1494, Fra Luca Paccioli released his work Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni e proportionalita which was the first written text on probability. Motivated by Paccioliâs work, Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) made further developments in probability theory. His work from 1550, titled Liber de Ludo Aleae , discussed the concepts of probability and how they directly related to gambling. However, his work did not receive any recognition because it was not published until after his death. Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) also contributed to probability theory. His friend, Chevalier de MÃ©rÃ©, was an avid gambler with the goal to become wealthy from it. De MÃ©rÃ© tried a new mathematical approach to a gambling game but did not get the desired results. Determined to know why his strategy was unsuccessful, he consulted with Pascal. Pascalâs work on this problem began an important correspondence between him and fellow mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Communicating through letters, the two continued to exchange their ideas and thoughts. These interactions led to the conception of basic probability theory. To this day, many gamblers still rely on the basic concepts of probability theory in order to make informed decisions while gambling. [1]  [2]  Frequency of 5-card poker hands [ edit ]     A Venn diagram depicting poker hands and their odds from a typical American 9/6 Jacks or Better machine    The following chart enumerates the (absolute) frequency of each hand, given all combinations of 5 cards randomly drawn from a full deck of 52 without replacement. Wild cards are not considered. In this chart:   Distinct hands is the number of different ways to draw the hand, not counting different suits.  Frequency is the number of ways to draw the hand, including the same card values in different suits.  The Probability of drawing a given hand is calculated by dividing the number of ways of drawing the hand ( Frequency ) by the total number of 5-card hands (the sample space ;             (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle \,{\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   ). For example, there are 4 different ways to draw a royal flush (one for each suit), so the probability is 4 / 2,598,960 , or one in 649,740. One would then expect to draw this hand about once in every 649,740 draws, that's nearly 0.000154% of the time.  Cumulative probability refers to the probability of drawing a hand as good as or better than the specified one. For example, the probability of drawing three of a kind is approximately 2.11%, while the probability of drawing a hand at least as good as three of a kind is about 2.87%. The cumulative probability is determined by adding one hand's probability with the probabilities of all hands above it.  The Odds are defined as the ratio of the number of ways not to draw the hand, to the number of ways to draw it. For instance, with a royal flush, there are 4 ways to draw one, and 2,598,956 ways to draw something else (2,598,960 - 4), so the odds against drawing a royal flush are 2,598,956Â : 4, or 649,739Â : 1. The formula for establishing the odds can also be stated as (1/p) - 1Â : 1 , where p is the aforementioned probability.  The values given for Probability , Cumulative probability , and Odds are rounded off for simplicity; the Distinct hands and Frequency values are exact.   The nCr function on most scientific calculators can be used to calculate hand frequencies; entering nCr with 52 and 5 , for example, yields            (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   as above.

It can be formed 4 ways (one for each suit), giving it a probability of 0.000154% and odds of 649,739Â : 1.  When ace-low straights and ace-low straight flushes are not counted, the probabilities of each are reduced: straights and straight flushes each become 9/10 as common as they otherwise would be. The 4 missed straight flushes become flushes and the 1,020 missed straights become no pair.  Note that since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. For example, the hand 3â£ 7â£ 8â£ Qâ  Aâ  is identical to 3â¦ 7â¦ 8â¦ Qâ¥ Aâ¥ because replacing all of the clubs in the first hand with diamonds and all of the spades with hearts produces the second hand. So eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values, there are only 134,459 distinct hands.  The number of distinct poker hands is even smaller. For example, 3â£ 7â£ 8â£ Qâ  Aâ  and 3â¦ 7â£ 8â¦ Qâ¥ Aâ¥ are not identical hands when just ignoring suit assignments because one hand has three suits, while the other hand has only twoâthat difference could affect the relative value of each hand when there are more cards to come. However, even though the hands are not identical from that perspective, they still form equivalent poker hands because each hand is an A-Q-8-7-3 high card hand. There are 7,462 distinct poker hands.  Frequency of 7-card poker hands [ edit ]  In some popular variations of poker, a player uses the best five-card poker hand out of seven cards. The frequencies are calculated in a manner similar to that shown for 5-card hands, except additional complications arise due to the extra two cards in the 7-card poker hand. The total number of distinct 7-card hands is            (    52  7    )     =  133  ,  784  ,  560        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 7}=133,784,560\end{matrix}}}   . It is notable that the probability of a no-pair hand is less than the probability of a one-pair or two-pair hand.  The Ace-high straight flush or royal flush is slightly more frequent (4324) than the lower straight flushes (4140 each) because the remaining two cards can have any value; a King-high straight flush, for example, cannot have the Ace of its suit in the hand (as that would make it ace-high instead).      Hand  Frequency  Probability  Cumulative  Odds    Royal flush  4,324  0.0032%  0.0032%  30,939Â : 1    Straight flush (excl. royal flush)  37,260  0.0279%  0.0311%  3,589.6Â : 1    Four of a kind  224,848  0.168%  0.199%  594Â : 1    Full house  3,473,184  2.60%  2.80%  37.5Â : 1    Flush  4,047,644  3.03%  5.82%  32.1Â : 1    Straight  6,180,020  4.62%  10.4%  20.6Â : 1    Three of a kind  6,461,620  4.83%  15.3%  19.7Â : 1    Two pair  31,433,400  23.5%  38.8%  3.26Â : 1    One pair  58,627,800  43.8%  82.6%  1.28Â : 1    No pair  23,294,460  17.4%  100%  4.74Â : 1    Total  133,784,560  100%  100%  0Â : 1      (The frequencies given are exact; the probabilities and odds are approximate.)  Since suits have no relative value in poker, two hands can be considered identical if one hand can be transformed into the other by swapping suits. Eliminating identical hands that ignore relative suit values leaves 6,009,159 distinct 7-card hands.  The number of distinct 5-card poker hands that are possible from 7 cards is 4,824. Perhaps surprisingly, this is fewer than the number of 5-card poker hands from 5 cards because some 5-card hands are impossible with 7 cards (e.g. 7-high).  Frequency of 5-card lowball poker hands [ edit ]  See also: Lowball (poker)  Some variants of poker, called lowball , use a low hand to determine the winning hand. In most variants of lowball, the ace is counted as the lowest card and straights and flushes don't count against a low hand, so the lowest hand is the five-high hand A-2-3-4-5 , also called a wheel . The probability is calculated based on            (    52  5    )     =  2  ,  598  ,  960        {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{52 \choose 5}=2,598,960\end{matrix}}}   , the total number of 5-card combinations.

(50.7%)  If aces are not low, simply rotate the hand descriptions so that 6-high replaces 5-high for the best hand and ace-high replaces king-high as the worst hand.

The table does not extend to include five-card hands with at least one pair. Its "Total" represents 95.4% of the time that a player can select a 5-card low hand without any pair.

I was playing a NLHE tourney on pokerstars earlier tonight (UK) and I lost to quad queens after I had flopped quad jacks.  The flop came QJJ - I check and he checks behind - turn comes Q - he bets - I raise - he pushes - I snap call and the river comes Q - he turns over Q9  Either way it was a pretty damn bad beat.  I checked the odds out and got the following as indicated below.  Has anyone else on here ever lost to higher quads?  probability of first person being dealt a pair is (78/1326). Probability of 2nd person making a different pair is now (72/1225). After being dealt these pairs, the probability of dealing quads over quads by the river is (2/48)(1/47)(2/46)(1/45)(44/44)(120). The reason you multiply by 120 is because the since we're seeing it to the river, the order in which the cards doesn't matter. There are 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120 different ways of dealing those particular 5 cards.  So the probability of being dealt quads over quads in a pair vs pair situation is (78/1326)(72/1225)(2/48)(1/47)(2/46)(1/45)(44/44)(120) ~ 0.00003555%  Probability of getting dealt a non pair hand is (1248/1326). The probability of getting dealt a pp that doesn't match a card from the first hand is (66/1225). The probability of dealing quads over quads by the river is (2/48)(1/47)(3/46)(2/45)(1/44)(120) So the probability of being dealt quads over quads in a pair vs non pair situation is (1248)(1326)(66/1225)(2/48)(1/47)(3/46)(2/45)(1/44)(120) ~ 0.00003555% Same as pair vs pair. This should not come as a surprise since we're seeing all 7 cards.  So the probability of being dealt quads is 0.00003555 + 0.00003555 = 0.0000711% This translates to about 1,406,988.063 - 1 odds  Cheers             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                             Farrellwannabe    0    Grand master        Members    0   950 posts           Posted December 11, 2009 Â· Report post      ouch             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                             Farrellwannabe    0    Grand master        Members    0   950 posts           Posted December 11, 2009 Â· Report post      side bet 100000000000000000 that was on full tilt             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                             iatrest    0    Member        Members    0   210 posts           Posted December 11, 2009 Â· Report post      You aren't calculating the odds right. Once one person has quads the odds are 1:1. It is true preflop those are the odds, so those are the odds it will happen on any specific hand. Here is my own  bad beat story with the same odds. I had AA flop 8A8 turn 2 river 2 Opp turns over 22 ftw the odds in this case are the same b/c we had our opponents drawing as slim as possible post-flop, which is drawing to a 2-outer followed by a 1-outer. The odds of this are 2/47*1/46 which is about .1%. So it is more like 1-in a thousand post flop than 1 in 1.4 mil. Hope this helps and trust me you aren't running as bad as me... last two tourneys I lost with JJ vs JT to a straight and AA vs A3 to a str8 so..... keep your chin up.. i guess:hehe:             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                             samboyyy    0    Master        Members    0   620 posts           Posted December 11, 2009 Â· Report post      1 outer. if that happened in my casino, you get a bad beat jackpot. well everyone has those sick bad beats. mine was just full house vs full house, the river gave my opponent the better full house, 2 outer though. sick beat for you, sick sick no bad beat jackpot from quads vs quads?

Have learnt to play within my BR so those silly beats don't become too damaging.  I think that's clearly the key for long term success, no matter how big or small.

And also from all the online poker rooms to choose from that you both decided to play on pokerstars, and the probability of you existing in the same universe in the same time e t c  It was an interesting way of complaining about a bad beat though. Lick it up, its poker.

A buddy this year day 3 of WSOP Main Event, KK v. AA all in pre with a KKx flop, A turn A river, .1%! I think I would have to quit for a year minimum after I **** my pants at the table.

Once one person has quads the odds are 1:1. It is true preflop those are the odds, so those are the odds it will happen on any specific hand. Here is my own  bad beat story with the same odds.  I had AA  flop 8A8  turn 2 river 2  Opp turns over 22 ftw  the odds in this case are the same b/c we had our opponents drawing as slim as possible post-flop, which is drawing to a 2-outer followed by a 1-outer. The odds of this are 2/47*1/46 which is about .1%. So it is more like 1-in a thousand post flop than 1 in 1.4 mil. Hope this helps and trust me you aren't running as bad as me... last two tourneys I lost with JJ vs JT to a straight and AA vs A3 to a str8 so..... keep your chin up.. i guess:hehe: +1            Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                             I AM The Truth    0    Member        Members    0   191 posts           Posted December 12, 2009 Â· Report post      If it was on full tilt then the odds of your opponent hitting quads are hugely reduced because of the likelyhood of an action flop but must admit they done themselves proud with this one.

I made a straight flush in an omaha tourney with 45 of hearts vs quads and the idiot never raised one time - we both had about 150 big blinds. I am sure it was a bot based on previous play etc.... it was a 10 dollar buy in with about 1500 for 1st place - flop 3 6 7 hearts turn 7  river king - he never put a chip in the pot other than to call and yes I bet every street but with it being pot limit I could have made about 100k more versus a living breathing opponent...........................  Also, I almost lost a finger trying to eat a chocolate chip cookie in the Bellagio poker room when Jimmy Fricke inhaled it from across the room             Share this post   Link to post   Share on other sites                                             stevel999    0    Newbie       Members    0   3 posts           Posted December 12, 2009 (edited)
			
			
			
				Â· Report post      Lord-Orca. This is actually the unluckiest you can get in Holdem. That is, the situation where there are 2 cards to come, there are 2 outs  and the villain has to hit both. The exact probability is 0.0816326% = odds of 1 in 1224.  Not your one in 1.4 million !, but yes a bad beat.

				Â· Report post      I lost with Quad queens once...  It was in 2006, and i was heads up for a 10k wsop seat!  I had 2 red queens and the flop came Qs Qc 9c  I check he bets like half of his stack which was something like 30k if i can remember correctly all the details of the hand.  I use all my time then shove in the last few seconds, he calls and heres the gazillion to one bad beat.  He was holding A 10 of clubs turn came 8c river Jc  Happy Hannika.

He seems to be really good in math and could probally do everything that site can do on his fingers.
