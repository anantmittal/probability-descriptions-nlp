The popular book, What to
Expect when Youre Expecting, for example, portrays epidurals as
perfectly safe. The risks, however, may be greatly underplayed.  N ote: This is a site in progress.  We are interested in detailing all the risks of epidural anesthesia for childbirth.  There is currently a selection bias toward the risks.  We welcome all readers to send us studies about epidurals regardless of the results, so that we can continue to work toward a balanced  site.  Our bias is that epidurals have risks and that these risks are under-communicated to women, and that true informed consent is not given.    Epidurals and Pain Relief  For the most part, epidural analgesia
does effectively relieve labor
pain. 1 Obstetrical
anesthesiologists continue to state that epidural
analgesia has other, potentially catastrophic, adverse effects but,
with safe clinical practice, these problems are extremely rare. We
will suggest in the material that follows that these complications
are not extremely rare, and that women are not receiving adequate
informed consent about what these complications are and their
accompanying frequency. Nor are they being offered any serious
alternatives to epidural anesthesia. Despite this, anesthesiologists
such as Eberle and Norris argue that specific anaesthetic techniques
... or obstetrical management can limit or eliminate these risks of
epidural labour analgesia. What must be remembered for any technical
procedure, is that it is studied in major academic centers where
highly skilled professors supervise residents and all outcomes are
monitored closely. The actual practice, however, takes place in
smaller institutions by less qualified individuals so that the actual
complication rates of any procedure (obstetric, cardiac, pulmonary)
are always higher than what are found in studies.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]      Overall Complications Rates for Epidural Anesthesia  A general estimate of the overall complication rate of epidural anesthesia is 23%. 2   1. Effects of epidurals on cesarean rate: When the dose is too large or when it sinks down into the sacral ("tailbone") region of the body, the perineum and the vagina are anesthetized. Anesthetic is
intentionally injected into this area late in labor to deaden all
sensation. When it "accidentally" happens earlier in labor, the
muscles of the pelvic floor are prematurely relaxed, thereby
interfering with the normal flexion and rotation of the baby's head
as it passes through the birth canal. This interference can lead to
abnormal presentations which are more dangerous for the baby or to
what is called "failure to descend," an indication for Cesarean
birth. Thorp, et al 3 studied 711
consecutive nulliparous women at term, with cephalic fetal
presentations and spontaneous onset of labor. They compared 447
patients who received epidural analgesia in labor with 264 patients
who received either narcotics or no analgesia. The incidence of cesarean section for dystocia was significantly greater (p <
0.005) in the epidural group (10.3%) than in the nonepidural group
(3.8%). There remained a significantly increased incidence (p <
0.005) of cesarean section for dystocia in the epidural group after
selection bias was corrected and the following confounding variables
were controlled by multivariate analysis: maternal age, race,
gestational age, cervical dilatation on admission, use of oxytocin,
duration of oxytocin use, maximum infusion rate of oxytocin, duration
of labor, presence of meconium, and birth weight. The incidence of cesarean section for fetal distress was similar (p > 0.20) in both
groups. There were no clinically significant differences in frequency
of low Apgar scores at 5 minutes or cord arterial and venous blood
gas parameters between the two groups. They concluded that epidural
analgesia in labor increases the incidence of cesarean section for
dystocia in nulliparous women. Frequently the epidural is so effective that it eliminates uterine
contractions. The nerves which tell the uterus to contract are all
anesthetized. The uterus becomes quiet and must be driven artificially
with the hormone oxytocin (Pitocin or Syntocinon). As the cervix becomes fully dilated and the head descends, the woman
(in a normal birth) feels pain and pressure in the lower pelvis and
rectum. The last injection of anesthetic during the process of
epidural anesthesia occurs after the head has rotated and come down
onto the perineum. Higher concentrations of anesthetic are used to
assure perineal relaxation. Sometimes the mother is sat upright or at
least at a 45 degree angle to be certain that the anesthetic will
descend to the sacral nerve roots. When the sacral nerve roots are
blocked, the woman looses the urge to push. After controlling for potentially confounding variables with multiple logistic regression analysis, Adashek, et al 4 found that epidural anesthesia was an independent risk factor for cesarean birth among women over age 35 (R = 0.195, p < 0.001). At the 1997 meeting of the American Society for Anesthesiology, a
press release was issued about four studies involving a combined
total of more than 22,000 women claiming that labor epidural
analgesia does not increase a woman's risk of having a cesarean
delivery. 5 Three of the studies were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of
Anesthesiologists. The fourth appeared in the September 1997 issue of
the medical journal of Anesthesiology. The findings have significant implications for physicians,
patients and insurers, said one of the researchers, Steven T.
Fogel, M.D., an anesthesiologist at Washington University School of
Medicine in St. Louis. "Some physicians and insurance companies limit
patient access to epidurals because they strongly believe that
epidurals can prolong labor, "Dr. Fogel said. "Delaying or
withholding an epidural forces the pregnant woman to suffer
needlessly and does not lower the cesarean rate." Each year, about one-million women choose epidural blocks for safe and effective pain relief during labor. A study by Dr. Fogel and colleagues at Washington University analyzed
labor and delivery data on 7,000 patients. The researchers compared
the cesarean rates among first-time mothers during the 12 months
before and the 16 months after epidural analgesia became available on
request at the hospital. They found no significant differences in
cesarean section rates before and after the services introduction.
"Epidural analgesia did not stop normal labor or cause cesarean
deliveries, because the rate of cesareans did not change," Dr. Fogel
said. Women may still require cesarean delivery following epidural blocks,
but no direct cause-and-effect relationship has ever been
established. "labor epidural anlagesia can be associated with , but
does not cause, cesarean section delivery," Dr Fogel said. "An
abnormal labor can produce extreme pain for mothers, and this pain
leads women to ask for epidurals," he said. "Our study has the advantage of following cesarean rates before and
after the introduction of a popular epidural service," Dr Fogel said.
"Since patient demographics and cesarean section rates did not
change, we can safely and accurately conclude that the total number
of cesarean deliveries performed was not affected by the
availability of epidural analgesia." Similar findings emerged from an analysis of data on more than 13,000
first-time mothers who gave birth between 1989 and 1995 at St. Luke's
Roosevelt Hospital Center, a teaching hospital of Columbia University
in New York City. The analysis showed that the mother's age, the baby's birth weight and
use of the labor-inducing drug oxytocin increased the women's risk
for cesarean sections. "Not only was epidural analgesia not a
significant risk factor but it was associated with slightly decreased
cesarean section delivery risk." anesthesiologist David J. Birnbach,
M.D., said. By relieving pain, epidural analgesia may help some patients relax
and this realization could facilitate labor, Dr. Birnbach said. "We're
not suggesting the technique will prevent cesarean sections," he
stressed, "but in our practice, epidurals are clearly not a cause."
In addition, the use of epidural analgesia almost doubled at the
hospital during the five years studied (from 37% to 68%) but the
percentage of cesarean sections deliveries did not increase, Dr.
Birnbach said. A third study at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
reviewed the labor and delivery records of more than 2300 women who
received ultra-low dose solutions of epidural medications. The
ultra-low dose epidurals allow many women's labor to proceed
comfortable, Stephen D. Pratt, M.D., said. For women requiring more
pain relief, additional medication can be given by the same epidural
route. The Boston study showed that women who needed additional pain relief
beyond the ultra-low dose were more likely to have cesareans. Women
who needed more than two additional doses were twice as likely to
require a cesarean section as those who do not. "The slow, abnormal
labor that leads to cesarean section is more painful than normal
labor and therefore requires stronger epidural medication," Dr Pratt
said. "Epidural do not cause cesarean sections. Rather women who have
abnormal labor may be in more pain and therefore are more likely to
need an epidural and stronger medication." The above three studies were retrospective studies done in choice
situations/hospitals that had actively taken a new approach to
reducing cesarean sections as well as hospitals that maintain such
high cesarean section rates that the comparisons would be
insignificant due to cesarean rates of over 30%. The only prospective study was the fourth one, conducted at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in
Dallas. 6 Seven hundred, fifteen
women of mixed parity in spontaneous labor at full term were randomly
assigned to receive either epidural anesthesia (EA) or
patient-controlled intravenous meperidine analgesia (PCMA). Epidural
analgesia was maintained with a continous infusion of 0.125%
bupivacaine with 2 pg/ml fentanyl. Patient controlled analgesia was
maintained as 10-15 mg meperidine given every 10 minutes as desired
by the patient using a patient-controlled pump. A total of 358 women were randomized to receive epidural anesthesia
and 243 (68%) complied. Similarly, 357 women were randomized to
receive patient-controlled analgesia, and 259 (73%) complied with
that protocol. Five women randomized to PCMA requested epidurals.
Based upon an intent to treat analysis, there was no difference in
the rate of cesarean deliveries between the two groups (EA, 4%, 95%
CI: 1.9-6.2%; PCMA, 5%, 95% CI: 2.6-7.2%. Women in the epidural group
reported lower pain scores during labor and delivery. What is amazing is that this study was used to argue that epidurals
did not increase risk for cesarean birth. What is lacking, of course,
is a reasonable control group, such as a doula. When one looks at the
amazingly high amounts of meperidine that women could
self-administer, it is no wonder that so few requested an epidural,
since they could hardly be expected to be very alert. A woman could
receive 90 mg of meperidine per hour. In actuality, the average amount
of meperidine a woman self-administered was 200 mg with the highest
amount being 500 mg. To give a sense of the amounts being given here,
routinely in the emergency department, for treating ureterolithiasis
(kidney stones), which most women agree is a more severe pain than
labor, I would rarely administer more than 150 to 200 mg of
meperidine over 12 hours. The average length of labor during which
these women received their meperidine was under 12 hours. No one has
asked the question of how such a massive dose of meperidine would
affect the cesarean rate. The authors stated, "Patient-Controlled intravenous analgesia is
widely used in the United States to manage postoperative pain,
although use during childbirth has been limited. One concern is
newborn respiratory depression from increased narcotic administration
to the mother. Many women in our study used more than 200 mg of
meperidine during the course of their labor, but only 3.4% of infants
were given naloxone to reverse respiratory depression. The mothers
were visibly sedated but were invariably arousable and none
experienced respiratory depression."  Since neither of us have never had to give an infant naloxone in over 1000 deliveries, we wonder what the indications would actually be. We suspect these infants were quite depressed to receive naloxone. Our experience with patient controlled analgesia is that the reason the patient stops pushing the button is that she gets so high a dose that she falls asleep. I suspect the mothers were more compromised than the authors think, but none had to be intubated or artificially ventilated, therefore, none experience respiratory depression. The authors also under-emphasized the fact that all patients were
enrolled at the same time in an aggressive program to reduce cesarean
birth, consisting of:   No use of electronic fetal monitoring, even for epidurals (except
for one test strip on admission), thereby necessitating nurse
auscultation of the fetal heart rate and one-on-one patient care,
both well known to reduce
the cesarean rate.  No patient admitted to the hospital before 4-5 cm of cervical
dilation, also known to lower the cesarean rate.  No drugs or epidurals until the woman was 5 cm dilated, also known
to reduce the cesarean rate.  All births attended by CNMs, which is known to reduce the cesarean
rate by one-third of what obstetricians would do. For example, a
study from Los Angeles County-USC Hospital showed a 4% cesarean rate
in a 95% Hispanic population when they were attended by
nurse-midwives. 7  Use of a black and Hispanic population. In an editorial
discussion, the authors, themselves, comment on black and Hispanic
populations having historically lower cesarean rates.   The authors' real conclusions are this: If you do everything possible
to reduce the cesarean rate for all patients, and then, if you
compare epidural anesthesia with high dose, self-administered
narcotic analgesia, there is no difference in the cesarean rate. This
is not really a very outstanding conclusion, though the popular press
read this result as saying epidural anesthesia is now proven safe and
unlikely to increase the cesarean rate (without addressing the
question, over what? Some infants (0.8%) in the epidural group also required naloxone. Two
transfers to NICU occurred in the epidural group and 3 in PCMA
group. Looking just at those who had epidurals vs. those who didn't,
epidurals prolonged the first stage of labor and increased the
incidence of oxytocin administration. Fever developed in more women
during epidural anesthesia. There was no difference in the number of
cesareans in the epidural vs. the PCIA group (the range from 3% to 7%
cesarean rate). Regarding other complications, 24% of women having epidurals had
fever compared to 6% in PCMA. Nine percent had forceps with epidural
compared to 3% with PCMA. There was a15-19% range of meconium during
labor (not different between groups), which we find rather high.
There was a rate of 1.2-1.8% of infants suffering meconium aspiration
(not different between groups), but also rather high in our
experience.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   2. Significant Low Blood Pressure (Hypotension): Significant low blood pressure is a complication of epidural anesthesia. 1 The ways that epiduralized patients must lie accentuate this. Their position is limited since they are essentially paralyzed people for the duration of the epidural. Hypotension occurs among almost one-third of patients with serious hypotension occurring about 12% of the time. 8  Maternal hypotension is a major risk for the baby. The epidural
blocks the nerves which regulate blood pressure. It causes the blood
in the body to pool, keeping it from being pumped around the body in
the proper manner. The arteries dilate and relax their usual,
necessary level of tension, making it difficult for the heart to pump
blood to the baby. These changes lead to a decrease in the output of
the mothers heart. Less blood per unit time can reach the placenta
and therefore the baby. The baby is completely dependent on the mothers heart to pump blood
to the placenta to satisfy its needs. All of its oxygen comes across
from the placenta. All of the food for its brain and other organs
comes across the placenta. Brains cannot live without a relatively
constant supply of oxygen and glucose. Without this they become
damaged. A good blood flow is needed to the uterus between contractions so it
can get fresh oxygen. During the contraction, blood flow to the
uterus is cut off by the muscles contracting. When the contraction
stops, the uterus must quickly refill with fresh blood containing
oxygen for the baby. If the amount of blood flowing to the uterus is
reduced, the baby may not be able to get the oxygen it needs. Then
what is called fetal distress may occur. The baby's system does not
get enough oxygen and goes into distress. Its blood retains excess
acid, the oxygen levels go low and tissues and vital organs begin to
fail from excess acid, lack of oxygen and lack of fuel. Animal studies have shown that lack of oxygen to the baby (called fetal hypoxia) can cause significant damage to the babys brain even without the pH of the baby's umbilical cord blood being
affected. 9 (The pH of the babys umbilical cord blood at birth is usually used as an indicator of whether or not fetal hypoxia has occurred.) Severe low blood pressure can also result from compression of
the mothers blood vessels (aorta and vena cava) since all mothers
must lie essentially flat on their back after epidural anesthesia
(they cannot feel or move their back, pelvis and
legs). 10   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   3. Fetal Distress: Fetal heart rate decelerations can occur
following the use of epidurals. 1 Babies can develop fetal
distress after epidural
anesthesia. 11 This may be caused
by the mothers blood pressure getting so low that blood cannot be
adequately pumped into the uterus to deliver oxygen to the baby. As
we mentioned above, epidurals make it difficult for the muscles in
the arteries of the lower body to respond and to keep blood
adequately flowing through the body. The ability of the heart to
respond to changing needs of the body is
impaired. 12 Eberle and
Norris 1 suggest that [i]nduction of maternal analgesia may
transiently alter the balance between factors encouraging and
discouraging uterine contraction. A temporary increase in the
uterotonic effects of endogenous or exogenous oxytocin may then
produce a tetanic contraction with subsequent decrease fetal oxygen
delivery and resultant fetal bradycardia. Most babies of mothers receiving epidural anesthesia develop episodes of slow heart rate (bradycardia). 13 While this does not usually affect the healthy baby, it can be disastrous for the baby that is already compromised from some other problem (often unknown to the doctors). Adverse effects on the baby indicative of insufficient oxygen
reaching the baby (late decelerations) can occur. These changes may
also result from a toxic effect to the baby of the local anesthetic
given in the epidural. The transient low blood pressure which always occurs after epidural anesthesia has been found to lead to significantly lower the baby's blood pH. 14 This indicates excess blood acid, usually meaning that the baby is not getting enough oxygen. Anesthesiologists dont think that this makes any difference in the baby's outcome, but we suspect, if we studied babies already at risk for other reasons, we would find that epidural significantly worsens compromised babies and may lead to a Cesarean birth when the baby might have otherwise tolerated a vaginal birth. We suspect that more detailed research would identify a group of babies who would have tolerated unmedicated, normal birth, but who are unable to handle the added stress of the epidural, leading in the worst causes to death or permanent disability.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   4. IV Cannulation: Accidental injection of the anesthetic
solution into the blood stream can occur and can cause the mother to
twitch, have convulsions, or lose of consciousness. Seizures
can occur from the toxic effects of the anesthetic agent entering the
blood stream. 15 Local
anesthetic toxicity occurred among 12 women in 1000
epidurals. 16   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   5. Trauma to Blood Vessels: Trauma to blood vessels can occur as a result of epidural anesthesia. 17 In one study, bleeding
in the spinal column and unintentional placement of the catheter into
an artery or vein occurred 0.67% of the time (67 women of every 1000
epidurals). 18 The catheter
actually escapes outside of where it is supposed to go 1 to 6% of the
time. 19  Hemorrhages can occur around the spinal cord and even within the
skull following epidural
anesthesia. 20 These were
associated with persistent backaches or headaches. Failure to treat
these problems usually results in permanent paralysis. Surgery must
be performed within 8 hours of the onset of paralysis or the
prognosis is poor. Chronic subdural hematoma has resulted from
epidural anesthesia and has even presented as post-partum
psychosis. 21   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   6. Punctured Dura: The actual dura may be punctured as a result of epidural anesthesia. Because of the large size of the
needle used, severe headache may also result. Dural punctures have been
found to occur about 1.8% of the
time. 22 Unintentional dural
puncture occurred in 61 of 1000 epidurals in a University
hospital (resulting in spinal
anesthesia). 23   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   7. Infection: An infection can develop at the site of
injection. Bacterial meningitis can occur from contamination
during placement of the
epidural. 24 An abscess can also form
at the site where the epidural catheter is
placed. 25  26   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   8. Backache: Backache after an epidural is a common complication. Back pain
commonly occurs after epidural anesthesia (18.9% of the
time 27 ). Upper back pain can
happen at some distance from the site where the epidural is
injected. 28 The back pain can
last very long-term. 29 Nineteen
percent of women had long-term backache after epidural
anesthesia. 30 It probably
results from a combination of its effects on the nerves and from
extreme postures and stretching that occurs after the epidural during
labor. Low back pain after epidural anesthesia for childbirth is also frequently
mentioned. 31   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   9. Broken catheters: Occasionally the catheter has
broken and a small piece is left in place. It usually causes no
ill effects.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   10. Abnormal Uterine Contractions: Uterine contractions can become weaker and less frequent.
An oxytocin infusion is then necessary to improve labor and produce
good strength contractions Mothers having epidurals have longer
labors and have a higher incidence of the use of oxytocin than
mothers having non-medicated
deliveries. 32  There are important risks of giving oxytocin also. Administration of
this hormone to the mother during labor can cause:    Dangerously high blood pressure. Abnormal heart rhythms. Nausea and vomiting. Sustained uterine contractions which last too long and result in the baby going into distress from lack of oxygen. When this is too severe, the uterus can rupture. The epidural can mask the strength of the uterine contractions so that no one knows that how strong they are, making uterine rupture more possible. Hemorrhage around the brain. Retention of water leading to convulsions and coma. Bleeding in the pelvis and increased incidence of postpartum hemorrhage. Death of the baby. Jaundice of the baby.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   11. Second Stage Labor Effects: With large doses the patient
loses the desire and the ability to bear down and push. This results
in an increased use of forceps and vacuum extractions over women
having unmedicated
deliveries. 33   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   12. Inadequate Pain Relief: The epidural is generally
inadequate 7.1% of the time, leading to supplementation with
intravenous pain medication 4.0% of the time and a general anesthetic
3.1% of the time (in one
study). 34   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   13. Accidental Spinal Anesthesia: When an epidural
accidentally turns into a spinal anesthetic, many complications can
occur:    Postspinal headaches. Dysfunction of the bladder is frequent Occasionally numbness and tingling (paresthesias) of the lower limbs and abdomen develop, and sometimes there is a temporary loss or diminution of sensation in these areas. Unilateral footdrop (paralysis of the muscle that lifts the foot) has occurred. Permanent nerve damage (conditions called chronic, progressive adhesive arachnoiditis or transverse myelitis) can occur. These lead to paralysis of the lower parts of the body. Deaths have been reported. Difficult breathing Increased incidence of forceps deliveries.   The reliability of spinal anesthesia with 5% hyperbaric lignocaine
was studied among 30 patients undergoing elective Cesarean. Twelve
patients had hypotension and four developed severe postspinal
headaches. The block progressed to the C2 dermatome in four patients
and was associated with dysphagia. This was totally unpredicted and
was thought due to altered cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in late
pregnancy. 35   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   14. Maternal Heart Attack or Spinal Cord Ischemia: The lack of
ability of the heart to pump blood around the body (from low blood
pressure or pooling of blood) can become so severe that a heart
attack occurs or the spinal cord will suffer damage from not enough
blood reaching it. 36   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   15. Asthmatics: Asthmatics can get suddenly worse during epidural
anesthesia 37 with more wheezing
and inability to breath.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   16. Medication interactions: A hidden danger of epidural anesthesia is its interaction with
medications (prostaglandins) commonly used to soften the cervix
and start labor. The use of prostaglandins is common at hospitals
and creates a potentially dangerous situation in which the
usual medications used to treat low blood pressure during
labor will no longer work. 38   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   17. Interactions Occur with Other Illnesses: As an example, women who have
migraines can have more visual disturbances after
epidurals. 39   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   18. Maternal Fever & Malignant Hyperthermia: Maternal fever and even the severe condition called
malignant hyperthermia (dangerously high fever) can
result. 40  41   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   19. Respiratory Arrests: Mothers can stop breathing
(respiratory arrest) 42  43 and can experience other
breathing difficulties. 44 Greenhalgh * reported a 19 year old obstetric patient who
had a respiratory arrest shortly after receiving intrathecal
sufentanil and bupivacaine as part of a combined epidural/spinal
technique for pain relief.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   20. Other Neurological Disabilties: Other neurological disabilities (including a condition
called Horners syndrome) can develop along with hoarseness
(from even just one dose of epidural
anesthetic). 45 Clayton 46 reported an incidence
of Horner's syndrome during epidural anesthesia for elective
Caesarean section of 4%. The incidence of Horner's syndrome with
epidural anesthesia for vaginal delivery was 1.33%. They found it
impossible to predict which patients would develop a Horner's
syndrome. Even the nerves to the face can be blocked, sometimes
temporarily, sometimes
permanently. 47 Tremors and
shakes can occur. 48  49  Paresthesias (persistent tingling from sensory nerves)
occurred in 0.16% of patients in one study (1.6 per 1000) with an
incidence of persistent neuropathy of 0.04% (4 per
10,000). 50 Four of these
patients had a neuropathy which eventually resolved. In another study
3.0% of patients had tingling of the hands or fingers, while 26 of
almost 5000 women had persistent tingling or numbness in the lower
back, buttocks or legs. 51  Dizziness and fainting can become a problem after epidurals. One
study found these symptoms persisting in 2.1% of
women. 52   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   21. Nausea and Vomiting: Twenty to 30 percent of women
experience nausea after epidural anesthesia, while 3 to 7% have
vomiting. 53   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   22. Allergic Conditions: A dangerous allergic condition with shock (called
anaphylaxis) can occur. 54 The
woman develops a red rash (erythema), itches, and her lungs fill up
with fluid (pulmonary edema). Excessive lung fluid is also found in
the babies in these cases. 55   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   23. Heart Problems: Mothers can experience excessively slow heart rates
(bradycardia), heart block in which the electrical activity of the
chambers of the heart become dissociated and sometimes even stoppage
of the heart (cardiac
arrest). 56   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   24. Headache: Headache after epidural is a persistent problem that is
more pronounced in younger
patients. 57 One study found its
incidence after epidural anesthesia to be 4.6%, significantly more
often than women not having
epidurals. 58 It usually occurs
from the effects of puncturing the dura. Headache can also occur from
air getting into the spinal fluid (called an iatrogenic
pneumocephalus). The air is introduced into the spinal fluid and
column when the test dose is given that is assumed to be in the
extra-dural space. When the person giving the epidural feels a loss
of resistance to the injection of air, this is when a pneumocephalus
can occur. The patient that was described complained immediately of
severe headache on both sides of her forehead followed by vomiting.
The baby had to be delivered by Cesarean with general anesthesia. The
patients headache resolved in 24 hours after Cesarean. Of 34 women with spinal headache (from 4766 epidurals), nine had
long-term disability from headache. Five of these were from
accidental dural puncture and four occurred after accidental spinal
block. 59   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   25. Motor Blockade: Epidural anesthesia can produce motor
blockade, resulting in temporary paralysis, even of respiratory
muscles. 60   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   26. Use in VBAC: Epidurals are sometimes used with women
desiring VBAC. Leung, et al. 61 studied the maternal and fetal consequences of uterine rupture during
VBAC. They concluded that significant neonatal morbidity occurred
when > or = 18 minutes elapsed between the onset of prolonged
deceleration and delivery. In 106 cases of uterine rupture at their
institution between Jan 1, 1983 and June 30, 1992, seven charts
were incomplete and excluded; of the remainder, 28 patients had
complete, 13 patients had partial, and 58 patients had no fetal
extrusion into the maternal abdomen. Maternal characteristics or
intrapartum events were not predictive of the catastrophic extent of
uterine rupture. There was one maternal death. Complete fetal
extrusion was associated with a higher incidence of perinatal
mortality and morbidity.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   27. Technical Considerations: Epidural anesthesia is a technical procedure that requires
significant skill to place correctly. Many papers document the
technical aspects of this procedure which are not insignificant. For
example, 23% of epidural catheters inserted more than 2 cm into the
epidural space required manipulation. Epidural catheters inserted 8
cm within the epidural space were more likely to result in iv
cannulation. Epidural catheters inserted 2 cm within the epidural
space were more likely to become dislodged. Epidural catheters
inserted 2 to 4 cm within the epidural space required replacement
more often than catheters inserted deeper. 62   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   28. Herpes Simplex Assocation: Epidural analgesia is
associated with recurrence of herpes simplex blepharitis after
cesarean section when epidural morphine is
given. 63    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Case Examples (Mild Problems) Here is an example of a 30 year old woman having her first baby who was admitted to the hospital
at 2 cm dilation at 11:05 pm. 64 By 4:30 am, she was 4 cm dilated with her waters broken and requested
epidural anesthesia. Her mother and her husband were in attendance coaching her. The epidural was started at 5:01 am and within 30 seconds, the patients heart rate began to climb steadily and precipitously from 88 to 174, levelling off at that rate.  The certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) discovered that the
patient had previously experienced heart palpitations: when stressed
or with heavy exercise. She had begun to feel mild nausea and
dizziness. Oxygen was administered and an iv drug (adenosine) was
given. A second dose followed five minutes later. The abnormal heart
rate (a supraventricular tachycardia) returned to normal and the
woman had a normal vaginal delivery within 6 hours of this episode.
This occurred presumable from a sensitivity to medication placed
through the epidural catheter. When complications such as this occur,
fetal scalp electrodes are usually placed to monitor the baby's EKG.
The therapy sometimes causes severe hypotension. A case has been reported in which a 24 year old woman with a past
history of mild backache had an epidural anesthesia. She had an acute
vagal reaction with loss of consciousness and her head falling
forward. Thirty-six hours later, she complained of severe pains all
over her spine, together with sciatica and spasm of the muscles on
either side of the spinal column (paravertebral muscles). None of
these symptoms responded to drug treatment. The pain eventually
disappeared after she wore a cervical collar, taking
anti-inflammatory drugs and having spinal manipulations (what
chiropractors and osteopaths do) It was thought that her backache was
due to what is called a posterior articular joint syndrome in which
the forward fall of her head strained the posterior joints of the
spinal column. 65    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Permanent Disability from Epidural Anesthesia  a. A disabling condition called spinal arachnoiditis can
develop after epidural anesthesia. Of 6 such women, 3 were
permanently confined to a wheelchair three years after their initial
evaluation. 66 None of these
patients had any prior spinal surgery or trauma or problems with the
spinal cord including previous hemorrhage, infections or other known
causes of arachnoiditis. They had no neurological symptoms prior to
epidural anesthesia. The diagnosis was confirmed by a medical test
called myelography in all cases. The epidurals were uneventful and
performed according to standard methods. Arachnoiditis is probably caused from the epidural injection of
foreign substances (the anesthetic itself or contaminants in the
solution) into the spinal canal. Subarachnoid cysts can occur in the spine from arachnoiditis produced
from the epidural
anesthetic. 67   b. Paralysis can occur. 68 The injection of the local anesthetic into the epidural space can
result in the veins becoming engorged, the spinal cord suffering from
a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and the woman developing acute
neurological problems. Some of these deficits can become
permanent. 69 Paralysis can also
occur from bleeding into the area during the epidural injection with
the formation of a pocket of blood pressing on the spinal cord
(hematoma). It can also occur from infection or trauma. Cranial nerve paralysis can occur at quite a distance from the site
of the epidural. This is thought to occur from traction on the spinal
cord. 70  Paralysis can occur from a condition called anterior spinal artery
syndrome after epidural anesthesia during
labor. 71 Paralysis can occur
when the blood flow to the spinal cord becomes so limited that tissue
dies. This is called an infarction. A case report of an infarction
after epidural anesthesia has been published in which leg paralysis
occurred and did not recover. A loss of sensation to pain and
temperature also occurred to the level of the mid-chest which
partially resolved. 72  Of 108 non-fatal complications in one study, five were associated
with permanent disability. 73 These included damage (neuropathy) to a single spinal nerve, acute
toxicity from the local anesthetic, and problems associated with
accidental puncture of the dura to become a spinal anesthetic. Another patient developed paralysis after epidural anesthesia
probably due to the anterior spinal artery or central arteries being
blocked during the epidural and leading to death of part of the
spinal cord. 74  Neuropathy is a condition in which sensory changes occur (loss
of sensation or hypersensitivity to sensation) with or without
chronic pain. Neuropathy occurs after epidural anesthesia. It can
occur from thrombosis of an artery from trauma from the epidural
injection or from the catheter. A lack of adequate blood flow (and
therefore oxygen) is called ischemia. This can cause neuropathy
also. 75    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Deaths from Epidural Anesthesia Here are some examples of women who have died from epidural anesthesia to illustrate the dangers. A healthy, 31 year old woman having her third child requested
epidural anesthesia and developed an acute condition of fluid in the
lungs (pulmonary edema). She could not be successfully
resuscitated. The baby also
died. 76  Sudden stoppage of the heart (cardiac arrest) can occur during
epidural anesthesia. 77  78 along with other heart rhythm
changes. 79 Sudden cardiac arrest
may be caused by air getting into veins during placement of the
epidural. 80  Respiratory insufficiency can occur and cause death. In one
case report, the patient initially developed pain in the
shoulder-neck region after epidural anesthesia, followed by fever and
an elevated white blood count. This led to a high-level (arms and
legs) paralysis with an inability to breath. Many problems then
developed with the heart and arterial system. An abscess was found
and the patient was eventually stabilized with antibiotics. The
patient required chronic mechanical ventilation and died of recurrent
pneumonia after 5 months of intensive care. The incidence of
breathing difficulties in one study was 0.54%, although only 5% of
those patients required prolonged artificial ventilation. Total
spinal anesthesia occurred in 0.013% of the epidurals but more than
half of these cases required intubation and prolonged mechanical
ventilation. Partial spinal anesthesia (sub-arachnoid block) occurred
in 0.04% of the cases. 81  Women are almost never given informed consent for epidurals. Even if they were just read two paragraphs from the package insert that comes with the medication used for epidurals (manufactured by Abbott
Laboratories), they might think twice. The package insert states:         Local anesthetics rapidly cross the placenta, and when used for
epidural, caudal or pudendal anesthesia, can cause varying degrees of
maternal, fetal and neonatal toxicity.... Adverse reactions in the
parturient, fetus and neonate involve alternations of the central
nervous system, peripheral vascular tone and cardiac function.... Neurologic effects following epidural or caudal anesthesia may
include spinal block of varying magnitude (including high or total
spinal block); hypotension secondary to spinal block; urinary
retention; fecal and urinary incontinence; loss of perineal sensation
and sexual function; persistent anesthesia, paresthesia, weakness,
paralysis of the lower extremities and loss of sphincter control all
of which may have slow, incomplete or no recovery; headache;
backache; septic meningitis; meningismus; slowing of labor; increased
incidence of forceps delivery; cranial nerve palsies due to traction
on nerves from loss of cerebrospinal fluid.         Who would sign a consent if it included the above language? The
degree to which the facts about the risks of epidural anesthesia are
hidden from women in labor is astonishing. Mothers who have a fever are significantly more likely to have had
epidural anesthesia. 82 Therefor
increasing the incidence of septic workups on newborns and the
subsequent complications of this procedure. We would hope that pregnant women would have a more informed
explanation of the risks of epidural anesthesia than what is
currently given, and would suspect that many would make other choices
if true informed consent was given (before labor, when the woman
still has time to prepare to cope with childbirth pain in other
ways).    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Critique of 3 Other Studies As we said the study we just discussed was the only prospective study. The other three studies are papers not yet published so we can only comment on the abstracts of these studies, they were "presented"
at the conference of the American Society of Anesthesiologists in November of 1997. Presented means that the paper was talked about at the conference and has not necessarily been accepted by a major medical journal for publication as of yet and may/or may not be.    1st Additional Study:   TITLE: Does epidural analgesia protect against cesarean section in nulliparous patients?   AUTHORS: DJ Burnbach, MD, A Grunebaum, MD, DJ Stem, MD, B Katgaem MD, MM Kuroda, MPH, DM Thys, MD   AFFILIATION: Department of Anesthesiology and Ob/Gyn, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY   INTRODUCTION: Recent articles have suggested that epidural analgesia may increase the risk of cesarean section. (1,2) In an effort to evaluate whether epidural analgesia during labor is associated with an increased risk of cesarean section at our institution, we evaluated the labor data of nulliparous patients who delivered at the hospital between 1989-1995.  METHODS : From January 1, 1989 -December 31, 1995, there were a total
of

31,670 deliveries at the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. The
13,203

nulliparous patients who delivered under the care of an obstetrician
during

that period of time constituted the study population. The following
were

the independent variables: type of labor analgesia administered,
patient

age, obstetric care provider (private vs. non-private), birth weight,
and

use of oxytocin for stimulation or induction. The dependent variable
was

the delivery mode. A non-hierarchical logistic regression was
performed to

determine which of these independent variables contributed to the
risk of

cesarean section.  RESULTS: Logistic analysis demonstrated that the highest risks for
cesarean

section were associated with oxytocin induction and maternal age. As
shown

in Table 1, other significant predictors of cesarean delivery were
oxytocin

for stimulation, patient status (private patients were at an
increased risk

of cesarean section) and birth weight. Epidural analgesia, on the
other

hand, was associated with a slightly decreased risk for cesarean
section.

For example, patients under 30 years of age who were induced with
oxytocin

who received epidural analgesia had a 32% cesarean section rate
(230/719)

versus a 39.1% cesarean section rate (70/179) for the same group
of

patients who did not receive an epidural anesthetic. Patients greater
than

29 years of age who were induced with oxytocin and received an
epidural had

a 45.4% cesarean section rate (114/251) versus a 58% cesarean section
rate

(51/88) for the same group of patients who did not receive an
epidural. Table 1:     Independent Variables  Odds Ratio  Confidence Interval    Oxytocin Induction  1.93  1.70 - 2.19    Maternal Age (per 10 years)  1.60  1.53 - 1.68    Birth Weight (per 1000g)  1.20  1.13 - 1.27    Oxytocin Stimulation  1.17  1.06 - 1.30    Patient Status (pvt. vs clinic)  1.10  1.01 - 1.16    Epidural Analgesia  0.89  0.81 - 0.97     DISCUSSION: Our data support other studies that have shown an
increased

risk of cesarean section with use of oxytocin, increased maternal
age, and

private patient status.(3) When controlled for other variables,
the

administration of epidural analgesia was associated with a decreased
risk

of cesarean section. Based on our data, we suggest that epidural
analgesia

as practiced at our institution, is associated with a decrease in
cesarean

section rate in nulliparous patients.  1. Obstet Gynecol 1996;88:993-1000 2. Am J Obstet Gynecol 1993;169:851-8 3. Am J Obstet Gynecol 1993;168:1881-5  CRITIQUE:  A major statistical problem with the study, which prevents the
authors from making the conclusions they have made, is the failure to
consider the interaction between epidural anesthesia and oxytocin
stimulation. Many studies have shown that epidural anesthesia
increases the need for oxytocin stimulations [refs]. A proper
statistical procedure would have been to use an interactive term for
epidural and oxytocin stimulation. I would have started with a
multivariate analysis of variance which would have considered the
interaction between epidural anesthesia and the other variables. The
authors believe (erroneously) that they are dealing with independent
variables. Clearly we all know that there is an association between
oxytocin induction and epidurals (more difficult labors; more likely
to have an epidural), maternal age (younger and older mothers are
more likely to have epidurals), oxytocin stimuation (women who have
epidurals are more likely to need oxytocin stimuation because of the
desultory effect of the epidural on uterine contractions, private
patients are more likely to have epidurals. The more sophisticated
approach to their paper would have been to use a technique such as
structural equations modeling (LISREL, or related procedures) to test
paths of effects. For example, one can test the hypothesis that
epidurals affect the cesarean rate through their effect on the need
for uterine stimulation. That could still be done with the authors'
data, and we plan to challenge them to an independent data analysis
(by our colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh) using path
analysis to test these hypotheses. Simply using logistic regression
in this context was inappropriately simplistic, but done probably
because it supported their bias (epidurals are good!). I suspect the
authors are well-informed and have excellent biostatistical
consultation, and chose not to report these other analyses that they
probably did, because these other analyses did not support their
position. I would draw your attention to another part of the abstract. Is it
reasonable practice to do cesareans on 58% of women who are older
than 29 years and are being induced? Are these numbers generalizable?
I was shocked to read this figure. In all my experience in
obstetrics, I can't imagine how you can perform a cesarean on 58% of
the women over age 29 whom you are inducing. I would very much like
to see their criteria for cesarean. With such high rates (45% in the
epidural group and 58% in the non-epidural group), I question how
generalizable these results are to good practice elsewhere. Perhaps
in an environment (consider how stressful this environment must be)
in which such high cesarean rates occur, epidurals do decrease the
risk for cesarean if you are being induced, but I can't believe that
such high cesarean rates constitute safe and prudent practice. I would like to see their overall complication rates, including
post-partum infection and the backache/headache complications of
epidurals. I suspect their morbidity is quite high.    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   2nd & 3rd Additional Studies:  Two other studies shed some light on this debate. The first is Newton
ER, Schroeder BC, Knape KG, Bennett BL. Epidural analgesia and
uterine function . Obstet Gynecol 1995; 85:749-55.  "Continuous epidural analgesia with bupivacaine and fentanyl did not
result in a change in myometrial contractility in the first hour
after initiation of analgesia. However, despite more oxytocin
therapy, the rate of cervical dilation was significantly slower in
the epidural group than in the nonepidural group (1.9 versus 5.6
cm/hr, p < 0.001). Operative deliveries were more common in
patients with epidural analgesia than in those without it (12 of 62
versus 2 of 124, p < 0.0001). After epidural analgesia, myometrial
contractility is maintained with oxytocin, but the ability of the
uterus to dilate the uterus is reduced significantly."   Also important, Albers LL, Anderson D, Cragin L, Daniels SM, Hunter
C, Sedler KD, Teaf D. The relationship of ambulation in labor to
operative delivery . JNM 1997; 42(1):4-8.  "Women who ambulated for a significant amount of time during labor
(compared with those who did not ambulate) had half the rate of
operative delivery (2.7% versus 5.5%)." It's very hard to ambulate
with either an epidural or PCIA.  Two others studies have been widely quoted in the popular press. They
included a study by Dr. Steven Fogel, an anesthesiologist at
Washington University School of Medicine, in St. Louis. Dr. Fogel
looked at data on 7,000 patients delivering over a 28 month period at
his hospital. He compared cesarean rates for first time mothers
before the introduction of an epidural on demand anesthesia service
to cesarean rates after the introduction of the service, finding no
change. What isn't reported is how obstetrical practices changed
during this time interval, a very significant factor. Such historical
studies are notoriously unreliable because policies change so rapidly
in obstetrical management. Without such information, the study is
meaningless. The final study was done at Boston's Beth Isreal-Deaconess Medical
Center by anesthesiologist Steven Pratt. This study reviewed the
labor and delivery records of more than 2300 women who received
ultra-low dose solutions of epidural medications. The study showed
that women who needed additional pain relief beyond the low-doses
were more likely to have cesareans than women who did not. Dr. Pratt
argued that it was harder labors that caused cesareans and not
epidurals. This study was so anecdotal as to be hardly worth
commenting upon. What Dr. Pratt failed to note was that several
others studies have shown that patient satisfaction with low-dose
epidurals is very low and that more than half of women have
additional medication. Pratt's study actually supports the point of
view that epidurals lead to increased cesareans, when this
information is taken into account. What is amazing is the propagandizing that went on in the press. The
gold standard in medicine consists of randomized, controlled trials.
These have been done and do generally show increased cesarean rates.
To try and argue against these much better quality studies with
retrospective studies using historical controls is poor science, but
clearly good propaganda. To conclude we list some of these studies
and their conclusions:  Prospective Clinical Trials Investigating the Association between

From fears of permanent back pain to allegations of potential harm to the baby, many women still harbor mistaken beliefs about epidurals.  “My own mother didn’t want me to have an epidural because she thought it would hurt my baby,” says Paloma Toledo,  M.D., M.P.H., lead author of the study. “But when I showed her the overwhelming scientific evidence that it was safe for me and the baby, she felt good about my decision.”  More than 60 percent of women in labor use an epidural, spinal or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia for labor, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. It is becoming increasingly rare to use spinal anesthesia for delivery alone, but combined spinal-epidurals are becoming quite common, according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). To administer an epidural, a physician anesthesiologist inserts a needle and tiny tube (catheter) in your lower back and delivers medication to continuously relieve pain below your belly button. Spinal anesthesia is a one-time injection of pain medication.  Toledo, an obstetric physician anesthesiologist and assistant professor of anesthesiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, frequently hears concerns and misconceptions about epidurals. With the ASA, she offers the truth behind some common myths:  Myth: Epidurals can cause permanent back pain or paralysis in the mother.  Fact:  Serious complications from an epidural, including paralysis, are extremely rare. Some women have discomfort in the lower back (where the catheter was inserted) for a few hours or days after the epidural, but it doesn’t last.  Myth:  Epidurals can harm the baby.  Fact: In Toledo’s study, published last year in the “International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,” women expressed concern that an epidural could cause cerebral palsy or be harmful to the baby. No evidence or research corroborates these concerns. Additionally, the amount of medication that reaches the baby from the epidural is so small it doesn’t cause harm.  Myth: Epidurals can slow down labor or increase the risk of having a cesarean section (C-section).  Fact: There is no credible evidence that an epidural slows down labor or increases your risk of having a C-section. If a woman has a C-section, other factors usually are at play, including having a very large baby or slow progression of labor due to other issues. In fact, there is evidence that epidurals can speed the first stage of labor for some women.  Myth: An epidural can interfere with the birth experience.  Fact: Some women express fear that their legs will be numb and they won’t be able to walk, feel a contraction or push properly. In fact, your legs should not be so numb that you do not feel them.  You may be able to walk after an epidural, depending on the hospital’s policy; however, walking generally is not recommended immediately after the epidural is placed. Epidural procedures have improved significantly in the last 20 years, and you’ll receive enough medication to relieve the pain without taking away your ability to move. Furthermore, the epidural medications will not cause you to be groggy or tired. In other words, you’ll be able to feel contractions – they just won’t hurt – and you’ll be able to push effectively.  Myth: There’s a limited window of time when you can get an epidural.  Fact: You can get an epidural any time during your labor – in the beginning, the middle or even toward the end.   < Back to                     Focused Resources For Your Specialty    Physician Anesthesiologists      Fellows & Residents      Medical Students      Care Team Members     International     Group Practice Solutions       Top          Thank You Industry Supporters  Whose contributions allow the American Society of Anesthesiologists ® to create world-class education and resources to improve patient care and outcomes.

I'm terrified now and don't know if I will get one. They make you sign a waiver and everything and I didn't even know that :/ Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  43 Posts b  bek302711 @jibberjabber  I knew a couple of women who were paralized for a few weeks but not years. They so make u sign a waiver. I always ask who the anastesialigist (sp?) is and how many years of experience they have. I kinda get a little background before I let them poke me. If your nurse is nice too u can always ask her who she thinks is the best what other patients thought of them. The chances of that happening are quite low. That used to be one of my fears too but after 3 times of doing it I have calm down even though I get nervous everytime. a  aandmbub @jibberjabber  There are risks of complications from severe headaches to paralyzation, but in birth class they said the likelihood of that is about the same as dying in a plane crash- so very unlikely! d  dawn4980 @jibberjabber   my lil sister had an epi when she had her baby on the 21st.  the dr that did it told her that the chances of  a failed epidural, missing the spot and hitting spine, fluid leakage were at 1 out of every 200.  for paralysis he said it was 1 out of every 200,000.  there were some others that he gave stats for but i cant remember them all. (i know one was for blood clots)  i didnt like the sound of those odds, neither did her boyfriend. he asked the dr if there was anyone better than him on call, and the nurse shook her head behind dr's back. so she had the best on call dr.   i dont want an epi, its not worth the risk to me, ive already discussed it with my own dr.  those odds to change tho slightly from what i was told with your size. if you're a 'fluffy' person it can be slightly harder for them to find the right spot.  ask the hospital you're delivering at who the dr's are that do it, and who they think are the best for it.  at my hospital we can request a specific one if we know one we'd feel more comfortable with. editted cause i typed 200,00 not 200,000 the first time :-\ small error but bothered me  j  jibberjabber @dawn4980  I agree with you dawn, the risk, even if it's one in a Million is not worth it to me. I'd rather suck up through hours of excruciating pain then there even being a almost impossible chance I could be paralyzed, because there is Still a possibility. I don't know why so many choose this risk over just pushing trough the pain. I am strong enough, why not everyone else? P  Purpleflowers @jibberjabber  Thanks for your post but it's not something I really wanted to read right before I go into labour when I plan to have an epidural. Especially having it as a title as now each time I come in I see it. Maybe some tact next time please. Its your body take some responsibility and find out all facts before u do anything to it. I can't believe u weren't aware of epidural risks until this late in the game. There are risks with all factors of childbirth but we don't need reminding of them so graphically just when a lot of us are going to be in labour very soon. Most of us have made the decisions about how we feel about epidurals c sections etc a long time ago and don't need to dreg up horror stories of them going wrong when we could be facing them anyday now. M  MomOfMiniCooper @jibberjabber  I told them no students and specifically chose a non teaching hospital. My ansteologist was bery experienced. I think thats importsnt. i  ivan1lucy2aby3 @Purpleflowers  If you already made your decision, then you know the risks and it's always in the back of your head anyway. I dont think she was trying to make anyone upset, just voicing her concerns, sorry, but everyone has the right to post about anything they want. To OP thats the main reason i plan to go natural this time as well.. The risk is not worth it M  Mom0507 That's something I think about every time I've got an epidural. I'm so scared to move I paralyz myself to make sure nothin happens lol V  Venuseventy @jibberjabber  That's the main reason I'm leaving epidurals as a last measure. First it's natural with labor tub/ball/bar, then it's Nitrous Oxide (laughing gas, it's the only medical management that doesn't affect baby/labor in the slightest, but it's the weakest form of pain reducer), then IV meds. If all else fails I might consider an epi, but honestly with my fear vs pain tolerance and knowledge that there is a very certain time limit on that pain is what I think will pull me through epi-free. We'll see! I do agree a more tactful Topic Title might have been appropriate. This is one of those TMI topics that, to be fair, other women should have a choice to read, not have it thrown at them, especially so close to decision time. Just my opinion. m  musesinspire @jibberjabber  As you may or may not know, I'm having my 5th child now.  I'd like to share my story, ok? My first child, I was adamant that I didn't want an epidural!  My doctor said I needed to keep an open mind as you never know what could happen once labor actually starts. I told him I was 100% positive that I just wanted IV drugs and that was it.  I felt this way because my mother, aunts and older friends that had already had children and recounted their various experiences... everything from horrendous headaches, extreme back problems to bladder issues after epidurals.  I was terrified of the idea of a needle and catheter going into my SPINE!!! My water broke and the contractions weren't too bad.  We got to the hospital, they got my IV in me and gave me some Demerol.  I figured I was going to be ok.  And I may have been, truth be told.  But in the middle of a contraction (they were uncomfortable) they inserted the internal fetal monitor and I transitioned immediately!  I puked my guts up, went into active hard labor and proceeded to sit up, in my stirrups while the doctor was still doing the monitor and screamed that I wanted an epidural and I wanted it NOW!!! I was in so much pain from the contractions and so freaked out from puking like I did that I didn't even feel the epidural being inserted.  Within 5 mins, all pain was gone, the Demerol could work its magic and I was in hog heaven! LOL I can honestly say that at that point, I could relax, concentrate and be an active participant in bringing my daughter into the world instead of a writhing, agonizing, painfilled miserable mess. The removal wasn't too bad, as they took it out while it was still numbing me.  The only problem I had was for about 3 months afterwards, if I bent down too quickly, I'd get a 'twinge' in my back right where the catheter went in.  It was uncomfortable but in the long run, more than worth it!!  I've had epidurals for all of the rest of them... I wouldn't go any other way, personally. L  LStrong2011 @Purpleflowers  I'm kind of with PurpleFlowers on this one. I think you have every right to post about this, but perhaps your title could have had more tact so those of us uninterested in reading could ignore?? I think it's a bit insensitive this stage in the game when people are delivering every day. k  kristichelle @Purpleflowers  Don't blame the poster! You should've done your research before making the decision! H  Hotlantamama2011 @jibberjabber  People post all sorts of things if you're not interested don't read it! She didn't criticize she asked an honest question! It seems that people don't ask enough questions before doing it about the effects. I had one and was sore in that spot for months it was awful!! I will not opt for that again and if I start to I have my beloved to remind me and help me through because I'm probably in transition and at the end anyway!! To each their own I just hope people really think about the risks! c  cl2016 I had a spinal tap at age 17. It was incredibly painful and scary. I made a rule then (15 years ago), no needles in my spine, thank you very much. We have been preparing for a natural birth since june to assure no epi for me! m  musesinspire Why is it that every post regarding epidurals and natural child birth always turn into these flaming threads of venom and strife?!  JESUS!  If you feel strongly about one, then don't read the posts about the other!  Some of the replies on some of these threads are borderline bullying and sometimes outright disrespectful. I swear, I fully expect to read one day that because so and so didn't agree with what this person says, they are going to post that they are taking their ball and going home!  It gets downright immature at times!  Which is why I avoid most of these. k  kristichelle @musesinspire  Actually, you never ignore these! You always show up and give everyone the same lecture which gets just as annoying as the topic itself! If you hate it so much then ignore it too! m  musesinspire @kristichelle  Huh... and I guess being a sarcastic know-it-all such as yourself is better, Kristi?  I have YET to see you post something productive or constructive, just a lot of belittling commentary about how stupid/uninformed/ridiculous the original poster is.  If you feel that everyone is so beneath your knowledge, then why bother being on the board? At least I try to be constructive and supportive, no matter what your choice is.  You browbeat everyone. N  Noodles001 Everything has risks. crossing the road has a risk. Giving birth has risks. With or without drugs. Tylenol has risks. Its individual ... if the minute chance freaks you out then don't have one. If it worries you but you think benefits outweigh risks then go for it.This post doesn't worry me- there isn't a single medical procedure out there that doesn't pose some kind of risk.To me it's logical reasoning. N  Noodles001 Btw- I've had 3 spinal taps and 2 epidurals - unrelated to childbirth ...I have zero horror stories to report and God Willing may it continue this way! My friend had an epi in April- got a severe headache as a result of a leak- they plugged the leak with blood and then all good after a couple of days!You can get mrsa from the catheters in your hand for the iv drugs! No one panic- chill. Just make a calculated decision that works best for your individual needs. Related Articles & Discussions Do Epidurals Slow Down Labor?

I know its kind of irrational, his mom has 3 epidurals, my mom had two and that was decades ago. But he's really freaked me out. I'd like to labor as long as possible without one, but if I decide to get one, what are the biggest risks? Isn't it super safe these days? Was anyone else really afraid? If I google it I'm sure I'll only see horror stories. I just need a little reassurance, I've had Pelvic Girdle since 22 weeks, I think I've suffered enough. Reply  Close Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  22 Posts j  jess_ortez I've had it twice now, no complications. Although during contractions it's hard to relax so of course the anesthesiologist waits until it's done. The numbing wasn't bad, the needle I couldn't feel much except a small amount of pressure. The thing that pumped in the medicine was tiny like a wire.. My back feels a little sore being 3 days post partum, but I did have back labor. I know there are so much more risks regarding the epsidural, but medicine has come a long way. Good luck :) Reply  Close c  catiemcm I was absolutely terrified of being paralyzed from an epidural and didn't want one. Then I got induced and my contractions were agony so I was encouraged to get one and did. It was amazing. I went from constant super intense contractions in my back hips and abdomen to feeling nothing at all. It took about 2 days to get full feeling back in my legs though Reply  Close B  Bjacobson8214 My sister is an AA ( anesthesiology assistant) so she deals with epidurals and actual anesthesia...she gave me some pointers as she's not allowed to give me it...she said just to try to hunch over exposing your lower back as much as possible...it's a pretty standard procedure, she said to try to relax as much as possible (yeah easier said than done lol) but I'm trying to stay clam about it...even though she has given me tips, I consider going natural as well bc of the risks but I'm having trust in them that they have gone through at least 2yrs of school plus the experience that they have working in the actual hospital Reply  Close f  ferox Getting an epidural increases the risk of the need for further interventions such as pitocin etc. Interventions such as epidurals also increases the risk for tearing/rupture, and increases the risk of needing a c-section. I also came across a study that found some possible links between epidurals and autism. I don't remember exactly the content, but it was something to do with saline levels or some such. You might find it if you google. I have done two natural unmedicated births and planning my third. It is absolutely doable. I'm sure getting an epidural is pretty safe these days, but there are still risks associated with it and I don't think the hospitals are really good at getting proper informed consent on the matter. Do some research on it before going into labour so you are completely aware of the bigger picture. Reply  Close L  Lucky42016 I was scared to get one as well however when my contractions got stronger and stronger i didn't even think about the risks anymore I just wanted the pain to stop! The doctor explained the risks, being paralyzed was a 1% chance. They talked me through every step and all I felt was a little pinch when the administered the needle to freeze me. After about 20 minutes I was in heaven! I felt so much better and relaxed, I didn't feel the majority of my contractions and if I did feel one it was when I was at 8cm and it was more just pressure but very manageable. When I was pushing I was having regular conversations and cracking jokes with the nurses I didn't feel anything it was amazing! Reply  Close b  babywalker0719 FTM and just delivered last Wednesday! I had an epidural and it was a breeze. I wanted to go without it as long as I could but at 6cm I had to have some relief. The only issue I had was nausea right after it was administered. It didn't slow down the labor/delivery process at all for me. I had a healthy baby girl an hour later! Only pushed for 30 minutes. Reply  Close s  soblessed16 I delivered my daughter 6 weeks ago and had the same concerns as you.  I am a FTM and was convinced I didn't want an epidural because I was so scared of the horror stories I read online.  I delivered at a hospital whose main purpose is women who deliver babies and they deliver at least 50 a day...so knowing how many epidurals they likely place there each day really eased my mind when making my decision to get one.  I spent time asking any questions to the anesthesiology team and the pain was eventually just too much to take so I got one. I went into labor at 38 weeks and 3 days & was 5 cm after about 10 hours into it when I decided on a walking epidural.  That didn't do much for the pain...it really made me feel pretty high or drunk honestly and took a little pain away.  So then I got a regular epidural before they broke my water because between the pain from contractions and the cervical checks it was too much. Getting it placed wasn't bad honestly the only advice I can tell you on that is stay as still as possible--get someone (nurse, husband, etc.) to stand in front of you and hold you steady so you don't jump when they place the epidural.  Mine worked better for my left side than the right but did work for where it counted thankfully.  After 23 hours by the time I started to push the epidural began to wear off I believe across my lower abdomen right above my pubic bone area so the pain of her coming through my pelvic bone was incredibly intense.  I didn't feel her coming out at all that part was numb but I did feel the feeling of relief when she did come out.  I also had a harder time pushing because honestly I couldn't feel myself pushing because of the epidural.  All I could feel was the pain across my pelvic bone area when the contractions would come and a burning feeling like my lower belly was in front of a fire. Also I think that it prolonged my labor--I pushed for 3.5 hours so my labor was 26 hours total.  I had a tear too but no complications thus far after labor and delivery.  I haven't had any back pain or numbness,etc thankfully.  I can't imagine going through labor without it to be honest because the pain WITH it was too much and I was mostly numb.  I would definitely get one again if I have another child someday. Reply  Close h  hannahkates I was terrified of getting an epidural with my first because of the risks... However, I was induced and after 24 hours of labour hooked up the IV I just couldn't cope with the pain any more and for me, alleviating the pain outweighed the risks. It wasn't painful to administer and it worked amazingly and allowed me to sleep whilst I finished dilating. That said, there were three distinct downsides ( although with retrospect I don't regret my choice because I really wasn't coping with the pain): 1. I couldn't feel anything when it came to pushing which made it really hard (for me) and I personally feel that contributed to my need for assisted delivery (forceps) 2. I couldn't move around very easily the next day which I found scary until the sensation in my legs returned 3. I had to have a catheter which I found a bit grim But that's just my experience and I don't regret having one Reply  Close b  bpt2015 Some people completely cannot feel their legs whilst having an epidural others can. You will have a catheter do you don't pee yourself. Mid/long term effects after can include back numbness/ pain and more extreme cases worse than this but from what I understand it's pretty rare Reply  Close R  RainshadowNoba My first epidural failed and I had to be given narcotics in my IV. Even that didn't help, and when it came time to push, you could have amputated my legs and I would have felt nothing but I still was feeling every contraction. I then blacked out and fell on my stitches in the bathroom because the nurse removed the epidural catheter with me standing by the sink. Had to have Vicodin for the pain since I fell and she couldn't even tell the doctor if I'd hit my head or not. Due to the trauma of her birth, I didn't want an epidural with my second, but was forced to get one for still unknown reasons. I have permanent nerve damage in my back and nearly dislocated my shoulder being moved to postpartum because they hadn't turned it off. He was born very drugged looking. My third was a home birth because of the experiences I had with the medical staff at my previous births. I'm due today with #4 and am having another home birth. I can't birth in hospitals anymore. I can't even visit maternity wards without having a panic attack. Reply  Close r  rmontgomery13 According To my dr I had the "perfect epidural experience". I was not in any pain but I could feel when my body had contractions and when it was time to push I was able to do so on my own without needing my doctor or nurse to tell me. So I was able to push how I was comfortable and it resulted in a very quick and easy delivery. I think I only pushed for about 15 minutes and she was here. Reply  Close m  myjujubee http://www.metropolitanmama.net/blog/2013/01/17/10-reasons-not-to-get-an-epidural/ Reply  Close N  NULL STM and I got an epidural with both deliveries. Both times I was induced. The second time the epidural wasn't "working correctly" and they sent people in to fix it and dose me up more. I then was so numb I couldn't feel the urge to push and my baby pretty much came out by herself. That being said, these people do this all day everyday. Just try to remain as calm as possible while they are doing it, relax and breathe. Reply  Close l  lucysky You can't feel how you're pushing, so you're more likely to tear or not push correctly and need more interventions. You're also limited to one position. Reply  Close m  myjujubee I'm not a fan of epidural personally and I could never get one (I've had 2 natural deliveries, this will be my third), but when I was a L&D nurse most of the 'complications' were minor - drop in blood pressure (sometimes leading to c-section), bad headache afterwards until anesthesia does a blood patch to help it, slowed down labor, increased chance of episiotomy from not being able to push as well in the laying down position... There are cases where moms have back pain or numbness for years afterwards, which obviously does affect daily living and is very unfortunate, but that is pretty rare. Reply  Close M  Mama_Nicky It is nice that he's concerned about you but ultimately it's your decision if you want the epidural to help you manage the pain. I've had 3 babies & had epidurals with the first and the last (got to the hospital too late with the second so no time, but had a spinal block I believe). The first delivery I got the epidural around 4 cm and I think that was too early. By the time I was 10cm I was completely numb & didn't/couldn't effectively push which led to 2 hours of pushing time with a vacuum assisted delivery and an episiotomy for me. Recovery was fine. This last time with baby #3 I got the epidural at 7cm and I could still feel the urge to push with the contractions but the medicine took away the debilitating abdominal pain I felt during the contractions. I pushed for 30 min & recovery was fine again - no pain or soreness at the epidural sight, no headaches. Feeling was back in my legs in about 2 hours. My advice would be to wait as long as you can but every women is different & has different birth experiences. Good luck :) Reply  Close L  L_Lubas I had an epidural when I hit 8cm. No complications. It's really the anesthesiologist who needs to be sure they know what they're doing! Had a clean, easy epi with no side effects afterward. It was a fine experience. Reply  Close n  naptimeninja I know there are risks but it's a very small risk and you should be fine if you are having one done at a good hospital. I've had 4 and they have all been heavenly and helped me relax and enjoy the birth process more Reply  Close B  Brandiengland26 I was super nervous about getting one too!! I lasted until I was 7cm dilated and then got one. I was in so much pain and once the epidural kicked in I felt nothing but a little pressure. It was amazing lol although right when I was pushing I definitely felt like my epidural was starting to wear off and could feel the contractions more. I did tear and could feel them stitching me up which hurt Reply  Close Related Articles & Discussions Do Epidurals Slow Down Labor?

Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  19 Posts b  babysalt131 @k_brooke_10  I think this rarely happens now. Especially considering how many epidurals are administered these days, it's become such a rarity. P  Po_Tay_Toes @k_brooke_10  It's extremely rare, but not impossible. k  kementari Possible but very rare. It will be listed as a possible outcome in the consent form though. I don't know anyone who has had it happen. m  mammer83 @k_brooke_10  The nurse at our extremely busy hospital said she seen one complication in 25 years. s  sapphire723 That's a possible complication.  The receptionist at my spa yesterday said they hit her sciatic nerve and she still experiences pain and problems years later. s  silver0980 Ask your anesthesiologist l  lindseyrhae It's in the paperwork they make you sign before you get it. Read through it carefully or request a copy before you go into labor that way your not pressured to just sign in the midst of contractions. I personally know someone that was paralyzed from an epidural. It is rare, but they definitely still scare the heck out of me! j  jhilchie @k_brooke_10  I wouldn't put any worry in to this possibility. Best not to focus on things that could go wrong. m  mlind15 It's also possible to die from childbirth but u don't see everyone freaking out about it k  k_brooke_10 @mlind15  I don't see myself or anyone freaking about about this either... k  k_brooke_10 @sapphire723  Was it a mistake on the anesthesiologists part or did she accidentally move or something? And if it was his fault did she sue?! s  sheenab4 My friend's cousin had this happen. She was paralyzed for 3 months after she had her baby. Also it is very possible for them to put the epidural in to far and into the spinal cord.  If that happens the meds go up to your lungs and can cause you to stop breathing. I am do a natural birth becuse I am too afraid of all the bad side effects. Even if it is rare, it happens. b  babyhalle28 Some of you are scaring her.  You have to believe and you have to have faith that it is going to work out ok.  If the question was about people enjoying epidurals and getting them again, there would be a ton of responses.  Yes it's rare, but ive done it twice and will do it again!! b  blanzen My anesthesiologist said it was a possible outcome if your platelets are low (I have an autoimmune disease and have chronically low platelets). That's why they run a CBC blood check beforehand to make sure platelets high enough. Most hospitals require platelet levels to be at least 80; some require 100. If not high enough and can't do a transfusion, then would either need to go natural or under general anesthesia for a c-section to avoid the paralysis risk. My understanding is the risk comes from bleeding in the spine when needle inserted and not enough platelets to clot any injury from needle insertion. t  trying4four @k_brooke_10  It's very possible.the hospital I was delivered at is sometimes nicknamed Crippler, or was almost 30 years ago. My mom knew a few women who went to the hospital and ended up with serious complications from birth. One being a woman went to deliver and got an epidural they messed up and missed and she ended up a paraplegic. It's a very very rare complication but one none the less. s  sapphire723 @k_brooke_10  To be honest, I didn't pry much further. I'm shooting for a natural birth, so I'm trying to not focus on the negatives. She did say she regrets it, because she didn't even get relief. At the end of the day, there are risks associated with the epidural, but it's not the norm. Personally, I'm going to try to avoid it if I can and talk to my dr about the risks so I can make an informed decision if I decide I need one. r  rachaelofcourse If you become paralyzed from an epidural, I'd really be questioning your anesthesiologist. You have 3 layers protecting your spinal cord and the epidural goes in between the first 2. Also, your spinal cord ends above where they place the epidural. So, if they paralyze you, they either placed it waaaaaay too high, or the anesthesiologist carelessly placed the catheter. There's also the platelet/clotting issue a PP mention. I'm not having an epidural (mainly because I don't want to pay for it), but I wouldn't be the least bit scared. C  CCMEL @k_brooke_10  Rare. I'm an anesthetist and seeing this post makes my bones chill! We place these all the time, we are trained to know what and where epidurals are placed and it's why we ask questions as we do them. I wouldn't let this scare you off from receiving one. Complications can arise with anything however like I've said it's rare. Good luck. Related Articles & Discussions Do Epidurals Slow Down Labor?

I'm sure I'm being completely irrational, but it's a big fear I have... But I also don't want to be in so much pain that I have no idea of what's going on... Anyone else feel the same way? How bad does it hurt? Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  54 Posts m  meowmeowmeowz @pcoble11  OMG I was just thinking about this last night. Giant needle to the spine terrifies me but so does giving birth with no pain relief. I'm FTM too . I thought I was the only one terrified M  Munkeroo I'll say two things. I got it once as a last resort before c section. I won't ever get one again. However, my experience is NOT the norm and I know no one with even a remotely similar experience so I really think more often than not things go just fine. I didn't find it hurt, but it was icky feeling. They had to do mine over a few times an I could feel the catheter in my spine and that's just...ick to me. My whole back bruised from it and that hurt more than the epidural. The hardest part is sitting up with a rounded back during contractions. L  Lubug2014 @pcoble11  I was adamant that I would not get it. I ended up caving and taking it. I was so terrified of it. The pain from labor was so strong I really barely felt it. I can't believe how quick it was. I was totally against it, you will know what's best for you in that moment. I will try again this time to not get it, but I won't be ruling it out. I hope this helps. God Bless! m  mlvaughan1 @pcoble11  I was right there with you with my first.. I couldn't believe how easy it was. They numb you with a small poke, then you don't feel the big part. I promise the actual process of an epi is no biggie! I understand that there are other reasons to fear it, that are legit, but actually getting it is a breeze in my opinion! j  jlk3 @pcoble11  Yes, I'm terrified! I know I definitely want one but I'm scared of complications. I've had a spinal tap before and had a spinal fluid leak afterwards for 3 weeks and needed a blood patch, the while ordeal was the worst experience of my life. I know an epidural is a little different (they don't go as deep) but a spinal leak is a possible complication. m  mtnladyAGAIN I was more afraid of an epidural than birthing a baby, so my plan was a drug-free birth with my first. Long (loooong) story short, I ended up with an epidural and it was a good experience. My plan is drug-free, but in the end what matters is a healthy baby and healthy mom. Birth is only a small part of the big picture. Have a plan, but don't let it be the focus of your pregnancy. C  Cp89 I so far have had two babies without an epidural. I have never been against getting one, it just so happened that both times that I got to the point of "I can't take it anymore" it was time to push. But the thought of having an epidural does scare me too. I can understand when women say your in so much pain that the thought of an epidural doesn't scare you anymore. A  AutumnSky002 With my first I didn't want an epidural, just from hearing it's easier to nurse them right away without meds and hearing other moms say how the epidural is still causing them back pain I decided I didn't want to have one. I have a pretty high pain tolerance so I thought I would be able to do it and it did! The pain to me was never worse than my worst cramps, and knowing the pain doesn't last and I would have a break before the next one made it easier k  kateandluke When I had an epi the worst part of it was the freezing cold antiseptic they washed my back with to start with. The needle was nothing in comparison! Very minimal. Getting your ears done would hurt more G  GayeFamily I'm a ftm as well. And we're not going with any meds. Simply because I'm a research freak and I'm very cautious about the medicines I and my baby receive. When you get a chance check out this documentary called "the business of being born" VERY INFORMATIVE!! s  saltwater I literally couldn't feel the epidural at all, but the pain relief was heaven! I was having an incredibly intense labor with all my contractions right on top of one another. Other women have very different labor and don't feel they need it- do what is best for you!! And a word of caution, like most documentaries, business of being born is very one-sided and doesn't present objective information. Educate yourself, but don't blindly believe everything you see/read!! j  jps2011jps @pcoble11  Lol. Yes. I didn't want the needle in my back after. I wS luck with a quick delivery so I was able to do it no meds M  MamaMindyB85 @pcoble11  You will have to see how your labor progresses. I've had two epidural a, but I'm not sure I will have one with this third labor. But being a FTM you don't know how fast it will go. My first labor was very long and I was not dilating fast, it took me from 7 am - 1 pm to go from 3-4 cm and they had started giving me pitocin and I just did not see an end in sight. It is a bit terrifying to have an epidural, and everyone reacts differently to it. I did not find it to be painful, but it affected my blood pressure and made me shaky. When you are in labor you will make the best decision for you and your baby!! Good luck!! L  LuluMay29 @pcoble11  It's one of the reasons I'm aiming to go natural! I'd also like the freedom to get up and walk around right after delivery, which you can't do with an epidural. My cousin was temporarily paralyzed for several weeks after hers, needed physical therapy and also had a spinal headache (one of the worst headaches imaginable) as a result of her epidural. Obviously that is NOT common nor is it the norm, but it is one of the risks. t  tatee79 @pcoble11  the labor pain overshadowed any fear I had about an epidural. I'm definitely getting an epidural again! n  natzmolko There's plenty to try before epidural such a as relaxation, hypnobirthing, tens, water, gas and air, morphine injection, remifentanil etc s  shellsbells82 @pcoble11  I am so scared of it that I'm leaning towards not getting it. I have started to reconsider that though after talking to my PCP. She did her residency with my OB and said she saw a lot of them done, and the women who got them had much better birth experiences than the ones who didn't. b  bcmama23 I ended up with a spinal leak and had to have a blood patch. I survived though, it is t the end of the world, just a setback. h  hrain27 @pcoble11  When I got one with my first it was horribly painful. Much more painful than what I was experiencing laboring. On top of that it didn't even work for me. I won't be doing it again.

K  Kelly_Ruiz @thomps29   DO NOT TOUCH OR RUB IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is exactly why i go natural! After having an Epidural with my 2nd baby, i had pain to the touch in my injection site for NINE months after delivery. When i told my friend i was rubbing it, she yelled at me. Her friend who is a Nurse told her that after having an Epidural, there may be a pocket of fluid that stays put. If you rub and break that pocket of Epi meds, you can rub it back into your spine. Causing parylization. This is why i don't mess with needles/meds in my spine. It's nothing to mess around with IMO. I'll take any contraction pain any day over what could happen from an Epidural. Whatever you do, do not touch that spot!  P  PaigeW @thomps29  mine is doing the same, it did with my first too.  with my first it was like that for a long time almost 4 months. im not sure how long its supposed to hurt but i expect it to :) P  PaigeW @Kelly_Ruiz  i did not know that holy crap!!!!! dh rubbed my back today but thankfully that spot hasnt been rubbed wtf why dont they tell you this lol... guess i should have done some research but still with all the other useless information those dr.s tell you you think they would tell you something important like this!!!!!!!!!!! lol... K  Kelly_Ruiz @PaigeW   No they do not tell you that. They push so many interventions and medicine on women because it's easier on everyone. When i found that out, i was pissed to say the least. A little "hey, you could be paralyzed!" would be friggen' nice, ya know?? I swore from thay day forward, if i had any more kids, i'd have them naturally. No amount of pain scares me like the thought of being paralyzed. I weighed my odds....paralyzed for LIFE, or a ton of pain for a few hours??? Hmmm, no brainer to me :P You ain't stickin' any needles in my spine Doc! LOL  3  3ladies @thomps29  Find a good chiropractor. Preferably one who specializes in pregnancy therapy. The epi site can give you discomfort for up to a year afterwards. And try some core/back strengthening exercises. Yoga is great. This should help. n  nat_in_ill @3ladies  I'd call your doc and ask about whether rubbing the site will cause paralysis.  I'm having a hard time believing that.  I could be wrong, though. is the injection site warm to touch or red?  make sure there is no infection.

Rats at school.   by armywife2 in Bargain Hunters          advertisement           advertisement           From July 2017 Birth Club          Epidural paralyzed my bladder??  High Risk Pregnancy             princ3zzjh    Posted 07/08/2017      I gave birth a little over 24hrs ago via c section. Ever since labor, delivery, and after I've had a catheter in. I first got it once I received the first epidural. I ended up getting 3 in total. 2 while attempting a vaginal delivery, and 1 during prep for a csection. My catheter was taken out about 12 hours after delivery. Since then, I've had the strongest urge to urinate but I'm unable to do so. Like I can tell that my bladder is super full but no matter how long I sit on the toilet or try to relax and push, I literally can't. I was in so pain I begged my nurse for another catheter which gave instant relief. I'm just afraid that I'm going to continue to have this problem once I go home on Sunday, tomorrow.  Has anyone had a similar issue? If so how did you get past it. I'm trying not to stress and freak out over while attempting to heal from a csection at the same time...     --  Me + DH = 10.12.15 DS  4/6/10 DS2 7/6/17        Comment            Report this post        3       Comments (13)        / 2                  hardingbabe    Posted 07/08/2017      Usually they don't release you until you can pee.

More common complications are drops in blood pressure and heart rate and delayed/stalled labor leading to C/S, and increased body temperature (for you and baby) leading to NICU stays for monitoring for infection.      --  Proud mamabear to M: 02/2010 & C: 09/2012              Reply            Report this comment        1                     slhaug    Posted 04/17/2012      It's a risk but it's rather minuscule . Make your choice but anything you have done in medical aspect is a risk. Just do your homework on your hospital and the anesthesioligists there. I had 1 my first child and it was a nightmare because they had to do it three times and the left side of my belly never got numb. Second child I had a walking epidural and it was fine but I developed a leak and had to have a blood patch . And with my third I had a spinal and it was fabulous! Spinal is much riskier per say but it's awesome if you have a csection. Having a baby is a risk. You just gotta keep it in perspective.

I had an epi with my ODS and since then I have back spasms in the area it was insterted and its a spot that must be avoided during a massage as its uncomfortable to put pressure on it. My son is over 3.5yrs old and its still like this. When he was just a few weeks old I was doing laundry and when I was getting the stuff out of the dryer, a spasm shot me forward during the bend and I almost smacked my head on my dryer. I am opting to try and go all natural this time because I dont want this again. Good luck!

ETA: this one is more specific I think!  http://www.healing-arts.org/mehl-madrona/mmepidural.htm  ^^^A disabling condition called spinal arachnoiditis can develop after epidural anesthesia. Of 6 such women, 3 were permanently confined to a wheelchair three years after their initial evaluation. 66 None of these patients had any prior spinal surgery or trauma or problems with the spinal cord including previous hemorrhage, infections or other known causes of arachnoiditis. They had no neurological symptoms prior to epidural anesthesia. The diagnosis was confirmed by a medical test called myelography in all cases. The epidurals were uneventful and performed according to standard methods.    --  proud wife  mother of three amazing little dudes preparing to surrogate CD, BF, BLW, BW, ERF, CS, HS, HB NO RIC, NO VAX, VBAC... pretty crunchy             Reply            Report this comment       0                     TaliaSLP    Posted 06/19/2011      In our birth class someone asked that question and the instructor said it is not possible.

I had one with my first- loved that it took away the pain, hated feeling numb and it slowed my progress greatly (3 hours to go from 1-7, 6.5 hours to get to a 10 with epi). Then it wore off and I pushed for 3 hours without it (DS was facing up). I'm going to try without it this time, assuming my labor is another quick one.

She had an emergency c-cection twice with an epidural due to high blood pressure, when she got the epidural her blood pressure plummetted and she had to be resuscitated.  The third c-section they knew what caused it and used general anesthesia!  But they are a lot more aware of the effects now and that is really rare.  They give IV fluids before and during an epidural now to prevent such occurences.    --  T+M=AJ(8/4/11) Though I never knew you, yet I loved you still.  You will always be in my heart, my angel.  4/23 ^i^              Reply            Report this comment       0                     BoysMommyto4    Last edited 06/19/2011      You can be, but it's rare and it only happens when they put the needle in to deep.  Headaches are way more common and low blood preasure that would do harm to your baby.  Giving birth is not that bad, I did it 5 times natural and will again this time!  Goodluck to each one of you!

I am very freaked out by the fact that you have to sign a waiver that says "the anaethesiolgist is not liable if you become paralyzed" and I am very freaked out by being numb from the waist down for a few hours. What other options are there to manage pain? i am a FTM  (first time mom) and am wondering if there are other mom's out there that are freaked out about the risks. My husband is a pain management doctor and actually injects pain medication into the back and knee (not on pregnanct women) and he said that he uses an x-ray machine to make sure the needle in going into the right space. When you get an epidural the injection goes in "blind" which means that the doctor just has to feel the area and guesses where the needle needs to go in. They can't use an x-ray machine. My husband doesn't knwo of anyone that has been paralyzed but the chance is still there. Does anyone know of any friends, sisters etc that were?

I think there's a thing called a "walking epidural"  in which you can still get around and feel some...but I didn't have one and I don't know anyone that did.

I have however heard of horrible migraines or it not working totally correctly, but those two problems are not life threatening.  As far as pain management goes, there are a lot of mental things you can do, but the iv pain meds only do so much. If you aren't mentally in control of your state then you pretty much have to work through it just like any other pain.  Hypnobirthing is becoming very popular, as is water birthing. Those are apparently great at helping with pain, although I don't believe it's for everyone. Also breathing techniques and massage can help.  Do your research. There are a lot of options out there, you just have to find what is best for you.    --  -Shana...

From fears of permanent back pain to allegations of potential harm to the baby, many women still harbor mistaken beliefs about epidurals.  “My own mother didn’t want me to have an epidural because she thought it would hurt my baby,” says Paloma Toledo,  M.D., M.P.H., lead author of the study. “But when I showed her the overwhelming scientific evidence that it was safe for me and the baby, she felt good about my decision.”  More than 60 percent of women in labor use an epidural, spinal or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia for labor, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. It is becoming increasingly rare to use spinal anesthesia for delivery alone, but combined spinal-epidurals are becoming quite common, according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). To administer an epidural, a physician anesthesiologist inserts a needle and tiny tube (catheter) in your lower back and delivers medication to continuously relieve pain below your belly button. Spinal anesthesia is a one-time injection of pain medication.  Toledo, an obstetric physician anesthesiologist and assistant professor of anesthesiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, frequently hears concerns and misconceptions about epidurals. With the ASA, she offers the truth behind some common myths:  Myth: Epidurals can cause permanent back pain or paralysis in the mother.  Fact:  Serious complications from an epidural, including paralysis, are extremely rare. Some women have discomfort in the lower back (where the catheter was inserted) for a few hours or days after the epidural, but it doesn’t last.  Myth:  Epidurals can harm the baby.  Fact: In Toledo’s study, published last year in the “International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,” women expressed concern that an epidural could cause cerebral palsy or be harmful to the baby. No evidence or research corroborates these concerns. Additionally, the amount of medication that reaches the baby from the epidural is so small it doesn’t cause harm.  Myth: Epidurals can slow down labor or increase the risk of having a cesarean section (C-section).  Fact: There is no credible evidence that an epidural slows down labor or increases your risk of having a C-section. If a woman has a C-section, other factors usually are at play, including having a very large baby or slow progression of labor due to other issues. In fact, there is evidence that epidurals can speed the first stage of labor for some women.  Myth: An epidural can interfere with the birth experience.  Fact: Some women express fear that their legs will be numb and they won’t be able to walk, feel a contraction or push properly. In fact, your legs should not be so numb that you do not feel them.  You may be able to walk after an epidural, depending on the hospital’s policy; however, walking generally is not recommended immediately after the epidural is placed. Epidural procedures have improved significantly in the last 20 years, and you’ll receive enough medication to relieve the pain without taking away your ability to move. Furthermore, the epidural medications will not cause you to be groggy or tired. In other words, you’ll be able to feel contractions – they just won’t hurt – and you’ll be able to push effectively.  Myth: There’s a limited window of time when you can get an epidural.  Fact: You can get an epidural any time during your labor – in the beginning, the middle or even toward the end.   < Back to                     Focused Resources For Your Specialty    Physician Anesthesiologists      Fellows & Residents      Medical Students      Care Team Members     International     Group Practice Solutions       Top          Thank You Industry Supporters  Whose contributions allow the American Society of Anesthesiologists ® to create world-class education and resources to improve patient care and outcomes.

I realise this is a small percentage, but a quick check shows that approx 700,000 are born each year in the UK - so if all mothers were to use epidurals, 70 per year would be paralysed.  Have any of you been affected drastically by epidurals?  Thanks.

It seemed to be working fine, then I could feel half, then it didn't work at all and we let it come the rest of the way out.  I had 2 stomach surgeries with epidurals prior to that though, and they worked great.

I think everybody has the wrong idea here.  Paralysis doesn't necessarily mean that you're paraplegic.  It is the loss of muscle function in more than one muscle.  In most cases where an epidural is involved, your back stays numb after it is removed.

They were putting me on the drip to induce me and knew i wouldnt be able to cope with the pain. It did wear off towards the end and i felt EVERYTHING when i started to push, but honestly it wasnt painful and i dont regret having one.

  Epidural Anaesthetic    Epidural Anaesthetic   By Jane Palmer      An epidural anaesthetic is a procedure that is performed by a specialist doctor known as an anaesthetist. Epidural anaesthetic is where an injection of local anaesthetic (sometimes mixed with an opiate such as pethidine or fentanyl) is given into the epidural space (an area located around the spinal cord). An epidural anaesthetic is given to relieve pain in labour, to help reduce high blood pressure (if it is a problem in labour) and prior to a caesarean birth. The effects of the epidural anaesthetic on the woman depend on the type of medication used. A woman may be numb from the waist down and unable to move or she may be able to move her legs but not feel the pain of the contractions. An epidural anaesthetic takes between 10 to 20 minutes to be put in place and then the medication takes around 5 to 20 minutes to become effective. An epidural catheter is left in place after the procedure is completed. It is through this catheter that regular doses of medication can be given to help keep the woman comfortable (Robertson, 1999).  What happens during the administration of an epidural anaesthetic?  Firstly the anaesthetist places a needle in the woman’s hand and attaches a bag of intravenous fluids. These fluids are to help counteract any drop in blood pressure that can occur. The woman is then positioned either lying on her side or sitting up in bed in a curled up position. An area of the woman’s back is swabbed with an antiseptic solution such as betadine. The woman is given a local anaesthetic to numb the area where the epidural catheter will be introduced. A special needle is inserted into the appropriate space and the very fine epidural catheter is passed into the needle. The epidural catheter is left in place and the special needle is removed. The epidural catheter is then taped carefully in place so that it cannot move. The appropriate medication is given into the epidural catheter.  What are the advantages of an epidural anaesthetic?  The advantages of an epidural anaesthetic include: The most effect form of pain relief available, mother can see the birth of her baby during a caesarean, provides adequate pain relief if a forceps or vacuum birth is indicated, helps control high blood pressure (Robertson, 1999).  What are the disadvantages of an epidural anaesthetic?  The disadvantages of an epidural anaesthetic include: Being confined to bed, increases chance of a caesarean birth, increases chance of forceps or vacuum extraction by three times (around 50% of first time mothers will need this type of assistance - statistics between hospitals can vary), approximately 1:100 women will experience a severe headache afterwards, 1:550 women will experience small numb patches on their legs that persist after birth for up to three months, 1:4000 women will experience a life threatening emergency from an epidural (paralysis is extremely rare), labour can be longer (approximately three times more likely to need medication to speed labour up), more likely to need a catheter to help pass urine, some women experience itchy skin (as a result of some of the medication used), some women do not achieve adequate pain relief or partial relief on one side, mothers temperature can rise resulting in the need to give the baby antibiotics after birth (Enkin, Keirse, Renfrew & Neilson, 1995; MIDIRS and The NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, 1997; Robertson, 1999).  Are there any long term effects on my self or my baby if I choose an epidural anaesthetic?  Remarkable there has been little research done on short or long term effects of epidural anaesthetics. So the effects on mothers and babies remains unknown at this stage. All research can say at this stage is that epidural anaesthetic provides the most effective form of pain relief to date but it substantially increases the risk of operative births ie. caesarean section, forceps and vacuum extraction (Enkin, Keirse, Renfrew & Neilson, 1995).

The popular book, What to
Expect when Youre Expecting, for example, portrays epidurals as
perfectly safe. The risks, however, may be greatly underplayed.  N ote: This is a site in progress.  We are interested in detailing all the risks of epidural anesthesia for childbirth.  There is currently a selection bias toward the risks.  We welcome all readers to send us studies about epidurals regardless of the results, so that we can continue to work toward a balanced  site.  Our bias is that epidurals have risks and that these risks are under-communicated to women, and that true informed consent is not given.    Epidurals and Pain Relief  For the most part, epidural analgesia
does effectively relieve labor
pain. 1 Obstetrical
anesthesiologists continue to state that epidural
analgesia has other, potentially catastrophic, adverse effects but,
with safe clinical practice, these problems are extremely rare. We
will suggest in the material that follows that these complications
are not extremely rare, and that women are not receiving adequate
informed consent about what these complications are and their
accompanying frequency. Nor are they being offered any serious
alternatives to epidural anesthesia. Despite this, anesthesiologists
such as Eberle and Norris argue that specific anaesthetic techniques
... or obstetrical management can limit or eliminate these risks of
epidural labour analgesia. What must be remembered for any technical
procedure, is that it is studied in major academic centers where
highly skilled professors supervise residents and all outcomes are
monitored closely. The actual practice, however, takes place in
smaller institutions by less qualified individuals so that the actual
complication rates of any procedure (obstetric, cardiac, pulmonary)
are always higher than what are found in studies.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]      Overall Complications Rates for Epidural Anesthesia  A general estimate of the overall complication rate of epidural anesthesia is 23%. 2   1. Effects of epidurals on cesarean rate: When the dose is too large or when it sinks down into the sacral ("tailbone") region of the body, the perineum and the vagina are anesthetized. Anesthetic is
intentionally injected into this area late in labor to deaden all
sensation. When it "accidentally" happens earlier in labor, the
muscles of the pelvic floor are prematurely relaxed, thereby
interfering with the normal flexion and rotation of the baby's head
as it passes through the birth canal. This interference can lead to
abnormal presentations which are more dangerous for the baby or to
what is called "failure to descend," an indication for Cesarean
birth. Thorp, et al 3 studied 711
consecutive nulliparous women at term, with cephalic fetal
presentations and spontaneous onset of labor. They compared 447
patients who received epidural analgesia in labor with 264 patients
who received either narcotics or no analgesia. The incidence of cesarean section for dystocia was significantly greater (p <
0.005) in the epidural group (10.3%) than in the nonepidural group
(3.8%). There remained a significantly increased incidence (p <
0.005) of cesarean section for dystocia in the epidural group after
selection bias was corrected and the following confounding variables
were controlled by multivariate analysis: maternal age, race,
gestational age, cervical dilatation on admission, use of oxytocin,
duration of oxytocin use, maximum infusion rate of oxytocin, duration
of labor, presence of meconium, and birth weight. The incidence of cesarean section for fetal distress was similar (p > 0.20) in both
groups. There were no clinically significant differences in frequency
of low Apgar scores at 5 minutes or cord arterial and venous blood
gas parameters between the two groups. They concluded that epidural
analgesia in labor increases the incidence of cesarean section for
dystocia in nulliparous women. Frequently the epidural is so effective that it eliminates uterine
contractions. The nerves which tell the uterus to contract are all
anesthetized. The uterus becomes quiet and must be driven artificially
with the hormone oxytocin (Pitocin or Syntocinon). As the cervix becomes fully dilated and the head descends, the woman
(in a normal birth) feels pain and pressure in the lower pelvis and
rectum. The last injection of anesthetic during the process of
epidural anesthesia occurs after the head has rotated and come down
onto the perineum. Higher concentrations of anesthetic are used to
assure perineal relaxation. Sometimes the mother is sat upright or at
least at a 45 degree angle to be certain that the anesthetic will
descend to the sacral nerve roots. When the sacral nerve roots are
blocked, the woman looses the urge to push. After controlling for potentially confounding variables with multiple logistic regression analysis, Adashek, et al 4 found that epidural anesthesia was an independent risk factor for cesarean birth among women over age 35 (R = 0.195, p < 0.001). At the 1997 meeting of the American Society for Anesthesiology, a
press release was issued about four studies involving a combined
total of more than 22,000 women claiming that labor epidural
analgesia does not increase a woman's risk of having a cesarean
delivery. 5 Three of the studies were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of
Anesthesiologists. The fourth appeared in the September 1997 issue of
the medical journal of Anesthesiology. The findings have significant implications for physicians,
patients and insurers, said one of the researchers, Steven T.
Fogel, M.D., an anesthesiologist at Washington University School of
Medicine in St. Louis. "Some physicians and insurance companies limit
patient access to epidurals because they strongly believe that
epidurals can prolong labor, "Dr. Fogel said. "Delaying or
withholding an epidural forces the pregnant woman to suffer
needlessly and does not lower the cesarean rate." Each year, about one-million women choose epidural blocks for safe and effective pain relief during labor. A study by Dr. Fogel and colleagues at Washington University analyzed
labor and delivery data on 7,000 patients. The researchers compared
the cesarean rates among first-time mothers during the 12 months
before and the 16 months after epidural analgesia became available on
request at the hospital. They found no significant differences in
cesarean section rates before and after the services introduction.
"Epidural analgesia did not stop normal labor or cause cesarean
deliveries, because the rate of cesareans did not change," Dr. Fogel
said. Women may still require cesarean delivery following epidural blocks,
but no direct cause-and-effect relationship has ever been
established. "labor epidural anlagesia can be associated with , but
does not cause, cesarean section delivery," Dr Fogel said. "An
abnormal labor can produce extreme pain for mothers, and this pain
leads women to ask for epidurals," he said. "Our study has the advantage of following cesarean rates before and
after the introduction of a popular epidural service," Dr Fogel said.
"Since patient demographics and cesarean section rates did not
change, we can safely and accurately conclude that the total number
of cesarean deliveries performed was not affected by the
availability of epidural analgesia." Similar findings emerged from an analysis of data on more than 13,000
first-time mothers who gave birth between 1989 and 1995 at St. Luke's
Roosevelt Hospital Center, a teaching hospital of Columbia University
in New York City. The analysis showed that the mother's age, the baby's birth weight and
use of the labor-inducing drug oxytocin increased the women's risk
for cesarean sections. "Not only was epidural analgesia not a
significant risk factor but it was associated with slightly decreased
cesarean section delivery risk." anesthesiologist David J. Birnbach,
M.D., said. By relieving pain, epidural analgesia may help some patients relax
and this realization could facilitate labor, Dr. Birnbach said. "We're
not suggesting the technique will prevent cesarean sections," he
stressed, "but in our practice, epidurals are clearly not a cause."
In addition, the use of epidural analgesia almost doubled at the
hospital during the five years studied (from 37% to 68%) but the
percentage of cesarean sections deliveries did not increase, Dr.
Birnbach said. A third study at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
reviewed the labor and delivery records of more than 2300 women who
received ultra-low dose solutions of epidural medications. The
ultra-low dose epidurals allow many women's labor to proceed
comfortable, Stephen D. Pratt, M.D., said. For women requiring more
pain relief, additional medication can be given by the same epidural
route. The Boston study showed that women who needed additional pain relief
beyond the ultra-low dose were more likely to have cesareans. Women
who needed more than two additional doses were twice as likely to
require a cesarean section as those who do not. "The slow, abnormal
labor that leads to cesarean section is more painful than normal
labor and therefore requires stronger epidural medication," Dr Pratt
said. "Epidural do not cause cesarean sections. Rather women who have
abnormal labor may be in more pain and therefore are more likely to
need an epidural and stronger medication." The above three studies were retrospective studies done in choice
situations/hospitals that had actively taken a new approach to
reducing cesarean sections as well as hospitals that maintain such
high cesarean section rates that the comparisons would be
insignificant due to cesarean rates of over 30%. The only prospective study was the fourth one, conducted at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in
Dallas. 6 Seven hundred, fifteen
women of mixed parity in spontaneous labor at full term were randomly
assigned to receive either epidural anesthesia (EA) or
patient-controlled intravenous meperidine analgesia (PCMA). Epidural
analgesia was maintained with a continous infusion of 0.125%
bupivacaine with 2 pg/ml fentanyl. Patient controlled analgesia was
maintained as 10-15 mg meperidine given every 10 minutes as desired
by the patient using a patient-controlled pump. A total of 358 women were randomized to receive epidural anesthesia
and 243 (68%) complied. Similarly, 357 women were randomized to
receive patient-controlled analgesia, and 259 (73%) complied with
that protocol. Five women randomized to PCMA requested epidurals.
Based upon an intent to treat analysis, there was no difference in
the rate of cesarean deliveries between the two groups (EA, 4%, 95%
CI: 1.9-6.2%; PCMA, 5%, 95% CI: 2.6-7.2%. Women in the epidural group
reported lower pain scores during labor and delivery. What is amazing is that this study was used to argue that epidurals
did not increase risk for cesarean birth. What is lacking, of course,
is a reasonable control group, such as a doula. When one looks at the
amazingly high amounts of meperidine that women could
self-administer, it is no wonder that so few requested an epidural,
since they could hardly be expected to be very alert. A woman could
receive 90 mg of meperidine per hour. In actuality, the average amount
of meperidine a woman self-administered was 200 mg with the highest
amount being 500 mg. To give a sense of the amounts being given here,
routinely in the emergency department, for treating ureterolithiasis
(kidney stones), which most women agree is a more severe pain than
labor, I would rarely administer more than 150 to 200 mg of
meperidine over 12 hours. The average length of labor during which
these women received their meperidine was under 12 hours. No one has
asked the question of how such a massive dose of meperidine would
affect the cesarean rate. The authors stated, "Patient-Controlled intravenous analgesia is
widely used in the United States to manage postoperative pain,
although use during childbirth has been limited. One concern is
newborn respiratory depression from increased narcotic administration
to the mother. Many women in our study used more than 200 mg of
meperidine during the course of their labor, but only 3.4% of infants
were given naloxone to reverse respiratory depression. The mothers
were visibly sedated but were invariably arousable and none
experienced respiratory depression."  Since neither of us have never had to give an infant naloxone in over 1000 deliveries, we wonder what the indications would actually be. We suspect these infants were quite depressed to receive naloxone. Our experience with patient controlled analgesia is that the reason the patient stops pushing the button is that she gets so high a dose that she falls asleep. I suspect the mothers were more compromised than the authors think, but none had to be intubated or artificially ventilated, therefore, none experience respiratory depression. The authors also under-emphasized the fact that all patients were
enrolled at the same time in an aggressive program to reduce cesarean
birth, consisting of:   No use of electronic fetal monitoring, even for epidurals (except
for one test strip on admission), thereby necessitating nurse
auscultation of the fetal heart rate and one-on-one patient care,
both well known to reduce
the cesarean rate.  No patient admitted to the hospital before 4-5 cm of cervical
dilation, also known to lower the cesarean rate.  No drugs or epidurals until the woman was 5 cm dilated, also known
to reduce the cesarean rate.  All births attended by CNMs, which is known to reduce the cesarean
rate by one-third of what obstetricians would do. For example, a
study from Los Angeles County-USC Hospital showed a 4% cesarean rate
in a 95% Hispanic population when they were attended by
nurse-midwives. 7  Use of a black and Hispanic population. In an editorial
discussion, the authors, themselves, comment on black and Hispanic
populations having historically lower cesarean rates.   The authors' real conclusions are this: If you do everything possible
to reduce the cesarean rate for all patients, and then, if you
compare epidural anesthesia with high dose, self-administered
narcotic analgesia, there is no difference in the cesarean rate. This
is not really a very outstanding conclusion, though the popular press
read this result as saying epidural anesthesia is now proven safe and
unlikely to increase the cesarean rate (without addressing the
question, over what? Some infants (0.8%) in the epidural group also required naloxone. Two
transfers to NICU occurred in the epidural group and 3 in PCMA
group. Looking just at those who had epidurals vs. those who didn't,
epidurals prolonged the first stage of labor and increased the
incidence of oxytocin administration. Fever developed in more women
during epidural anesthesia. There was no difference in the number of
cesareans in the epidural vs. the PCIA group (the range from 3% to 7%
cesarean rate). Regarding other complications, 24% of women having epidurals had
fever compared to 6% in PCMA. Nine percent had forceps with epidural
compared to 3% with PCMA. There was a15-19% range of meconium during
labor (not different between groups), which we find rather high.
There was a rate of 1.2-1.8% of infants suffering meconium aspiration
(not different between groups), but also rather high in our
experience.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   2. Significant Low Blood Pressure (Hypotension): Significant low blood pressure is a complication of epidural anesthesia. 1 The ways that epiduralized patients must lie accentuate this. Their position is limited since they are essentially paralyzed people for the duration of the epidural. Hypotension occurs among almost one-third of patients with serious hypotension occurring about 12% of the time. 8  Maternal hypotension is a major risk for the baby. The epidural
blocks the nerves which regulate blood pressure. It causes the blood
in the body to pool, keeping it from being pumped around the body in
the proper manner. The arteries dilate and relax their usual,
necessary level of tension, making it difficult for the heart to pump
blood to the baby. These changes lead to a decrease in the output of
the mothers heart. Less blood per unit time can reach the placenta
and therefore the baby. The baby is completely dependent on the mothers heart to pump blood
to the placenta to satisfy its needs. All of its oxygen comes across
from the placenta. All of the food for its brain and other organs
comes across the placenta. Brains cannot live without a relatively
constant supply of oxygen and glucose. Without this they become
damaged. A good blood flow is needed to the uterus between contractions so it
can get fresh oxygen. During the contraction, blood flow to the
uterus is cut off by the muscles contracting. When the contraction
stops, the uterus must quickly refill with fresh blood containing
oxygen for the baby. If the amount of blood flowing to the uterus is
reduced, the baby may not be able to get the oxygen it needs. Then
what is called fetal distress may occur. The baby's system does not
get enough oxygen and goes into distress. Its blood retains excess
acid, the oxygen levels go low and tissues and vital organs begin to
fail from excess acid, lack of oxygen and lack of fuel. Animal studies have shown that lack of oxygen to the baby (called fetal hypoxia) can cause significant damage to the babys brain even without the pH of the baby's umbilical cord blood being
affected. 9 (The pH of the babys umbilical cord blood at birth is usually used as an indicator of whether or not fetal hypoxia has occurred.) Severe low blood pressure can also result from compression of
the mothers blood vessels (aorta and vena cava) since all mothers
must lie essentially flat on their back after epidural anesthesia
(they cannot feel or move their back, pelvis and
legs). 10   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   3. Fetal Distress: Fetal heart rate decelerations can occur
following the use of epidurals. 1 Babies can develop fetal
distress after epidural
anesthesia. 11 This may be caused
by the mothers blood pressure getting so low that blood cannot be
adequately pumped into the uterus to deliver oxygen to the baby. As
we mentioned above, epidurals make it difficult for the muscles in
the arteries of the lower body to respond and to keep blood
adequately flowing through the body. The ability of the heart to
respond to changing needs of the body is
impaired. 12 Eberle and
Norris 1 suggest that [i]nduction of maternal analgesia may
transiently alter the balance between factors encouraging and
discouraging uterine contraction. A temporary increase in the
uterotonic effects of endogenous or exogenous oxytocin may then
produce a tetanic contraction with subsequent decrease fetal oxygen
delivery and resultant fetal bradycardia. Most babies of mothers receiving epidural anesthesia develop episodes of slow heart rate (bradycardia). 13 While this does not usually affect the healthy baby, it can be disastrous for the baby that is already compromised from some other problem (often unknown to the doctors). Adverse effects on the baby indicative of insufficient oxygen
reaching the baby (late decelerations) can occur. These changes may
also result from a toxic effect to the baby of the local anesthetic
given in the epidural. The transient low blood pressure which always occurs after epidural anesthesia has been found to lead to significantly lower the baby's blood pH. 14 This indicates excess blood acid, usually meaning that the baby is not getting enough oxygen. Anesthesiologists dont think that this makes any difference in the baby's outcome, but we suspect, if we studied babies already at risk for other reasons, we would find that epidural significantly worsens compromised babies and may lead to a Cesarean birth when the baby might have otherwise tolerated a vaginal birth. We suspect that more detailed research would identify a group of babies who would have tolerated unmedicated, normal birth, but who are unable to handle the added stress of the epidural, leading in the worst causes to death or permanent disability.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   4. IV Cannulation: Accidental injection of the anesthetic
solution into the blood stream can occur and can cause the mother to
twitch, have convulsions, or lose of consciousness. Seizures
can occur from the toxic effects of the anesthetic agent entering the
blood stream. 15 Local
anesthetic toxicity occurred among 12 women in 1000
epidurals. 16   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   5. Trauma to Blood Vessels: Trauma to blood vessels can occur as a result of epidural anesthesia. 17 In one study, bleeding
in the spinal column and unintentional placement of the catheter into
an artery or vein occurred 0.67% of the time (67 women of every 1000
epidurals). 18 The catheter
actually escapes outside of where it is supposed to go 1 to 6% of the
time. 19  Hemorrhages can occur around the spinal cord and even within the
skull following epidural
anesthesia. 20 These were
associated with persistent backaches or headaches. Failure to treat
these problems usually results in permanent paralysis. Surgery must
be performed within 8 hours of the onset of paralysis or the
prognosis is poor. Chronic subdural hematoma has resulted from
epidural anesthesia and has even presented as post-partum
psychosis. 21   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   6. Punctured Dura: The actual dura may be punctured as a result of epidural anesthesia. Because of the large size of the
needle used, severe headache may also result. Dural punctures have been
found to occur about 1.8% of the
time. 22 Unintentional dural
puncture occurred in 61 of 1000 epidurals in a University
hospital (resulting in spinal
anesthesia). 23   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   7. Infection: An infection can develop at the site of
injection. Bacterial meningitis can occur from contamination
during placement of the
epidural. 24 An abscess can also form
at the site where the epidural catheter is
placed. 25  26   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   8. Backache: Backache after an epidural is a common complication. Back pain
commonly occurs after epidural anesthesia (18.9% of the
time 27 ). Upper back pain can
happen at some distance from the site where the epidural is
injected. 28 The back pain can
last very long-term. 29 Nineteen
percent of women had long-term backache after epidural
anesthesia. 30 It probably
results from a combination of its effects on the nerves and from
extreme postures and stretching that occurs after the epidural during
labor. Low back pain after epidural anesthesia for childbirth is also frequently
mentioned. 31   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   9. Broken catheters: Occasionally the catheter has
broken and a small piece is left in place. It usually causes no
ill effects.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   10. Abnormal Uterine Contractions: Uterine contractions can become weaker and less frequent.
An oxytocin infusion is then necessary to improve labor and produce
good strength contractions Mothers having epidurals have longer
labors and have a higher incidence of the use of oxytocin than
mothers having non-medicated
deliveries. 32  There are important risks of giving oxytocin also. Administration of
this hormone to the mother during labor can cause:    Dangerously high blood pressure. Abnormal heart rhythms. Nausea and vomiting. Sustained uterine contractions which last too long and result in the baby going into distress from lack of oxygen. When this is too severe, the uterus can rupture. The epidural can mask the strength of the uterine contractions so that no one knows that how strong they are, making uterine rupture more possible. Hemorrhage around the brain. Retention of water leading to convulsions and coma. Bleeding in the pelvis and increased incidence of postpartum hemorrhage. Death of the baby. Jaundice of the baby.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   11. Second Stage Labor Effects: With large doses the patient
loses the desire and the ability to bear down and push. This results
in an increased use of forceps and vacuum extractions over women
having unmedicated
deliveries. 33   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   12. Inadequate Pain Relief: The epidural is generally
inadequate 7.1% of the time, leading to supplementation with
intravenous pain medication 4.0% of the time and a general anesthetic
3.1% of the time (in one
study). 34   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   13. Accidental Spinal Anesthesia: When an epidural
accidentally turns into a spinal anesthetic, many complications can
occur:    Postspinal headaches. Dysfunction of the bladder is frequent Occasionally numbness and tingling (paresthesias) of the lower limbs and abdomen develop, and sometimes there is a temporary loss or diminution of sensation in these areas. Unilateral footdrop (paralysis of the muscle that lifts the foot) has occurred. Permanent nerve damage (conditions called chronic, progressive adhesive arachnoiditis or transverse myelitis) can occur. These lead to paralysis of the lower parts of the body. Deaths have been reported. Difficult breathing Increased incidence of forceps deliveries.   The reliability of spinal anesthesia with 5% hyperbaric lignocaine
was studied among 30 patients undergoing elective Cesarean. Twelve
patients had hypotension and four developed severe postspinal
headaches. The block progressed to the C2 dermatome in four patients
and was associated with dysphagia. This was totally unpredicted and
was thought due to altered cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in late
pregnancy. 35   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   14. Maternal Heart Attack or Spinal Cord Ischemia: The lack of
ability of the heart to pump blood around the body (from low blood
pressure or pooling of blood) can become so severe that a heart
attack occurs or the spinal cord will suffer damage from not enough
blood reaching it. 36   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   15. Asthmatics: Asthmatics can get suddenly worse during epidural
anesthesia 37 with more wheezing
and inability to breath.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   16. Medication interactions: A hidden danger of epidural anesthesia is its interaction with
medications (prostaglandins) commonly used to soften the cervix
and start labor. The use of prostaglandins is common at hospitals
and creates a potentially dangerous situation in which the
usual medications used to treat low blood pressure during
labor will no longer work. 38   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   17. Interactions Occur with Other Illnesses: As an example, women who have
migraines can have more visual disturbances after
epidurals. 39   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   18. Maternal Fever & Malignant Hyperthermia: Maternal fever and even the severe condition called
malignant hyperthermia (dangerously high fever) can
result. 40  41   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   19. Respiratory Arrests: Mothers can stop breathing
(respiratory arrest) 42  43 and can experience other
breathing difficulties. 44 Greenhalgh * reported a 19 year old obstetric patient who
had a respiratory arrest shortly after receiving intrathecal
sufentanil and bupivacaine as part of a combined epidural/spinal
technique for pain relief.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   20. Other Neurological Disabilties: Other neurological disabilities (including a condition
called Horners syndrome) can develop along with hoarseness
(from even just one dose of epidural
anesthetic). 45 Clayton 46 reported an incidence
of Horner's syndrome during epidural anesthesia for elective
Caesarean section of 4%. The incidence of Horner's syndrome with
epidural anesthesia for vaginal delivery was 1.33%. They found it
impossible to predict which patients would develop a Horner's
syndrome. Even the nerves to the face can be blocked, sometimes
temporarily, sometimes
permanently. 47 Tremors and
shakes can occur. 48  49  Paresthesias (persistent tingling from sensory nerves)
occurred in 0.16% of patients in one study (1.6 per 1000) with an
incidence of persistent neuropathy of 0.04% (4 per
10,000). 50 Four of these
patients had a neuropathy which eventually resolved. In another study
3.0% of patients had tingling of the hands or fingers, while 26 of
almost 5000 women had persistent tingling or numbness in the lower
back, buttocks or legs. 51  Dizziness and fainting can become a problem after epidurals. One
study found these symptoms persisting in 2.1% of
women. 52   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   21. Nausea and Vomiting: Twenty to 30 percent of women
experience nausea after epidural anesthesia, while 3 to 7% have
vomiting. 53   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   22. Allergic Conditions: A dangerous allergic condition with shock (called
anaphylaxis) can occur. 54 The
woman develops a red rash (erythema), itches, and her lungs fill up
with fluid (pulmonary edema). Excessive lung fluid is also found in
the babies in these cases. 55   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   23. Heart Problems: Mothers can experience excessively slow heart rates
(bradycardia), heart block in which the electrical activity of the
chambers of the heart become dissociated and sometimes even stoppage
of the heart (cardiac
arrest). 56   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   24. Headache: Headache after epidural is a persistent problem that is
more pronounced in younger
patients. 57 One study found its
incidence after epidural anesthesia to be 4.6%, significantly more
often than women not having
epidurals. 58 It usually occurs
from the effects of puncturing the dura. Headache can also occur from
air getting into the spinal fluid (called an iatrogenic
pneumocephalus). The air is introduced into the spinal fluid and
column when the test dose is given that is assumed to be in the
extra-dural space. When the person giving the epidural feels a loss
of resistance to the injection of air, this is when a pneumocephalus
can occur. The patient that was described complained immediately of
severe headache on both sides of her forehead followed by vomiting.
The baby had to be delivered by Cesarean with general anesthesia. The
patients headache resolved in 24 hours after Cesarean. Of 34 women with spinal headache (from 4766 epidurals), nine had
long-term disability from headache. Five of these were from
accidental dural puncture and four occurred after accidental spinal
block. 59   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   25. Motor Blockade: Epidural anesthesia can produce motor
blockade, resulting in temporary paralysis, even of respiratory
muscles. 60   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   26. Use in VBAC: Epidurals are sometimes used with women
desiring VBAC. Leung, et al. 61 studied the maternal and fetal consequences of uterine rupture during
VBAC. They concluded that significant neonatal morbidity occurred
when > or = 18 minutes elapsed between the onset of prolonged
deceleration and delivery. In 106 cases of uterine rupture at their
institution between Jan 1, 1983 and June 30, 1992, seven charts
were incomplete and excluded; of the remainder, 28 patients had
complete, 13 patients had partial, and 58 patients had no fetal
extrusion into the maternal abdomen. Maternal characteristics or
intrapartum events were not predictive of the catastrophic extent of
uterine rupture. There was one maternal death. Complete fetal
extrusion was associated with a higher incidence of perinatal
mortality and morbidity.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   27. Technical Considerations: Epidural anesthesia is a technical procedure that requires
significant skill to place correctly. Many papers document the
technical aspects of this procedure which are not insignificant. For
example, 23% of epidural catheters inserted more than 2 cm into the
epidural space required manipulation. Epidural catheters inserted 8
cm within the epidural space were more likely to result in iv
cannulation. Epidural catheters inserted 2 cm within the epidural
space were more likely to become dislodged. Epidural catheters
inserted 2 to 4 cm within the epidural space required replacement
more often than catheters inserted deeper. 62   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   28. Herpes Simplex Assocation: Epidural analgesia is
associated with recurrence of herpes simplex blepharitis after
cesarean section when epidural morphine is
given. 63    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Case Examples (Mild Problems) Here is an example of a 30 year old woman having her first baby who was admitted to the hospital
at 2 cm dilation at 11:05 pm. 64 By 4:30 am, she was 4 cm dilated with her waters broken and requested
epidural anesthesia. Her mother and her husband were in attendance coaching her. The epidural was started at 5:01 am and within 30 seconds, the patients heart rate began to climb steadily and precipitously from 88 to 174, levelling off at that rate.  The certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) discovered that the
patient had previously experienced heart palpitations: when stressed
or with heavy exercise. She had begun to feel mild nausea and
dizziness. Oxygen was administered and an iv drug (adenosine) was
given. A second dose followed five minutes later. The abnormal heart
rate (a supraventricular tachycardia) returned to normal and the
woman had a normal vaginal delivery within 6 hours of this episode.
This occurred presumable from a sensitivity to medication placed
through the epidural catheter. When complications such as this occur,
fetal scalp electrodes are usually placed to monitor the baby's EKG.
The therapy sometimes causes severe hypotension. A case has been reported in which a 24 year old woman with a past
history of mild backache had an epidural anesthesia. She had an acute
vagal reaction with loss of consciousness and her head falling
forward. Thirty-six hours later, she complained of severe pains all
over her spine, together with sciatica and spasm of the muscles on
either side of the spinal column (paravertebral muscles). None of
these symptoms responded to drug treatment. The pain eventually
disappeared after she wore a cervical collar, taking
anti-inflammatory drugs and having spinal manipulations (what
chiropractors and osteopaths do) It was thought that her backache was
due to what is called a posterior articular joint syndrome in which
the forward fall of her head strained the posterior joints of the
spinal column. 65    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Permanent Disability from Epidural Anesthesia  a. A disabling condition called spinal arachnoiditis can
develop after epidural anesthesia. Of 6 such women, 3 were
permanently confined to a wheelchair three years after their initial
evaluation. 66 None of these
patients had any prior spinal surgery or trauma or problems with the
spinal cord including previous hemorrhage, infections or other known
causes of arachnoiditis. They had no neurological symptoms prior to
epidural anesthesia. The diagnosis was confirmed by a medical test
called myelography in all cases. The epidurals were uneventful and
performed according to standard methods. Arachnoiditis is probably caused from the epidural injection of
foreign substances (the anesthetic itself or contaminants in the
solution) into the spinal canal. Subarachnoid cysts can occur in the spine from arachnoiditis produced
from the epidural
anesthetic. 67   b. Paralysis can occur. 68 The injection of the local anesthetic into the epidural space can
result in the veins becoming engorged, the spinal cord suffering from
a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and the woman developing acute
neurological problems. Some of these deficits can become
permanent. 69 Paralysis can also
occur from bleeding into the area during the epidural injection with
the formation of a pocket of blood pressing on the spinal cord
(hematoma). It can also occur from infection or trauma. Cranial nerve paralysis can occur at quite a distance from the site
of the epidural. This is thought to occur from traction on the spinal
cord. 70  Paralysis can occur from a condition called anterior spinal artery
syndrome after epidural anesthesia during
labor. 71 Paralysis can occur
when the blood flow to the spinal cord becomes so limited that tissue
dies. This is called an infarction. A case report of an infarction
after epidural anesthesia has been published in which leg paralysis
occurred and did not recover. A loss of sensation to pain and
temperature also occurred to the level of the mid-chest which
partially resolved. 72  Of 108 non-fatal complications in one study, five were associated
with permanent disability. 73 These included damage (neuropathy) to a single spinal nerve, acute
toxicity from the local anesthetic, and problems associated with
accidental puncture of the dura to become a spinal anesthetic. Another patient developed paralysis after epidural anesthesia
probably due to the anterior spinal artery or central arteries being
blocked during the epidural and leading to death of part of the
spinal cord. 74  Neuropathy is a condition in which sensory changes occur (loss
of sensation or hypersensitivity to sensation) with or without
chronic pain. Neuropathy occurs after epidural anesthesia. It can
occur from thrombosis of an artery from trauma from the epidural
injection or from the catheter. A lack of adequate blood flow (and
therefore oxygen) is called ischemia. This can cause neuropathy
also. 75    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Deaths from Epidural Anesthesia Here are some examples of women who have died from epidural anesthesia to illustrate the dangers. A healthy, 31 year old woman having her third child requested
epidural anesthesia and developed an acute condition of fluid in the
lungs (pulmonary edema). She could not be successfully
resuscitated. The baby also
died. 76  Sudden stoppage of the heart (cardiac arrest) can occur during
epidural anesthesia. 77  78 along with other heart rhythm
changes. 79 Sudden cardiac arrest
may be caused by air getting into veins during placement of the
epidural. 80  Respiratory insufficiency can occur and cause death. In one
case report, the patient initially developed pain in the
shoulder-neck region after epidural anesthesia, followed by fever and
an elevated white blood count. This led to a high-level (arms and
legs) paralysis with an inability to breath. Many problems then
developed with the heart and arterial system. An abscess was found
and the patient was eventually stabilized with antibiotics. The
patient required chronic mechanical ventilation and died of recurrent
pneumonia after 5 months of intensive care. The incidence of
breathing difficulties in one study was 0.54%, although only 5% of
those patients required prolonged artificial ventilation. Total
spinal anesthesia occurred in 0.013% of the epidurals but more than
half of these cases required intubation and prolonged mechanical
ventilation. Partial spinal anesthesia (sub-arachnoid block) occurred
in 0.04% of the cases. 81  Women are almost never given informed consent for epidurals. Even if they were just read two paragraphs from the package insert that comes with the medication used for epidurals (manufactured by Abbott
Laboratories), they might think twice. The package insert states:         Local anesthetics rapidly cross the placenta, and when used for
epidural, caudal or pudendal anesthesia, can cause varying degrees of
maternal, fetal and neonatal toxicity.... Adverse reactions in the
parturient, fetus and neonate involve alternations of the central
nervous system, peripheral vascular tone and cardiac function.... Neurologic effects following epidural or caudal anesthesia may
include spinal block of varying magnitude (including high or total
spinal block); hypotension secondary to spinal block; urinary
retention; fecal and urinary incontinence; loss of perineal sensation
and sexual function; persistent anesthesia, paresthesia, weakness,
paralysis of the lower extremities and loss of sphincter control all
of which may have slow, incomplete or no recovery; headache;
backache; septic meningitis; meningismus; slowing of labor; increased
incidence of forceps delivery; cranial nerve palsies due to traction
on nerves from loss of cerebrospinal fluid.         Who would sign a consent if it included the above language? The
degree to which the facts about the risks of epidural anesthesia are
hidden from women in labor is astonishing. Mothers who have a fever are significantly more likely to have had
epidural anesthesia. 82 Therefor
increasing the incidence of septic workups on newborns and the
subsequent complications of this procedure. We would hope that pregnant women would have a more informed
explanation of the risks of epidural anesthesia than what is
currently given, and would suspect that many would make other choices
if true informed consent was given (before labor, when the woman
still has time to prepare to cope with childbirth pain in other
ways).    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Critique of 3 Other Studies As we said the study we just discussed was the only prospective study. The other three studies are papers not yet published so we can only comment on the abstracts of these studies, they were "presented"
at the conference of the American Society of Anesthesiologists in November of 1997. Presented means that the paper was talked about at the conference and has not necessarily been accepted by a major medical journal for publication as of yet and may/or may not be.    1st Additional Study:   TITLE: Does epidural analgesia protect against cesarean section in nulliparous patients?   AUTHORS: DJ Burnbach, MD, A Grunebaum, MD, DJ Stem, MD, B Katgaem MD, MM Kuroda, MPH, DM Thys, MD   AFFILIATION: Department of Anesthesiology and Ob/Gyn, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY   INTRODUCTION: Recent articles have suggested that epidural analgesia may increase the risk of cesarean section. (1,2) In an effort to evaluate whether epidural analgesia during labor is associated with an increased risk of cesarean section at our institution, we evaluated the labor data of nulliparous patients who delivered at the hospital between 1989-1995.  METHODS : From January 1, 1989 -December 31, 1995, there were a total
of

31,670 deliveries at the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. The
13,203

nulliparous patients who delivered under the care of an obstetrician
during

that period of time constituted the study population. The following
were

the independent variables: type of labor analgesia administered,
patient

age, obstetric care provider (private vs. non-private), birth weight,
and

use of oxytocin for stimulation or induction. The dependent variable
was

the delivery mode. A non-hierarchical logistic regression was
performed to

determine which of these independent variables contributed to the
risk of

cesarean section.  RESULTS: Logistic analysis demonstrated that the highest risks for
cesarean

section were associated with oxytocin induction and maternal age. As
shown

in Table 1, other significant predictors of cesarean delivery were
oxytocin

for stimulation, patient status (private patients were at an
increased risk

of cesarean section) and birth weight. Epidural analgesia, on the
other

hand, was associated with a slightly decreased risk for cesarean
section.

For example, patients under 30 years of age who were induced with
oxytocin

who received epidural analgesia had a 32% cesarean section rate
(230/719)

versus a 39.1% cesarean section rate (70/179) for the same group
of

patients who did not receive an epidural anesthetic. Patients greater
than

29 years of age who were induced with oxytocin and received an
epidural had

a 45.4% cesarean section rate (114/251) versus a 58% cesarean section
rate

(51/88) for the same group of patients who did not receive an
epidural. Table 1:     Independent Variables  Odds Ratio  Confidence Interval    Oxytocin Induction  1.93  1.70 - 2.19    Maternal Age (per 10 years)  1.60  1.53 - 1.68    Birth Weight (per 1000g)  1.20  1.13 - 1.27    Oxytocin Stimulation  1.17  1.06 - 1.30    Patient Status (pvt. vs clinic)  1.10  1.01 - 1.16    Epidural Analgesia  0.89  0.81 - 0.97     DISCUSSION: Our data support other studies that have shown an
increased

risk of cesarean section with use of oxytocin, increased maternal
age, and

private patient status.(3) When controlled for other variables,
the

administration of epidural analgesia was associated with a decreased
risk

of cesarean section. Based on our data, we suggest that epidural
analgesia

as practiced at our institution, is associated with a decrease in
cesarean

section rate in nulliparous patients.  1. Obstet Gynecol 1996;88:993-1000 2. Am J Obstet Gynecol 1993;169:851-8 3. Am J Obstet Gynecol 1993;168:1881-5  CRITIQUE:  A major statistical problem with the study, which prevents the
authors from making the conclusions they have made, is the failure to
consider the interaction between epidural anesthesia and oxytocin
stimulation. Many studies have shown that epidural anesthesia
increases the need for oxytocin stimulations [refs]. A proper
statistical procedure would have been to use an interactive term for
epidural and oxytocin stimulation. I would have started with a
multivariate analysis of variance which would have considered the
interaction between epidural anesthesia and the other variables. The
authors believe (erroneously) that they are dealing with independent
variables. Clearly we all know that there is an association between
oxytocin induction and epidurals (more difficult labors; more likely
to have an epidural), maternal age (younger and older mothers are
more likely to have epidurals), oxytocin stimuation (women who have
epidurals are more likely to need oxytocin stimuation because of the
desultory effect of the epidural on uterine contractions, private
patients are more likely to have epidurals. The more sophisticated
approach to their paper would have been to use a technique such as
structural equations modeling (LISREL, or related procedures) to test
paths of effects. For example, one can test the hypothesis that
epidurals affect the cesarean rate through their effect on the need
for uterine stimulation. That could still be done with the authors'
data, and we plan to challenge them to an independent data analysis
(by our colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh) using path
analysis to test these hypotheses. Simply using logistic regression
in this context was inappropriately simplistic, but done probably
because it supported their bias (epidurals are good!). I suspect the
authors are well-informed and have excellent biostatistical
consultation, and chose not to report these other analyses that they
probably did, because these other analyses did not support their
position. I would draw your attention to another part of the abstract. Is it
reasonable practice to do cesareans on 58% of women who are older
than 29 years and are being induced? Are these numbers generalizable?
I was shocked to read this figure. In all my experience in
obstetrics, I can't imagine how you can perform a cesarean on 58% of
the women over age 29 whom you are inducing. I would very much like
to see their criteria for cesarean. With such high rates (45% in the
epidural group and 58% in the non-epidural group), I question how
generalizable these results are to good practice elsewhere. Perhaps
in an environment (consider how stressful this environment must be)
in which such high cesarean rates occur, epidurals do decrease the
risk for cesarean if you are being induced, but I can't believe that
such high cesarean rates constitute safe and prudent practice. I would like to see their overall complication rates, including
post-partum infection and the backache/headache complications of
epidurals. I suspect their morbidity is quite high.    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   2nd & 3rd Additional Studies:  Two other studies shed some light on this debate. The first is Newton
ER, Schroeder BC, Knape KG, Bennett BL. Epidural analgesia and
uterine function . Obstet Gynecol 1995; 85:749-55.  "Continuous epidural analgesia with bupivacaine and fentanyl did not
result in a change in myometrial contractility in the first hour
after initiation of analgesia. However, despite more oxytocin
therapy, the rate of cervical dilation was significantly slower in
the epidural group than in the nonepidural group (1.9 versus 5.6
cm/hr, p < 0.001). Operative deliveries were more common in
patients with epidural analgesia than in those without it (12 of 62
versus 2 of 124, p < 0.0001). After epidural analgesia, myometrial
contractility is maintained with oxytocin, but the ability of the
uterus to dilate the uterus is reduced significantly."   Also important, Albers LL, Anderson D, Cragin L, Daniels SM, Hunter
C, Sedler KD, Teaf D. The relationship of ambulation in labor to
operative delivery . JNM 1997; 42(1):4-8.  "Women who ambulated for a significant amount of time during labor
(compared with those who did not ambulate) had half the rate of
operative delivery (2.7% versus 5.5%)." It's very hard to ambulate
with either an epidural or PCIA.  Two others studies have been widely quoted in the popular press. They
included a study by Dr. Steven Fogel, an anesthesiologist at
Washington University School of Medicine, in St. Louis. Dr. Fogel
looked at data on 7,000 patients delivering over a 28 month period at
his hospital. He compared cesarean rates for first time mothers
before the introduction of an epidural on demand anesthesia service
to cesarean rates after the introduction of the service, finding no
change. What isn't reported is how obstetrical practices changed
during this time interval, a very significant factor. Such historical
studies are notoriously unreliable because policies change so rapidly
in obstetrical management. Without such information, the study is
meaningless. The final study was done at Boston's Beth Isreal-Deaconess Medical
Center by anesthesiologist Steven Pratt. This study reviewed the
labor and delivery records of more than 2300 women who received
ultra-low dose solutions of epidural medications. The study showed
that women who needed additional pain relief beyond the low-doses
were more likely to have cesareans than women who did not. Dr. Pratt
argued that it was harder labors that caused cesareans and not
epidurals. This study was so anecdotal as to be hardly worth
commenting upon. What Dr. Pratt failed to note was that several
others studies have shown that patient satisfaction with low-dose
epidurals is very low and that more than half of women have
additional medication. Pratt's study actually supports the point of
view that epidurals lead to increased cesareans, when this
information is taken into account. What is amazing is the propagandizing that went on in the press. The
gold standard in medicine consists of randomized, controlled trials.
These have been done and do generally show increased cesarean rates.
To try and argue against these much better quality studies with
retrospective studies using historical controls is poor science, but
clearly good propaganda. To conclude we list some of these studies
and their conclusions:  Prospective Clinical Trials Investigating the Association between

How Safe Are Epidurals?  Statistics show that nearly 75 percent of women who give birth in America choose to have an epidural injection ( image ), the remaining choosing a natural birth. The rise in popularity of epidurals in recent years is linked to their relative safety record and successful pain relief results. So in answer to the question, yes, epidurals are considered relatively safe. One recent study by Cochrane Collaboration reviewed 21 clinical trials involving more than 6,500 births. They reported no increase in C-section rates among women who took an epidural anesthesia compared to those who did not. They did find however that those who took epidurals spent on average 15 minutes more in the second stage of labor (the pushing part). These women were also 18 percent more likely to need the drug pitocin, to artificially speed up the process ( labor induction ). The researchers also compared the well-being of the babies born and found no difference between the babies born to mothers who took an epidural than those who did not.   Bottom Line : Most doctors say that an epidural will reduce the amount of pain a woman feels during delivery and childbirth ; and that the medication is safe for both mother and child. Anecdotally many women complain of severe headaches and/or drowsiness for days after an epidural. Some of those who go on to experience a drug-free home birth in subsequent pregnancies, say that while it  hurt more, they felt much better immediately afterwards. Many feel that waterbirths help to reduce the pain of childbirth naturally. See also, is a home birth safe?    When Should An Epidural NOT Be Given? If: • Your cervix is less than 4cm dilated. You still need to wait. • If the epidural space, the tiny area where the needle needs to be inserted, cannot be located by the physician. • You are hemorrhaging. • You are taking blood thinners or antiplatelets for an ongoing medical condition. • If you have a low blood platelet count or a blood infection. • If labor is moving so fast that there is not enough time to prepare and administer the drug.  Interesting Epidural Risk Statistics As an epidural is an injection into the spine, some women may worry about the chance of something going wrong in this delicate area. Rest assured, the risk of paralysis (paraplegia) is very, very rare - statistically it happens in 1 in every 250,000 cases.  More common is an accidental puncture (1 in 100 cases) where  the doctor tries to insert the needle in the epidural space, a tiny area about 3-5mm deep, but accidentally misses it. This can lead to the severe headaches we discussed above which can last for several days.  Note: An epidural cannot be given in birthing centers or during a home birth ( image ). They require hospitalization.  • Need more information about childbirth? See: Guide To Childbirth • Got another question?

Share  On Facebook    Tweet  This    Reddit This    Share  This    Email    Leave A  Comment        by Amy B.  – on Sep 02nd  in Belly Talk   As if a pregnant woman doesn’t have enough to worry about, she may need to be concerned with getting an epidural – one of the things that’s supposed to help relieve pain and take the edge off an intense labor or prevent feeling during a C-section. And, epidurals are even given as pain management solutions for spinal and other chronic issues.  Although it’s extremely rare, it’s possible for epidurals to cause severe pain, spinal problems like arachnoiditis, and even temporary or lifelong paralysis. Unfortunately, many patients aren’t told about all of the possible complications before they opt for an epidural, making a devastating outcome even more surprising and difficult to cope with.  According to ScienceDaily, less than 1 in 200,000 people given an epidural are permanently or severely harmed, but as these cases show, it can happen.  The women in this article have all had different types of paralysis – from temporary to severe and lifelong – from their epidurals. It’s incredibly scary to think that something so routine can cause such severe effects on one’s health, but it’s also important to be aware of the risks of an epidural so women can be fully prepared and in control of their own health when creating their birth plans.  15 Major Medicine Mix-Up                     Advertising [x]        One woman in Sweden had a horrifying mix-up that never should have happened when she went to the hospital to give birth in July 2014. She was given what she thought was an epidural, but at some point, the containers for the epidural and a disinfectant were switched, leaving the mom with what could have been a fatal dose of disinfectant instead of an epidural.  The disinfectant was chlorhexidine, which is used to disinfect medical tools, like catheters. Fortunately, the dose was small enough that it didn’t leave any lasting damage to the woman. But, she spent two weeks in the hospital after her birth in a tremendous amount of pain – her husband described it as “electric jolts” - that left her unable to move her body properly as if she had a temporary paralysis.  14 Routine Procedure Goes Wrong                     Advertising [x]        Irrum Jethra’s case is one of the most well-known cases of epidurals related to childbirth gone wrong. Her story has been plastered on almost every online news outlet imaginable, and it’s easy to see why. Irrum’s first child’s birth was supposed to go as “normally” as possible, but when she received an epidural, things went downhill. For hours after her daughter’s birth, Irrum still had no feeling in her legs, which is uncommon for epidural recipients.  Eventually, Irrum’s doctors found that she had a rare blood clot caused by the epidural that compressed her spinal cord, causing paralysis. It’s unknown at this point if she will ever regain feeling in her lower body , but Irrum undergoes several hours of daily treatments with a therapist to try to get her legs working – or at least, feeling – again.  13 Too Painful To Sit After Birth                     Advertising [x]        Debra Shaw had her daughter in 2003, and since then, her life hadn’t been the same. She suffered damage to her coccyx, or the tail bone, during her daughter’s birth, which was long and intense for Debra because her daughter wasn’t positioned properly in the womb. But, to make matters worse, Debra’s anesthesiologist – who was a trainee - couldn’t find the proper place for the epidural to go, leaving her like a human pin cushion until he found the right spot.  Debra believes that the epidural possibly damaged her coccyx, which then became exacerbated by her rough labor and pushing. For years after the birth, with the worst pain starting around the time her daughter was two, Debra found it too painful to sit down because her coccyx had been pushed to an abnormal position, creating almost a reverse paralysis. Debra has since entered yoga and other treatments but has never regained full mobility without pain.  12 Scary Situation Post-Epidural                     One husband on Reddit asked some of his peers for help regarding his wife’s condition after receiving an epidural for pain during the birth of the couple’s baby. During the procedure, the wife had felt a liquidy sensation going down her leg, to which the anesthesiologist said something about hitting a pocket, but no more was said beyond that. After the birth, his wife got several hot flashes and her right leg was still feeling numb.  The husband asked others what they thought may be the problem with his wife, as she was still experiencing numbness in her leg to the point that she was unable to walk, severe hot flashes, and no appetite. Fortunately, the wife was, at the time of the husband’s writing, under the care of a doctor and undergoing some testing to find out the problem, rather than relying on Reddit users to solve the puzzle.  11 A Change Of Mind Led To Disaster                     Lisa Mann gave birth to her first child in 2002. At first, she planned not to have an epidural. However, she wasn’t prepared for her labor to last as long as it did, and by the time she had been in labor for 48 hours, she was ready for some pain relief. Lisa recalls that she was in incredible pain as the epidural needle went in, with an extremely hot feeling between her shoulders and then her whole body feeling cold. Soon, her legs started twitching uncontrollably.  She was able to have her daughter, but her left leg remained numb after the birth. When she got home from the hospital and tried to take a bath, neither leg was able to hold her up any longer. A day or so later, she began feeling numb at her waist. Doctors determined that she had spinal inflammation, which may have been caused by the epidural. For two years she used a wheelchair but was finally able to walk again when her daughter turned two.  10 Effects Of Missed Epidural                     Advertising [x]        Dawn Gonzalez recalls her frightening birth story on the National Pain Report website. She believes she was coerced into having an epidural and a C-section because of complications she was experiencing with her labor. She went along with the doctor’s wishes. But, during the epidural insertion, she experienced incredible pain that she didn’t think was normal. The nurse administering the epidural said, “Why didn’t you tell me I missed?”  It was later found that Dawn had arachnoiditis and two forms of meningitis attacking her spine from the epidural insertion. Because of her intense pain and complications, Dawn isn’t able to give herself a bath or change her clothes without help and has chronic pain throughout her body. Dawn believes that everyone should be aware of possible complications of an epidural and never feel pressured into getting one if it’s not what they want.  9 Temporary Paralysis And Constant Pain                     Michelle Babcock went into labor not thinking the worst, but instead excited to meet her new baby. She didn’t think twice about having an epidural when she gave birth in 2012 to her son. When she got the epidural though, Michelle felt a sudden intense pain on her body’s left side and her anesthesiologist reinserted the needle to another location. Then, her blood pressure dropped, causing her to feel faint. She was able to deliver her son but still had no feeling in her legs for hours after her son’s birth when nurses tried to get her to walk.  Michelle ended up with uncontrollable muscle spasms and extremely weak legs and feet that sometimes left her unable to walk at all, and when she could, it wasn’t much. She was eventually diagnosed with arachnoiditis and is unable to stand or sit for prolonged amounts of time.

Although the specifics of her epidural weren’t released – if she had one for childbirth or pain management and what went wrong along the way – it’s clear that the effects of her epidural had changed her life forever. In 2017, a video was released showing Terri taking her first steps after long, hard, and intense training for the past year.  Terri had been training with NextStep Orlando Center after being told by doctors that her chances of ever walking again were slim to none – at only about a 3% chance. But, as the video and this screenshot from that video show, Terri proved her doctors wrong, taking her first unassisted steps with her trainer close by for safety.  7 Wheelchair Bound From Epidural                     Advertising [x]        One woman on the What To Expect forums, a place where expecting and new moms share questions, answers, and pregnancy or birth-related stories, asked a question of other moms and pregnant women:  “One of my friends told me her cousin has been in a wheelchair for 5 years because of a failed epidural, what are the chances this happens?”. It is likely an even scarier situation when tragic side effects hit close to home, as was the case for this woman, who was afraid of it happening to her.  One woman replied that she’s known a couple of women who have had temporary paralysis from the epidural, but not long-term paralysis, and many other women had similar stories to share. Fortunately, the chances of permanent paralysis are slim, but they’re still there and it’s a possibility that every soon-to-be-mom should be aware of so they can make informed decisions.  6 A Devastating Post-Birth Story                     Giving birth should be one of the happiest times in a new mom’s life, but as Candace told to The West Coast Mommy, her baby’s birth in October 2004 ended in tragedy:  “My pregnancy was complication-free. “[During labor] my baby decided to flip ‘face up’ which meant he was no longer in the ‘optimal birthing position.’ This, in combination with the back labor I was experiencing, was horrible. I begged for an epidural. “[The anesthesiologist] began preparing, and I said, ‘I’m contracting,’ but she went ahead anyway.”  Candace said she shook from the contractions during the needle insertion when they suddenly went limp. But, she was still able to feel cold sensations and touches. Days after giving birth, she still couldn’t get her legs to move to walk. She hasn’t gotten any answers from doctors as to what went wrong, but she hasn’t been able to walk since that day.  5 Long-Term Crippling Effects                     Helen Bertelli’s epidural wasn’t associated with either one of her births of her two children, but instead was part of a treatment for serious back pain she was experiencing. An epidural for pain management is administered the same way as one for labor and carries the same possible side effects, including temporary or permanent paralysis. In Helen’s case, her epidural left her with spinal arachnoiditis, which is currently not curable.  The epidural left her with strange sensations in her legs which, at times, make her unable to walk or stand. She also gets intense pains and muscle cramps in her lower body. Helen says that she was never informed of the potential risks of her epidurals and has since formed an advocacy group that urges the FDA to make the risks known to patients.  4 Fighting For Answers                     Advertising [x]        One husband started a Go Fund Me fundraiser for his wife, Cheryl, who received an epidural for pain management in 2010, much like Helen Bertelli’s case. When she awoke from her general anesthesia, she couldn’t feel her legs at all. Doctors reassured her that her numbness was normal for a short time, but hours later, she was still unable to feel anything below her waist.  Eventually, Cheryl was sent to another facility that found spinal damage from the epidural, causing her to become completely paralyzed from the waist down. The Go Fund Me account was set up to help cover medical bills for Cheryl’s new and unexpected health needs, including rehabilitation therapy designed to try to help her walk again one day. As of her husband’s writing, Cheryl had taken two unassisted steps finally, almost three years after her epidural.  3 Swimmer’s Horrifying Paralysis                     At only 18 years old, Mallory Weggemann lost her ability to walk following an epidural that she had for pain management related to a case of shingles that caused her to have severe lower back pain. Mallory previously had two epidurals that went just as expected, but it was her third one that left her paralyzed from the waist down. Mallory had been a swimmer since she was 7 years old, so of course, she wondered if she’d ever swim again.  Fortunately, she’s defied all odds and has since become a para-swimmer, using her arms to help propel her from the wall instead of her legs, as most swimmers do. In 2009 and 2010, she won the title of World Disabled Swimmer of the Year and got an ESPY award in 2011, as the Best Female Athlete with a Disability.  2 Getting Some Justice                     Just to show that epidurals have potential risks to people of all ages, this case tells the story of Robbin Smith, a woman who just recently won a $14.9 million lawsuit against a surgery center of which she was a patient in 2013. According to KDVR, Smith had received an epidural as a steroid injection with a drug that was labeled “Not for epidural use.” The epidural left her with a spinal cord infection , thanks to the faulty medicine, and she was paralyzed – likely permanently – from the waist down. Unfortunately, Smith was never told about the risks of using the medicine via an epidural.  Smith now needs constant care to do things she should be able to do on her own, like cook a meal, use the bathroom or take a bath.  1 Devastating Hospital Error                     It’s extremely sad to hear about cases in which epidurals had such devastating effects on women, but it’s scary to know that it can happen to such young people, like Mallory Weggemann, who trusted the procedure to help their pain. In 2008, Sophie Tyler was another young woman – only 14 years old – who received an epidural for pain management following a gall stone surgery. The hospital made a traumatic error, though, leaving her epidural in place for two days and permanently damaging her spinal cord.  Sophie was left paralyzed from the waist down and now lives her life in a wheelchair. The family attorney has said, "At the age of 14, to be told the news that you will never walk again is unimaginable and to discover that mistakes were entirely avoidable has been incredibly hard for them to cope with."

The popular book, What to
Expect when Youre Expecting, for example, portrays epidurals as
perfectly safe. The risks, however, may be greatly underplayed.  N ote: This is a site in progress.  We are interested in detailing all the risks of epidural anesthesia for childbirth.  There is currently a selection bias toward the risks.  We welcome all readers to send us studies about epidurals regardless of the results, so that we can continue to work toward a balanced  site.  Our bias is that epidurals have risks and that these risks are under-communicated to women, and that true informed consent is not given.    Epidurals and Pain Relief  For the most part, epidural analgesia
does effectively relieve labor
pain. 1 Obstetrical
anesthesiologists continue to state that epidural
analgesia has other, potentially catastrophic, adverse effects but,
with safe clinical practice, these problems are extremely rare. We
will suggest in the material that follows that these complications
are not extremely rare, and that women are not receiving adequate
informed consent about what these complications are and their
accompanying frequency. Nor are they being offered any serious
alternatives to epidural anesthesia. Despite this, anesthesiologists
such as Eberle and Norris argue that specific anaesthetic techniques
... or obstetrical management can limit or eliminate these risks of
epidural labour analgesia. What must be remembered for any technical
procedure, is that it is studied in major academic centers where
highly skilled professors supervise residents and all outcomes are
monitored closely. The actual practice, however, takes place in
smaller institutions by less qualified individuals so that the actual
complication rates of any procedure (obstetric, cardiac, pulmonary)
are always higher than what are found in studies.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]      Overall Complications Rates for Epidural Anesthesia  A general estimate of the overall complication rate of epidural anesthesia is 23%. 2   1. Effects of epidurals on cesarean rate: When the dose is too large or when it sinks down into the sacral ("tailbone") region of the body, the perineum and the vagina are anesthetized. Anesthetic is
intentionally injected into this area late in labor to deaden all
sensation. When it "accidentally" happens earlier in labor, the
muscles of the pelvic floor are prematurely relaxed, thereby
interfering with the normal flexion and rotation of the baby's head
as it passes through the birth canal. This interference can lead to
abnormal presentations which are more dangerous for the baby or to
what is called "failure to descend," an indication for Cesarean
birth. Thorp, et al 3 studied 711
consecutive nulliparous women at term, with cephalic fetal
presentations and spontaneous onset of labor. They compared 447
patients who received epidural analgesia in labor with 264 patients
who received either narcotics or no analgesia. The incidence of cesarean section for dystocia was significantly greater (p <
0.005) in the epidural group (10.3%) than in the nonepidural group
(3.8%). There remained a significantly increased incidence (p <
0.005) of cesarean section for dystocia in the epidural group after
selection bias was corrected and the following confounding variables
were controlled by multivariate analysis: maternal age, race,
gestational age, cervical dilatation on admission, use of oxytocin,
duration of oxytocin use, maximum infusion rate of oxytocin, duration
of labor, presence of meconium, and birth weight. The incidence of cesarean section for fetal distress was similar (p > 0.20) in both
groups. There were no clinically significant differences in frequency
of low Apgar scores at 5 minutes or cord arterial and venous blood
gas parameters between the two groups. They concluded that epidural
analgesia in labor increases the incidence of cesarean section for
dystocia in nulliparous women. Frequently the epidural is so effective that it eliminates uterine
contractions. The nerves which tell the uterus to contract are all
anesthetized. The uterus becomes quiet and must be driven artificially
with the hormone oxytocin (Pitocin or Syntocinon). As the cervix becomes fully dilated and the head descends, the woman
(in a normal birth) feels pain and pressure in the lower pelvis and
rectum. The last injection of anesthetic during the process of
epidural anesthesia occurs after the head has rotated and come down
onto the perineum. Higher concentrations of anesthetic are used to
assure perineal relaxation. Sometimes the mother is sat upright or at
least at a 45 degree angle to be certain that the anesthetic will
descend to the sacral nerve roots. When the sacral nerve roots are
blocked, the woman looses the urge to push. After controlling for potentially confounding variables with multiple logistic regression analysis, Adashek, et al 4 found that epidural anesthesia was an independent risk factor for cesarean birth among women over age 35 (R = 0.195, p < 0.001). At the 1997 meeting of the American Society for Anesthesiology, a
press release was issued about four studies involving a combined
total of more than 22,000 women claiming that labor epidural
analgesia does not increase a woman's risk of having a cesarean
delivery. 5 Three of the studies were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of
Anesthesiologists. The fourth appeared in the September 1997 issue of
the medical journal of Anesthesiology. The findings have significant implications for physicians,
patients and insurers, said one of the researchers, Steven T.
Fogel, M.D., an anesthesiologist at Washington University School of
Medicine in St. Louis. "Some physicians and insurance companies limit
patient access to epidurals because they strongly believe that
epidurals can prolong labor, "Dr. Fogel said. "Delaying or
withholding an epidural forces the pregnant woman to suffer
needlessly and does not lower the cesarean rate." Each year, about one-million women choose epidural blocks for safe and effective pain relief during labor. A study by Dr. Fogel and colleagues at Washington University analyzed
labor and delivery data on 7,000 patients. The researchers compared
the cesarean rates among first-time mothers during the 12 months
before and the 16 months after epidural analgesia became available on
request at the hospital. They found no significant differences in
cesarean section rates before and after the services introduction.
"Epidural analgesia did not stop normal labor or cause cesarean
deliveries, because the rate of cesareans did not change," Dr. Fogel
said. Women may still require cesarean delivery following epidural blocks,
but no direct cause-and-effect relationship has ever been
established. "labor epidural anlagesia can be associated with , but
does not cause, cesarean section delivery," Dr Fogel said. "An
abnormal labor can produce extreme pain for mothers, and this pain
leads women to ask for epidurals," he said. "Our study has the advantage of following cesarean rates before and
after the introduction of a popular epidural service," Dr Fogel said.
"Since patient demographics and cesarean section rates did not
change, we can safely and accurately conclude that the total number
of cesarean deliveries performed was not affected by the
availability of epidural analgesia." Similar findings emerged from an analysis of data on more than 13,000
first-time mothers who gave birth between 1989 and 1995 at St. Luke's
Roosevelt Hospital Center, a teaching hospital of Columbia University
in New York City. The analysis showed that the mother's age, the baby's birth weight and
use of the labor-inducing drug oxytocin increased the women's risk
for cesarean sections. "Not only was epidural analgesia not a
significant risk factor but it was associated with slightly decreased
cesarean section delivery risk." anesthesiologist David J. Birnbach,
M.D., said. By relieving pain, epidural analgesia may help some patients relax
and this realization could facilitate labor, Dr. Birnbach said. "We're
not suggesting the technique will prevent cesarean sections," he
stressed, "but in our practice, epidurals are clearly not a cause."
In addition, the use of epidural analgesia almost doubled at the
hospital during the five years studied (from 37% to 68%) but the
percentage of cesarean sections deliveries did not increase, Dr.
Birnbach said. A third study at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
reviewed the labor and delivery records of more than 2300 women who
received ultra-low dose solutions of epidural medications. The
ultra-low dose epidurals allow many women's labor to proceed
comfortable, Stephen D. Pratt, M.D., said. For women requiring more
pain relief, additional medication can be given by the same epidural
route. The Boston study showed that women who needed additional pain relief
beyond the ultra-low dose were more likely to have cesareans. Women
who needed more than two additional doses were twice as likely to
require a cesarean section as those who do not. "The slow, abnormal
labor that leads to cesarean section is more painful than normal
labor and therefore requires stronger epidural medication," Dr Pratt
said. "Epidural do not cause cesarean sections. Rather women who have
abnormal labor may be in more pain and therefore are more likely to
need an epidural and stronger medication." The above three studies were retrospective studies done in choice
situations/hospitals that had actively taken a new approach to
reducing cesarean sections as well as hospitals that maintain such
high cesarean section rates that the comparisons would be
insignificant due to cesarean rates of over 30%. The only prospective study was the fourth one, conducted at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in
Dallas. 6 Seven hundred, fifteen
women of mixed parity in spontaneous labor at full term were randomly
assigned to receive either epidural anesthesia (EA) or
patient-controlled intravenous meperidine analgesia (PCMA). Epidural
analgesia was maintained with a continous infusion of 0.125%
bupivacaine with 2 pg/ml fentanyl. Patient controlled analgesia was
maintained as 10-15 mg meperidine given every 10 minutes as desired
by the patient using a patient-controlled pump. A total of 358 women were randomized to receive epidural anesthesia
and 243 (68%) complied. Similarly, 357 women were randomized to
receive patient-controlled analgesia, and 259 (73%) complied with
that protocol. Five women randomized to PCMA requested epidurals.
Based upon an intent to treat analysis, there was no difference in
the rate of cesarean deliveries between the two groups (EA, 4%, 95%
CI: 1.9-6.2%; PCMA, 5%, 95% CI: 2.6-7.2%. Women in the epidural group
reported lower pain scores during labor and delivery. What is amazing is that this study was used to argue that epidurals
did not increase risk for cesarean birth. What is lacking, of course,
is a reasonable control group, such as a doula. When one looks at the
amazingly high amounts of meperidine that women could
self-administer, it is no wonder that so few requested an epidural,
since they could hardly be expected to be very alert. A woman could
receive 90 mg of meperidine per hour. In actuality, the average amount
of meperidine a woman self-administered was 200 mg with the highest
amount being 500 mg. To give a sense of the amounts being given here,
routinely in the emergency department, for treating ureterolithiasis
(kidney stones), which most women agree is a more severe pain than
labor, I would rarely administer more than 150 to 200 mg of
meperidine over 12 hours. The average length of labor during which
these women received their meperidine was under 12 hours. No one has
asked the question of how such a massive dose of meperidine would
affect the cesarean rate. The authors stated, "Patient-Controlled intravenous analgesia is
widely used in the United States to manage postoperative pain,
although use during childbirth has been limited. One concern is
newborn respiratory depression from increased narcotic administration
to the mother. Many women in our study used more than 200 mg of
meperidine during the course of their labor, but only 3.4% of infants
were given naloxone to reverse respiratory depression. The mothers
were visibly sedated but were invariably arousable and none
experienced respiratory depression."  Since neither of us have never had to give an infant naloxone in over 1000 deliveries, we wonder what the indications would actually be. We suspect these infants were quite depressed to receive naloxone. Our experience with patient controlled analgesia is that the reason the patient stops pushing the button is that she gets so high a dose that she falls asleep. I suspect the mothers were more compromised than the authors think, but none had to be intubated or artificially ventilated, therefore, none experience respiratory depression. The authors also under-emphasized the fact that all patients were
enrolled at the same time in an aggressive program to reduce cesarean
birth, consisting of:   No use of electronic fetal monitoring, even for epidurals (except
for one test strip on admission), thereby necessitating nurse
auscultation of the fetal heart rate and one-on-one patient care,
both well known to reduce
the cesarean rate.  No patient admitted to the hospital before 4-5 cm of cervical
dilation, also known to lower the cesarean rate.  No drugs or epidurals until the woman was 5 cm dilated, also known
to reduce the cesarean rate.  All births attended by CNMs, which is known to reduce the cesarean
rate by one-third of what obstetricians would do. For example, a
study from Los Angeles County-USC Hospital showed a 4% cesarean rate
in a 95% Hispanic population when they were attended by
nurse-midwives. 7  Use of a black and Hispanic population. In an editorial
discussion, the authors, themselves, comment on black and Hispanic
populations having historically lower cesarean rates.   The authors' real conclusions are this: If you do everything possible
to reduce the cesarean rate for all patients, and then, if you
compare epidural anesthesia with high dose, self-administered
narcotic analgesia, there is no difference in the cesarean rate. This
is not really a very outstanding conclusion, though the popular press
read this result as saying epidural anesthesia is now proven safe and
unlikely to increase the cesarean rate (without addressing the
question, over what? Some infants (0.8%) in the epidural group also required naloxone. Two
transfers to NICU occurred in the epidural group and 3 in PCMA
group. Looking just at those who had epidurals vs. those who didn't,
epidurals prolonged the first stage of labor and increased the
incidence of oxytocin administration. Fever developed in more women
during epidural anesthesia. There was no difference in the number of
cesareans in the epidural vs. the PCIA group (the range from 3% to 7%
cesarean rate). Regarding other complications, 24% of women having epidurals had
fever compared to 6% in PCMA. Nine percent had forceps with epidural
compared to 3% with PCMA. There was a15-19% range of meconium during
labor (not different between groups), which we find rather high.
There was a rate of 1.2-1.8% of infants suffering meconium aspiration
(not different between groups), but also rather high in our
experience.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   2. Significant Low Blood Pressure (Hypotension): Significant low blood pressure is a complication of epidural anesthesia. 1 The ways that epiduralized patients must lie accentuate this. Their position is limited since they are essentially paralyzed people for the duration of the epidural. Hypotension occurs among almost one-third of patients with serious hypotension occurring about 12% of the time. 8  Maternal hypotension is a major risk for the baby. The epidural
blocks the nerves which regulate blood pressure. It causes the blood
in the body to pool, keeping it from being pumped around the body in
the proper manner. The arteries dilate and relax their usual,
necessary level of tension, making it difficult for the heart to pump
blood to the baby. These changes lead to a decrease in the output of
the mothers heart. Less blood per unit time can reach the placenta
and therefore the baby. The baby is completely dependent on the mothers heart to pump blood
to the placenta to satisfy its needs. All of its oxygen comes across
from the placenta. All of the food for its brain and other organs
comes across the placenta. Brains cannot live without a relatively
constant supply of oxygen and glucose. Without this they become
damaged. A good blood flow is needed to the uterus between contractions so it
can get fresh oxygen. During the contraction, blood flow to the
uterus is cut off by the muscles contracting. When the contraction
stops, the uterus must quickly refill with fresh blood containing
oxygen for the baby. If the amount of blood flowing to the uterus is
reduced, the baby may not be able to get the oxygen it needs. Then
what is called fetal distress may occur. The baby's system does not
get enough oxygen and goes into distress. Its blood retains excess
acid, the oxygen levels go low and tissues and vital organs begin to
fail from excess acid, lack of oxygen and lack of fuel. Animal studies have shown that lack of oxygen to the baby (called fetal hypoxia) can cause significant damage to the babys brain even without the pH of the baby's umbilical cord blood being
affected. 9 (The pH of the babys umbilical cord blood at birth is usually used as an indicator of whether or not fetal hypoxia has occurred.) Severe low blood pressure can also result from compression of
the mothers blood vessels (aorta and vena cava) since all mothers
must lie essentially flat on their back after epidural anesthesia
(they cannot feel or move their back, pelvis and
legs). 10   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   3. Fetal Distress: Fetal heart rate decelerations can occur
following the use of epidurals. 1 Babies can develop fetal
distress after epidural
anesthesia. 11 This may be caused
by the mothers blood pressure getting so low that blood cannot be
adequately pumped into the uterus to deliver oxygen to the baby. As
we mentioned above, epidurals make it difficult for the muscles in
the arteries of the lower body to respond and to keep blood
adequately flowing through the body. The ability of the heart to
respond to changing needs of the body is
impaired. 12 Eberle and
Norris 1 suggest that [i]nduction of maternal analgesia may
transiently alter the balance between factors encouraging and
discouraging uterine contraction. A temporary increase in the
uterotonic effects of endogenous or exogenous oxytocin may then
produce a tetanic contraction with subsequent decrease fetal oxygen
delivery and resultant fetal bradycardia. Most babies of mothers receiving epidural anesthesia develop episodes of slow heart rate (bradycardia). 13 While this does not usually affect the healthy baby, it can be disastrous for the baby that is already compromised from some other problem (often unknown to the doctors). Adverse effects on the baby indicative of insufficient oxygen
reaching the baby (late decelerations) can occur. These changes may
also result from a toxic effect to the baby of the local anesthetic
given in the epidural. The transient low blood pressure which always occurs after epidural anesthesia has been found to lead to significantly lower the baby's blood pH. 14 This indicates excess blood acid, usually meaning that the baby is not getting enough oxygen. Anesthesiologists dont think that this makes any difference in the baby's outcome, but we suspect, if we studied babies already at risk for other reasons, we would find that epidural significantly worsens compromised babies and may lead to a Cesarean birth when the baby might have otherwise tolerated a vaginal birth. We suspect that more detailed research would identify a group of babies who would have tolerated unmedicated, normal birth, but who are unable to handle the added stress of the epidural, leading in the worst causes to death or permanent disability.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   4. IV Cannulation: Accidental injection of the anesthetic
solution into the blood stream can occur and can cause the mother to
twitch, have convulsions, or lose of consciousness. Seizures
can occur from the toxic effects of the anesthetic agent entering the
blood stream. 15 Local
anesthetic toxicity occurred among 12 women in 1000
epidurals. 16   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   5. Trauma to Blood Vessels: Trauma to blood vessels can occur as a result of epidural anesthesia. 17 In one study, bleeding
in the spinal column and unintentional placement of the catheter into
an artery or vein occurred 0.67% of the time (67 women of every 1000
epidurals). 18 The catheter
actually escapes outside of where it is supposed to go 1 to 6% of the
time. 19  Hemorrhages can occur around the spinal cord and even within the
skull following epidural
anesthesia. 20 These were
associated with persistent backaches or headaches. Failure to treat
these problems usually results in permanent paralysis. Surgery must
be performed within 8 hours of the onset of paralysis or the
prognosis is poor. Chronic subdural hematoma has resulted from
epidural anesthesia and has even presented as post-partum
psychosis. 21   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   6. Punctured Dura: The actual dura may be punctured as a result of epidural anesthesia. Because of the large size of the
needle used, severe headache may also result. Dural punctures have been
found to occur about 1.8% of the
time. 22 Unintentional dural
puncture occurred in 61 of 1000 epidurals in a University
hospital (resulting in spinal
anesthesia). 23   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   7. Infection: An infection can develop at the site of
injection. Bacterial meningitis can occur from contamination
during placement of the
epidural. 24 An abscess can also form
at the site where the epidural catheter is
placed. 25  26   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   8. Backache: Backache after an epidural is a common complication. Back pain
commonly occurs after epidural anesthesia (18.9% of the
time 27 ). Upper back pain can
happen at some distance from the site where the epidural is
injected. 28 The back pain can
last very long-term. 29 Nineteen
percent of women had long-term backache after epidural
anesthesia. 30 It probably
results from a combination of its effects on the nerves and from
extreme postures and stretching that occurs after the epidural during
labor. Low back pain after epidural anesthesia for childbirth is also frequently
mentioned. 31   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   9. Broken catheters: Occasionally the catheter has
broken and a small piece is left in place. It usually causes no
ill effects.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   10. Abnormal Uterine Contractions: Uterine contractions can become weaker and less frequent.
An oxytocin infusion is then necessary to improve labor and produce
good strength contractions Mothers having epidurals have longer
labors and have a higher incidence of the use of oxytocin than
mothers having non-medicated
deliveries. 32  There are important risks of giving oxytocin also. Administration of
this hormone to the mother during labor can cause:    Dangerously high blood pressure. Abnormal heart rhythms. Nausea and vomiting. Sustained uterine contractions which last too long and result in the baby going into distress from lack of oxygen. When this is too severe, the uterus can rupture. The epidural can mask the strength of the uterine contractions so that no one knows that how strong they are, making uterine rupture more possible. Hemorrhage around the brain. Retention of water leading to convulsions and coma. Bleeding in the pelvis and increased incidence of postpartum hemorrhage. Death of the baby. Jaundice of the baby.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   11. Second Stage Labor Effects: With large doses the patient
loses the desire and the ability to bear down and push. This results
in an increased use of forceps and vacuum extractions over women
having unmedicated
deliveries. 33   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   12. Inadequate Pain Relief: The epidural is generally
inadequate 7.1% of the time, leading to supplementation with
intravenous pain medication 4.0% of the time and a general anesthetic
3.1% of the time (in one
study). 34   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   13. Accidental Spinal Anesthesia: When an epidural
accidentally turns into a spinal anesthetic, many complications can
occur:    Postspinal headaches. Dysfunction of the bladder is frequent Occasionally numbness and tingling (paresthesias) of the lower limbs and abdomen develop, and sometimes there is a temporary loss or diminution of sensation in these areas. Unilateral footdrop (paralysis of the muscle that lifts the foot) has occurred. Permanent nerve damage (conditions called chronic, progressive adhesive arachnoiditis or transverse myelitis) can occur. These lead to paralysis of the lower parts of the body. Deaths have been reported. Difficult breathing Increased incidence of forceps deliveries.   The reliability of spinal anesthesia with 5% hyperbaric lignocaine
was studied among 30 patients undergoing elective Cesarean. Twelve
patients had hypotension and four developed severe postspinal
headaches. The block progressed to the C2 dermatome in four patients
and was associated with dysphagia. This was totally unpredicted and
was thought due to altered cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in late
pregnancy. 35   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   14. Maternal Heart Attack or Spinal Cord Ischemia: The lack of
ability of the heart to pump blood around the body (from low blood
pressure or pooling of blood) can become so severe that a heart
attack occurs or the spinal cord will suffer damage from not enough
blood reaching it. 36   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   15. Asthmatics: Asthmatics can get suddenly worse during epidural
anesthesia 37 with more wheezing
and inability to breath.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   16. Medication interactions: A hidden danger of epidural anesthesia is its interaction with
medications (prostaglandins) commonly used to soften the cervix
and start labor. The use of prostaglandins is common at hospitals
and creates a potentially dangerous situation in which the
usual medications used to treat low blood pressure during
labor will no longer work. 38   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   17. Interactions Occur with Other Illnesses: As an example, women who have
migraines can have more visual disturbances after
epidurals. 39   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   18. Maternal Fever & Malignant Hyperthermia: Maternal fever and even the severe condition called
malignant hyperthermia (dangerously high fever) can
result. 40  41   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   19. Respiratory Arrests: Mothers can stop breathing
(respiratory arrest) 42  43 and can experience other
breathing difficulties. 44 Greenhalgh * reported a 19 year old obstetric patient who
had a respiratory arrest shortly after receiving intrathecal
sufentanil and bupivacaine as part of a combined epidural/spinal
technique for pain relief.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   20. Other Neurological Disabilties: Other neurological disabilities (including a condition
called Horners syndrome) can develop along with hoarseness
(from even just one dose of epidural
anesthetic). 45 Clayton 46 reported an incidence
of Horner's syndrome during epidural anesthesia for elective
Caesarean section of 4%. The incidence of Horner's syndrome with
epidural anesthesia for vaginal delivery was 1.33%. They found it
impossible to predict which patients would develop a Horner's
syndrome. Even the nerves to the face can be blocked, sometimes
temporarily, sometimes
permanently. 47 Tremors and
shakes can occur. 48  49  Paresthesias (persistent tingling from sensory nerves)
occurred in 0.16% of patients in one study (1.6 per 1000) with an
incidence of persistent neuropathy of 0.04% (4 per
10,000). 50 Four of these
patients had a neuropathy which eventually resolved. In another study
3.0% of patients had tingling of the hands or fingers, while 26 of
almost 5000 women had persistent tingling or numbness in the lower
back, buttocks or legs. 51  Dizziness and fainting can become a problem after epidurals. One
study found these symptoms persisting in 2.1% of
women. 52   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   21. Nausea and Vomiting: Twenty to 30 percent of women
experience nausea after epidural anesthesia, while 3 to 7% have
vomiting. 53   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   22. Allergic Conditions: A dangerous allergic condition with shock (called
anaphylaxis) can occur. 54 The
woman develops a red rash (erythema), itches, and her lungs fill up
with fluid (pulmonary edema). Excessive lung fluid is also found in
the babies in these cases. 55   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   23. Heart Problems: Mothers can experience excessively slow heart rates
(bradycardia), heart block in which the electrical activity of the
chambers of the heart become dissociated and sometimes even stoppage
of the heart (cardiac
arrest). 56   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   24. Headache: Headache after epidural is a persistent problem that is
more pronounced in younger
patients. 57 One study found its
incidence after epidural anesthesia to be 4.6%, significantly more
often than women not having
epidurals. 58 It usually occurs
from the effects of puncturing the dura. Headache can also occur from
air getting into the spinal fluid (called an iatrogenic
pneumocephalus). The air is introduced into the spinal fluid and
column when the test dose is given that is assumed to be in the
extra-dural space. When the person giving the epidural feels a loss
of resistance to the injection of air, this is when a pneumocephalus
can occur. The patient that was described complained immediately of
severe headache on both sides of her forehead followed by vomiting.
The baby had to be delivered by Cesarean with general anesthesia. The
patients headache resolved in 24 hours after Cesarean. Of 34 women with spinal headache (from 4766 epidurals), nine had
long-term disability from headache. Five of these were from
accidental dural puncture and four occurred after accidental spinal
block. 59   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   25. Motor Blockade: Epidural anesthesia can produce motor
blockade, resulting in temporary paralysis, even of respiratory
muscles. 60   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   26. Use in VBAC: Epidurals are sometimes used with women
desiring VBAC. Leung, et al. 61 studied the maternal and fetal consequences of uterine rupture during
VBAC. They concluded that significant neonatal morbidity occurred
when > or = 18 minutes elapsed between the onset of prolonged
deceleration and delivery. In 106 cases of uterine rupture at their
institution between Jan 1, 1983 and June 30, 1992, seven charts
were incomplete and excluded; of the remainder, 28 patients had
complete, 13 patients had partial, and 58 patients had no fetal
extrusion into the maternal abdomen. Maternal characteristics or
intrapartum events were not predictive of the catastrophic extent of
uterine rupture. There was one maternal death. Complete fetal
extrusion was associated with a higher incidence of perinatal
mortality and morbidity.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   27. Technical Considerations: Epidural anesthesia is a technical procedure that requires
significant skill to place correctly. Many papers document the
technical aspects of this procedure which are not insignificant. For
example, 23% of epidural catheters inserted more than 2 cm into the
epidural space required manipulation. Epidural catheters inserted 8
cm within the epidural space were more likely to result in iv
cannulation. Epidural catheters inserted 2 cm within the epidural
space were more likely to become dislodged. Epidural catheters
inserted 2 to 4 cm within the epidural space required replacement
more often than catheters inserted deeper. 62   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   28. Herpes Simplex Assocation: Epidural analgesia is
associated with recurrence of herpes simplex blepharitis after
cesarean section when epidural morphine is
given. 63    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Case Examples (Mild Problems) Here is an example of a 30 year old woman having her first baby who was admitted to the hospital
at 2 cm dilation at 11:05 pm. 64 By 4:30 am, she was 4 cm dilated with her waters broken and requested
epidural anesthesia. Her mother and her husband were in attendance coaching her. The epidural was started at 5:01 am and within 30 seconds, the patients heart rate began to climb steadily and precipitously from 88 to 174, levelling off at that rate.  The certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) discovered that the
patient had previously experienced heart palpitations: when stressed
or with heavy exercise. She had begun to feel mild nausea and
dizziness. Oxygen was administered and an iv drug (adenosine) was
given. A second dose followed five minutes later. The abnormal heart
rate (a supraventricular tachycardia) returned to normal and the
woman had a normal vaginal delivery within 6 hours of this episode.
This occurred presumable from a sensitivity to medication placed
through the epidural catheter. When complications such as this occur,
fetal scalp electrodes are usually placed to monitor the baby's EKG.
The therapy sometimes causes severe hypotension. A case has been reported in which a 24 year old woman with a past
history of mild backache had an epidural anesthesia. She had an acute
vagal reaction with loss of consciousness and her head falling
forward. Thirty-six hours later, she complained of severe pains all
over her spine, together with sciatica and spasm of the muscles on
either side of the spinal column (paravertebral muscles). None of
these symptoms responded to drug treatment. The pain eventually
disappeared after she wore a cervical collar, taking
anti-inflammatory drugs and having spinal manipulations (what
chiropractors and osteopaths do) It was thought that her backache was
due to what is called a posterior articular joint syndrome in which
the forward fall of her head strained the posterior joints of the
spinal column. 65    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Permanent Disability from Epidural Anesthesia  a. A disabling condition called spinal arachnoiditis can
develop after epidural anesthesia. Of 6 such women, 3 were
permanently confined to a wheelchair three years after their initial
evaluation. 66 None of these
patients had any prior spinal surgery or trauma or problems with the
spinal cord including previous hemorrhage, infections or other known
causes of arachnoiditis. They had no neurological symptoms prior to
epidural anesthesia. The diagnosis was confirmed by a medical test
called myelography in all cases. The epidurals were uneventful and
performed according to standard methods. Arachnoiditis is probably caused from the epidural injection of
foreign substances (the anesthetic itself or contaminants in the
solution) into the spinal canal. Subarachnoid cysts can occur in the spine from arachnoiditis produced
from the epidural
anesthetic. 67   b. Paralysis can occur. 68 The injection of the local anesthetic into the epidural space can
result in the veins becoming engorged, the spinal cord suffering from
a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and the woman developing acute
neurological problems. Some of these deficits can become
permanent. 69 Paralysis can also
occur from bleeding into the area during the epidural injection with
the formation of a pocket of blood pressing on the spinal cord
(hematoma). It can also occur from infection or trauma. Cranial nerve paralysis can occur at quite a distance from the site
of the epidural. This is thought to occur from traction on the spinal
cord. 70  Paralysis can occur from a condition called anterior spinal artery
syndrome after epidural anesthesia during
labor. 71 Paralysis can occur
when the blood flow to the spinal cord becomes so limited that tissue
dies. This is called an infarction. A case report of an infarction
after epidural anesthesia has been published in which leg paralysis
occurred and did not recover. A loss of sensation to pain and
temperature also occurred to the level of the mid-chest which
partially resolved. 72  Of 108 non-fatal complications in one study, five were associated
with permanent disability. 73 These included damage (neuropathy) to a single spinal nerve, acute
toxicity from the local anesthetic, and problems associated with
accidental puncture of the dura to become a spinal anesthetic. Another patient developed paralysis after epidural anesthesia
probably due to the anterior spinal artery or central arteries being
blocked during the epidural and leading to death of part of the
spinal cord. 74  Neuropathy is a condition in which sensory changes occur (loss
of sensation or hypersensitivity to sensation) with or without
chronic pain. Neuropathy occurs after epidural anesthesia. It can
occur from thrombosis of an artery from trauma from the epidural
injection or from the catheter. A lack of adequate blood flow (and
therefore oxygen) is called ischemia. This can cause neuropathy
also. 75    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Deaths from Epidural Anesthesia Here are some examples of women who have died from epidural anesthesia to illustrate the dangers. A healthy, 31 year old woman having her third child requested
epidural anesthesia and developed an acute condition of fluid in the
lungs (pulmonary edema). She could not be successfully
resuscitated. The baby also
died. 76  Sudden stoppage of the heart (cardiac arrest) can occur during
epidural anesthesia. 77  78 along with other heart rhythm
changes. 79 Sudden cardiac arrest
may be caused by air getting into veins during placement of the
epidural. 80  Respiratory insufficiency can occur and cause death. In one
case report, the patient initially developed pain in the
shoulder-neck region after epidural anesthesia, followed by fever and
an elevated white blood count. This led to a high-level (arms and
legs) paralysis with an inability to breath. Many problems then
developed with the heart and arterial system. An abscess was found
and the patient was eventually stabilized with antibiotics. The
patient required chronic mechanical ventilation and died of recurrent
pneumonia after 5 months of intensive care. The incidence of
breathing difficulties in one study was 0.54%, although only 5% of
those patients required prolonged artificial ventilation. Total
spinal anesthesia occurred in 0.013% of the epidurals but more than
half of these cases required intubation and prolonged mechanical
ventilation. Partial spinal anesthesia (sub-arachnoid block) occurred
in 0.04% of the cases. 81  Women are almost never given informed consent for epidurals. Even if they were just read two paragraphs from the package insert that comes with the medication used for epidurals (manufactured by Abbott
Laboratories), they might think twice. The package insert states:         Local anesthetics rapidly cross the placenta, and when used for
epidural, caudal or pudendal anesthesia, can cause varying degrees of
maternal, fetal and neonatal toxicity.... Adverse reactions in the
parturient, fetus and neonate involve alternations of the central
nervous system, peripheral vascular tone and cardiac function.... Neurologic effects following epidural or caudal anesthesia may
include spinal block of varying magnitude (including high or total
spinal block); hypotension secondary to spinal block; urinary
retention; fecal and urinary incontinence; loss of perineal sensation
and sexual function; persistent anesthesia, paresthesia, weakness,
paralysis of the lower extremities and loss of sphincter control all
of which may have slow, incomplete or no recovery; headache;
backache; septic meningitis; meningismus; slowing of labor; increased
incidence of forceps delivery; cranial nerve palsies due to traction
on nerves from loss of cerebrospinal fluid.         Who would sign a consent if it included the above language? The
degree to which the facts about the risks of epidural anesthesia are
hidden from women in labor is astonishing. Mothers who have a fever are significantly more likely to have had
epidural anesthesia. 82 Therefor
increasing the incidence of septic workups on newborns and the
subsequent complications of this procedure. We would hope that pregnant women would have a more informed
explanation of the risks of epidural anesthesia than what is
currently given, and would suspect that many would make other choices
if true informed consent was given (before labor, when the woman
still has time to prepare to cope with childbirth pain in other
ways).    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Critique of 3 Other Studies As we said the study we just discussed was the only prospective study. The other three studies are papers not yet published so we can only comment on the abstracts of these studies, they were "presented"
at the conference of the American Society of Anesthesiologists in November of 1997. Presented means that the paper was talked about at the conference and has not necessarily been accepted by a major medical journal for publication as of yet and may/or may not be.    1st Additional Study:   TITLE: Does epidural analgesia protect against cesarean section in nulliparous patients?   AUTHORS: DJ Burnbach, MD, A Grunebaum, MD, DJ Stem, MD, B Katgaem MD, MM Kuroda, MPH, DM Thys, MD   AFFILIATION: Department of Anesthesiology and Ob/Gyn, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY   INTRODUCTION: Recent articles have suggested that epidural analgesia may increase the risk of cesarean section. (1,2) In an effort to evaluate whether epidural analgesia during labor is associated with an increased risk of cesarean section at our institution, we evaluated the labor data of nulliparous patients who delivered at the hospital between 1989-1995.  METHODS : From January 1, 1989 -December 31, 1995, there were a total
of

31,670 deliveries at the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. The
13,203

nulliparous patients who delivered under the care of an obstetrician
during

that period of time constituted the study population. The following
were

the independent variables: type of labor analgesia administered,
patient

age, obstetric care provider (private vs. non-private), birth weight,
and

use of oxytocin for stimulation or induction. The dependent variable
was

the delivery mode. A non-hierarchical logistic regression was
performed to

determine which of these independent variables contributed to the
risk of

cesarean section.  RESULTS: Logistic analysis demonstrated that the highest risks for
cesarean

section were associated with oxytocin induction and maternal age. As
shown

in Table 1, other significant predictors of cesarean delivery were
oxytocin

for stimulation, patient status (private patients were at an
increased risk

of cesarean section) and birth weight. Epidural analgesia, on the
other

hand, was associated with a slightly decreased risk for cesarean
section.

For example, patients under 30 years of age who were induced with
oxytocin

who received epidural analgesia had a 32% cesarean section rate
(230/719)

versus a 39.1% cesarean section rate (70/179) for the same group
of

patients who did not receive an epidural anesthetic. Patients greater
than

29 years of age who were induced with oxytocin and received an
epidural had

a 45.4% cesarean section rate (114/251) versus a 58% cesarean section
rate

(51/88) for the same group of patients who did not receive an
epidural. Table 1:     Independent Variables  Odds Ratio  Confidence Interval    Oxytocin Induction  1.93  1.70 - 2.19    Maternal Age (per 10 years)  1.60  1.53 - 1.68    Birth Weight (per 1000g)  1.20  1.13 - 1.27    Oxytocin Stimulation  1.17  1.06 - 1.30    Patient Status (pvt. vs clinic)  1.10  1.01 - 1.16    Epidural Analgesia  0.89  0.81 - 0.97     DISCUSSION: Our data support other studies that have shown an
increased

risk of cesarean section with use of oxytocin, increased maternal
age, and

private patient status.(3) When controlled for other variables,
the

administration of epidural analgesia was associated with a decreased
risk

of cesarean section. Based on our data, we suggest that epidural
analgesia

as practiced at our institution, is associated with a decrease in
cesarean

section rate in nulliparous patients.  1. Obstet Gynecol 1996;88:993-1000 2. Am J Obstet Gynecol 1993;169:851-8 3. Am J Obstet Gynecol 1993;168:1881-5  CRITIQUE:  A major statistical problem with the study, which prevents the
authors from making the conclusions they have made, is the failure to
consider the interaction between epidural anesthesia and oxytocin
stimulation. Many studies have shown that epidural anesthesia
increases the need for oxytocin stimulations [refs]. A proper
statistical procedure would have been to use an interactive term for
epidural and oxytocin stimulation. I would have started with a
multivariate analysis of variance which would have considered the
interaction between epidural anesthesia and the other variables. The
authors believe (erroneously) that they are dealing with independent
variables. Clearly we all know that there is an association between
oxytocin induction and epidurals (more difficult labors; more likely
to have an epidural), maternal age (younger and older mothers are
more likely to have epidurals), oxytocin stimuation (women who have
epidurals are more likely to need oxytocin stimuation because of the
desultory effect of the epidural on uterine contractions, private
patients are more likely to have epidurals. The more sophisticated
approach to their paper would have been to use a technique such as
structural equations modeling (LISREL, or related procedures) to test
paths of effects. For example, one can test the hypothesis that
epidurals affect the cesarean rate through their effect on the need
for uterine stimulation. That could still be done with the authors'
data, and we plan to challenge them to an independent data analysis
(by our colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh) using path
analysis to test these hypotheses. Simply using logistic regression
in this context was inappropriately simplistic, but done probably
because it supported their bias (epidurals are good!). I suspect the
authors are well-informed and have excellent biostatistical
consultation, and chose not to report these other analyses that they
probably did, because these other analyses did not support their
position. I would draw your attention to another part of the abstract. Is it
reasonable practice to do cesareans on 58% of women who are older
than 29 years and are being induced? Are these numbers generalizable?
I was shocked to read this figure. In all my experience in
obstetrics, I can't imagine how you can perform a cesarean on 58% of
the women over age 29 whom you are inducing. I would very much like
to see their criteria for cesarean. With such high rates (45% in the
epidural group and 58% in the non-epidural group), I question how
generalizable these results are to good practice elsewhere. Perhaps
in an environment (consider how stressful this environment must be)
in which such high cesarean rates occur, epidurals do decrease the
risk for cesarean if you are being induced, but I can't believe that
such high cesarean rates constitute safe and prudent practice. I would like to see their overall complication rates, including
post-partum infection and the backache/headache complications of
epidurals. I suspect their morbidity is quite high.    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   2nd & 3rd Additional Studies:  Two other studies shed some light on this debate. The first is Newton
ER, Schroeder BC, Knape KG, Bennett BL. Epidural analgesia and
uterine function . Obstet Gynecol 1995; 85:749-55.  "Continuous epidural analgesia with bupivacaine and fentanyl did not
result in a change in myometrial contractility in the first hour
after initiation of analgesia. However, despite more oxytocin
therapy, the rate of cervical dilation was significantly slower in
the epidural group than in the nonepidural group (1.9 versus 5.6
cm/hr, p < 0.001). Operative deliveries were more common in
patients with epidural analgesia than in those without it (12 of 62
versus 2 of 124, p < 0.0001). After epidural analgesia, myometrial
contractility is maintained with oxytocin, but the ability of the
uterus to dilate the uterus is reduced significantly."   Also important, Albers LL, Anderson D, Cragin L, Daniels SM, Hunter
C, Sedler KD, Teaf D. The relationship of ambulation in labor to
operative delivery . JNM 1997; 42(1):4-8.  "Women who ambulated for a significant amount of time during labor
(compared with those who did not ambulate) had half the rate of
operative delivery (2.7% versus 5.5%)." It's very hard to ambulate
with either an epidural or PCIA.  Two others studies have been widely quoted in the popular press. They
included a study by Dr. Steven Fogel, an anesthesiologist at
Washington University School of Medicine, in St. Louis. Dr. Fogel
looked at data on 7,000 patients delivering over a 28 month period at
his hospital. He compared cesarean rates for first time mothers
before the introduction of an epidural on demand anesthesia service
to cesarean rates after the introduction of the service, finding no
change. What isn't reported is how obstetrical practices changed
during this time interval, a very significant factor. Such historical
studies are notoriously unreliable because policies change so rapidly
in obstetrical management. Without such information, the study is
meaningless. The final study was done at Boston's Beth Isreal-Deaconess Medical
Center by anesthesiologist Steven Pratt. This study reviewed the
labor and delivery records of more than 2300 women who received
ultra-low dose solutions of epidural medications. The study showed
that women who needed additional pain relief beyond the low-doses
were more likely to have cesareans than women who did not. Dr. Pratt
argued that it was harder labors that caused cesareans and not
epidurals. This study was so anecdotal as to be hardly worth
commenting upon. What Dr. Pratt failed to note was that several
others studies have shown that patient satisfaction with low-dose
epidurals is very low and that more than half of women have
additional medication. Pratt's study actually supports the point of
view that epidurals lead to increased cesareans, when this
information is taken into account. What is amazing is the propagandizing that went on in the press. The
gold standard in medicine consists of randomized, controlled trials.
These have been done and do generally show increased cesarean rates.
To try and argue against these much better quality studies with
retrospective studies using historical controls is poor science, but
clearly good propaganda. To conclude we list some of these studies
and their conclusions:  Prospective Clinical Trials Investigating the Association between

From fears of permanent back pain to allegations of potential harm to the baby, many women still harbor mistaken beliefs about epidurals.  “My own mother didn’t want me to have an epidural because she thought it would hurt my baby,” says Paloma Toledo,  M.D., M.P.H., lead author of the study. “But when I showed her the overwhelming scientific evidence that it was safe for me and the baby, she felt good about my decision.”  More than 60 percent of women in labor use an epidural, spinal or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia for labor, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. It is becoming increasingly rare to use spinal anesthesia for delivery alone, but combined spinal-epidurals are becoming quite common, according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). To administer an epidural, a physician anesthesiologist inserts a needle and tiny tube (catheter) in your lower back and delivers medication to continuously relieve pain below your belly button. Spinal anesthesia is a one-time injection of pain medication.  Toledo, an obstetric physician anesthesiologist and assistant professor of anesthesiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, frequently hears concerns and misconceptions about epidurals. With the ASA, she offers the truth behind some common myths:  Myth: Epidurals can cause permanent back pain or paralysis in the mother.  Fact:  Serious complications from an epidural, including paralysis, are extremely rare. Some women have discomfort in the lower back (where the catheter was inserted) for a few hours or days after the epidural, but it doesn’t last.  Myth:  Epidurals can harm the baby.  Fact: In Toledo’s study, published last year in the “International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,” women expressed concern that an epidural could cause cerebral palsy or be harmful to the baby. No evidence or research corroborates these concerns. Additionally, the amount of medication that reaches the baby from the epidural is so small it doesn’t cause harm.  Myth: Epidurals can slow down labor or increase the risk of having a cesarean section (C-section).  Fact: There is no credible evidence that an epidural slows down labor or increases your risk of having a C-section. If a woman has a C-section, other factors usually are at play, including having a very large baby or slow progression of labor due to other issues. In fact, there is evidence that epidurals can speed the first stage of labor for some women.  Myth: An epidural can interfere with the birth experience.  Fact: Some women express fear that their legs will be numb and they won’t be able to walk, feel a contraction or push properly. In fact, your legs should not be so numb that you do not feel them.  You may be able to walk after an epidural, depending on the hospital’s policy; however, walking generally is not recommended immediately after the epidural is placed. Epidural procedures have improved significantly in the last 20 years, and you’ll receive enough medication to relieve the pain without taking away your ability to move. Furthermore, the epidural medications will not cause you to be groggy or tired. In other words, you’ll be able to feel contractions – they just won’t hurt – and you’ll be able to push effectively.  Myth: There’s a limited window of time when you can get an epidural.  Fact: You can get an epidural any time during your labor – in the beginning, the middle or even toward the end.   < Back to                     Focused Resources For Your Specialty    Physician Anesthesiologists      Fellows & Residents      Medical Students      Care Team Members     International     Group Practice Solutions       Top          Thank You Industry Supporters  Whose contributions allow the American Society of Anesthesiologists ® to create world-class education and resources to improve patient care and outcomes.

I'm terrified now and don't know if I will get one. They make you sign a waiver and everything and I didn't even know that :/ Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  43 Posts b  bek302711 @jibberjabber  I knew a couple of women who were paralized for a few weeks but not years. They so make u sign a waiver. I always ask who the anastesialigist (sp?) is and how many years of experience they have. I kinda get a little background before I let them poke me. If your nurse is nice too u can always ask her who she thinks is the best what other patients thought of them. The chances of that happening are quite low. That used to be one of my fears too but after 3 times of doing it I have calm down even though I get nervous everytime. a  aandmbub @jibberjabber  There are risks of complications from severe headaches to paralyzation, but in birth class they said the likelihood of that is about the same as dying in a plane crash- so very unlikely! d  dawn4980 @jibberjabber   my lil sister had an epi when she had her baby on the 21st.  the dr that did it told her that the chances of  a failed epidural, missing the spot and hitting spine, fluid leakage were at 1 out of every 200.  for paralysis he said it was 1 out of every 200,000.  there were some others that he gave stats for but i cant remember them all. (i know one was for blood clots)  i didnt like the sound of those odds, neither did her boyfriend. he asked the dr if there was anyone better than him on call, and the nurse shook her head behind dr's back. so she had the best on call dr.   i dont want an epi, its not worth the risk to me, ive already discussed it with my own dr.  those odds to change tho slightly from what i was told with your size. if you're a 'fluffy' person it can be slightly harder for them to find the right spot.  ask the hospital you're delivering at who the dr's are that do it, and who they think are the best for it.  at my hospital we can request a specific one if we know one we'd feel more comfortable with. editted cause i typed 200,00 not 200,000 the first time :-\ small error but bothered me  j  jibberjabber @dawn4980  I agree with you dawn, the risk, even if it's one in a Million is not worth it to me. I'd rather suck up through hours of excruciating pain then there even being a almost impossible chance I could be paralyzed, because there is Still a possibility. I don't know why so many choose this risk over just pushing trough the pain. I am strong enough, why not everyone else? P  Purpleflowers @jibberjabber  Thanks for your post but it's not something I really wanted to read right before I go into labour when I plan to have an epidural. Especially having it as a title as now each time I come in I see it. Maybe some tact next time please. Its your body take some responsibility and find out all facts before u do anything to it. I can't believe u weren't aware of epidural risks until this late in the game. There are risks with all factors of childbirth but we don't need reminding of them so graphically just when a lot of us are going to be in labour very soon. Most of us have made the decisions about how we feel about epidurals c sections etc a long time ago and don't need to dreg up horror stories of them going wrong when we could be facing them anyday now. M  MomOfMiniCooper @jibberjabber  I told them no students and specifically chose a non teaching hospital. My ansteologist was bery experienced. I think thats importsnt. i  ivan1lucy2aby3 @Purpleflowers  If you already made your decision, then you know the risks and it's always in the back of your head anyway. I dont think she was trying to make anyone upset, just voicing her concerns, sorry, but everyone has the right to post about anything they want. To OP thats the main reason i plan to go natural this time as well.. The risk is not worth it M  Mom0507 That's something I think about every time I've got an epidural. I'm so scared to move I paralyz myself to make sure nothin happens lol V  Venuseventy @jibberjabber  That's the main reason I'm leaving epidurals as a last measure. First it's natural with labor tub/ball/bar, then it's Nitrous Oxide (laughing gas, it's the only medical management that doesn't affect baby/labor in the slightest, but it's the weakest form of pain reducer), then IV meds. If all else fails I might consider an epi, but honestly with my fear vs pain tolerance and knowledge that there is a very certain time limit on that pain is what I think will pull me through epi-free. We'll see! I do agree a more tactful Topic Title might have been appropriate. This is one of those TMI topics that, to be fair, other women should have a choice to read, not have it thrown at them, especially so close to decision time. Just my opinion. m  musesinspire @jibberjabber  As you may or may not know, I'm having my 5th child now.  I'd like to share my story, ok? My first child, I was adamant that I didn't want an epidural!  My doctor said I needed to keep an open mind as you never know what could happen once labor actually starts. I told him I was 100% positive that I just wanted IV drugs and that was it.  I felt this way because my mother, aunts and older friends that had already had children and recounted their various experiences... everything from horrendous headaches, extreme back problems to bladder issues after epidurals.  I was terrified of the idea of a needle and catheter going into my SPINE!!! My water broke and the contractions weren't too bad.  We got to the hospital, they got my IV in me and gave me some Demerol.  I figured I was going to be ok.  And I may have been, truth be told.  But in the middle of a contraction (they were uncomfortable) they inserted the internal fetal monitor and I transitioned immediately!  I puked my guts up, went into active hard labor and proceeded to sit up, in my stirrups while the doctor was still doing the monitor and screamed that I wanted an epidural and I wanted it NOW!!! I was in so much pain from the contractions and so freaked out from puking like I did that I didn't even feel the epidural being inserted.  Within 5 mins, all pain was gone, the Demerol could work its magic and I was in hog heaven! LOL I can honestly say that at that point, I could relax, concentrate and be an active participant in bringing my daughter into the world instead of a writhing, agonizing, painfilled miserable mess. The removal wasn't too bad, as they took it out while it was still numbing me.  The only problem I had was for about 3 months afterwards, if I bent down too quickly, I'd get a 'twinge' in my back right where the catheter went in.  It was uncomfortable but in the long run, more than worth it!!  I've had epidurals for all of the rest of them... I wouldn't go any other way, personally. L  LStrong2011 @Purpleflowers  I'm kind of with PurpleFlowers on this one. I think you have every right to post about this, but perhaps your title could have had more tact so those of us uninterested in reading could ignore?? I think it's a bit insensitive this stage in the game when people are delivering every day. k  kristichelle @Purpleflowers  Don't blame the poster! You should've done your research before making the decision! H  Hotlantamama2011 @jibberjabber  People post all sorts of things if you're not interested don't read it! She didn't criticize she asked an honest question! It seems that people don't ask enough questions before doing it about the effects. I had one and was sore in that spot for months it was awful!! I will not opt for that again and if I start to I have my beloved to remind me and help me through because I'm probably in transition and at the end anyway!! To each their own I just hope people really think about the risks! c  cl2016 I had a spinal tap at age 17. It was incredibly painful and scary. I made a rule then (15 years ago), no needles in my spine, thank you very much. We have been preparing for a natural birth since june to assure no epi for me! m  musesinspire Why is it that every post regarding epidurals and natural child birth always turn into these flaming threads of venom and strife?!  JESUS!  If you feel strongly about one, then don't read the posts about the other!  Some of the replies on some of these threads are borderline bullying and sometimes outright disrespectful. I swear, I fully expect to read one day that because so and so didn't agree with what this person says, they are going to post that they are taking their ball and going home!  It gets downright immature at times!  Which is why I avoid most of these. k  kristichelle @musesinspire  Actually, you never ignore these! You always show up and give everyone the same lecture which gets just as annoying as the topic itself! If you hate it so much then ignore it too! m  musesinspire @kristichelle  Huh... and I guess being a sarcastic know-it-all such as yourself is better, Kristi?  I have YET to see you post something productive or constructive, just a lot of belittling commentary about how stupid/uninformed/ridiculous the original poster is.  If you feel that everyone is so beneath your knowledge, then why bother being on the board? At least I try to be constructive and supportive, no matter what your choice is.  You browbeat everyone. N  Noodles001 Everything has risks. crossing the road has a risk. Giving birth has risks. With or without drugs. Tylenol has risks. Its individual ... if the minute chance freaks you out then don't have one. If it worries you but you think benefits outweigh risks then go for it.This post doesn't worry me- there isn't a single medical procedure out there that doesn't pose some kind of risk.To me it's logical reasoning. N  Noodles001 Btw- I've had 3 spinal taps and 2 epidurals - unrelated to childbirth ...I have zero horror stories to report and God Willing may it continue this way! My friend had an epi in April- got a severe headache as a result of a leak- they plugged the leak with blood and then all good after a couple of days!You can get mrsa from the catheters in your hand for the iv drugs! No one panic- chill. Just make a calculated decision that works best for your individual needs. Related Articles & Discussions Do Epidurals Slow Down Labor?

I know its kind of irrational, his mom has 3 epidurals, my mom had two and that was decades ago. But he's really freaked me out. I'd like to labor as long as possible without one, but if I decide to get one, what are the biggest risks? Isn't it super safe these days? Was anyone else really afraid? If I google it I'm sure I'll only see horror stories. I just need a little reassurance, I've had Pelvic Girdle since 22 weeks, I think I've suffered enough. Reply  Close Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  22 Posts j  jess_ortez I've had it twice now, no complications. Although during contractions it's hard to relax so of course the anesthesiologist waits until it's done. The numbing wasn't bad, the needle I couldn't feel much except a small amount of pressure. The thing that pumped in the medicine was tiny like a wire.. My back feels a little sore being 3 days post partum, but I did have back labor. I know there are so much more risks regarding the epsidural, but medicine has come a long way. Good luck :) Reply  Close c  catiemcm I was absolutely terrified of being paralyzed from an epidural and didn't want one. Then I got induced and my contractions were agony so I was encouraged to get one and did. It was amazing. I went from constant super intense contractions in my back hips and abdomen to feeling nothing at all. It took about 2 days to get full feeling back in my legs though Reply  Close B  Bjacobson8214 My sister is an AA ( anesthesiology assistant) so she deals with epidurals and actual anesthesia...she gave me some pointers as she's not allowed to give me it...she said just to try to hunch over exposing your lower back as much as possible...it's a pretty standard procedure, she said to try to relax as much as possible (yeah easier said than done lol) but I'm trying to stay clam about it...even though she has given me tips, I consider going natural as well bc of the risks but I'm having trust in them that they have gone through at least 2yrs of school plus the experience that they have working in the actual hospital Reply  Close f  ferox Getting an epidural increases the risk of the need for further interventions such as pitocin etc. Interventions such as epidurals also increases the risk for tearing/rupture, and increases the risk of needing a c-section. I also came across a study that found some possible links between epidurals and autism. I don't remember exactly the content, but it was something to do with saline levels or some such. You might find it if you google. I have done two natural unmedicated births and planning my third. It is absolutely doable. I'm sure getting an epidural is pretty safe these days, but there are still risks associated with it and I don't think the hospitals are really good at getting proper informed consent on the matter. Do some research on it before going into labour so you are completely aware of the bigger picture. Reply  Close L  Lucky42016 I was scared to get one as well however when my contractions got stronger and stronger i didn't even think about the risks anymore I just wanted the pain to stop! The doctor explained the risks, being paralyzed was a 1% chance. They talked me through every step and all I felt was a little pinch when the administered the needle to freeze me. After about 20 minutes I was in heaven! I felt so much better and relaxed, I didn't feel the majority of my contractions and if I did feel one it was when I was at 8cm and it was more just pressure but very manageable. When I was pushing I was having regular conversations and cracking jokes with the nurses I didn't feel anything it was amazing! Reply  Close b  babywalker0719 FTM and just delivered last Wednesday! I had an epidural and it was a breeze. I wanted to go without it as long as I could but at 6cm I had to have some relief. The only issue I had was nausea right after it was administered. It didn't slow down the labor/delivery process at all for me. I had a healthy baby girl an hour later! Only pushed for 30 minutes. Reply  Close s  soblessed16 I delivered my daughter 6 weeks ago and had the same concerns as you.  I am a FTM and was convinced I didn't want an epidural because I was so scared of the horror stories I read online.  I delivered at a hospital whose main purpose is women who deliver babies and they deliver at least 50 a day...so knowing how many epidurals they likely place there each day really eased my mind when making my decision to get one.  I spent time asking any questions to the anesthesiology team and the pain was eventually just too much to take so I got one. I went into labor at 38 weeks and 3 days & was 5 cm after about 10 hours into it when I decided on a walking epidural.  That didn't do much for the pain...it really made me feel pretty high or drunk honestly and took a little pain away.  So then I got a regular epidural before they broke my water because between the pain from contractions and the cervical checks it was too much. Getting it placed wasn't bad honestly the only advice I can tell you on that is stay as still as possible--get someone (nurse, husband, etc.) to stand in front of you and hold you steady so you don't jump when they place the epidural.  Mine worked better for my left side than the right but did work for where it counted thankfully.  After 23 hours by the time I started to push the epidural began to wear off I believe across my lower abdomen right above my pubic bone area so the pain of her coming through my pelvic bone was incredibly intense.  I didn't feel her coming out at all that part was numb but I did feel the feeling of relief when she did come out.  I also had a harder time pushing because honestly I couldn't feel myself pushing because of the epidural.  All I could feel was the pain across my pelvic bone area when the contractions would come and a burning feeling like my lower belly was in front of a fire. Also I think that it prolonged my labor--I pushed for 3.5 hours so my labor was 26 hours total.  I had a tear too but no complications thus far after labor and delivery.  I haven't had any back pain or numbness,etc thankfully.  I can't imagine going through labor without it to be honest because the pain WITH it was too much and I was mostly numb.  I would definitely get one again if I have another child someday. Reply  Close h  hannahkates I was terrified of getting an epidural with my first because of the risks... However, I was induced and after 24 hours of labour hooked up the IV I just couldn't cope with the pain any more and for me, alleviating the pain outweighed the risks. It wasn't painful to administer and it worked amazingly and allowed me to sleep whilst I finished dilating. That said, there were three distinct downsides ( although with retrospect I don't regret my choice because I really wasn't coping with the pain): 1. I couldn't feel anything when it came to pushing which made it really hard (for me) and I personally feel that contributed to my need for assisted delivery (forceps) 2. I couldn't move around very easily the next day which I found scary until the sensation in my legs returned 3. I had to have a catheter which I found a bit grim But that's just my experience and I don't regret having one Reply  Close b  bpt2015 Some people completely cannot feel their legs whilst having an epidural others can. You will have a catheter do you don't pee yourself. Mid/long term effects after can include back numbness/ pain and more extreme cases worse than this but from what I understand it's pretty rare Reply  Close R  RainshadowNoba My first epidural failed and I had to be given narcotics in my IV. Even that didn't help, and when it came time to push, you could have amputated my legs and I would have felt nothing but I still was feeling every contraction. I then blacked out and fell on my stitches in the bathroom because the nurse removed the epidural catheter with me standing by the sink. Had to have Vicodin for the pain since I fell and she couldn't even tell the doctor if I'd hit my head or not. Due to the trauma of her birth, I didn't want an epidural with my second, but was forced to get one for still unknown reasons. I have permanent nerve damage in my back and nearly dislocated my shoulder being moved to postpartum because they hadn't turned it off. He was born very drugged looking. My third was a home birth because of the experiences I had with the medical staff at my previous births. I'm due today with #4 and am having another home birth. I can't birth in hospitals anymore. I can't even visit maternity wards without having a panic attack. Reply  Close r  rmontgomery13 According To my dr I had the "perfect epidural experience". I was not in any pain but I could feel when my body had contractions and when it was time to push I was able to do so on my own without needing my doctor or nurse to tell me. So I was able to push how I was comfortable and it resulted in a very quick and easy delivery. I think I only pushed for about 15 minutes and she was here.

Both times I was induced. The second time the epidural wasn't "working correctly" and they sent people in to fix it and dose me up more. I then was so numb I couldn't feel the urge to push and my baby pretty much came out by herself. That being said, these people do this all day everyday. Just try to remain as calm as possible while they are doing it, relax and breathe. Reply  Close l  lucysky You can't feel how you're pushing, so you're more likely to tear or not push correctly and need more interventions. You're also limited to one position. Reply  Close m  myjujubee I'm not a fan of epidural personally and I could never get one (I've had 2 natural deliveries, this will be my third), but when I was a L&D nurse most of the 'complications' were minor - drop in blood pressure (sometimes leading to c-section), bad headache afterwards until anesthesia does a blood patch to help it, slowed down labor, increased chance of episiotomy from not being able to push as well in the laying down position... There are cases where moms have back pain or numbness for years afterwards, which obviously does affect daily living and is very unfortunate, but that is pretty rare. Reply  Close M  Mama_Nicky It is nice that he's concerned about you but ultimately it's your decision if you want the epidural to help you manage the pain. I've had 3 babies & had epidurals with the first and the last (got to the hospital too late with the second so no time, but had a spinal block I believe). The first delivery I got the epidural around 4 cm and I think that was too early. By the time I was 10cm I was completely numb & didn't/couldn't effectively push which led to 2 hours of pushing time with a vacuum assisted delivery and an episiotomy for me. Recovery was fine. This last time with baby #3 I got the epidural at 7cm and I could still feel the urge to push with the contractions but the medicine took away the debilitating abdominal pain I felt during the contractions. I pushed for 30 min & recovery was fine again - no pain or soreness at the epidural sight, no headaches. Feeling was back in my legs in about 2 hours. My advice would be to wait as long as you can but every women is different & has different birth experiences. Good luck :) Reply  Close L  L_Lubas I had an epidural when I hit 8cm. No complications. It's really the anesthesiologist who needs to be sure they know what they're doing! Had a clean, easy epi with no side effects afterward. It was a fine experience. Reply  Close n  naptimeninja I know there are risks but it's a very small risk and you should be fine if you are having one done at a good hospital. I've had 4 and they have all been heavenly and helped me relax and enjoy the birth process more Reply  Close B  Brandiengland26 I was super nervous about getting one too!! I lasted until I was 7cm dilated and then got one. I was in so much pain and once the epidural kicked in I felt nothing but a little pressure. It was amazing lol although right when I was pushing I definitely felt like my epidural was starting to wear off and could feel the contractions more.

Sort by:  Oldest  Newest  19 Posts b  babysalt131 @k_brooke_10  I think this rarely happens now. Especially considering how many epidurals are administered these days, it's become such a rarity. P  Po_Tay_Toes @k_brooke_10  It's extremely rare, but not impossible. k  kementari Possible but very rare. It will be listed as a possible outcome in the consent form though. I don't know anyone who has had it happen. m  mammer83 @k_brooke_10  The nurse at our extremely busy hospital said she seen one complication in 25 years. s  sapphire723 That's a possible complication.  The receptionist at my spa yesterday said they hit her sciatic nerve and she still experiences pain and problems years later. s  silver0980 Ask your anesthesiologist l  lindseyrhae It's in the paperwork they make you sign before you get it. Read through it carefully or request a copy before you go into labor that way your not pressured to just sign in the midst of contractions. I personally know someone that was paralyzed from an epidural. It is rare, but they definitely still scare the heck out of me! j  jhilchie @k_brooke_10  I wouldn't put any worry in to this possibility. Best not to focus on things that could go wrong. m  mlind15 It's also possible to die from childbirth but u don't see everyone freaking out about it k  k_brooke_10 @mlind15  I don't see myself or anyone freaking about about this either... k  k_brooke_10 @sapphire723  Was it a mistake on the anesthesiologists part or did she accidentally move or something? And if it was his fault did she sue?! s  sheenab4 My friend's cousin had this happen. She was paralyzed for 3 months after she had her baby. Also it is very possible for them to put the epidural in to far and into the spinal cord.  If that happens the meds go up to your lungs and can cause you to stop breathing. I am do a natural birth becuse I am too afraid of all the bad side effects. Even if it is rare, it happens. b  babyhalle28 Some of you are scaring her.  You have to believe and you have to have faith that it is going to work out ok.  If the question was about people enjoying epidurals and getting them again, there would be a ton of responses.  Yes it's rare, but ive done it twice and will do it again!! b  blanzen My anesthesiologist said it was a possible outcome if your platelets are low (I have an autoimmune disease and have chronically low platelets). That's why they run a CBC blood check beforehand to make sure platelets high enough. Most hospitals require platelet levels to be at least 80; some require 100. If not high enough and can't do a transfusion, then would either need to go natural or under general anesthesia for a c-section to avoid the paralysis risk. My understanding is the risk comes from bleeding in the spine when needle inserted and not enough platelets to clot any injury from needle insertion. t  trying4four @k_brooke_10  It's very possible.the hospital I was delivered at is sometimes nicknamed Crippler, or was almost 30 years ago. My mom knew a few women who went to the hospital and ended up with serious complications from birth. One being a woman went to deliver and got an epidural they messed up and missed and she ended up a paraplegic. It's a very very rare complication but one none the less. s  sapphire723 @k_brooke_10  To be honest, I didn't pry much further. I'm shooting for a natural birth, so I'm trying to not focus on the negatives. She did say she regrets it, because she didn't even get relief. At the end of the day, there are risks associated with the epidural, but it's not the norm. Personally, I'm going to try to avoid it if I can and talk to my dr about the risks so I can make an informed decision if I decide I need one. r  rachaelofcourse If you become paralyzed from an epidural, I'd really be questioning your anesthesiologist. You have 3 layers protecting your spinal cord and the epidural goes in between the first 2. Also, your spinal cord ends above where they place the epidural. So, if they paralyze you, they either placed it waaaaaay too high, or the anesthesiologist carelessly placed the catheter. There's also the platelet/clotting issue a PP mention. I'm not having an epidural (mainly because I don't want to pay for it), but I wouldn't be the least bit scared. C  CCMEL @k_brooke_10  Rare. I'm an anesthetist and seeing this post makes my bones chill! We place these all the time, we are trained to know what and where epidurals are placed and it's why we ask questions as we do them. I wouldn't let this scare you off from receiving one. Complications can arise with anything however like I've said it's rare. Good luck. Related Articles & Discussions Do Epidurals Slow Down Labor?

Giant needle to the spine terrifies me but so does giving birth with no pain relief. I'm FTM too . I thought I was the only one terrified M  Munkeroo I'll say two things. I got it once as a last resort before c section. I won't ever get one again. However, my experience is NOT the norm and I know no one with even a remotely similar experience so I really think more often than not things go just fine. I didn't find it hurt, but it was icky feeling. They had to do mine over a few times an I could feel the catheter in my spine and that's just...ick to me. My whole back bruised from it and that hurt more than the epidural. The hardest part is sitting up with a rounded back during contractions. L  Lubug2014 @pcoble11  I was adamant that I would not get it. I ended up caving and taking it. I was so terrified of it. The pain from labor was so strong I really barely felt it. I can't believe how quick it was. I was totally against it, you will know what's best for you in that moment. I will try again this time to not get it, but I won't be ruling it out. I hope this helps. God Bless! m  mlvaughan1 @pcoble11  I was right there with you with my first.. I couldn't believe how easy it was. They numb you with a small poke, then you don't feel the big part. I promise the actual process of an epi is no biggie! I understand that there are other reasons to fear it, that are legit, but actually getting it is a breeze in my opinion! j  jlk3 @pcoble11  Yes, I'm terrified! I know I definitely want one but I'm scared of complications. I've had a spinal tap before and had a spinal fluid leak afterwards for 3 weeks and needed a blood patch, the while ordeal was the worst experience of my life. I know an epidural is a little different (they don't go as deep) but a spinal leak is a possible complication. m  mtnladyAGAIN I was more afraid of an epidural than birthing a baby, so my plan was a drug-free birth with my first. Long (loooong) story short, I ended up with an epidural and it was a good experience. My plan is drug-free, but in the end what matters is a healthy baby and healthy mom. Birth is only a small part of the big picture. Have a plan, but don't let it be the focus of your pregnancy. C  Cp89 I so far have had two babies without an epidural. I have never been against getting one, it just so happened that both times that I got to the point of "I can't take it anymore" it was time to push. But the thought of having an epidural does scare me too. I can understand when women say your in so much pain that the thought of an epidural doesn't scare you anymore. A  AutumnSky002 With my first I didn't want an epidural, just from hearing it's easier to nurse them right away without meds and hearing other moms say how the epidural is still causing them back pain I decided I didn't want to have one. I have a pretty high pain tolerance so I thought I would be able to do it and it did! The pain to me was never worse than my worst cramps, and knowing the pain doesn't last and I would have a break before the next one made it easier k  kateandluke When I had an epi the worst part of it was the freezing cold antiseptic they washed my back with to start with. The needle was nothing in comparison! Very minimal. Getting your ears done would hurt more G  GayeFamily I'm a ftm as well. And we're not going with any meds. Simply because I'm a research freak and I'm very cautious about the medicines I and my baby receive. When you get a chance check out this documentary called "the business of being born" VERY INFORMATIVE!! s  saltwater I literally couldn't feel the epidural at all, but the pain relief was heaven! I was having an incredibly intense labor with all my contractions right on top of one another. Other women have very different labor and don't feel they need it- do what is best for you!! And a word of caution, like most documentaries, business of being born is very one-sided and doesn't present objective information. Educate yourself, but don't blindly believe everything you see/read!! j  jps2011jps @pcoble11  Lol. Yes. I didn't want the needle in my back after. I wS luck with a quick delivery so I was able to do it no meds M  MamaMindyB85 @pcoble11  You will have to see how your labor progresses. I've had two epidural a, but I'm not sure I will have one with this third labor. But being a FTM you don't know how fast it will go. My first labor was very long and I was not dilating fast, it took me from 7 am - 1 pm to go from 3-4 cm and they had started giving me pitocin and I just did not see an end in sight. It is a bit terrifying to have an epidural, and everyone reacts differently to it. I did not find it to be painful, but it affected my blood pressure and made me shaky. When you are in labor you will make the best decision for you and your baby!! Good luck!! L  LuluMay29 @pcoble11  It's one of the reasons I'm aiming to go natural! I'd also like the freedom to get up and walk around right after delivery, which you can't do with an epidural. My cousin was temporarily paralyzed for several weeks after hers, needed physical therapy and also had a spinal headache (one of the worst headaches imaginable) as a result of her epidural. Obviously that is NOT common nor is it the norm, but it is one of the risks. t  tatee79 @pcoble11  the labor pain overshadowed any fear I had about an epidural. I'm definitely getting an epidural again! n  natzmolko There's plenty to try before epidural such a as relaxation, hypnobirthing, tens, water, gas and air, morphine injection, remifentanil etc s  shellsbells82 @pcoble11  I am so scared of it that I'm leaning towards not getting it. I have started to reconsider that though after talking to my PCP. She did her residency with my OB and said she saw a lot of them done, and the women who got them had much better birth experiences than the ones who didn't. b  bcmama23 I ended up with a spinal leak and had to have a blood patch. I survived though, it is t the end of the world, just a setback. h  hrain27 @pcoble11  When I got one with my first it was horribly painful. Much more painful than what I was experiencing laboring. On top of that it didn't even work for me. I won't be doing it again.

Her friend who is a Nurse told her that after having an Epidural, there may be a pocket of fluid that stays put. If you rub and break that pocket of Epi meds, you can rub it back into your spine. Causing parylization. This is why i don't mess with needles/meds in my spine. It's nothing to mess around with IMO. I'll take any contraction pain any day over what could happen from an Epidural.

Hmmm, no brainer to me :P You ain't stickin' any needles in my spine Doc! LOL  3  3ladies @thomps29  Find a good chiropractor. Preferably one who specializes in pregnancy therapy. The epi site can give you discomfort for up to a year afterwards. And try some core/back strengthening exercises. Yoga is great. This should help. n  nat_in_ill @3ladies  I'd call your doc and ask about whether rubbing the site will cause paralysis.  I'm having a hard time believing that.  I could be wrong, though. is the injection site warm to touch or red?  make sure there is no infection.

I have had 2 spinal taps before because I had meningitis...they use the same huge needle to do that as an epidural. All I ended up with was a horrible spinal headache the second time. Believe me even if you had a good chance of becoming paralyzed you'd take the chance with the pain you'll be feeling!

Just try not to worry about that and get the epidural, it feels so good to get a break from all the pain that you wont even be thinking about becoming paralyzed. Good luck and I hope everything goes well for you and baby.

High Risk Pregnancy             princ3zzjh    Posted 07/08/2017      I gave birth a little over 24hrs ago via c section. Ever since labor, delivery, and after I've had a catheter in. I first got it once I received the first epidural. I ended up getting 3 in total. 2 while attempting a vaginal delivery, and 1 during prep for a csection. My catheter was taken out about 12 hours after delivery. Since then, I've had the strongest urge to urinate but I'm unable to do so. Like I can tell that my bladder is super full but no matter how long I sit on the toilet or try to relax and push, I literally can't. I was in so pain I begged my nurse for another catheter which gave instant relief. I'm just afraid that I'm going to continue to have this problem once I go home on Sunday, tomorrow.  Has anyone had a similar issue? If so how did you get past it. I'm trying not to stress and freak out over while attempting to heal from a csection at the same time...     --  Me + DH = 10.12.15 DS  4/6/10 DS2 7/6/17        Comment            Report this post        3       Comments (13)        / 2                  hardingbabe    Posted 07/08/2017      Usually they don't release you until you can pee.

Usually a few hours, but some people days. You should recover quickly, and they shouldn't discharge you without being able to pee normally! Don't worry!

I could feel it all from my hips down. I have a bulging lower disk and from that disk down I could feel. And it wasn't that bad. I also had back labor and I know what you mean.

The doc wasn't worried, said it could take up to 6 months to regain total feeling. Since my second was a repeat c section, I had a spinal instead. That's what'll happen with this one too.

More common complications are drops in blood pressure and heart rate and delayed/stalled labor leading to C/S, and increased body temperature (for you and baby) leading to NICU stays for monitoring for infection.      --  Proud mamabear to M: 02/2010 & C: 09/2012              Reply            Report this comment        1                     slhaug    Posted 04/17/2012      It's a risk but it's rather minuscule . Make your choice but anything you have done in medical aspect is a risk. Just do your homework on your hospital and the anesthesioligists there. I had 1 my first child and it was a nightmare because they had to do it three times and the left side of my belly never got numb. Second child I had a walking epidural and it was fine but I developed a leak and had to have a blood patch . And with my third I had a spinal and it was fabulous! Spinal is much riskier per say but it's awesome if you have a csection. Having a baby is a risk. You just gotta keep it in perspective. Don't flip out over something you know nothing about               Reply            Report this comment        1                     catiedid27    Posted 04/17/2012      The risks are definitely real. But.. When I had my daughter I had an epidural. Really at that point I wanted ANYTHING to take the pain away.

I had an epi with my ODS and since then I have back spasms in the area it was insterted and its a spot that must be avoided during a massage as its uncomfortable to put pressure on it. My son is over 3.5yrs old and its still like this. When he was just a few weeks old I was doing laundry and when I was getting the stuff out of the dryer, a spasm shot me forward during the bend and I almost smacked my head on my dryer.

ETA: this one is more specific I think!  http://www.healing-arts.org/mehl-madrona/mmepidural.htm  ^^^A disabling condition called spinal arachnoiditis can develop after epidural anesthesia. Of 6 such women, 3 were permanently confined to a wheelchair three years after their initial evaluation. 66 None of these patients had any prior spinal surgery or trauma or problems with the spinal cord including previous hemorrhage, infections or other known causes of arachnoiditis. They had no neurological symptoms prior to epidural anesthesia. The diagnosis was confirmed by a medical test called myelography in all cases. The epidurals were uneventful and performed according to standard methods.    --  proud wife  mother of three amazing little dudes preparing to surrogate CD, BF, BLW, BW, ERF, CS, HS, HB NO RIC, NO VAX, VBAC... pretty crunchy             Reply            Report this comment       0                     TaliaSLP    Posted 06/19/2011      In our birth class someone asked that question and the instructor said it is not possible.

I had one with my first- loved that it took away the pain, hated feeling numb and it slowed my progress greatly (3 hours to go from 1-7, 6.5 hours to get to a 10 with epi). Then it wore off and I pushed for 3 hours without it (DS was facing up). I'm going to try without it this time, assuming my labor is another quick one.

She had an emergency c-cection twice with an epidural due to high blood pressure, when she got the epidural her blood pressure plummetted and she had to be resuscitated.  The third c-section they knew what caused it and used general anesthesia!  But they are a lot more aware of the effects now and that is really rare.  They give IV fluids before and during an epidural now to prevent such occurences.    --  T+M=AJ(8/4/11) Though I never knew you, yet I loved you still.  You will always be in my heart, my angel.  4/23 ^i^              Reply            Report this comment       0                     BoysMommyto4    Last edited 06/19/2011      You can be, but it's rare and it only happens when they put the needle in to deep.

Store policy edition   by Ironphist in Bargain Hunters          advertisement           advertisement           From June 2011 Birth Club          Paralyzed by an epidural during labor             dhillons    Posted 01/03/2011        Does anyone know anyone who was paralyzed by getting an epidural? I am very freaked out by the fact that you have to sign a waiver that says "the anaethesiolgist is not liable if you become paralyzed" and I am very freaked out by being numb from the waist down for a few hours. What other options are there to manage pain? i am a FTM  (first time mom) and am wondering if there are other mom's out there that are freaked out about the risks. My husband is a pain management doctor and actually injects pain medication into the back and knee (not on pregnanct women) and he said that he uses an x-ray machine to make sure the needle in going into the right space. When you get an epidural the injection goes in "blind" which means that the doctor just has to feel the area and guesses where the needle needs to go in. They can't use an x-ray machine. My husband doesn't knwo of anyone that has been paralyzed but the chance is still there. Does anyone know of any friends, sisters etc that were?

I think there's a thing called a "walking epidural"  in which you can still get around and feel some...but I didn't have one and I don't know anyone that did.

I have however heard of horrible migraines or it not working totally correctly, but those two problems are not life threatening.  As far as pain management goes, there are a lot of mental things you can do, but the iv pain meds only do so much. If you aren't mentally in control of your state then you pretty much have to work through it just like any other pain.  Hypnobirthing is becoming very popular, as is water birthing. Those are apparently great at helping with pain, although I don't believe it's for everyone. Also breathing techniques and massage can help.  Do your research. There are a lot of options out there, you just have to find what is best for you.    --  -Shana...

From fears of permanent back pain to allegations of potential harm to the baby, many women still harbor mistaken beliefs about epidurals.  “My own mother didn’t want me to have an epidural because she thought it would hurt my baby,” says Paloma Toledo,  M.D., M.P.H., lead author of the study. “But when I showed her the overwhelming scientific evidence that it was safe for me and the baby, she felt good about my decision.”  More than 60 percent of women in labor use an epidural, spinal or combined spinal-epidural anesthesia for labor, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. It is becoming increasingly rare to use spinal anesthesia for delivery alone, but combined spinal-epidurals are becoming quite common, according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). To administer an epidural, a physician anesthesiologist inserts a needle and tiny tube (catheter) in your lower back and delivers medication to continuously relieve pain below your belly button. Spinal anesthesia is a one-time injection of pain medication.  Toledo, an obstetric physician anesthesiologist and assistant professor of anesthesiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, frequently hears concerns and misconceptions about epidurals. With the ASA, she offers the truth behind some common myths:  Myth: Epidurals can cause permanent back pain or paralysis in the mother.  Fact:  Serious complications from an epidural, including paralysis, are extremely rare. Some women have discomfort in the lower back (where the catheter was inserted) for a few hours or days after the epidural, but it doesn’t last.  Myth:  Epidurals can harm the baby.  Fact: In Toledo’s study, published last year in the “International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,” women expressed concern that an epidural could cause cerebral palsy or be harmful to the baby. No evidence or research corroborates these concerns. Additionally, the amount of medication that reaches the baby from the epidural is so small it doesn’t cause harm.  Myth: Epidurals can slow down labor or increase the risk of having a cesarean section (C-section).  Fact: There is no credible evidence that an epidural slows down labor or increases your risk of having a C-section. If a woman has a C-section, other factors usually are at play, including having a very large baby or slow progression of labor due to other issues. In fact, there is evidence that epidurals can speed the first stage of labor for some women.  Myth: An epidural can interfere with the birth experience.  Fact: Some women express fear that their legs will be numb and they won’t be able to walk, feel a contraction or push properly. In fact, your legs should not be so numb that you do not feel them.  You may be able to walk after an epidural, depending on the hospital’s policy; however, walking generally is not recommended immediately after the epidural is placed. Epidural procedures have improved significantly in the last 20 years, and you’ll receive enough medication to relieve the pain without taking away your ability to move. Furthermore, the epidural medications will not cause you to be groggy or tired. In other words, you’ll be able to feel contractions – they just won’t hurt – and you’ll be able to push effectively.  Myth: There’s a limited window of time when you can get an epidural.  Fact: You can get an epidural any time during your labor – in the beginning, the middle or even toward the end.   < Back to                     Focused Resources For Your Specialty    Physician Anesthesiologists      Fellows & Residents      Medical Students      Care Team Members     International     Group Practice Solutions       Top          Thank You Industry Supporters  Whose contributions allow the American Society of Anesthesiologists ® to create world-class education and resources to improve patient care and outcomes.

I realise this is a small percentage, but a quick check shows that approx 700,000 are born each year in the UK - so if all mothers were to use epidurals, 70 per year would be paralysed.  Have any of you been affected drastically by epidurals?  Thanks.

It seemed to be working fine, then I could feel half, then it didn't work at all and we let it come the rest of the way out.

I think everybody has the wrong idea here.  Paralysis doesn't necessarily mean that you're paraplegic.  It is the loss of muscle function in more than one muscle.  In most cases where an epidural is involved, your back stays numb after it is removed.

They were putting me on the drip to induce me and knew i wouldnt be able to cope with the pain. It did wear off towards the end and i felt EVERYTHING when i started to push, but honestly it wasnt painful and i dont regret having one.

  Epidural Anaesthetic    Epidural Anaesthetic   By Jane Palmer      An epidural anaesthetic is a procedure that is performed by a specialist doctor known as an anaesthetist. Epidural anaesthetic is where an injection of local anaesthetic (sometimes mixed with an opiate such as pethidine or fentanyl) is given into the epidural space (an area located around the spinal cord). An epidural anaesthetic is given to relieve pain in labour, to help reduce high blood pressure (if it is a problem in labour) and prior to a caesarean birth. The effects of the epidural anaesthetic on the woman depend on the type of medication used. A woman may be numb from the waist down and unable to move or she may be able to move her legs but not feel the pain of the contractions. An epidural anaesthetic takes between 10 to 20 minutes to be put in place and then the medication takes around 5 to 20 minutes to become effective. An epidural catheter is left in place after the procedure is completed. It is through this catheter that regular doses of medication can be given to help keep the woman comfortable (Robertson, 1999).  What happens during the administration of an epidural anaesthetic?  Firstly the anaesthetist places a needle in the woman’s hand and attaches a bag of intravenous fluids. These fluids are to help counteract any drop in blood pressure that can occur. The woman is then positioned either lying on her side or sitting up in bed in a curled up position. An area of the woman’s back is swabbed with an antiseptic solution such as betadine. The woman is given a local anaesthetic to numb the area where the epidural catheter will be introduced. A special needle is inserted into the appropriate space and the very fine epidural catheter is passed into the needle. The epidural catheter is left in place and the special needle is removed. The epidural catheter is then taped carefully in place so that it cannot move. The appropriate medication is given into the epidural catheter.  What are the advantages of an epidural anaesthetic?  The advantages of an epidural anaesthetic include: The most effect form of pain relief available, mother can see the birth of her baby during a caesarean, provides adequate pain relief if a forceps or vacuum birth is indicated, helps control high blood pressure (Robertson, 1999).  What are the disadvantages of an epidural anaesthetic?  The disadvantages of an epidural anaesthetic include: Being confined to bed, increases chance of a caesarean birth, increases chance of forceps or vacuum extraction by three times (around 50% of first time mothers will need this type of assistance - statistics between hospitals can vary), approximately 1:100 women will experience a severe headache afterwards, 1:550 women will experience small numb patches on their legs that persist after birth for up to three months, 1:4000 women will experience a life threatening emergency from an epidural (paralysis is extremely rare), labour can be longer (approximately three times more likely to need medication to speed labour up), more likely to need a catheter to help pass urine, some women experience itchy skin (as a result of some of the medication used), some women do not achieve adequate pain relief or partial relief on one side, mothers temperature can rise resulting in the need to give the baby antibiotics after birth (Enkin, Keirse, Renfrew & Neilson, 1995; MIDIRS and The NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, 1997; Robertson, 1999).  Are there any long term effects on my self or my baby if I choose an epidural anaesthetic?  Remarkable there has been little research done on short or long term effects of epidural anaesthetics. So the effects on mothers and babies remains unknown at this stage. All research can say at this stage is that epidural anaesthetic provides the most effective form of pain relief to date but it substantially increases the risk of operative births ie. caesarean section, forceps and vacuum extraction (Enkin, Keirse, Renfrew & Neilson, 1995).

You may have statistical information of your own the contradicts what the ANZCA has. If you could let me know that would be great.  Best Regards,

The popular book, What to
Expect when Youre Expecting, for example, portrays epidurals as
perfectly safe. The risks, however, may be greatly underplayed.  N ote: This is a site in progress.  We are interested in detailing all the risks of epidural anesthesia for childbirth.  There is currently a selection bias toward the risks.  We welcome all readers to send us studies about epidurals regardless of the results, so that we can continue to work toward a balanced  site.  Our bias is that epidurals have risks and that these risks are under-communicated to women, and that true informed consent is not given.    Epidurals and Pain Relief  For the most part, epidural analgesia
does effectively relieve labor
pain. 1 Obstetrical
anesthesiologists continue to state that epidural
analgesia has other, potentially catastrophic, adverse effects but,
with safe clinical practice, these problems are extremely rare. We
will suggest in the material that follows that these complications
are not extremely rare, and that women are not receiving adequate
informed consent about what these complications are and their
accompanying frequency. Nor are they being offered any serious
alternatives to epidural anesthesia. Despite this, anesthesiologists
such as Eberle and Norris argue that specific anaesthetic techniques
... or obstetrical management can limit or eliminate these risks of
epidural labour analgesia. What must be remembered for any technical
procedure, is that it is studied in major academic centers where
highly skilled professors supervise residents and all outcomes are
monitored closely. The actual practice, however, takes place in
smaller institutions by less qualified individuals so that the actual
complication rates of any procedure (obstetric, cardiac, pulmonary)
are always higher than what are found in studies.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]      Overall Complications Rates for Epidural Anesthesia  A general estimate of the overall complication rate of epidural anesthesia is 23%. 2   1. Effects of epidurals on cesarean rate: When the dose is too large or when it sinks down into the sacral ("tailbone") region of the body, the perineum and the vagina are anesthetized. Anesthetic is
intentionally injected into this area late in labor to deaden all
sensation. When it "accidentally" happens earlier in labor, the
muscles of the pelvic floor are prematurely relaxed, thereby
interfering with the normal flexion and rotation of the baby's head
as it passes through the birth canal. This interference can lead to
abnormal presentations which are more dangerous for the baby or to
what is called "failure to descend," an indication for Cesarean
birth. Thorp, et al 3 studied 711
consecutive nulliparous women at term, with cephalic fetal
presentations and spontaneous onset of labor. They compared 447
patients who received epidural analgesia in labor with 264 patients
who received either narcotics or no analgesia. The incidence of cesarean section for dystocia was significantly greater (p <
0.005) in the epidural group (10.3%) than in the nonepidural group
(3.8%). There remained a significantly increased incidence (p <
0.005) of cesarean section for dystocia in the epidural group after
selection bias was corrected and the following confounding variables
were controlled by multivariate analysis: maternal age, race,
gestational age, cervical dilatation on admission, use of oxytocin,
duration of oxytocin use, maximum infusion rate of oxytocin, duration
of labor, presence of meconium, and birth weight. The incidence of cesarean section for fetal distress was similar (p > 0.20) in both
groups. There were no clinically significant differences in frequency
of low Apgar scores at 5 minutes or cord arterial and venous blood
gas parameters between the two groups. They concluded that epidural
analgesia in labor increases the incidence of cesarean section for
dystocia in nulliparous women. Frequently the epidural is so effective that it eliminates uterine
contractions. The nerves which tell the uterus to contract are all
anesthetized. The uterus becomes quiet and must be driven artificially
with the hormone oxytocin (Pitocin or Syntocinon). As the cervix becomes fully dilated and the head descends, the woman
(in a normal birth) feels pain and pressure in the lower pelvis and
rectum. The last injection of anesthetic during the process of
epidural anesthesia occurs after the head has rotated and come down
onto the perineum. Higher concentrations of anesthetic are used to
assure perineal relaxation. Sometimes the mother is sat upright or at
least at a 45 degree angle to be certain that the anesthetic will
descend to the sacral nerve roots. When the sacral nerve roots are
blocked, the woman looses the urge to push. After controlling for potentially confounding variables with multiple logistic regression analysis, Adashek, et al 4 found that epidural anesthesia was an independent risk factor for cesarean birth among women over age 35 (R = 0.195, p < 0.001). At the 1997 meeting of the American Society for Anesthesiology, a
press release was issued about four studies involving a combined
total of more than 22,000 women claiming that labor epidural
analgesia does not increase a woman's risk of having a cesarean
delivery. 5 Three of the studies were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of
Anesthesiologists. The fourth appeared in the September 1997 issue of
the medical journal of Anesthesiology. The findings have significant implications for physicians,
patients and insurers, said one of the researchers, Steven T.
Fogel, M.D., an anesthesiologist at Washington University School of
Medicine in St. Louis. "Some physicians and insurance companies limit
patient access to epidurals because they strongly believe that
epidurals can prolong labor, "Dr. Fogel said. "Delaying or
withholding an epidural forces the pregnant woman to suffer
needlessly and does not lower the cesarean rate." Each year, about one-million women choose epidural blocks for safe and effective pain relief during labor. A study by Dr. Fogel and colleagues at Washington University analyzed
labor and delivery data on 7,000 patients. The researchers compared
the cesarean rates among first-time mothers during the 12 months
before and the 16 months after epidural analgesia became available on
request at the hospital. They found no significant differences in
cesarean section rates before and after the services introduction.
"Epidural analgesia did not stop normal labor or cause cesarean
deliveries, because the rate of cesareans did not change," Dr. Fogel
said. Women may still require cesarean delivery following epidural blocks,
but no direct cause-and-effect relationship has ever been
established. "labor epidural anlagesia can be associated with , but
does not cause, cesarean section delivery," Dr Fogel said. "An
abnormal labor can produce extreme pain for mothers, and this pain
leads women to ask for epidurals," he said. "Our study has the advantage of following cesarean rates before and
after the introduction of a popular epidural service," Dr Fogel said.
"Since patient demographics and cesarean section rates did not
change, we can safely and accurately conclude that the total number
of cesarean deliveries performed was not affected by the
availability of epidural analgesia." Similar findings emerged from an analysis of data on more than 13,000
first-time mothers who gave birth between 1989 and 1995 at St. Luke's
Roosevelt Hospital Center, a teaching hospital of Columbia University
in New York City. The analysis showed that the mother's age, the baby's birth weight and
use of the labor-inducing drug oxytocin increased the women's risk
for cesarean sections. "Not only was epidural analgesia not a
significant risk factor but it was associated with slightly decreased
cesarean section delivery risk." anesthesiologist David J. Birnbach,
M.D., said. By relieving pain, epidural analgesia may help some patients relax
and this realization could facilitate labor, Dr. Birnbach said. "We're
not suggesting the technique will prevent cesarean sections," he
stressed, "but in our practice, epidurals are clearly not a cause."
In addition, the use of epidural analgesia almost doubled at the
hospital during the five years studied (from 37% to 68%) but the
percentage of cesarean sections deliveries did not increase, Dr.
Birnbach said. A third study at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
reviewed the labor and delivery records of more than 2300 women who
received ultra-low dose solutions of epidural medications. The
ultra-low dose epidurals allow many women's labor to proceed
comfortable, Stephen D. Pratt, M.D., said. For women requiring more
pain relief, additional medication can be given by the same epidural
route. The Boston study showed that women who needed additional pain relief
beyond the ultra-low dose were more likely to have cesareans. Women
who needed more than two additional doses were twice as likely to
require a cesarean section as those who do not. "The slow, abnormal
labor that leads to cesarean section is more painful than normal
labor and therefore requires stronger epidural medication," Dr Pratt
said. "Epidural do not cause cesarean sections. Rather women who have
abnormal labor may be in more pain and therefore are more likely to
need an epidural and stronger medication." The above three studies were retrospective studies done in choice
situations/hospitals that had actively taken a new approach to
reducing cesarean sections as well as hospitals that maintain such
high cesarean section rates that the comparisons would be
insignificant due to cesarean rates of over 30%. The only prospective study was the fourth one, conducted at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in
Dallas. 6 Seven hundred, fifteen
women of mixed parity in spontaneous labor at full term were randomly
assigned to receive either epidural anesthesia (EA) or
patient-controlled intravenous meperidine analgesia (PCMA). Epidural
analgesia was maintained with a continous infusion of 0.125%
bupivacaine with 2 pg/ml fentanyl. Patient controlled analgesia was
maintained as 10-15 mg meperidine given every 10 minutes as desired
by the patient using a patient-controlled pump. A total of 358 women were randomized to receive epidural anesthesia
and 243 (68%) complied. Similarly, 357 women were randomized to
receive patient-controlled analgesia, and 259 (73%) complied with
that protocol. Five women randomized to PCMA requested epidurals.
Based upon an intent to treat analysis, there was no difference in
the rate of cesarean deliveries between the two groups (EA, 4%, 95%
CI: 1.9-6.2%; PCMA, 5%, 95% CI: 2.6-7.2%. Women in the epidural group
reported lower pain scores during labor and delivery. What is amazing is that this study was used to argue that epidurals
did not increase risk for cesarean birth. What is lacking, of course,
is a reasonable control group, such as a doula. When one looks at the
amazingly high amounts of meperidine that women could
self-administer, it is no wonder that so few requested an epidural,
since they could hardly be expected to be very alert. A woman could
receive 90 mg of meperidine per hour. In actuality, the average amount
of meperidine a woman self-administered was 200 mg with the highest
amount being 500 mg. To give a sense of the amounts being given here,
routinely in the emergency department, for treating ureterolithiasis
(kidney stones), which most women agree is a more severe pain than
labor, I would rarely administer more than 150 to 200 mg of
meperidine over 12 hours. The average length of labor during which
these women received their meperidine was under 12 hours. No one has
asked the question of how such a massive dose of meperidine would
affect the cesarean rate. The authors stated, "Patient-Controlled intravenous analgesia is
widely used in the United States to manage postoperative pain,
although use during childbirth has been limited. One concern is
newborn respiratory depression from increased narcotic administration
to the mother. Many women in our study used more than 200 mg of
meperidine during the course of their labor, but only 3.4% of infants
were given naloxone to reverse respiratory depression. The mothers
were visibly sedated but were invariably arousable and none
experienced respiratory depression."  Since neither of us have never had to give an infant naloxone in over 1000 deliveries, we wonder what the indications would actually be. We suspect these infants were quite depressed to receive naloxone. Our experience with patient controlled analgesia is that the reason the patient stops pushing the button is that she gets so high a dose that she falls asleep. I suspect the mothers were more compromised than the authors think, but none had to be intubated or artificially ventilated, therefore, none experience respiratory depression. The authors also under-emphasized the fact that all patients were
enrolled at the same time in an aggressive program to reduce cesarean
birth, consisting of:   No use of electronic fetal monitoring, even for epidurals (except
for one test strip on admission), thereby necessitating nurse
auscultation of the fetal heart rate and one-on-one patient care,
both well known to reduce
the cesarean rate.  No patient admitted to the hospital before 4-5 cm of cervical
dilation, also known to lower the cesarean rate.  No drugs or epidurals until the woman was 5 cm dilated, also known
to reduce the cesarean rate.  All births attended by CNMs, which is known to reduce the cesarean
rate by one-third of what obstetricians would do. For example, a
study from Los Angeles County-USC Hospital showed a 4% cesarean rate
in a 95% Hispanic population when they were attended by
nurse-midwives. 7  Use of a black and Hispanic population. In an editorial
discussion, the authors, themselves, comment on black and Hispanic
populations having historically lower cesarean rates.   The authors' real conclusions are this: If you do everything possible
to reduce the cesarean rate for all patients, and then, if you
compare epidural anesthesia with high dose, self-administered
narcotic analgesia, there is no difference in the cesarean rate. This
is not really a very outstanding conclusion, though the popular press
read this result as saying epidural anesthesia is now proven safe and
unlikely to increase the cesarean rate (without addressing the
question, over what? Some infants (0.8%) in the epidural group also required naloxone. Two
transfers to NICU occurred in the epidural group and 3 in PCMA
group. Looking just at those who had epidurals vs. those who didn't,
epidurals prolonged the first stage of labor and increased the
incidence of oxytocin administration. Fever developed in more women
during epidural anesthesia. There was no difference in the number of
cesareans in the epidural vs. the PCIA group (the range from 3% to 7%
cesarean rate). Regarding other complications, 24% of women having epidurals had
fever compared to 6% in PCMA. Nine percent had forceps with epidural
compared to 3% with PCMA. There was a15-19% range of meconium during
labor (not different between groups), which we find rather high.
There was a rate of 1.2-1.8% of infants suffering meconium aspiration
(not different between groups), but also rather high in our
experience.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   2. Significant Low Blood Pressure (Hypotension): Significant low blood pressure is a complication of epidural anesthesia. 1 The ways that epiduralized patients must lie accentuate this. Their position is limited since they are essentially paralyzed people for the duration of the epidural. Hypotension occurs among almost one-third of patients with serious hypotension occurring about 12% of the time. 8  Maternal hypotension is a major risk for the baby. The epidural
blocks the nerves which regulate blood pressure. It causes the blood
in the body to pool, keeping it from being pumped around the body in
the proper manner. The arteries dilate and relax their usual,
necessary level of tension, making it difficult for the heart to pump
blood to the baby. These changes lead to a decrease in the output of
the mothers heart. Less blood per unit time can reach the placenta
and therefore the baby. The baby is completely dependent on the mothers heart to pump blood
to the placenta to satisfy its needs. All of its oxygen comes across
from the placenta. All of the food for its brain and other organs
comes across the placenta. Brains cannot live without a relatively
constant supply of oxygen and glucose. Without this they become
damaged. A good blood flow is needed to the uterus between contractions so it
can get fresh oxygen. During the contraction, blood flow to the
uterus is cut off by the muscles contracting. When the contraction
stops, the uterus must quickly refill with fresh blood containing
oxygen for the baby. If the amount of blood flowing to the uterus is
reduced, the baby may not be able to get the oxygen it needs. Then
what is called fetal distress may occur. The baby's system does not
get enough oxygen and goes into distress. Its blood retains excess
acid, the oxygen levels go low and tissues and vital organs begin to
fail from excess acid, lack of oxygen and lack of fuel. Animal studies have shown that lack of oxygen to the baby (called fetal hypoxia) can cause significant damage to the babys brain even without the pH of the baby's umbilical cord blood being
affected. 9 (The pH of the babys umbilical cord blood at birth is usually used as an indicator of whether or not fetal hypoxia has occurred.) Severe low blood pressure can also result from compression of
the mothers blood vessels (aorta and vena cava) since all mothers
must lie essentially flat on their back after epidural anesthesia
(they cannot feel or move their back, pelvis and
legs). 10   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   3. Fetal Distress: Fetal heart rate decelerations can occur
following the use of epidurals. 1 Babies can develop fetal
distress after epidural
anesthesia. 11 This may be caused
by the mothers blood pressure getting so low that blood cannot be
adequately pumped into the uterus to deliver oxygen to the baby. As
we mentioned above, epidurals make it difficult for the muscles in
the arteries of the lower body to respond and to keep blood
adequately flowing through the body. The ability of the heart to
respond to changing needs of the body is
impaired. 12 Eberle and
Norris 1 suggest that [i]nduction of maternal analgesia may
transiently alter the balance between factors encouraging and
discouraging uterine contraction. A temporary increase in the
uterotonic effects of endogenous or exogenous oxytocin may then
produce a tetanic contraction with subsequent decrease fetal oxygen
delivery and resultant fetal bradycardia. Most babies of mothers receiving epidural anesthesia develop episodes of slow heart rate (bradycardia). 13 While this does not usually affect the healthy baby, it can be disastrous for the baby that is already compromised from some other problem (often unknown to the doctors). Adverse effects on the baby indicative of insufficient oxygen
reaching the baby (late decelerations) can occur. These changes may
also result from a toxic effect to the baby of the local anesthetic
given in the epidural. The transient low blood pressure which always occurs after epidural anesthesia has been found to lead to significantly lower the baby's blood pH. 14 This indicates excess blood acid, usually meaning that the baby is not getting enough oxygen. Anesthesiologists dont think that this makes any difference in the baby's outcome, but we suspect, if we studied babies already at risk for other reasons, we would find that epidural significantly worsens compromised babies and may lead to a Cesarean birth when the baby might have otherwise tolerated a vaginal birth. We suspect that more detailed research would identify a group of babies who would have tolerated unmedicated, normal birth, but who are unable to handle the added stress of the epidural, leading in the worst causes to death or permanent disability.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   4. IV Cannulation: Accidental injection of the anesthetic
solution into the blood stream can occur and can cause the mother to
twitch, have convulsions, or lose of consciousness. Seizures
can occur from the toxic effects of the anesthetic agent entering the
blood stream. 15 Local
anesthetic toxicity occurred among 12 women in 1000
epidurals. 16   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   5. Trauma to Blood Vessels: Trauma to blood vessels can occur as a result of epidural anesthesia. 17 In one study, bleeding
in the spinal column and unintentional placement of the catheter into
an artery or vein occurred 0.67% of the time (67 women of every 1000
epidurals). 18 The catheter
actually escapes outside of where it is supposed to go 1 to 6% of the
time. 19  Hemorrhages can occur around the spinal cord and even within the
skull following epidural
anesthesia. 20 These were
associated with persistent backaches or headaches. Failure to treat
these problems usually results in permanent paralysis. Surgery must
be performed within 8 hours of the onset of paralysis or the
prognosis is poor. Chronic subdural hematoma has resulted from
epidural anesthesia and has even presented as post-partum
psychosis. 21   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   6. Punctured Dura: The actual dura may be punctured as a result of epidural anesthesia. Because of the large size of the
needle used, severe headache may also result. Dural punctures have been
found to occur about 1.8% of the
time. 22 Unintentional dural
puncture occurred in 61 of 1000 epidurals in a University
hospital (resulting in spinal
anesthesia). 23   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   7. Infection: An infection can develop at the site of
injection. Bacterial meningitis can occur from contamination
during placement of the
epidural. 24 An abscess can also form
at the site where the epidural catheter is
placed. 25  26   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   8. Backache: Backache after an epidural is a common complication. Back pain
commonly occurs after epidural anesthesia (18.9% of the
time 27 ). Upper back pain can
happen at some distance from the site where the epidural is
injected. 28 The back pain can
last very long-term. 29 Nineteen
percent of women had long-term backache after epidural
anesthesia. 30 It probably
results from a combination of its effects on the nerves and from
extreme postures and stretching that occurs after the epidural during
labor. Low back pain after epidural anesthesia for childbirth is also frequently
mentioned. 31   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   9. Broken catheters: Occasionally the catheter has
broken and a small piece is left in place. It usually causes no
ill effects.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   10. Abnormal Uterine Contractions: Uterine contractions can become weaker and less frequent.
An oxytocin infusion is then necessary to improve labor and produce
good strength contractions Mothers having epidurals have longer
labors and have a higher incidence of the use of oxytocin than
mothers having non-medicated
deliveries. 32  There are important risks of giving oxytocin also. Administration of
this hormone to the mother during labor can cause:    Dangerously high blood pressure. Abnormal heart rhythms. Nausea and vomiting. Sustained uterine contractions which last too long and result in the baby going into distress from lack of oxygen. When this is too severe, the uterus can rupture. The epidural can mask the strength of the uterine contractions so that no one knows that how strong they are, making uterine rupture more possible. Hemorrhage around the brain. Retention of water leading to convulsions and coma. Bleeding in the pelvis and increased incidence of postpartum hemorrhage. Death of the baby. Jaundice of the baby.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   11. Second Stage Labor Effects: With large doses the patient
loses the desire and the ability to bear down and push. This results
in an increased use of forceps and vacuum extractions over women
having unmedicated
deliveries. 33   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   12. Inadequate Pain Relief: The epidural is generally
inadequate 7.1% of the time, leading to supplementation with
intravenous pain medication 4.0% of the time and a general anesthetic
3.1% of the time (in one
study). 34   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   13. Accidental Spinal Anesthesia: When an epidural
accidentally turns into a spinal anesthetic, many complications can
occur:    Postspinal headaches. Dysfunction of the bladder is frequent Occasionally numbness and tingling (paresthesias) of the lower limbs and abdomen develop, and sometimes there is a temporary loss or diminution of sensation in these areas. Unilateral footdrop (paralysis of the muscle that lifts the foot) has occurred. Permanent nerve damage (conditions called chronic, progressive adhesive arachnoiditis or transverse myelitis) can occur. These lead to paralysis of the lower parts of the body. Deaths have been reported. Difficult breathing Increased incidence of forceps deliveries.   The reliability of spinal anesthesia with 5% hyperbaric lignocaine
was studied among 30 patients undergoing elective Cesarean. Twelve
patients had hypotension and four developed severe postspinal
headaches. The block progressed to the C2 dermatome in four patients
and was associated with dysphagia. This was totally unpredicted and
was thought due to altered cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in late
pregnancy. 35   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   14. Maternal Heart Attack or Spinal Cord Ischemia: The lack of
ability of the heart to pump blood around the body (from low blood
pressure or pooling of blood) can become so severe that a heart
attack occurs or the spinal cord will suffer damage from not enough
blood reaching it. 36   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   15. Asthmatics: Asthmatics can get suddenly worse during epidural
anesthesia 37 with more wheezing
and inability to breath.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   16. Medication interactions: A hidden danger of epidural anesthesia is its interaction with
medications (prostaglandins) commonly used to soften the cervix
and start labor. The use of prostaglandins is common at hospitals
and creates a potentially dangerous situation in which the
usual medications used to treat low blood pressure during
labor will no longer work. 38   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   17. Interactions Occur with Other Illnesses: As an example, women who have
migraines can have more visual disturbances after
epidurals. 39   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   18. Maternal Fever & Malignant Hyperthermia: Maternal fever and even the severe condition called
malignant hyperthermia (dangerously high fever) can
result. 40  41   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   19. Respiratory Arrests: Mothers can stop breathing
(respiratory arrest) 42  43 and can experience other
breathing difficulties. 44 Greenhalgh * reported a 19 year old obstetric patient who
had a respiratory arrest shortly after receiving intrathecal
sufentanil and bupivacaine as part of a combined epidural/spinal
technique for pain relief.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   20. Other Neurological Disabilties: Other neurological disabilities (including a condition
called Horners syndrome) can develop along with hoarseness
(from even just one dose of epidural
anesthetic). 45 Clayton 46 reported an incidence
of Horner's syndrome during epidural anesthesia for elective
Caesarean section of 4%. The incidence of Horner's syndrome with
epidural anesthesia for vaginal delivery was 1.33%. They found it
impossible to predict which patients would develop a Horner's
syndrome. Even the nerves to the face can be blocked, sometimes
temporarily, sometimes
permanently. 47 Tremors and
shakes can occur. 48  49  Paresthesias (persistent tingling from sensory nerves)
occurred in 0.16% of patients in one study (1.6 per 1000) with an
incidence of persistent neuropathy of 0.04% (4 per
10,000). 50 Four of these
patients had a neuropathy which eventually resolved. In another study
3.0% of patients had tingling of the hands or fingers, while 26 of
almost 5000 women had persistent tingling or numbness in the lower
back, buttocks or legs. 51  Dizziness and fainting can become a problem after epidurals. One
study found these symptoms persisting in 2.1% of
women. 52   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   21. Nausea and Vomiting: Twenty to 30 percent of women
experience nausea after epidural anesthesia, while 3 to 7% have
vomiting. 53   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   22. Allergic Conditions: A dangerous allergic condition with shock (called
anaphylaxis) can occur. 54 The
woman develops a red rash (erythema), itches, and her lungs fill up
with fluid (pulmonary edema). Excessive lung fluid is also found in
the babies in these cases. 55   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   23. Heart Problems: Mothers can experience excessively slow heart rates
(bradycardia), heart block in which the electrical activity of the
chambers of the heart become dissociated and sometimes even stoppage
of the heart (cardiac
arrest). 56   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   24. Headache: Headache after epidural is a persistent problem that is
more pronounced in younger
patients. 57 One study found its
incidence after epidural anesthesia to be 4.6%, significantly more
often than women not having
epidurals. 58 It usually occurs
from the effects of puncturing the dura. Headache can also occur from
air getting into the spinal fluid (called an iatrogenic
pneumocephalus). The air is introduced into the spinal fluid and
column when the test dose is given that is assumed to be in the
extra-dural space. When the person giving the epidural feels a loss
of resistance to the injection of air, this is when a pneumocephalus
can occur. The patient that was described complained immediately of
severe headache on both sides of her forehead followed by vomiting.
The baby had to be delivered by Cesarean with general anesthesia. The
patients headache resolved in 24 hours after Cesarean. Of 34 women with spinal headache (from 4766 epidurals), nine had
long-term disability from headache. Five of these were from
accidental dural puncture and four occurred after accidental spinal
block. 59   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   25. Motor Blockade: Epidural anesthesia can produce motor
blockade, resulting in temporary paralysis, even of respiratory
muscles. 60   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   26. Use in VBAC: Epidurals are sometimes used with women
desiring VBAC. Leung, et al. 61 studied the maternal and fetal consequences of uterine rupture during
VBAC. They concluded that significant neonatal morbidity occurred
when > or = 18 minutes elapsed between the onset of prolonged
deceleration and delivery. In 106 cases of uterine rupture at their
institution between Jan 1, 1983 and June 30, 1992, seven charts
were incomplete and excluded; of the remainder, 28 patients had
complete, 13 patients had partial, and 58 patients had no fetal
extrusion into the maternal abdomen. Maternal characteristics or
intrapartum events were not predictive of the catastrophic extent of
uterine rupture. There was one maternal death. Complete fetal
extrusion was associated with a higher incidence of perinatal
mortality and morbidity.   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   27. Technical Considerations: Epidural anesthesia is a technical procedure that requires
significant skill to place correctly. Many papers document the
technical aspects of this procedure which are not insignificant. For
example, 23% of epidural catheters inserted more than 2 cm into the
epidural space required manipulation. Epidural catheters inserted 8
cm within the epidural space were more likely to result in iv
cannulation. Epidural catheters inserted 2 cm within the epidural
space were more likely to become dislodged. Epidural catheters
inserted 2 to 4 cm within the epidural space required replacement
more often than catheters inserted deeper. 62   [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   28. Herpes Simplex Assocation: Epidural analgesia is
associated with recurrence of herpes simplex blepharitis after
cesarean section when epidural morphine is
given. 63    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Case Examples (Mild Problems) Here is an example of a 30 year old woman having her first baby who was admitted to the hospital
at 2 cm dilation at 11:05 pm. 64 By 4:30 am, she was 4 cm dilated with her waters broken and requested
epidural anesthesia. Her mother and her husband were in attendance coaching her. The epidural was started at 5:01 am and within 30 seconds, the patients heart rate began to climb steadily and precipitously from 88 to 174, levelling off at that rate.  The certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) discovered that the
patient had previously experienced heart palpitations: when stressed
or with heavy exercise. She had begun to feel mild nausea and
dizziness. Oxygen was administered and an iv drug (adenosine) was
given. A second dose followed five minutes later. The abnormal heart
rate (a supraventricular tachycardia) returned to normal and the
woman had a normal vaginal delivery within 6 hours of this episode.
This occurred presumable from a sensitivity to medication placed
through the epidural catheter. When complications such as this occur,
fetal scalp electrodes are usually placed to monitor the baby's EKG.
The therapy sometimes causes severe hypotension. A case has been reported in which a 24 year old woman with a past
history of mild backache had an epidural anesthesia. She had an acute
vagal reaction with loss of consciousness and her head falling
forward. Thirty-six hours later, she complained of severe pains all
over her spine, together with sciatica and spasm of the muscles on
either side of the spinal column (paravertebral muscles). None of
these symptoms responded to drug treatment. The pain eventually
disappeared after she wore a cervical collar, taking
anti-inflammatory drugs and having spinal manipulations (what
chiropractors and osteopaths do) It was thought that her backache was
due to what is called a posterior articular joint syndrome in which
the forward fall of her head strained the posterior joints of the
spinal column. 65    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Permanent Disability from Epidural Anesthesia  a. A disabling condition called spinal arachnoiditis can
develop after epidural anesthesia. Of 6 such women, 3 were
permanently confined to a wheelchair three years after their initial
evaluation. 66 None of these
patients had any prior spinal surgery or trauma or problems with the
spinal cord including previous hemorrhage, infections or other known
causes of arachnoiditis. They had no neurological symptoms prior to
epidural anesthesia. The diagnosis was confirmed by a medical test
called myelography in all cases. The epidurals were uneventful and
performed according to standard methods. Arachnoiditis is probably caused from the epidural injection of
foreign substances (the anesthetic itself or contaminants in the
solution) into the spinal canal. Subarachnoid cysts can occur in the spine from arachnoiditis produced
from the epidural
anesthetic. 67   b. Paralysis can occur. 68 The injection of the local anesthetic into the epidural space can
result in the veins becoming engorged, the spinal cord suffering from
a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and the woman developing acute
neurological problems. Some of these deficits can become
permanent. 69 Paralysis can also
occur from bleeding into the area during the epidural injection with
the formation of a pocket of blood pressing on the spinal cord
(hematoma). It can also occur from infection or trauma. Cranial nerve paralysis can occur at quite a distance from the site
of the epidural. This is thought to occur from traction on the spinal
cord. 70  Paralysis can occur from a condition called anterior spinal artery
syndrome after epidural anesthesia during
labor. 71 Paralysis can occur
when the blood flow to the spinal cord becomes so limited that tissue
dies. This is called an infarction. A case report of an infarction
after epidural anesthesia has been published in which leg paralysis
occurred and did not recover. A loss of sensation to pain and
temperature also occurred to the level of the mid-chest which
partially resolved. 72  Of 108 non-fatal complications in one study, five were associated
with permanent disability. 73 These included damage (neuropathy) to a single spinal nerve, acute
toxicity from the local anesthetic, and problems associated with
accidental puncture of the dura to become a spinal anesthetic. Another patient developed paralysis after epidural anesthesia
probably due to the anterior spinal artery or central arteries being
blocked during the epidural and leading to death of part of the
spinal cord. 74  Neuropathy is a condition in which sensory changes occur (loss
of sensation or hypersensitivity to sensation) with or without
chronic pain. Neuropathy occurs after epidural anesthesia. It can
occur from thrombosis of an artery from trauma from the epidural
injection or from the catheter. A lack of adequate blood flow (and
therefore oxygen) is called ischemia. This can cause neuropathy
also. 75    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Deaths from Epidural Anesthesia Here are some examples of women who have died from epidural anesthesia to illustrate the dangers. A healthy, 31 year old woman having her third child requested
epidural anesthesia and developed an acute condition of fluid in the
lungs (pulmonary edema). She could not be successfully
resuscitated. The baby also
died. 76  Sudden stoppage of the heart (cardiac arrest) can occur during
epidural anesthesia. 77  78 along with other heart rhythm
changes. 79 Sudden cardiac arrest
may be caused by air getting into veins during placement of the
epidural. 80  Respiratory insufficiency can occur and cause death. In one
case report, the patient initially developed pain in the
shoulder-neck region after epidural anesthesia, followed by fever and
an elevated white blood count. This led to a high-level (arms and
legs) paralysis with an inability to breath. Many problems then
developed with the heart and arterial system. An abscess was found
and the patient was eventually stabilized with antibiotics. The
patient required chronic mechanical ventilation and died of recurrent
pneumonia after 5 months of intensive care. The incidence of
breathing difficulties in one study was 0.54%, although only 5% of
those patients required prolonged artificial ventilation. Total
spinal anesthesia occurred in 0.013% of the epidurals but more than
half of these cases required intubation and prolonged mechanical
ventilation. Partial spinal anesthesia (sub-arachnoid block) occurred
in 0.04% of the cases. 81  Women are almost never given informed consent for epidurals. Even if they were just read two paragraphs from the package insert that comes with the medication used for epidurals (manufactured by Abbott
Laboratories), they might think twice. The package insert states:         Local anesthetics rapidly cross the placenta, and when used for
epidural, caudal or pudendal anesthesia, can cause varying degrees of
maternal, fetal and neonatal toxicity.... Adverse reactions in the
parturient, fetus and neonate involve alternations of the central
nervous system, peripheral vascular tone and cardiac function.... Neurologic effects following epidural or caudal anesthesia may
include spinal block of varying magnitude (including high or total
spinal block); hypotension secondary to spinal block; urinary
retention; fecal and urinary incontinence; loss of perineal sensation
and sexual function; persistent anesthesia, paresthesia, weakness,
paralysis of the lower extremities and loss of sphincter control all
of which may have slow, incomplete or no recovery; headache;
backache; septic meningitis; meningismus; slowing of labor; increased
incidence of forceps delivery; cranial nerve palsies due to traction
on nerves from loss of cerebrospinal fluid.         Who would sign a consent if it included the above language? The
degree to which the facts about the risks of epidural anesthesia are
hidden from women in labor is astonishing. Mothers who have a fever are significantly more likely to have had
epidural anesthesia. 82 Therefor
increasing the incidence of septic workups on newborns and the
subsequent complications of this procedure. We would hope that pregnant women would have a more informed
explanation of the risks of epidural anesthesia than what is
currently given, and would suspect that many would make other choices
if true informed consent was given (before labor, when the woman
still has time to prepare to cope with childbirth pain in other
ways).    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]     Critique of 3 Other Studies As we said the study we just discussed was the only prospective study. The other three studies are papers not yet published so we can only comment on the abstracts of these studies, they were "presented"
at the conference of the American Society of Anesthesiologists in November of 1997. Presented means that the paper was talked about at the conference and has not necessarily been accepted by a major medical journal for publication as of yet and may/or may not be.    1st Additional Study:   TITLE: Does epidural analgesia protect against cesarean section in nulliparous patients?   AUTHORS: DJ Burnbach, MD, A Grunebaum, MD, DJ Stem, MD, B Katgaem MD, MM Kuroda, MPH, DM Thys, MD   AFFILIATION: Department of Anesthesiology and Ob/Gyn, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY   INTRODUCTION: Recent articles have suggested that epidural analgesia may increase the risk of cesarean section. (1,2) In an effort to evaluate whether epidural analgesia during labor is associated with an increased risk of cesarean section at our institution, we evaluated the labor data of nulliparous patients who delivered at the hospital between 1989-1995.  METHODS : From January 1, 1989 -December 31, 1995, there were a total
of

31,670 deliveries at the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. The
13,203

nulliparous patients who delivered under the care of an obstetrician
during

that period of time constituted the study population. The following
were

the independent variables: type of labor analgesia administered,
patient

age, obstetric care provider (private vs. non-private), birth weight,
and

use of oxytocin for stimulation or induction. The dependent variable
was

the delivery mode. A non-hierarchical logistic regression was
performed to

determine which of these independent variables contributed to the
risk of

cesarean section.  RESULTS: Logistic analysis demonstrated that the highest risks for
cesarean

section were associated with oxytocin induction and maternal age. As
shown

in Table 1, other significant predictors of cesarean delivery were
oxytocin

for stimulation, patient status (private patients were at an
increased risk

of cesarean section) and birth weight. Epidural analgesia, on the
other

hand, was associated with a slightly decreased risk for cesarean
section.

For example, patients under 30 years of age who were induced with
oxytocin

who received epidural analgesia had a 32% cesarean section rate
(230/719)

versus a 39.1% cesarean section rate (70/179) for the same group
of

patients who did not receive an epidural anesthetic. Patients greater
than

29 years of age who were induced with oxytocin and received an
epidural had

a 45.4% cesarean section rate (114/251) versus a 58% cesarean section
rate

(51/88) for the same group of patients who did not receive an
epidural. Table 1:     Independent Variables  Odds Ratio  Confidence Interval    Oxytocin Induction  1.93  1.70 - 2.19    Maternal Age (per 10 years)  1.60  1.53 - 1.68    Birth Weight (per 1000g)  1.20  1.13 - 1.27    Oxytocin Stimulation  1.17  1.06 - 1.30    Patient Status (pvt. vs clinic)  1.10  1.01 - 1.16    Epidural Analgesia  0.89  0.81 - 0.97     DISCUSSION: Our data support other studies that have shown an
increased

risk of cesarean section with use of oxytocin, increased maternal
age, and

private patient status.(3) When controlled for other variables,
the

administration of epidural analgesia was associated with a decreased
risk

of cesarean section. Based on our data, we suggest that epidural
analgesia

as practiced at our institution, is associated with a decrease in
cesarean

section rate in nulliparous patients.  1. Obstet Gynecol 1996;88:993-1000 2. Am J Obstet Gynecol 1993;169:851-8 3. Am J Obstet Gynecol 1993;168:1881-5  CRITIQUE:  A major statistical problem with the study, which prevents the
authors from making the conclusions they have made, is the failure to
consider the interaction between epidural anesthesia and oxytocin
stimulation. Many studies have shown that epidural anesthesia
increases the need for oxytocin stimulations [refs]. A proper
statistical procedure would have been to use an interactive term for
epidural and oxytocin stimulation. I would have started with a
multivariate analysis of variance which would have considered the
interaction between epidural anesthesia and the other variables. The
authors believe (erroneously) that they are dealing with independent
variables. Clearly we all know that there is an association between
oxytocin induction and epidurals (more difficult labors; more likely
to have an epidural), maternal age (younger and older mothers are
more likely to have epidurals), oxytocin stimuation (women who have
epidurals are more likely to need oxytocin stimuation because of the
desultory effect of the epidural on uterine contractions, private
patients are more likely to have epidurals. The more sophisticated
approach to their paper would have been to use a technique such as
structural equations modeling (LISREL, or related procedures) to test
paths of effects. For example, one can test the hypothesis that
epidurals affect the cesarean rate through their effect on the need
for uterine stimulation. That could still be done with the authors'
data, and we plan to challenge them to an independent data analysis
(by our colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh) using path
analysis to test these hypotheses. Simply using logistic regression
in this context was inappropriately simplistic, but done probably
because it supported their bias (epidurals are good!). I suspect the
authors are well-informed and have excellent biostatistical
consultation, and chose not to report these other analyses that they
probably did, because these other analyses did not support their
position. I would draw your attention to another part of the abstract. Is it
reasonable practice to do cesareans on 58% of women who are older
than 29 years and are being induced? Are these numbers generalizable?
I was shocked to read this figure. In all my experience in
obstetrics, I can't imagine how you can perform a cesarean on 58% of
the women over age 29 whom you are inducing. I would very much like
to see their criteria for cesarean. With such high rates (45% in the
epidural group and 58% in the non-epidural group), I question how
generalizable these results are to good practice elsewhere. Perhaps
in an environment (consider how stressful this environment must be)
in which such high cesarean rates occur, epidurals do decrease the
risk for cesarean if you are being induced, but I can't believe that
such high cesarean rates constitute safe and prudent practice. I would like to see their overall complication rates, including
post-partum infection and the backache/headache complications of
epidurals. I suspect their morbidity is quite high.    [ Return to "Quick-Index of the Medical Risks of Epidural Anesthesia" ]   2nd & 3rd Additional Studies:  Two other studies shed some light on this debate. The first is Newton
ER, Schroeder BC, Knape KG, Bennett BL. Epidural analgesia and
uterine function . Obstet Gynecol 1995; 85:749-55.  "Continuous epidural analgesia with bupivacaine and fentanyl did not
result in a change in myometrial contractility in the first hour
after initiation of analgesia. However, despite more oxytocin
therapy, the rate of cervical dilation was significantly slower in
the epidural group than in the nonepidural group (1.9 versus 5.6
cm/hr, p < 0.001). Operative deliveries were more common in
patients with epidural analgesia than in those without it (12 of 62
versus 2 of 124, p < 0.0001). After epidural analgesia, myometrial
contractility is maintained with oxytocin, but the ability of the
uterus to dilate the uterus is reduced significantly."   Also important, Albers LL, Anderson D, Cragin L, Daniels SM, Hunter
C, Sedler KD, Teaf D. The relationship of ambulation in labor to
operative delivery . JNM 1997; 42(1):4-8.  "Women who ambulated for a significant amount of time during labor
(compared with those who did not ambulate) had half the rate of
operative delivery (2.7% versus 5.5%)." It's very hard to ambulate
with either an epidural or PCIA.  Two others studies have been widely quoted in the popular press. They
included a study by Dr. Steven Fogel, an anesthesiologist at
Washington University School of Medicine, in St. Louis. Dr. Fogel
looked at data on 7,000 patients delivering over a 28 month period at
his hospital. He compared cesarean rates for first time mothers
before the introduction of an epidural on demand anesthesia service
to cesarean rates after the introduction of the service, finding no
change. What isn't reported is how obstetrical practices changed
during this time interval, a very significant factor. Such historical
studies are notoriously unreliable because policies change so rapidly
in obstetrical management. Without such information, the study is
meaningless. The final study was done at Boston's Beth Isreal-Deaconess Medical
Center by anesthesiologist Steven Pratt. This study reviewed the
labor and delivery records of more than 2300 women who received
ultra-low dose solutions of epidural medications. The study showed
that women who needed additional pain relief beyond the low-doses
were more likely to have cesareans than women who did not. Dr. Pratt
argued that it was harder labors that caused cesareans and not
epidurals. This study was so anecdotal as to be hardly worth
commenting upon. What Dr. Pratt failed to note was that several
others studies have shown that patient satisfaction with low-dose
epidurals is very low and that more than half of women have
additional medication. Pratt's study actually supports the point of
view that epidurals lead to increased cesareans, when this
information is taken into account. What is amazing is the propagandizing that went on in the press. The
gold standard in medicine consists of randomized, controlled trials.
These have been done and do generally show increased cesarean rates.
To try and argue against these much better quality studies with
retrospective studies using historical controls is poor science, but
clearly good propaganda. To conclude we list some of these studies
and their conclusions:  Prospective Clinical Trials Investigating the Association between

How Safe Are Epidurals?  Statistics show that nearly 75 percent of women who give birth in America choose to have an epidural injection ( image ), the remaining choosing a natural birth. The rise in popularity of epidurals in recent years is linked to their relative safety record and successful pain relief results. So in answer to the question, yes, epidurals are considered relatively safe. One recent study by Cochrane Collaboration reviewed 21 clinical trials involving more than 6,500 births. They reported no increase in C-section rates among women who took an epidural anesthesia compared to those who did not. They did find however that those who took epidurals spent on average 15 minutes more in the second stage of labor (the pushing part). These women were also 18 percent more likely to need the drug pitocin, to artificially speed up the process ( labor induction ). The researchers also compared the well-being of the babies born and found no difference between the babies born to mothers who took an epidural than those who did not.   Bottom Line : Most doctors say that an epidural will reduce the amount of pain a woman feels during delivery and childbirth ; and that the medication is safe for both mother and child. Anecdotally many women complain of severe headaches and/or drowsiness for days after an epidural. Some of those who go on to experience a drug-free home birth in subsequent pregnancies, say that while it  hurt more, they felt much better immediately afterwards. Many feel that waterbirths help to reduce the pain of childbirth naturally. See also, is a home birth safe?    When Should An Epidural NOT Be Given? If: • Your cervix is less than 4cm dilated. You still need to wait. • If the epidural space, the tiny area where the needle needs to be inserted, cannot be located by the physician. • You are hemorrhaging. • You are taking blood thinners or antiplatelets for an ongoing medical condition. • If you have a low blood platelet count or a blood infection. • If labor is moving so fast that there is not enough time to prepare and administer the drug.  Interesting Epidural Risk Statistics As an epidural is an injection into the spine, some women may worry about the chance of something going wrong in this delicate area. Rest assured, the risk of paralysis (paraplegia) is very, very rare - statistically it happens in 1 in every 250,000 cases.  More common is an accidental puncture (1 in 100 cases) where  the doctor tries to insert the needle in the epidural space, a tiny area about 3-5mm deep, but accidentally misses it. This can lead to the severe headaches we discussed above which can last for several days.  Note: An epidural cannot be given in birthing centers or during a home birth ( image ). They require hospitalization.  • Need more information about childbirth? See: Guide To Childbirth • Got another question?

Share  On Facebook    Tweet  This    Reddit This    Share  This    Email    Leave A  Comment        by Amy B.  – on Sep 02nd  in Belly Talk   As if a pregnant woman doesn’t have enough to worry about, she may need to be concerned with getting an epidural – one of the things that’s supposed to help relieve pain and take the edge off an intense labor or prevent feeling during a C-section. And, epidurals are even given as pain management solutions for spinal and other chronic issues.  Although it’s extremely rare, it’s possible for epidurals to cause severe pain, spinal problems like arachnoiditis, and even temporary or lifelong paralysis. Unfortunately, many patients aren’t told about all of the possible complications before they opt for an epidural, making a devastating outcome even more surprising and difficult to cope with.  According to ScienceDaily, less than 1 in 200,000 people given an epidural are permanently or severely harmed, but as these cases show, it can happen.  The women in this article have all had different types of paralysis – from temporary to severe and lifelong – from their epidurals. It’s incredibly scary to think that something so routine can cause such severe effects on one’s health, but it’s also important to be aware of the risks of an epidural so women can be fully prepared and in control of their own health when creating their birth plans.  15 Major Medicine Mix-Up                     Advertising [x]        One woman in Sweden had a horrifying mix-up that never should have happened when she went to the hospital to give birth in July 2014. She was given what she thought was an epidural, but at some point, the containers for the epidural and a disinfectant were switched, leaving the mom with what could have been a fatal dose of disinfectant instead of an epidural.  The disinfectant was chlorhexidine, which is used to disinfect medical tools, like catheters. Fortunately, the dose was small enough that it didn’t leave any lasting damage to the woman. But, she spent two weeks in the hospital after her birth in a tremendous amount of pain – her husband described it as “electric jolts” - that left her unable to move her body properly as if she had a temporary paralysis.  14 Routine Procedure Goes Wrong                     Advertising [x]        Irrum Jethra’s case is one of the most well-known cases of epidurals related to childbirth gone wrong. Her story has been plastered on almost every online news outlet imaginable, and it’s easy to see why. Irrum’s first child’s birth was supposed to go as “normally” as possible, but when she received an epidural, things went downhill. For hours after her daughter’s birth, Irrum still had no feeling in her legs, which is uncommon for epidural recipients.  Eventually, Irrum’s doctors found that she had a rare blood clot caused by the epidural that compressed her spinal cord, causing paralysis. It’s unknown at this point if she will ever regain feeling in her lower body , but Irrum undergoes several hours of daily treatments with a therapist to try to get her legs working – or at least, feeling – again.  13 Too Painful To Sit After Birth                     Advertising [x]        Debra Shaw had her daughter in 2003, and since then, her life hadn’t been the same. She suffered damage to her coccyx, or the tail bone, during her daughter’s birth, which was long and intense for Debra because her daughter wasn’t positioned properly in the womb. But, to make matters worse, Debra’s anesthesiologist – who was a trainee - couldn’t find the proper place for the epidural to go, leaving her like a human pin cushion until he found the right spot.  Debra believes that the epidural possibly damaged her coccyx, which then became exacerbated by her rough labor and pushing. For years after the birth, with the worst pain starting around the time her daughter was two, Debra found it too painful to sit down because her coccyx had been pushed to an abnormal position, creating almost a reverse paralysis. Debra has since entered yoga and other treatments but has never regained full mobility without pain.  12 Scary Situation Post-Epidural                     One husband on Reddit asked some of his peers for help regarding his wife’s condition after receiving an epidural for pain during the birth of the couple’s baby. During the procedure, the wife had felt a liquidy sensation going down her leg, to which the anesthesiologist said something about hitting a pocket, but no more was said beyond that. After the birth, his wife got several hot flashes and her right leg was still feeling numb.  The husband asked others what they thought may be the problem with his wife, as she was still experiencing numbness in her leg to the point that she was unable to walk, severe hot flashes, and no appetite. Fortunately, the wife was, at the time of the husband’s writing, under the care of a doctor and undergoing some testing to find out the problem, rather than relying on Reddit users to solve the puzzle.  11 A Change Of Mind Led To Disaster                     Lisa Mann gave birth to her first child in 2002. At first, she planned not to have an epidural. However, she wasn’t prepared for her labor to last as long as it did, and by the time she had been in labor for 48 hours, she was ready for some pain relief. Lisa recalls that she was in incredible pain as the epidural needle went in, with an extremely hot feeling between her shoulders and then her whole body feeling cold. Soon, her legs started twitching uncontrollably.  She was able to have her daughter, but her left leg remained numb after the birth. When she got home from the hospital and tried to take a bath, neither leg was able to hold her up any longer. A day or so later, she began feeling numb at her waist. Doctors determined that she had spinal inflammation, which may have been caused by the epidural. For two years she used a wheelchair but was finally able to walk again when her daughter turned two.  10 Effects Of Missed Epidural                     Advertising [x]        Dawn Gonzalez recalls her frightening birth story on the National Pain Report website. She believes she was coerced into having an epidural and a C-section because of complications she was experiencing with her labor. She went along with the doctor’s wishes. But, during the epidural insertion, she experienced incredible pain that she didn’t think was normal. The nurse administering the epidural said, “Why didn’t you tell me I missed?”  It was later found that Dawn had arachnoiditis and two forms of meningitis attacking her spine from the epidural insertion. Because of her intense pain and complications, Dawn isn’t able to give herself a bath or change her clothes without help and has chronic pain throughout her body. Dawn believes that everyone should be aware of possible complications of an epidural and never feel pressured into getting one if it’s not what they want.  9 Temporary Paralysis And Constant Pain                     Michelle Babcock went into labor not thinking the worst, but instead excited to meet her new baby. She didn’t think twice about having an epidural when she gave birth in 2012 to her son. When she got the epidural though, Michelle felt a sudden intense pain on her body’s left side and her anesthesiologist reinserted the needle to another location. Then, her blood pressure dropped, causing her to feel faint. She was able to deliver her son but still had no feeling in her legs for hours after her son’s birth when nurses tried to get her to walk.  Michelle ended up with uncontrollable muscle spasms and extremely weak legs and feet that sometimes left her unable to walk at all, and when she could, it wasn’t much. She was eventually diagnosed with arachnoiditis and is unable to stand or sit for prolonged amounts of time.

Although the specifics of her epidural weren’t released – if she had one for childbirth or pain management and what went wrong along the way – it’s clear that the effects of her epidural had changed her life forever. In 2017, a video was released showing Terri taking her first steps after long, hard, and intense training for the past year.  Terri had been training with NextStep Orlando Center after being told by doctors that her chances of ever walking again were slim to none – at only about a 3% chance. But, as the video and this screenshot from that video show, Terri proved her doctors wrong, taking her first unassisted steps with her trainer close by for safety.  7 Wheelchair Bound From Epidural                     Advertising [x]        One woman on the What To Expect forums, a place where expecting and new moms share questions, answers, and pregnancy or birth-related stories, asked a question of other moms and pregnant women:  “One of my friends told me her cousin has been in a wheelchair for 5 years because of a failed epidural, what are the chances this happens?”. It is likely an even scarier situation when tragic side effects hit close to home, as was the case for this woman, who was afraid of it happening to her.  One woman replied that she’s known a couple of women who have had temporary paralysis from the epidural, but not long-term paralysis, and many other women had similar stories to share. Fortunately, the chances of permanent paralysis are slim, but they’re still there and it’s a possibility that every soon-to-be-mom should be aware of so they can make informed decisions.  6 A Devastating Post-Birth Story                     Giving birth should be one of the happiest times in a new mom’s life, but as Candace told to The West Coast Mommy, her baby’s birth in October 2004 ended in tragedy:  “My pregnancy was complication-free. “[During labor] my baby decided to flip ‘face up’ which meant he was no longer in the ‘optimal birthing position.’ This, in combination with the back labor I was experiencing, was horrible. I begged for an epidural. “[The anesthesiologist] began preparing, and I said, ‘I’m contracting,’ but she went ahead anyway.”  Candace said she shook from the contractions during the needle insertion when they suddenly went limp. But, she was still able to feel cold sensations and touches. Days after giving birth, she still couldn’t get her legs to move to walk. She hasn’t gotten any answers from doctors as to what went wrong, but she hasn’t been able to walk since that day.  5 Long-Term Crippling Effects                     Helen Bertelli’s epidural wasn’t associated with either one of her births of her two children, but instead was part of a treatment for serious back pain she was experiencing. An epidural for pain management is administered the same way as one for labor and carries the same possible side effects, including temporary or permanent paralysis. In Helen’s case, her epidural left her with spinal arachnoiditis, which is currently not curable.  The epidural left her with strange sensations in her legs which, at times, make her unable to walk or stand. She also gets intense pains and muscle cramps in her lower body. Helen says that she was never informed of the potential risks of her epidurals and has since formed an advocacy group that urges the FDA to make the risks known to patients.  4 Fighting For Answers                     Advertising [x]        One husband started a Go Fund Me fundraiser for his wife, Cheryl, who received an epidural for pain management in 2010, much like Helen Bertelli’s case. When she awoke from her general anesthesia, she couldn’t feel her legs at all. Doctors reassured her that her numbness was normal for a short time, but hours later, she was still unable to feel anything below her waist.  Eventually, Cheryl was sent to another facility that found spinal damage from the epidural, causing her to become completely paralyzed from the waist down. The Go Fund Me account was set up to help cover medical bills for Cheryl’s new and unexpected health needs, including rehabilitation therapy designed to try to help her walk again one day. As of her husband’s writing, Cheryl had taken two unassisted steps finally, almost three years after her epidural.  3 Swimmer’s Horrifying Paralysis                     At only 18 years old, Mallory Weggemann lost her ability to walk following an epidural that she had for pain management related to a case of shingles that caused her to have severe lower back pain. Mallory previously had two epidurals that went just as expected, but it was her third one that left her paralyzed from the waist down. Mallory had been a swimmer since she was 7 years old, so of course, she wondered if she’d ever swim again.  Fortunately, she’s defied all odds and has since become a para-swimmer, using her arms to help propel her from the wall instead of her legs, as most swimmers do. In 2009 and 2010, she won the title of World Disabled Swimmer of the Year and got an ESPY award in 2011, as the Best Female Athlete with a Disability.  2 Getting Some Justice                     Just to show that epidurals have potential risks to people of all ages, this case tells the story of Robbin Smith, a woman who just recently won a $14.9 million lawsuit against a surgery center of which she was a patient in 2013. According to KDVR, Smith had received an epidural as a steroid injection with a drug that was labeled “Not for epidural use.” The epidural left her with a spinal cord infection , thanks to the faulty medicine, and she was paralyzed – likely permanently – from the waist down. Unfortunately, Smith was never told about the risks of using the medicine via an epidural.  Smith now needs constant care to do things she should be able to do on her own, like cook a meal, use the bathroom or take a bath.  1 Devastating Hospital Error                     It’s extremely sad to hear about cases in which epidurals had such devastating effects on women, but it’s scary to know that it can happen to such young people, like Mallory Weggemann, who trusted the procedure to help their pain. In 2008, Sophie Tyler was another young woman – only 14 years old – who received an epidural for pain management following a gall stone surgery. The hospital made a traumatic error, though, leaving her epidural in place for two days and permanently damaging her spinal cord.  Sophie was left paralyzed from the waist down and now lives her life in a wheelchair. The family attorney has said, "At the age of 14, to be told the news that you will never walk again is unimaginable and to discover that mistakes were entirely avoidable has been incredibly hard for them to cope with."

                        before the epidural is placed.  You
                        may also be asked to lie on your left side.    ·  Ephedrine may also be given through your IV to restore blood pressure.  You may also be given more IV saline fluid.   ·  Stay off your back.  Compression of

                        for a short time (30 minutes?).   ·  Can waste needed resources and deplete mother of energy.     ·  Medicine may be given to treat nausea.  This sometimes makes the mother intensely sleepy.       Postpartum Backache     10%
                        - 22% [21]  [22]     ·  May last a few days or continue for years.  Possibly due to “stressed” positions in labor exacerbated by muscular relaxation
                        and the absence of feedback pain to tell you to get out of a damaging position.   ·  May (rarely) be caused by nerve damage.     ·  Change positions frequently   ·  Stay off your back   ·  Practice pelvic and back strengthening exercises to prepare for childbirth.   ·  Consider choosing a CSE, or intrathecal epidural to allow you more sensation and

                        cesarean section.   ·  Babies are often separated from their mothers immediately after birth to check for
                        infection.  May include a spinal tap
                        to check for sepsis.  Baby may stay
                        in hospital for several days for antibiotic treatment while mother goes home.     ·  Do not accept epidural anesthesia before active labor is established (5 cms or more).   ·  Try to keep cool.  Eat ice chips or
                        drink ice water, keep ice packs under arms, under belly or between legs.   ·  Have a birth attendant mist and fan you during labor to promote heat dissipation.       Spinal Headache     1% -
                        10% [24]     ·  Most likely caused by postdural puncture and leaking cerebrospinal fluid.  Can range from mild to debilitating and last from days to weeks.     ·  Rest at home in a supine position (on your back).   ·  Drink caffinated drinks, with the approval of your care provider.   ·  May resolve on its own or you may need a blood patch procedure.

Some mothers may not feel like participants in their births.   ·  May affect mother-baby bonding.     ·  Talk to your care provider and get support for new parents.       Postpartum feelings of regret or loss of autonomy     Depends
