The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

View Archived Tables       The odds of dying from an injury in 2014 were 1 in 1,576 according to the latest data available.  The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

The unfortunate half-million were all those around the world who were slain in 2012. The average person thus had roughly a one in 16,000 chance of being bumped off that year. But as the UN’s figures make clear, there is no such thing as an average person. How can you shorten your odds of making it through 2014? First, don’t live in the Americas or Africa, where murder rates (one in 6,100 and one in 8,000 respectively) are more than four times as high as the rest of the world. Western Europe and East Asia are the safest regions. And the safest countries? Liechtenstein recorded no murders at all in 2012, but its population could fit in a football stadium. Among those countries whose populations number in millions, the safest is Singapore, which clocked up just 11 murders in 2012, or one killing per 480,000 people. In Honduras, the world’s most violent country, one in every 1,100 residents was killed. Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

The Economist explains a day ago Homo sapiens spread to Asia earlier than once believed Science and technology a day ago See more Next, be a woman. Your chance of being murdered will be barely a quarter what it would be were you a man. In fact, steer clear of men altogether: nearly half of all female murder-victims are killed by their partner or another (usually male) family member. But note that the gender imbalance is less pronounced in the rich world, probably because there is less banditry, a mainly male pursuit. In Japan and South Korea slightly over half of all murder victims are female. Then, sit back and grow older. From the age of 30 onwards, murder rates fall steadily in most places. But not everywhere. Europeans are more at risk in middle age than in youth. European women cannot let their guard down even in retirement: those aged over 60 are more likely to be murdered than those aged 15-29. The UN speculates that this may be because they are more likely to have partners, and those partners are more likely to drink. Other studies have found that alcohol featured in half of murders in Australia, Finland and Sweden, making it a more common factor than any weapon. And if you are killed? The chances are no one will be convicted. Worldwide only 43% of murders result in someone being put behind bars. This, too, varies hugely: whereas Europe’s police solve eight out of ten murders and those in Asia clear up nearly half, three-quarters of killers in the Americas escape justice (a smaller share in North America; a higher one elsewhere in the region). As long as that continues, there is little reason to think that the region’s fearsome murder rate will be tamed.

The following test lets you rate your actual risk of being burglarized (i.e. - Someone breaking into your home or apartment to steal something).  This test uses known risk factors taken from executive security courses, police detectives, crime stats and security consultants. Other Rate Your Risk tests are more accurate and give you an easy way to determine what life style actions, habits or associations will raise or lower your risks.  Some of the questions may seem odd but these factors impact burglary statistics.  Read each question. Click on the ones that you would answer yes and leave the answer boxes blank when you would answer no or if the question doesn't apply .  Take it to see if there are safety tips you haven't considered...don't be overly concerned about scores.  None of these tests are accurate for countries outside the United States (though they can be interesting).  Most people find they have little risk but may find tips to reduce even those risks.  These tests are a means to evaluate the risks in your lifestyle without a lecture. Don't panic if you have a high score... evaluate those factors that increase or decrease your risk.

This risk assessment is designed to give guidance and insight to educators, adults and concerned students regarding individuals in school who may have tendencies to assault others (get into fights or strike others). Individuals already involved with non-sexual assaults in the criminal justice system or referred for counseling in non-weapon assaults had many similar characteristics.  This test uses these combinations of significant risk factors and repetitive behaviors to produce intervention strategies wherever there are matching behaviors in the assessment. This test does not predict behavior (assault) but when a combination of behaviors and characteristics match the behaviors and characteristics of individuals who have already been incarcerated for assault or referred for counseling for assault -- the test response will make recommendations to lower specific risk factors.  There may also be links showing research links to aid you further.   This test is NOT designed to replace a trained school or mental health counselor. Responses to the test depend on the quality and completeness of the input. Remember - inaccurate or incomplete information input will result in inaccurate output.  The test responses may give suggestions for intervention or mitigation of problems.  Students (individuals) who score high share most of the behaviors and risk factors of students who have ALREADY gotten into fights or hit other people (assault and battery or aggravated assault).  This test uses warning indicators or factors from others who have already assaulted other students, teachers or peers.  Please use any recommendations provided by the test as a proactive tool to provide support and services to students. Some individuals may rise above high risk factors and never threaten or assault another individual .  The following Assault Risk Factors Assessment was developed through a School Based Partnership Grant .  The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, School Security, Metropolitan Juvenile Courts and Oasis Center, Inc. designed this test with funding and in cooperation with the National Institute of Justice - COPS Office.  The Metropolitan Police Department, Metropolitan Public Schools, Metropolitan Juvenile Court, National Institute of Justice, and the Oasis Center Incorporated are not responsible for the actions of any individuals taking this test. Use this tool as a triage method for students needing help -- and help those who may be marginally at risk. This assessment only uses risk factors (behaviors/characteristics) for non-weapon, non-sexual assaults and is normalized for Nashville, Davidson County at this time.   Only use this tool as an aid to reduce risk factors for assaults and find resources to intervene with students who have a significant number of risk factors similar to others who have already committed simple or aggravated assault.   Take the Assault Intervention - Risk Reduction Assessment and answer as many questions as possible.  You will be trying to find out if the person you are assessing has a pattern of risk factors similar to others who have ALREADY assaulted other people. This assessment will suggest what constitutes a risk factor and ways to reduce these risk factors.  Be thorough and try to be as honest as possible. Try to avoid bias in your test or the results will not be helpful. Many people will find that they do not have enough facts to complete an evaluation. Don't make snap judgments about this youth as you may only see how they are responding to your perception of them .  Have you spent more than five minutes with them?

What Are the Odds of Being Murdered?     Crime  /  Society             Flip through the channels on television on any ordinary weekday evening and you’ll be presented with a variety of entertainment options, many of which feature murder, in documentary or drama form. Murder, or intentional homicide, persistently occupies a place at the center of the popular imagination. Yet, for all its popularity, for all its pervasiveness in primetime television, local news or even bestseller lists, murder is a relatively rare occurrence.   The Odds of Being Murdered in Context  The odds of being murdered are relatively low when compared to other possible causes of death. In its Final Data report of U.S. deaths for 2010, the CDC reported assault (homicide) dropped off of the list of the 15 leading causes of death, becoming 16th, following “pneumonitis due to solids and liquids.”  Based on the data from the CDC report, deaths due to homicide accounted for less than 1% of all U.S. deaths, with the odds of being murdered in a given year at 1 in 18,989 . On the other hand, heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S., accounted for 24% of all U.S. deaths, with the odds of dying of heart disease at 1 in 517.  Murder and Place: Location, Communities, and Socioeconomics  The odds of being murdered vary significantly on the basis of location. However, it must be noted that careful analysis of the data reveals that “location” is most appropriately understood as referring not only to geography but also to other ways of defining place, including community type and socioeconomic conditions.  When murder rates are discussed from the perspective of location, people often ask which places—specific regions, states, counties, cities, or areas—have the highest and lowest homicide rates. Detailed data on the numbers of murders occurring annually can be found in the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports (UCR). Moreover, when cities or communities are grouped together or categorized by community type—rural, suburban or urban—an apparent trend emerges. Rural communities and suburban communities have lower average homicide rates than do urban communities (Schwartz 2010).  Cities, and more broadly, community types, are home to distinctive sets of socioeconomic conditions that form the backdrop of the murders that occur. Socioeconomic context is an important variable to consider when discussing the odds of being murdered. An individual’s socioeconomic context can be defined broadly as the aggregate combination of education, income, and occupation of the people who comprise his or her social sphere. Individuals who are a part of poverty-stricken socioeconomic contexts face greater odds of being murdered while individuals belonging to more affluent socioeconomic contexts have lower odds of being murdered.  Murder and Demographics  Besides location in general and socioeconomic context in particular, there are demographic characteristics that are relevant to an individual’s odds of being murdered, including sex, race and age. Males are more likely to be murdered than females. Individuals of African-American descent are more likely to be murdered than members of any other racial group. Individuals between the ages of 18 and 24 are at the greatest risk of being murdered. Additionally, individuals are most likely to be murdered by someone they know, and not a stranger.  It is also noteworthy that murder victim characteristics mirror those of murder perpetrators. The exception to this general pattern is the fact that females are usually murdered by males and less frequently by females (Schwartz 2010). In other words, an individual is most likely to be murdered by someone who has the same demographic traits, within his own socioeconomic context. More often than not, males are murdered by males, blacks are most often murdered by blacks and young adults are most often murdered by young adults.  However, murder and violence are tied not only to individual demographic traits, but also intrinsically to community level characteristics as well, as “communities are often segregated by SES, race, and ethnicity,” the American Psychological Association (APA) asserts. The APA goes on to explain that “community level risk factors for violence include increased levels of unemployment, poverty, and transiency; decreased levels of economic opportunities and community participation; poor housing conditions; and a lack of access to services.”  Murder, Relationships, and Crime  Murder is often precipitated by one of two additional factors as well: either an interpersonal relationship characterized by a history of confrontation or abuse or an active attempt to commit another crime.  Less than 30% of murders occur as a result of an active attempt to commit a felony, such as a robbery.  Murders involving a male victim and a male perpetrator most frequently occur during the course of or following a confrontation, an argument that in many cases originated because of a perceived slight, challenge or insult on the part of a male friend or acquaintance. Schwartz, Anderson and Messerschmidt each offer similar descriptions of this particular male murder motive, which Schwartz summarizes:  Whereas middle- and upper- class males may have a myriad of opportunities to “do masculinity,” lower class males living in concentrated urban poverty may, over time and as an adaptation to persistent economic strain, place stronger collective emphasis on more achievable goals than financial success, such as respect and prestige conferred to those with a street reputation (Anderson 1999; Messerschmidt 2004).  The murder of female victims is most often perpetrated within the framework of an intimate relationship. Usually, homicides against women are carried out by their male partners, at what turns out to be the end of a trajectory of escalating abuse or dominance (Schwartz 2010).

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

The study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics also concluded that about six million Americans, roughly 3 percent of those over 12, would become a victim of robbery, rape or other assault in a given year. The report said that over their lifetimes, black men have a 1-in-21 chance of being murdered; white men have a 1-in-131 chance; white women a 1-in-369 chance and black women a 1-in-104 chance. The assessment of murder risk was based on an analysis of reports submitted by coroners and medical examiners to the National Center for Crime Statistics in 1982. The other findings were based in part on research conducted over five years by the National Crime Survey, which conducts interviews twice a year with some 125,000 randomly selected people.

The odds may surprise you           Dave Mosher and Skye Gould     Jan. 31, 2017, 9:36 PM    123,331          facebook     linkedin     twitter     email     copy link     Shutterstock The idea that foreign terrorists pose a grave threat to Americans is sacrosanct to President Donald Trump's immigration ban, which he enacted on Friday. Trump's executive order immediately barred about 220 million people from seven majority-Muslim nations from setting foot on US soil for the next few months. It also triggered nationwide and international protest, sowed confusion at airports, and attracted judicial challenges (and defeats ), among other discord . Military and foreign policy experts, meanwhile, expressed concern the ban may actually worsen the threat of terrorism. The president, his administration, and his supporters defended the executive order by underscoring how the measure aims to protect US citizens from foreign-born terrorism. "We cannot gamble with American lives," Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary John Kelly said Tuesday during a televised press conference. "I will not gamble with American lives." But how justified is that gamble, according to real-world data? President Trump signs an executive order on January 27, 2017. Carlos Barria/Reuters According to a September 2016 study by Alex Nowrasteh at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, some 3,024 Americans died from 1975 through 2015 due to foreign-born terrorism. That number includes the 9/11 terrorist attacks (2,983 people) and averages nearly 74 Americans per year. Since 9/11, however, foreign-born terrorists have killed roughly one American per year. Six Americans have died per year at the hands, guns, and bombs of Islamic terrorists (foreign and domestic). "I once asked a guy at [the National Institutes of Health] how much we should spend on preventing a disease that kills 6 per year, and he looked at me like I was crazy," John Mueller , a foreign policy expert at the Ohio State University and co-author of the book " Chasing Ghosts: The Policing of Terrorism ", told Business Insider in an email. Here's how the lifetime odds of the most common — and feared — causes of death for Americans stack up against foreign killings (highlighted in red): Skye Gould/Business Insider Americans are more likely to win a lottery jackpot The chart above doesn't account for an American person's specific behaviors, age, sex, location, or other factors that can wildly change up the results — it's one big, fat average of the US population. The data primarily come from a 2016 report by the National Safety Council and the National Center for Health Statistics' final 2013 report on causes of death in the US , which was released in February 2016 (and is the most current). To include the Cato Institute's terrorism data — which doesn't include terrorism in other countries where Americans were victims — plus natural-disaster data shared by Tulane University, we calculated the lifetime odds of death by applying 2013 life expectancy and population in the US. Our analysis also assumes each cause of death won't change drastically in the near future. (A quick look at mortality data from other years suggests the magnitudes and rankings are relatively consistent.) "Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!" Trump tweeted on Wednesday . However, the reality flips Trump's rationale on its head. Compared to the threat posed by refugee terrorists — which the president's executive order is allegedly designed to curtail — the data suggest the typical American is: 6 times more likely to die from a shark attack (one of the rarest forms of death on Earth) 29 times more likely to die from a regional asteroid strike 260 times more likely to be struck and killed by lightning 4,700 times more likely to die in an airplane or spaceship accident 129,000 times more likely to die in a gun assault 407,000 times more likely to die in a motor vehicle incident 6.9 million times more likely to die from cancer or heart disease Put another way, as frightening and disturbing as events like 9/11 are, an American's unfathomably remote chances of winning the Powerball lottery jackpot are many times greater than those of being killed by a refugee terrorist on any given year — and even higher compared to the odds of being killed by an illegal immigrant terrorist. Syrian refugee children stand in front of their family caravan in Al Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan near the border with Syria, December 3, 2016. Muhammad Hamed/Reuters Weighing the logic of all-out counter-terrorism efforts It's worth pointing out that the US government's multi-billion-dollar-per-year homeland security efforts to thwart terrorism, certainly since 9/11, have ostensibly reduced American deaths and kept the odds low. However, it's hard to say — the DHS does not publicly release data about the number of terror attack attempts per day and lives saved as a result of its efforts. The same is also true of counter-terrorist military operations. But assume for a moment that one 9/11-like event killed 3,000 Americans per year, and indefinitely. While this would drastically raise the lifetime odds of death by a foreign terrorist, the typical American is still far more likely to die walking out the door, getting into a car, jumping into a pool, or simply standing up. Mueller and his colleague Mark G. Stewart explored the costs and benefits of fighting terrorism for the Cato Institute in a September 2014 study . That report states: "[T]he United States spends about $100 billion per year seeking to deter, disrupt, or protect against domestic terrorism. If each saved life is valued at $14 million, it would be necessary for the counterterrorism measures to prevent or protect against between 6,000 and 7,000 terrorism deaths in the country each year, or twice that if the lower figure of $7 million for a saved life is applied." Assuming the 2010 terrorist attack plot on Times Square was successful (the car bomb didn't go off), Mueller told Business Insider, hitting that measure would require four such attacks per day on US soil. "As has been suggested," Mueller and Stewart wrote in their study, "terrorists scarcely seem to be numerous, competent, and dedicated enough to carry out such a task." Andy Kiersz contributed to this report. This story has been updated with new details provided after its initial publication. A sentence that compared lottery odds to terrorist killing odds was also corrected and made more precise.

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

View Archived Tables       The odds of dying from an injury in 2014 were 1 in 1,576 according to the latest data available.  The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

The unfortunate half-million were all those around the world who were slain in 2012. The average person thus had roughly a one in 16,000 chance of being bumped off that year. But as the UN’s figures make clear, there is no such thing as an average person. How can you shorten your odds of making it through 2014? First, don’t live in the Americas or Africa, where murder rates (one in 6,100 and one in 8,000 respectively) are more than four times as high as the rest of the world. Western Europe and East Asia are the safest regions. And the safest countries? Liechtenstein recorded no murders at all in 2012, but its population could fit in a football stadium. Among those countries whose populations number in millions, the safest is Singapore, which clocked up just 11 murders in 2012, or one killing per 480,000 people. In Honduras, the world’s most violent country, one in every 1,100 residents was killed. Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

Your chance of being murdered will be barely a quarter what it would be were you a man. In fact, steer clear of men altogether: nearly half of all female murder-victims are killed by their partner or another (usually male) family member. But note that the gender imbalance is less pronounced in the rich world, probably because there is less banditry, a mainly male pursuit. In Japan and South Korea slightly over half of all murder victims are female. Then, sit back and grow older. From the age of 30 onwards, murder rates fall steadily in most places. But not everywhere. Europeans are more at risk in middle age than in youth. European women cannot let their guard down even in retirement: those aged over 60 are more likely to be murdered than those aged 15-29. The UN speculates that this may be because they are more likely to have partners, and those partners are more likely to drink. Other studies have found that alcohol featured in half of murders in Australia, Finland and Sweden, making it a more common factor than any weapon. And if you are killed? The chances are no one will be convicted. Worldwide only 43% of murders result in someone being put behind bars. This, too, varies hugely: whereas Europe’s police solve eight out of ten murders and those in Asia clear up nearly half, three-quarters of killers in the Americas escape justice (a smaller share in North America; a higher one elsewhere in the region). As long as that continues, there is little reason to think that the region’s fearsome murder rate will be tamed.

This risk assessment is designed to give guidance and insight to educators, adults and concerned students regarding individuals in school who may have tendencies to assault others (get into fights or strike others). Individuals already involved with non-sexual assaults in the criminal justice system or referred for counseling in non-weapon assaults had many similar characteristics.  This test uses these combinations of significant risk factors and repetitive behaviors to produce intervention strategies wherever there are matching behaviors in the assessment. This test does not predict behavior (assault) but when a combination of behaviors and characteristics match the behaviors and characteristics of individuals who have already been incarcerated for assault or referred for counseling for assault -- the test response will make recommendations to lower specific risk factors.  There may also be links showing research links to aid you further.   This test is NOT designed to replace a trained school or mental health counselor. Responses to the test depend on the quality and completeness of the input. Remember - inaccurate or incomplete information input will result in inaccurate output.  The test responses may give suggestions for intervention or mitigation of problems.  Students (individuals) who score high share most of the behaviors and risk factors of students who have ALREADY gotten into fights or hit other people (assault and battery or aggravated assault).  This test uses warning indicators or factors from others who have already assaulted other students, teachers or peers.  Please use any recommendations provided by the test as a proactive tool to provide support and services to students. Some individuals may rise above high risk factors and never threaten or assault another individual .  The following Assault Risk Factors Assessment was developed through a School Based Partnership Grant .  The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, School Security, Metropolitan Juvenile Courts and Oasis Center, Inc. designed this test with funding and in cooperation with the National Institute of Justice - COPS Office.  The Metropolitan Police Department, Metropolitan Public Schools, Metropolitan Juvenile Court, National Institute of Justice, and the Oasis Center Incorporated are not responsible for the actions of any individuals taking this test. Use this tool as a triage method for students needing help -- and help those who may be marginally at risk. This assessment only uses risk factors (behaviors/characteristics) for non-weapon, non-sexual assaults and is normalized for Nashville, Davidson County at this time.   Only use this tool as an aid to reduce risk factors for assaults and find resources to intervene with students who have a significant number of risk factors similar to others who have already committed simple or aggravated assault.   Take the Assault Intervention - Risk Reduction Assessment and answer as many questions as possible.  You will be trying to find out if the person you are assessing has a pattern of risk factors similar to others who have ALREADY assaulted other people. This assessment will suggest what constitutes a risk factor and ways to reduce these risk factors.  Be thorough and try to be as honest as possible. Try to avoid bias in your test or the results will not be helpful. Many people will find that they do not have enough facts to complete an evaluation.

Murder, or intentional homicide, persistently occupies a place at the center of the popular imagination. Yet, for all its popularity, for all its pervasiveness in primetime television, local news or even bestseller lists, murder is a relatively rare occurrence.   The Odds of Being Murdered in Context  The odds of being murdered are relatively low when compared to other possible causes of death. In its Final Data report of U.S. deaths for 2010, the CDC reported assault (homicide) dropped off of the list of the 15 leading causes of death, becoming 16th, following “pneumonitis due to solids and liquids.”  Based on the data from the CDC report, deaths due to homicide accounted for less than 1% of all U.S. deaths, with the odds of being murdered in a given year at 1 in 18,989 . On the other hand, heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S., accounted for 24% of all U.S. deaths, with the odds of dying of heart disease at 1 in 517.  Murder and Place: Location, Communities, and Socioeconomics  The odds of being murdered vary significantly on the basis of location. However, it must be noted that careful analysis of the data reveals that “location” is most appropriately understood as referring not only to geography but also to other ways of defining place, including community type and socioeconomic conditions.  When murder rates are discussed from the perspective of location, people often ask which places—specific regions, states, counties, cities, or areas—have the highest and lowest homicide rates. Detailed data on the numbers of murders occurring annually can be found in the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports (UCR). Moreover, when cities or communities are grouped together or categorized by community type—rural, suburban or urban—an apparent trend emerges. Rural communities and suburban communities have lower average homicide rates than do urban communities (Schwartz 2010).  Cities, and more broadly, community types, are home to distinctive sets of socioeconomic conditions that form the backdrop of the murders that occur. Socioeconomic context is an important variable to consider when discussing the odds of being murdered. An individual’s socioeconomic context can be defined broadly as the aggregate combination of education, income, and occupation of the people who comprise his or her social sphere. Individuals who are a part of poverty-stricken socioeconomic contexts face greater odds of being murdered while individuals belonging to more affluent socioeconomic contexts have lower odds of being murdered.  Murder and Demographics  Besides location in general and socioeconomic context in particular, there are demographic characteristics that are relevant to an individual’s odds of being murdered, including sex, race and age. Males are more likely to be murdered than females. Individuals of African-American descent are more likely to be murdered than members of any other racial group. Individuals between the ages of 18 and 24 are at the greatest risk of being murdered. Additionally, individuals are most likely to be murdered by someone they know, and not a stranger.  It is also noteworthy that murder victim characteristics mirror those of murder perpetrators. The exception to this general pattern is the fact that females are usually murdered by males and less frequently by females (Schwartz 2010). In other words, an individual is most likely to be murdered by someone who has the same demographic traits, within his own socioeconomic context. More often than not, males are murdered by males, blacks are most often murdered by blacks and young adults are most often murdered by young adults.  However, murder and violence are tied not only to individual demographic traits, but also intrinsically to community level characteristics as well, as “communities are often segregated by SES, race, and ethnicity,” the American Psychological Association (APA) asserts. The APA goes on to explain that “community level risk factors for violence include increased levels of unemployment, poverty, and transiency; decreased levels of economic opportunities and community participation; poor housing conditions; and a lack of access to services.”  Murder, Relationships, and Crime  Murder is often precipitated by one of two additional factors as well: either an interpersonal relationship characterized by a history of confrontation or abuse or an active attempt to commit another crime.  Less than 30% of murders occur as a result of an active attempt to commit a felony, such as a robbery.  Murders involving a male victim and a male perpetrator most frequently occur during the course of or following a confrontation, an argument that in many cases originated because of a perceived slight, challenge or insult on the part of a male friend or acquaintance. Schwartz, Anderson and Messerschmidt each offer similar descriptions of this particular male murder motive, which Schwartz summarizes:  Whereas middle- and upper- class males may have a myriad of opportunities to “do masculinity,” lower class males living in concentrated urban poverty may, over time and as an adaptation to persistent economic strain, place stronger collective emphasis on more achievable goals than financial success, such as respect and prestige conferred to those with a street reputation (Anderson 1999; Messerschmidt 2004).  The murder of female victims is most often perpetrated within the framework of an intimate relationship. Usually, homicides against women are carried out by their male partners, at what turns out to be the end of a trajectory of escalating abuse or dominance (Schwartz 2010).

The odds of dying over a one-year period are based on the U.S. population as a whole, not on participants in any particular activity or on how dangerous that activity may be. For example, more people are killed in auto accidents than in motorcycle accidents or airplane crashes, not because riding a motorcycle or traveling in an airplane is more or less dangerous, but because far more people travel by car. Drug poisoning is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The lifetime chances of dying from a drug or medication overdose were one in 96 in 2014, compared with about 1 in 645 in a car accident and 1 in 161,856 for fatal injuries caused by lightning.

The lifetime odds of dying from an injury for a person born in 2014 were 1 in 20.  The odds of dying from drug poisoning were 1 in 7,586 in 2014; the lifetime odds were 1 in 96 for a person born in 2014.                      The opioid crisis in the United States  Opioid abuse and addiction is now recognized as a significant public health problem in the United States. Drug poisoning, from prescription and illegal drugs combined, is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. Between 1999 and 2015 deaths from drug poisoning more than tripled from 16,849 in 1999 to 52,404 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Opioid analgesics, a group of prescription drugs that are used to alleviate chronic and acute pain, have been increasingly involved in the rise of drug overdose deaths over the same period. In 1999, there were 4,030 deaths attributed to opioid analgesics, accounting for 24 percent of all drug poisoning deaths. By 2014 deaths from opioid analgesics more than quadrupled to 18,893 and accounted for 40 percent of all drug poisoning deaths, according to the CDC.

A June 2017 report issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association found that diagnoses of opioid-use disorder (addiction to opioids, including prescription painkillers and illegal narcotics such as heroin) increased almost 500 percent between 2010 and 2016.  The study examined claims from 30 million people who had commercial insurance provided by Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers. It found that opioid-use disorder was 40 times more likely in patients prescribed high doses for a short duration, compared with low doses for a short duration. Opioid-use disorder was seven times more likely when patients were prescribed a high dose for a long duration, rather than a low dose for a long duration. In addition, 21 percent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) commercially-insured members filled at least one opioid prescription in 2015, according to the report.                 Health risks  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 614,000 fatalities in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Influenza and pneumonia ranked eighth in 2014, accounting for some 55,000 fatalities. However, pandemic influenza viruses have the potential to be far more deadly. An estimated 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, the deadliest and most infectious known influenza strain to date.

The study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics also concluded that about six million Americans, roughly 3 percent of those over 12, would become a victim of robbery, rape or other assault in a given year. The report said that over their lifetimes, black men have a 1-in-21 chance of being murdered; white men have a 1-in-131 chance; white women a 1-in-369 chance and black women a 1-in-104 chance. The assessment of murder risk was based on an analysis of reports submitted by coroners and medical examiners to the National Center for Crime Statistics in 1982. The other findings were based in part on research conducted over five years by the National Crime Survey, which conducts interviews twice a year with some 125,000 randomly selected people.

The odds may surprise you           Dave Mosher and Skye Gould     Jan. 31, 2017, 9:36 PM    123,331          facebook     linkedin     twitter     email     copy link     Shutterstock The idea that foreign terrorists pose a grave threat to Americans is sacrosanct to President Donald Trump's immigration ban, which he enacted on Friday. Trump's executive order immediately barred about 220 million people from seven majority-Muslim nations from setting foot on US soil for the next few months. It also triggered nationwide and international protest, sowed confusion at airports, and attracted judicial challenges (and defeats ), among other discord . Military and foreign policy experts, meanwhile, expressed concern the ban may actually worsen the threat of terrorism. The president, his administration, and his supporters defended the executive order by underscoring how the measure aims to protect US citizens from foreign-born terrorism. "We cannot gamble with American lives," Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary John Kelly said Tuesday during a televised press conference. "I will not gamble with American lives." But how justified is that gamble, according to real-world data? President Trump signs an executive order on January 27, 2017. Carlos Barria/Reuters According to a September 2016 study by Alex Nowrasteh at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, some 3,024 Americans died from 1975 through 2015 due to foreign-born terrorism. That number includes the 9/11 terrorist attacks (2,983 people) and averages nearly 74 Americans per year. Since 9/11, however, foreign-born terrorists have killed roughly one American per year. Six Americans have died per year at the hands, guns, and bombs of Islamic terrorists (foreign and domestic). "I once asked a guy at [the National Institutes of Health] how much we should spend on preventing a disease that kills 6 per year, and he looked at me like I was crazy," John Mueller , a foreign policy expert at the Ohio State University and co-author of the book " Chasing Ghosts: The Policing of Terrorism ", told Business Insider in an email. Here's how the lifetime odds of the most common — and feared — causes of death for Americans stack up against foreign killings (highlighted in red): Skye Gould/Business Insider Americans are more likely to win a lottery jackpot The chart above doesn't account for an American person's specific behaviors, age, sex, location, or other factors that can wildly change up the results — it's one big, fat average of the US population. The data primarily come from a 2016 report by the National Safety Council and the National Center for Health Statistics' final 2013 report on causes of death in the US , which was released in February 2016 (and is the most current). To include the Cato Institute's terrorism data — which doesn't include terrorism in other countries where Americans were victims — plus natural-disaster data shared by Tulane University, we calculated the lifetime odds of death by applying 2013 life expectancy and population in the US. Our analysis also assumes each cause of death won't change drastically in the near future. (A quick look at mortality data from other years suggests the magnitudes and rankings are relatively consistent.) "Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!" Trump tweeted on Wednesday . However, the reality flips Trump's rationale on its head. Compared to the threat posed by refugee terrorists — which the president's executive order is allegedly designed to curtail — the data suggest the typical American is: 6 times more likely to die from a shark attack (one of the rarest forms of death on Earth) 29 times more likely to die from a regional asteroid strike 260 times more likely to be struck and killed by lightning 4,700 times more likely to die in an airplane or spaceship accident 129,000 times more likely to die in a gun assault 407,000 times more likely to die in a motor vehicle incident 6.9 million times more likely to die from cancer or heart disease Put another way, as frightening and disturbing as events like 9/11 are, an American's unfathomably remote chances of winning the Powerball lottery jackpot are many times greater than those of being killed by a refugee terrorist on any given year — and even higher compared to the odds of being killed by an illegal immigrant terrorist. Syrian refugee children stand in front of their family caravan in Al Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan near the border with Syria, December 3, 2016. Muhammad Hamed/Reuters Weighing the logic of all-out counter-terrorism efforts It's worth pointing out that the US government's multi-billion-dollar-per-year homeland security efforts to thwart terrorism, certainly since 9/11, have ostensibly reduced American deaths and kept the odds low. However, it's hard to say — the DHS does not publicly release data about the number of terror attack attempts per day and lives saved as a result of its efforts. The same is also true of counter-terrorist military operations. But assume for a moment that one 9/11-like event killed 3,000 Americans per year, and indefinitely. While this would drastically raise the lifetime odds of death by a foreign terrorist, the typical American is still far more likely to die walking out the door, getting into a car, jumping into a pool, or simply standing up. Mueller and his colleague Mark G. Stewart explored the costs and benefits of fighting terrorism for the Cato Institute in a September 2014 study . That report states: "[T]he United States spends about $100 billion per year seeking to deter, disrupt, or protect against domestic terrorism. If each saved life is valued at $14 million, it would be necessary for the counterterrorism measures to prevent or protect against between 6,000 and 7,000 terrorism deaths in the country each year, or twice that if the lower figure of $7 million for a saved life is applied." Assuming the 2010 terrorist attack plot on Times Square was successful (the car bomb didn't go off), Mueller told Business Insider, hitting that measure would require four such attacks per day on US soil. "As has been suggested," Mueller and Stewart wrote in their study, "terrorists scarcely seem to be numerous, competent, and dedicated enough to carry out such a task." Andy Kiersz contributed to this report. This story has been updated with new details provided after its initial publication. A sentence that compared lottery odds to terrorist killing odds was also corrected and made more precise.
