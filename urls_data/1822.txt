A
traveler finds himself at a T-junction in an area populated by the Asciis and Bisciis in
the ratio 11 to 5. A Biscii always lie but an Ascii tells the truth three quarters of the
time, giving independent answers to all questions, even to immediately repeated ones.  Question:
The traveler asks one particular citizen three times whether he should go to the
left or to the right to reach the local village. Each time he receives the same
answer “left”. What should the traveler do now? Have his chances of finding the
village been altered by asking the question three times?    probability     share | cite | improve this question     asked Apr 28 '15 at 19:06       Bakyr   59 5                  I think that the probability will not change since the answers to all the questions are independent... I also know that the probability for an answer to be correct is 0.516... But I am not sure – Bakyr  Apr 28 '15 at 19:28            If the traveller asked a million times then he is very probably talking to a consistent liar.  This suggests that the more times he gets a consistent answer affects his chance of finding the village. – Henry  Apr 28 '15 at 19:41        add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  1  down vote  accepted      lets say A means he got three times the same answer and B means he got the truth.  we are looking for $$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A - and - B)}{P(A)}$$  three times the same answer can be achived if we tallked to a Biscii  for a chance of $$\frac{5}{16}$$ or if we tallked a Asciis and he either lied 3 times or told the truth 3 times for a chance of $$\frac{11}{16}*\frac{3^3}{4^3}+\frac{11}{16}*\frac{1^3}{4^3}=\frac{11}{16}*\frac{3^3+1^3}{4^3}$$
so $$ P(A) = \frac{5}{16} +\frac{11}{16}*\frac{3^3+1^3}{4^3}$$
now P(A and B) is the chance we were told the truth 3 times witch is only poliblle if we tallked to a Asciis and the chance is $$\frac{11}{16}*\frac{3^3}{4^3}$$
puting all this into a calculator gives us $$P(B|A) = \frac{297}{628}$$
that is a litlle less then 0.5, meaning its more likely to be false.  if we redo the calculations only he asked on time we get the chance of getting the truth is $$\frac{11}{16}*\frac{3}{4} = \frac{33}{64}$$
that is above 0.5 but the chance the difrence is less then before so you'r chance of going the way you should is lower.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Apr 28 '15 at 19:42       gurtonn   63 7              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

If you can explain that, it would be greatly appreciated!  There are three urns that each contain $10$ balls. The first contains $2$ white and 8 red balls, the second $8$ white and $2$ red, and the third all 10 white. Each urn has an equal probability of being selected. An urn is selected and a ball is drawn and replaced, and then another ball is drawn from the same urn. Suppose both are white.  What is the probability of first urn being selected?
What is the probability of second urn being selected?  Would I use the following formula?:
P(E)=P(F)(E|F) + P(F^C)P(E|F^C)  E being the event is the ball is white and F being the event if the urn was either the first or second    probability  bayes-theorem     share | cite | improve this question      edited Sep 28 '17 at 3:13             asked Sep 28 '17 at 2:05       Kevin Diez   49 7                  Good evening Kevin Diez!

$P(U_1) = P(U_2) = P(U_3) = 1/3.$  Denote the event $E = \{\text{Draw 2 white}\}$. Conditional
on each of the three urns (separately) find $P(E|U_i).$
For example, $P(E|U_3) = 1.$  Then use Bayes' Theorem with three 'partition sets', the $U_i$'s.  $$P(U_1|E) = \frac{P(U_1 \cap E)}{P(E)} 
= \frac{P(U_1)P(E|U_1)}{\sum_{i=1}^3 P(U_i)P(E|U_i)}.$$  The computation in the denominator uses what is often called
the Law of Total Probability.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 29 '17 at 15:45       BruceET   29.6k 5 14 39              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

It's lifted from another website , so just imagine that the 'white die' denotes your first roll, and the 'red die' denotes your second roll.  You'll notice that there are exactly $6$ pairs of rolls (out of all $36$ possible outcomes) in which the first roll equals the second roll.

For a specific number, say $1$, the probability of rolling it twice is equal to $$ \underbrace{\dfrac 16}_{1\text{st roll}}\;\times \;\underbrace{\dfrac 16}_{2\text{nd roll}}=\dfrac 1{36}$$ by the rule of the product .  Since this can happen for $2, 3, 4, 5, 6,$ as well as for $1$,  the probability of rolling the same number twice is $$6\cdot \dfrac 16\cdot \dfrac 16 = \dfrac 16$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 8 '13 at 22:50             answered Dec 8 '13 at 22:37       amWhy   187k 25 215 427                  And so the answer is 1/6??? – FiguringItOut  Dec 8 '13 at 22:38            Yes, I stated so explicitly.

It only sets a target. The chances of hitting a target in one roll are one in SIX, not one in three. You could have someone call out a number for the target.

I don't blame you, but it is obstructing the proper understanding of the question.  When you say the student makes (not "puts") an assumption, do you mean that we can assume that Question $X$ has the answer $0$, and Question $Y$ has the answer $1$?  When the student "gets" an answer, does he come up with the answer himself/herself, or is he/she given the answer? – Brian Tung  Dec 2 '15 at 5:56            @Brian Tung, sorry the"English" it is not my native language. Yes, I mean the student can assume that Question X has the answer 0, and Question Y has the answer 1?  - The student given the answe, but he/she does not know this answer belongs to which question. – SHdotCom  Dec 2 '15 at 6:27        add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  0  down vote      $$100\%$$
If he sees $0$, the question was $X$, if he sees $1$, the question was $Y$.

The assumption doesn't really mean anything in this case. – Nicholas Pipitone  Dec 2 '15 at 5:22            after the student get the answer, he can know whether  the answer match his assumption or not – SHdotCom  Dec 2 '15 at 5:26             if it is possible you just tell me this senario belongs to which type of probability, and I will try to find the answer. – SHdotCom  Dec 2 '15 at 5:34        add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

What are the chances of landing on blue after spinning the spinner? What are the chances of landing on red?      Solution: The chances of landing on blue are 1 in 4, or one fourth.  The chances of landing on red are 1 in 4, or one fourth.  This problem asked us to find some probabilities involving a spinner. Let's look at some definitions and examples from the problem above.  Definition  Example  An experiment is a situation involving chance or probability that leads to results called outcomes.  In the problem above, the experiment is spinning the spinner.  An outcome is the result of a single trial of an experiment.  The possible outcomes are landing on yellow, blue, green or red.  An event is one or more outcomes of an experiment.  One event of this experiment is landing on blue.  Probability is the measure of how likely an event is.  The probability of landing on blue is one fourth.  In order to measure probabilities, mathematicians have devised the following formula for finding the probability of an event.  Probability Of An Event   P(A) =  The Number Of Ways Event A Can Occur  The total number Of Possible Outcomes   The probability of event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Let's take a look at a slight modification of the problem from the top of the page.  Experiment 1: A spinner has 4 equal sectors colored yellow, blue, green and red. After spinning the spinner, what is the probability of landing on each color?  The possible outcomes of this experiment are yellow, blue, green, and red.  Probabilities:  P(yellow)  =  # of ways to land on yellow  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(blue)  =  # of ways to land on blue  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(green)  =  # of ways to land on green  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(red)  =  # of ways to land on red  =   1  total # of colors  4  Experiment 2: A single 6-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of each outcome? What is the probability of rolling an even number? of rolling an odd number?      Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Probabilities:  P(1)  =  # of ways to roll a 1  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(2)  =  # of ways to roll a 2  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(3)  =  # of ways to roll a 3  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(4)  =  # of ways to roll a 4  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(5)  =  # of ways to roll a 5  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(6)  =  # of ways to roll a 6  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(even)  =  # ways to roll an even number  =  3  =  1  total # of sides  6  2    P(odd)  =  # ways to roll an odd number  =  3  =  1  total # of sides  6  2  Experiment 2 illustrates the difference between an outcome and an event. A single outcome of this experiment is rolling a 1, or rolling a 2, or rolling a 3, etc. Rolling an even number (2, 4 or 6) is an event, and rolling an odd number (1, 3 or 5) is also an event.  In Experiment 1 the probability of each outcome is always the same. The probability of landing on each color of the spinner is always one fourth. In Experiment 2, the probability of rolling each number on the die is always one sixth. In both of these experiments, the outcomes are equally likely to occur. Let's look at an experiment in which the outcomes are not equally likely.  Experiment 3: A glass jar contains 6 red, 5 green, 8 blue and 3 yellow marbles. If a single marble is chosen at random from the jar, what is the probability of choosing a red marble? a green marble? a blue marble? a yellow marble?  Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are red, green, blue and yellow.  Probabilities:  P(red)  =  # of ways to choose red  =  6  =  3  total # of marbles  22  11    P(green)  =  # of ways to choose green  =  5  total # of marbles  22    P(blue)  =  # of ways to choose blue  =  8  =  4  total # of marbles  22  11    P(yellow)  =  # of ways to choose yellow  =  3  total # of marbles  22  The outcomes in this experiment are not equally likely to occur. You are more likely to choose a blue marble than any other color. You are least likely to choose a yellow marble.  Experiment 4: Choose a number at random from 1 to 5. What is the probability of each outcome? What is the probability that the number chosen is even? What is the probability that the number chosen is odd?  Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Probabilities:  P(1)  =  # of ways to choose a 1  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(2)  =  # of ways to choose a 2  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(3)  =  # of ways to choose a 3  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(4)  =  # of ways to choose a 4  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(5)  =  # of ways to choose a 5  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(even)  =  # of ways to choose an even number  =  2  total # of numbers  5    P(odd)  =  # of ways to choose an odd number  =  3  total # of numbers  5  The outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are equally likely to occur as a result of this experiment. However, the events even and odd are not equally likely to occur, since there are 3 odd numbers and only 2 even numbers from 1 to 5.  Summary: The probability of an event is the measure of the chance that the event will occur as a result of an experiment. The probability of an event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes. The probability of an event A, symbolized by P(A), is a number between 0 and 1, inclusive, that measures the likelihood of an event in the following way:  If P(A) > P(B) then event A is more likely to occur than event B.  If P(A) = P(B) then events A and B are equally likely to occur.  Exercises  Directions: Read each question below. Select your answer by clicking on its button.

A
traveler finds himself at a T-junction in an area populated by the Asciis and Bisciis in
the ratio 11 to 5. A Biscii always lie but an Ascii tells the truth three quarters of the
time, giving independent answers to all questions, even to immediately repeated ones.  Question:
The traveler asks one particular citizen three times whether he should go to the
left or to the right to reach the local village. Each time he receives the same
answer “left”. What should the traveler do now? Have his chances of finding the
village been altered by asking the question three times?    probability     share | cite | improve this question     asked Apr 28 '15 at 19:06       Bakyr   59 5                  I think that the probability will not change since the answers to all the questions are independent... I also know that the probability for an answer to be correct is 0.516... But I am not sure – Bakyr  Apr 28 '15 at 19:28            If the traveller asked a million times then he is very probably talking to a consistent liar.  This suggests that the more times he gets a consistent answer affects his chance of finding the village. – Henry  Apr 28 '15 at 19:41        add a comment |           1 Answer 1     active  oldest  votes            up vote  1  down vote  accepted      lets say A means he got three times the same answer and B means he got the truth.  we are looking for $$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A - and - B)}{P(A)}$$  three times the same answer can be achived if we tallked to a Biscii  for a chance of $$\frac{5}{16}$$ or if we tallked a Asciis and he either lied 3 times or told the truth 3 times for a chance of $$\frac{11}{16}*\frac{3^3}{4^3}+\frac{11}{16}*\frac{1^3}{4^3}=\frac{11}{16}*\frac{3^3+1^3}{4^3}$$
so $$ P(A) = \frac{5}{16} +\frac{11}{16}*\frac{3^3+1^3}{4^3}$$
now P(A and B) is the chance we were told the truth 3 times witch is only poliblle if we tallked to a Asciis and the chance is $$\frac{11}{16}*\frac{3^3}{4^3}$$
puting all this into a calculator gives us $$P(B|A) = \frac{297}{628}$$
that is a litlle less then 0.5, meaning its more likely to be false.  if we redo the calculations only he asked on time we get the chance of getting the truth is $$\frac{11}{16}*\frac{3}{4} = \frac{33}{64}$$
that is above 0.5 but the chance the difrence is less then before so you'r chance of going the way you should is lower.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Apr 28 '15 at 19:42       gurtonn   63 7              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

If you can explain that, it would be greatly appreciated!  There are three urns that each contain $10$ balls. The first contains $2$ white and 8 red balls, the second $8$ white and $2$ red, and the third all 10 white. Each urn has an equal probability of being selected. An urn is selected and a ball is drawn and replaced, and then another ball is drawn from the same urn. Suppose both are white.  What is the probability of first urn being selected?
What is the probability of second urn being selected?  Would I use the following formula?:
P(E)=P(F)(E|F) + P(F^C)P(E|F^C)  E being the event is the ball is white and F being the event if the urn was either the first or second    probability  bayes-theorem     share | cite | improve this question      edited Sep 28 '17 at 3:13             asked Sep 28 '17 at 2:05       Kevin Diez   49 7                  Good evening Kevin Diez!

$P(U_1) = P(U_2) = P(U_3) = 1/3.$  Denote the event $E = \{\text{Draw 2 white}\}$. Conditional
on each of the three urns (separately) find $P(E|U_i).$
For example, $P(E|U_3) = 1.$  Then use Bayes' Theorem with three 'partition sets', the $U_i$'s.  $$P(U_1|E) = \frac{P(U_1 \cap E)}{P(E)} 
= \frac{P(U_1)P(E|U_1)}{\sum_{i=1}^3 P(U_i)P(E|U_i)}.$$  The computation in the denominator uses what is often called
the Law of Total Probability.     share | cite | improve this answer     answered Sep 29 '17 at 15:45       BruceET   29.6k 5 14 39              add a comment |            Your Answer             draft saved  draft discarded             Sign up or log in    Sign up using Google   Sign up using Facebook   Sign up using Email and Password        Post as a guest       Name     Email             Post as a guest       Name     Email            discard  By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service .

It's lifted from another website , so just imagine that the 'white die' denotes your first roll, and the 'red die' denotes your second roll.  You'll notice that there are exactly $6$ pairs of rolls (out of all $36$ possible outcomes) in which the first roll equals the second roll.

For a specific number, say $1$, the probability of rolling it twice is equal to $$ \underbrace{\dfrac 16}_{1\text{st roll}}\;\times \;\underbrace{\dfrac 16}_{2\text{nd roll}}=\dfrac 1{36}$$ by the rule of the product .  Since this can happen for $2, 3, 4, 5, 6,$ as well as for $1$,  the probability of rolling the same number twice is $$6\cdot \dfrac 16\cdot \dfrac 16 = \dfrac 16$$     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Dec 8 '13 at 22:50             answered Dec 8 '13 at 22:37       amWhy   187k 25 215 427                  And so the answer is 1/6??? – FiguringItOut  Dec 8 '13 at 22:38            Yes, I stated so explicitly. The important thing is that you understand why , because your problems and exercises are only going to get much more complicated. So aim to get the basics down pat!

It only sets a target. The chances of hitting a target in one roll are one in SIX, not one in three. You could have someone call out a number for the target.

What are the chances of landing on blue after spinning the spinner? What are the chances of landing on red?      Solution: The chances of landing on blue are 1 in 4, or one fourth.  The chances of landing on red are 1 in 4, or one fourth.  This problem asked us to find some probabilities involving a spinner. Let's look at some definitions and examples from the problem above.  Definition  Example  An experiment is a situation involving chance or probability that leads to results called outcomes.  In the problem above, the experiment is spinning the spinner.  An outcome is the result of a single trial of an experiment.  The possible outcomes are landing on yellow, blue, green or red.  An event is one or more outcomes of an experiment.  One event of this experiment is landing on blue.  Probability is the measure of how likely an event is.  The probability of landing on blue is one fourth.  In order to measure probabilities, mathematicians have devised the following formula for finding the probability of an event.  Probability Of An Event   P(A) =  The Number Of Ways Event A Can Occur  The total number Of Possible Outcomes   The probability of event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Let's take a look at a slight modification of the problem from the top of the page.  Experiment 1: A spinner has 4 equal sectors colored yellow, blue, green and red. After spinning the spinner, what is the probability of landing on each color?  The possible outcomes of this experiment are yellow, blue, green, and red.  Probabilities:  P(yellow)  =  # of ways to land on yellow  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(blue)  =  # of ways to land on blue  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(green)  =  # of ways to land on green  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(red)  =  # of ways to land on red  =   1  total # of colors  4  Experiment 2: A single 6-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of each outcome? What is the probability of rolling an even number? of rolling an odd number?      Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Probabilities:  P(1)  =  # of ways to roll a 1  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(2)  =  # of ways to roll a 2  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(3)  =  # of ways to roll a 3  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(4)  =  # of ways to roll a 4  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(5)  =  # of ways to roll a 5  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(6)  =  # of ways to roll a 6  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(even)  =  # ways to roll an even number  =  3  =  1  total # of sides  6  2    P(odd)  =  # ways to roll an odd number  =  3  =  1  total # of sides  6  2  Experiment 2 illustrates the difference between an outcome and an event. A single outcome of this experiment is rolling a 1, or rolling a 2, or rolling a 3, etc. Rolling an even number (2, 4 or 6) is an event, and rolling an odd number (1, 3 or 5) is also an event.  In Experiment 1 the probability of each outcome is always the same. The probability of landing on each color of the spinner is always one fourth. In Experiment 2, the probability of rolling each number on the die is always one sixth. In both of these experiments, the outcomes are equally likely to occur. Let's look at an experiment in which the outcomes are not equally likely.  Experiment 3: A glass jar contains 6 red, 5 green, 8 blue and 3 yellow marbles. If a single marble is chosen at random from the jar, what is the probability of choosing a red marble? a green marble? a blue marble? a yellow marble?  Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are red, green, blue and yellow.  Probabilities:  P(red)  =  # of ways to choose red  =  6  =  3  total # of marbles  22  11    P(green)  =  # of ways to choose green  =  5  total # of marbles  22    P(blue)  =  # of ways to choose blue  =  8  =  4  total # of marbles  22  11    P(yellow)  =  # of ways to choose yellow  =  3  total # of marbles  22  The outcomes in this experiment are not equally likely to occur. You are more likely to choose a blue marble than any other color. You are least likely to choose a yellow marble.  Experiment 4: Choose a number at random from 1 to 5. What is the probability of each outcome? What is the probability that the number chosen is even? What is the probability that the number chosen is odd?  Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Probabilities:  P(1)  =  # of ways to choose a 1  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(2)  =  # of ways to choose a 2  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(3)  =  # of ways to choose a 3  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(4)  =  # of ways to choose a 4  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(5)  =  # of ways to choose a 5  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(even)  =  # of ways to choose an even number  =  2  total # of numbers  5    P(odd)  =  # of ways to choose an odd number  =  3  total # of numbers  5  The outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are equally likely to occur as a result of this experiment. However, the events even and odd are not equally likely to occur, since there are 3 odd numbers and only 2 even numbers from 1 to 5.  Summary: The probability of an event is the measure of the chance that the event will occur as a result of an experiment. The probability of an event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes. The probability of an event A, symbolized by P(A), is a number between 0 and 1, inclusive, that measures the likelihood of an event in the following way:  If P(A) > P(B) then event A is more likely to occur than event B.  If P(A) = P(B) then events A and B are equally likely to occur.  Exercises  Directions: Read each question below. Select your answer by clicking on its button.
