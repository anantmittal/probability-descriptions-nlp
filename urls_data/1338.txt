Posted under: Affordable Dental Care , Dental Tips , General | Posted on: March 18, 2014  Tweet    That third and final set of molars that emerge later in life in the deepest recesses of your mouth—named “wisdom teeth” as if they are a rite of passage into adulthood—can be a blemish in what might be an otherwise perfect dental record. Yes, these teeth disturb the oral health of a majority of individuals, requiring wisdom teeth removal. It is believed that “once upon a time” the wisdom teeth were essential to the caveman. Today, modern man seems to have little need for the teeth, much less space for them in the mouth. These teeth often emerge misaligned, crowding the other teeth, or hide partially below the surface of the gum line, stirring up damage to the jawbone or nerves, and causing wisdom teeth pain. Wisdom teeth removal has become a common procedure—nearly 85 percent of adults have had their wisdom teeth removed to protect their oral health. Wisdom teeth pain is not something to ignore. This can be a sign of crowding or impacted wisdom teeth. In either case, your oral health may be at stake and you should seek the advice of your dental care professional. Fully impacted wisdom teeth are enclosed within the soft tissue of the jawbone, while partially impacted wisdom teeth break partway through the gum line. A partial eruption often leaves an opening for bacterial growth around the tooth, leading to infection, tooth decay, or gum disease. These conditions are also associated with pain, swelling, jaw stiffness, and general illness. Your dentist will likely recommend prompt wisdom teeth removal to inhibit further development of adverse conditions or disease. If you are unsure about the state of your wisdom teeth—fully impacted teeth can’t be seen with the naked eye—ask your dentist. Periodic X-rays during routine dental care visits will allow you and your dentist to monitor your teeth. If the position of your teeth is already cause for concern, your dentist may recommend wisdom teeth removal or refer you to an oral surgeon for further evaluation. Many times, dentists and oral surgeons will recommend removal to avoid future problems. Although your wisdom teeth may not be causing you trouble now, wisdom teeth removal becomes a risky procedure late in life. Younger people tend to have wisdom teeth roots that have not fully developed and the bone is less dense, making removal easier. Older people, however, often have a longer healing time and more intense recovery. Wisdom Teeth Removal Removal of wisdom teeth is often an outpatient procedure, performed at the dentist’s or oral surgeon’s office. The ease of the procedure varies case by case, largely depending on the position of the teeth at time of removal. Your dental care provider can make you aware of what to expect when you have your exam before the procedure. Your dental care professional will use a local anesthetic to numb any pain that might occur during the surgery. If necessary, your dentist may sedate you as well. The teeth will then be carefully extracted, minimizing disturbance to the bone and optimizing your long-term oral health.

What to Expect When You Get Your Wisdom Teeth Pulled  Wisdom Teeth Surgery Recovery Tips  Questions Related to Wisdom Teeth Removal  Many people in their late teens and early twenties have their wisdom teeth removed, but not everyone needs to do so. While dental professionals often have differing opinions about wisdom teeth extraction, if you think you need your wisdom teeth pulled, your best bet is to consult with a professional.  Do You Have to Get Wisdom Teeth Removed?  Many people have no problems when their wisdom teeth erupt and don’t need to have their wisdom teeth pulled. Even so, many dental professionals will recommend having your wisdom teeth pulled if you experience the following scenarios:   Not enough room for wisdom teeth: Most of us have room for about 28 teeth, which is the number of teeth you have before your wisdom teeth erupt. When you add your four wisdom teeth, you have 32 teeth all trying to fit into the confined amount of space available in your jaw. When the jaw isn’t large enough, the wisdom teeth can become impacted, which means they are either unable to fully erupt or they become misaligned. In this case, having your wisdom teeth pulled will ensure all your teeth have ample room.  Experiencing wisdom tooth gum pain: This pain can be a sign of infection that can occur from partially erupted wisdom teeth. When food and bacteria get trapped in these areas, it can lead to a very painful infection known as pericoronitis. Having your wisdom teeth pulled in this case will prevent further infection.  Wisdom teeth coming in crooked: If your wisdom teeth come in fully, but come in sideways, they can cause your teeth to shift and move over time. There is also a chance that poorly aligned wisdom teeth can damage the nearby teeth. Once you have your wisdom teeth pulled, your nearby teeth will be protected from damage.  Cyst forms on wisdom teeth: This occurs when the sac next to the tooth becomes filled with fluid. When this occurs, it can destroy the surrounding structures such as bone or tooth roots. In rare cases, an untreated cyst can lead to a tumor that may require a more serious surgical procedure.   While wisdom teeth surgery may not sound like much fun, removing wisdom teeth is a very routine procedure that can help ensure the long-term health of your mouth and teeth. Removing wisdom teeth often is the best option for avoiding painful complications that occur when your wisdom teeth don’t come in properly, or become impacted. If your dental professional recently recommended wisdom teeth surgery, you may be concerned or worried about the procedure. Since millions of Americans fear dental procedures, this is completely normal. While wisdom tooth surgery may sound scary, having your wisdom teeth pulled can often be a better experience than not doing so when you consider the pain associated with wisdom teeth problems. The best way to help prevent this anxiety is to learn all you can about wisdom teeth surgery before your procedure.  What to Expect When You Get Your Wisdom Teeth Pulled  If you do make the decision to have your wisdom teeth pulled, you’ll want to know what to expect during your procedure. Talk with your dental professional or oral surgeon to be sure you understand the procedure and after-surgery care recommendations. Here are some questions you may want to ask before the big day:   How many teeth will be removed? Some professionals will take out all four teeth, or just a few at a time.  What type of anesthesia will be used? Typically, you will undergo either local or general anesthesia to avoid discomfort during the procedure. If you undergo general anesthesia, you will need to have someone accompany you since you will be groggy and unable to drive yourself home.  How long will the procedure take? This will likely depend on the number of wisdom teeth pulled and the condition of your teeth, but can range from an hour to several hours.  Are there any pre-surgical instructions? Your dental professional may tell you to avoid certain medications such as blood thinners or aspirin prior to the procedure.   This list is certainly not comprehensive, so it’s important to talk at length with your dental professional prior to the procedure. Having this important discussion can help alleviate any anxiety you may have and can also help avoid potential complications.  Wisdom Teeth Surgery Recovery Tips  While wisdom teeth surgery may sound overwhelming, having all the information you can gather beforehand will ensure you are well-prepared. Finally, be sure to review your post-surgical instructions with your surgeon before wisdom teeth surgery, since you are likely to be groggy after the procedure.   Pre-Surgery Tips Follow these instructions carefully to get your mouth back to good health quickly:   Prevent Wisdom Teeth Pain: If you are scared of the pain you may experience during your wisdom teeth surgery, don’t be worried. Your dental professional will ensure you are comfortable during the procedure by administering local anesthesia, intravenous sedation or general anesthesia. Be sure to discuss which type of treatment may be best for you with your oral surgeon prior to the procedure. This will also impact your ability to drive after the procedure. You’ll need to have someone pick you up if you will be fully sedated or under general anesthesia.  Know Your Numbers: How long will it take, how many teeth will be removed, and how much will it cost? Knowing this information beforehand can help you prepare. Your procedure will vary in length and complexity depending on how many teeth you need to have removed during your wisdom teeth surgery. Cost will be dependent on your insurance coverage or the oral surgeon’s financial policies. Be sure to know this information and understand what to expect before you get started.   Post-Surgery Tips After your wisdom tooth removal, keep these tips in mind to manage some common discomforts:   Bleeding: If you experience bleeding after wisdom tooth removal, apply a moist gauze pad to the area and bite down to keep pressure on it for about 45 minutes. If bleeding persists, contact your dental professional.  Swelling: To relieve swelling after tooth removal, place an ice pack on the outside of your cheek near the affected area. Hold the ice in place for 10 minutes, followed by 20 minutes with no ice. Repeat this cycle as often as you want during the first 24 hours after wisdom tooth removal.   Questions Related to Wisdom Teeth Removal  How Many People Get Their Wisdom Teeth Removed? While you may have heard horror stories about wisdom teeth surgery, millions of people have the procedure done each year with no complications. In fact, approximately 85 percent of people need to have their wisdom teeth extracted during their lifetime. You may wonder why so many people need to have their wisdom teeth removed and what impact wisdom teeth surgery may have on your ability to chew. The truth is that we don’t really need our wisdom teeth, otherwise known as our third molars.

She wasn’t having any problems now, but our dentist said trouble could flare up unexpectedly in the middle of the semester, perhaps in the middle of exams, and then she would probably have to leave school to get the teeth pulled. Better to do it now, he said. Each year, despite the risks of any surgical procedure, millions of healthy, asymptomatic wisdom teeth are extracted from young patients in the United States, often as they prepare to leave for college. Many dental plans cover the removal of these teeth, which have partly grown in or are impacted below the gum. But scientific evidence supporting the routine prophylactic extraction of wisdom teeth is surprisingly scant, and in some countries the practice has been abandoned. “Everybody is at risk for appendicitis , but do you take out everyone’s appendix?” said Dr. Greg J. Huang, chairman of orthodontics at the University of Washington in Seattle. “I’m not against removing wisdom teeth, but you should do an assessment and have a good clinical reason.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Oral surgeons have long argued that if you don’t have your wisdom teeth removed at a young age, you are simply postponing the inevitable.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       “It’s hard to get a percentage, but probably 75 to 80 percent of people do not meet the criteria of being able to successfully maintain their wisdom teeth,” said Dr. Louis K. Rafetto of Wilmington, Del., who headed the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons ’ task force on wisdom teeth. Another expert, Dr. Raymond P. White Jr., a professor of surgery at the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry , said that roughly 60 to 70 percent of patients with wisdom teeth will eventually have trouble with them, but he acknowledged that data is limited. “We’re making decisions based on the best data we have,” he said. Those persuasive numbers are used repeatedly by dentists and oral surgeons to justify routine removal of wisdom teeth. Just last year, the surgeons’ association issued a statement subtitled “Keeping Wisdom Teeth May Be More Harmful Than Previously Thought,” saying it was imperative that patients understood “how harmful retaining these wisdom teeth can be.” The association said that 80 percent of young adults who retained previously healthy wisdom teeth developed problems within seven years, and that retained wisdom teeth are extracted up to 70 percent of the time. Yet when asked, the association was not able to produce the evidence for these figures. “We were not able to locate the reference for it, and subsequently deleted the statement from our Web site,” Janice Teplitz, the group’s associate executive director of communications, said last week. As of Monday, however, the association’s Web site still said that “ between 25 percent and almost 70 percent ” of the time, retained, asymptomatic wisdom teeth “are eventually extracted.” Many studies suggest that the actual number of people who have trouble with their wisdom teeth is far lower.   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Oral surgeons warn that even when young people are not experiencing pain or discomfort, they may have infection or inflammation; numerous studies have found that adults who keep their wisdom teeth tend to have more such problems over time than those who have them removed . But there does not appear to be a single randomized clinical trial — the gold standard for scientific proof — comparing similar patients who have and have not undergone prophylactic wisdom teeth removal.  Photo         Credit Stuart Goldenberg    Our dentist warned us that cysts and tumors could grow around impacted wisdom teeth. But a new study of more than 6,000 patients in Greece found that only 2.7 percent of the teeth had a cyst or tumor . An older study, often cited by critics of routine extraction, found that only 12 percent of 1,756 middle-aged people who had not had impacted wisdom teeth removed experienced a complication . Numerous comprehensive reviews of research, conducted by independent bodies not affiliated with oral surgeons, have concluded that there was no evidence to support routine prophylactic extraction of impacted but healthy wisdom teeth. Britain’s National Health Service stopped paying for the procedure if there was no good reason for it after an analysis by its Center for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York concluded in 1998 that there was no solid scientific evidence to support it . Also that year, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh said that for patients who do not have a condition related to third molars or whose teeth would probably grow in successfully, removal is “not advisable.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The group also said there is “reliable evidence” that suggests that removing wisdom teeth does not prevent or reduce crowding of front teeth. In 2008, the American Public Health Association dismissed arguments typically made for removing wisdom teeth : that adjacent teeth might be damaged, or that the teeth may harbor bacteria that cause periodontal disease. The association approved a policy saying these concerns do not justify the risks of surgery, which include possible nerve damage, complications from anesthesia . loss of the sense of taste and, very rarely, death. “The few studies of long-term retention of impacted teeth have shown little risk of harm,” the association concluded. So given what all agree is a lack of good evidence, how should consumers proceed when a dentist suggests removing healthy wisdom teeth? IF EXTRACTION IS RECOMMENDED All surgery carries risks, and you should try to ensure that there is something to be gained from having your wisdom teeth removed. Ask what the reason is in your case. Is there a chance the wisdom teeth will grow in successfully? If you see a dentist on a regular basis, is watchful waiting an option?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   If you have an infection or inflammation, ask about less-invasive treatment. The general consensus among critics of routine extraction is that recurrent gum infection, or pericoronitis; irreparable tooth decay ; an abscess ; cysts; tumors; damage to nearby teeth and bone; or other pathological conditions justify the procedure. IF YOU CHOOSE SURGERY Most dental plans cover at least some of the costs of extraction. If you don’t have dental insurance, pulling all four teeth may cost several thousand dollars. Ask if you can have local anesthesia, which is considered safer than general anesthesia. Follow postoperative instructions carefully. Avoid being very active or eating solid food for three to four days (instead try noodles and milkshakes). Keeping ice on the jaw may help with pain and swelling . Painkillers may be needed. Young patients tend to recover sooner than older patients. IF YOU DECIDE AGAINST EXTRACTION Good dental hygiene will be even more important for you. The teeth in the back of the mouth are often harder to reach and clean well. Get frequent cleanings, and X-rays if necessary. Smoking increases the risk of periodontal disease, as does diabetes . If you have cavities in your back molars, you may be at greater risk for problems with the wisdom teeth. As for my daughter Emma, we have opted for watchful waiting. She went off to college last month, wisdom teeth and all.

Jennifer Flach was a college junior when her wisdom teeth started causing problems.  "My other teeth started moving around," she remembers. "The wisdom teeth were pushing out and undoing some of the orthodontic work I had done in high school."  At the same time, her brother — who's two years younger and was also in college — had no symptoms. But the family dentist said his wisdom teeth should come out, too.  Jen and her brother had back-to-back surgeries. They recovered together at home during spring break. "It was quite a week at my parents' house," she says.  Patrick Grother was 26 when his dentist said his wisdom teeth might need to be removed. His bottom left wisdom tooth had come partway into his mouth. But a flap of gum still covered it. "The dentist said food would get trapped there and it could get infected," he says.  Patrick eventually had the wisdom teeth on the left side of his mouth taken out.  A few people are born without wisdom teeth. Others have enough room in their mouths for the teeth. But many of us, like Jen and her brother, get our wisdom teeth taken out as young adults. And like Patrick, many of us are first alerted to the problem when our wisdom teeth can't come in all the way.  If that happens, part of the tooth may be covered by a flap of gum. Bits of food and bacteria can get trapped under the flap. This can cause swelling and a low-grade infection called pericoronitis. This usually happens with lower wisdom teeth. Pericoronitis, and the pain it causes, are the most common reasons people need wisdom teeth taken out.  There are other reasons to have your wisdom teeth removed.  In many people, the wisdom teeth are blocked from coming in, usually by bone or other teeth. Sometimes the teeth are tilted under the gum. Dentists call these "impacted" teeth.  They may cause pain, but not always. You may feel nothing at all for years. You may not even be aware that you have wisdom teeth until your dentist sees them on an X-ray.  Regular dental visits are important during your teens and early 20s. If you visit your dentist regularly, he or she can use X-rays to follow the progress of your wisdom teeth. Any problems will be seen early.  Even if your wisdom teeth aren't causing any pain or other problems, they may cause problems at some point. The most common problems are decay, infection and crowding or damage to other teeth. Teeth next to the wisdom teeth are more prone to developing gum problems.  But more serious complications can occur. Some people develop fluid-filled growths called cysts. These can cause permanent damage to bone, teeth and nerves. In rare cases, other tumors may develop as well.  Not all wisdom teeth need to be removed. But if there's a chance your wisdom teeth will cause problems, it's easier to take them out when you're young. That's because the roots of the teeth are not fully developed yet, and the bone around the teeth is less dense. Younger people also heal faster than older ones. As you age, it will take longer to recover from the surgery.  3/4/13  © 2002- 2017 Aetna, Inc. All rights reserved.

They are also the final teeth to erupt; they usually appear when a person is in their late teens or early twenties.  Signs & Symptoms  Wisdom teeth that only partially emerge or come in crooked can also lead to painful crowding and disease. Because teeth removed before age 20 have less developed roots and fewer complications, the American Dental Association recommends that people between 16 and 19 have their wisdom teeth evaluated to see if they need to be removed.

After surgery, swelling and tenderness in the face and neck are common, as is bruising. Ice packs and pain medications prescribed by the dentist or oral surgeon should help ease the pain.                   Are you practicing good oral hygiene after surgery?

That might be way too many.   By  Megan Thielking   Updated Feb  4, 2015, 10:40am EST        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  10 million wisdom teeth are removed each year. That might be way too many.      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images      Each year, five million people have wisdom teeth removed, but it's up in the air whether all of those surgeries were necessary.  Wisdom teeth , also called the third molars, are four teeth that grow at the very back of each corner of the mouth. For most people, they start to grow in between ages 17 and 25. They're thought to crowd out other teeth or cause tooth decay, which is why many dentists and oral surgeons think it's better to just nip those problems in the bud and take them out as a preventative measure.  But there's a serious debate between dentists and oral surgeons: should they preemptively remove someone's wisdom teeth if the patient doesn't have any symptoms?  Simply put, there's no right answer. It comes down to what you, as a patient, want. Here's what you need to know to figure that out.  Dentists and oral surgeons are fighting over wisdom teeth             (Nicole Mays/Flickr)   Dentists and oral surgeons agree across the board that there's cause to remove wisdom teeth if a patient is in pain or if there are signs of disease popping up, like tooth decay or infection. That's an obvious choice. But taking out wisdom teeth when there aren't any symptoms is where the professionals get into it.  Many dental professionals stick with a watch and wait approach with wisdom teeth to avoid surgery if possible . "Many people don’t have adequate space in their jaw for the teeth to come into full position, but that alone isn’t justification of having them all removed," says Dr. Scott Tomar of University of North Carolina's School of Dentistry. Tomar says that as a dentist he feels the risks of complication, including infection and hitting nerves during surgery, outweigh any benefits of preventative removal.  In 2007, oral surgeon Dr. Jay Friedman called the preventative removals a public health hazard in the American Journal of Public Health. The American Public Health Association has sided with this argument since 2008, when it formally opposed the preventative removal of wisdom teeth. (The same thing happened with tonsils , which doctors no longer remove just to get rid of the chance of infection later on.)  Americans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having their wisdom teeth removed  Some doctors, though, still see preventative oral surgery as being two steps ahead of the problem. If you're going to need your wisdom teeth out eventually, why not have them removed when you're younger and are more likely to recover more easily? Some think of removing the wisdom teeth early on as a way to lessen the crowding of other teeth  "You might not have symptoms now, but you can't assume it's gonna be that way for the rest of your life," says Dr. Ray White, an oral surgeon working at University of North Carolina. Rather than let the teeth cause problems later on, many oral surgeons remove them.  But a 2012 Cochrane review of randomized clinical trials found there's no evidence that removing wisdom teeth will prevent or reduce crowding of other teeth down the line. And a different Cochrane review found that watching and waiting can "may reduce the number of surgical procedures by 60 percent or more.  The question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on  It's worth noting that oral surgeons make a good chunk of their paychecks by removing wisdom teeth, so there is a financial incentive involved.  "Are there people gaming the system? Sure. You don't get paid much for not doing anything," White says. "But I'd hope we can get past that."  The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons says, "There is no pat answer , cookbook recipe, or flow chart that is universally accepted regarding the decision making process" in these cases. So the question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on, and what works best for their patients.  The risks and benefits of removing your wisdom teeth             (Melanie Holtsman/ Flickr)   There's a chance that if you opt not to have your wisdom teeth taken out, they might be fine for the rest of your life.  There's also a chance that they'll need to come out later. If that's the case, you can't always plan for it. Opting to have them removed gives patients time to plan around the procedure, which leaves people out of commission for about three days.  But inconvenience isn't the only risk. "The risk for complications increases as people get older, and the duration of disability after the operation gets longer as people get older," says oral surgeon Dr. Thomas Dodson.  In some cases, the extraction can be more painful if you wait, Dodson says. That's because the tooth is easier to remove if its roots aren't fully developed.  The common risks related to the surgery include poor wound healing, infection, pain, and uncontrolled bleeding. Nerve injury, in rare cases of wisdom teeth removal, can leave people with permanent numbness around the face and mouth, according to the APHA.  Americans spend billions each year on wisdom teeth             (Intermedline Medical Tourism/Flickr)   Americans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having 10 million wisdom teeth removed , according to the American Public Health Association.  That's a hefty bill for something we may or may not need. How much it costs depends on how the molars are situated. A simple  surgical extraction for a wisdom tooth that's showing through the gums should run about $230 , according to Healthcare Bluebook. If it's impacted (pushed against another tooth and unable to fully come through the gum), the cost jumps to about $400 per tooth.  Update: Added information about the number of teeth removed.

When Do You Need to Remove Your Wisdom Teeth?  By  Dr. Samuel Kwon  on  June 7, 2017  in  Family Dentist  The chances are that you or someone you know personally has had their wisdom teeth removed. And, if your experiences have been anything like my own, not a lot of people have very positive things to say about the procedure! You might be wondering, “Do wisdom teeth have to be removed?” The truth of the matter is that almost everyone has to undergo the procedure. Some people, however, never have to get these teeth taken out. There are ways you can tell if they really need to be removed or not. What Are Your Wisdom Teeth? So what exactly are your wisdom teeth? These teeth are the very last of your teeth to grow in and break through your gums. They are located the furthest back inside of your mouth, and there are four of them. There is one on the top and one on the bottom on both sides of your mouth. The actual age that your wisdom teeth finally grow in can vary greatly, but they usually first start forming in your teen years. By the time you’re in your late teens, the crowns of your the teeth usually start to erupt through your gums, if there’s enough room for them to do so. By the time you reach your mid-twenties, these teeth are usually either completely erupted through your gums or they become what is called “impacted.” If your wisdom teeth are positioned properly and totally healthy, they can actually be a pretty valuable asset to your mouth. However, more often than not, they usually end up causing a lot of people more hassle than help. When your wisdom teeth erupt through your gums, they often cause a dental condition called “crowding,” which, for a lot of people, can lead to abnormal development. There are a couple of different degrees of wisdom teeth impaction . In some cases, they can be partially impacted. This condition occurs when part of their crown is actually showing through the gums. In other cases, they can be what’s called “fully” impacted. This condition occurs when they have never actually broken through your gum line. How to Tell If You Need Your Wisdom Teeth Removed Whenever your wisdom teeth are partially or fully impacted, there is always a risk of developing dental complications. These dental complications caused by impacted teeth can initially begin with symptoms like mild pain and bleeding gums. However, if these wisdom teeth symptoms remain untreated, they can eventually lead to and/or develop into the following dental issues: Damaging adjacent teeth Tooth and/or gum disease (periodontal diseases) Oral cyst development Now, not everyone has impacted wisdom teeth. And although it’s common for experts to recommend that you have them extracted early on even if you have not yet had any problems with them, if you do not have any symptoms, only a dental office visit can determine if you truly need an extraction. However, if you do have issues, your teeth are most likely impacted and the question becomes, “Should I get my wisdom teeth removed?” If you’re experiencing any of the following symptoms, the answer to that question might be yes: Tenderness and/or pain in the back of your mouth close to your gums Chewing difficulties Reddening of area where your tooth surfaces Headaches Swelling of your jaw A persistent bad taste in your mouth Red, tender, swollen, and/or bleeding gums Unpleasant odor on your breath How to Tell If Your Wisdom Teeth are Coming In A common question for teens and young adults is, “How do I know if I have wisdom teeth?” For starters, these teeth usually come in in one’s late teens or early 20s. If you’re younger than that or well past your early 20s, the chances are that you don’t have wisdom teeth. It’s easy to tell if your wisdom teeth are coming in, though. Look for the following signs : Irritated gums at the back of your mouth, including redness Frequent pain in the back of your jaw Frequent biting of the tongue or cheek due to a lack of space in your mouth once the new teeth have erupted Pain in the jaw, eyes, or ears, especially at night Now that you are aware of the signs and symptoms that you may need to have your wisdom teeth extracted, contact us at (253) 770-0198 to schedule an appointment or contact us via our online contact form right away if you are experiencing any of these symptoms.

Posted under: Affordable Dental Care , Dental Tips , General | Posted on: March 18, 2014  Tweet    That third and final set of molars that emerge later in life in the deepest recesses of your mouth—named “wisdom teeth” as if they are a rite of passage into adulthood—can be a blemish in what might be an otherwise perfect dental record. Yes, these teeth disturb the oral health of a majority of individuals, requiring wisdom teeth removal. It is believed that “once upon a time” the wisdom teeth were essential to the caveman. Today, modern man seems to have little need for the teeth, much less space for them in the mouth. These teeth often emerge misaligned, crowding the other teeth, or hide partially below the surface of the gum line, stirring up damage to the jawbone or nerves, and causing wisdom teeth pain. Wisdom teeth removal has become a common procedure—nearly 85 percent of adults have had their wisdom teeth removed to protect their oral health. Wisdom teeth pain is not something to ignore. This can be a sign of crowding or impacted wisdom teeth. In either case, your oral health may be at stake and you should seek the advice of your dental care professional. Fully impacted wisdom teeth are enclosed within the soft tissue of the jawbone, while partially impacted wisdom teeth break partway through the gum line. A partial eruption often leaves an opening for bacterial growth around the tooth, leading to infection, tooth decay, or gum disease. These conditions are also associated with pain, swelling, jaw stiffness, and general illness. Your dentist will likely recommend prompt wisdom teeth removal to inhibit further development of adverse conditions or disease. If you are unsure about the state of your wisdom teeth—fully impacted teeth can’t be seen with the naked eye—ask your dentist. Periodic X-rays during routine dental care visits will allow you and your dentist to monitor your teeth. If the position of your teeth is already cause for concern, your dentist may recommend wisdom teeth removal or refer you to an oral surgeon for further evaluation. Many times, dentists and oral surgeons will recommend removal to avoid future problems. Although your wisdom teeth may not be causing you trouble now, wisdom teeth removal becomes a risky procedure late in life. Younger people tend to have wisdom teeth roots that have not fully developed and the bone is less dense, making removal easier. Older people, however, often have a longer healing time and more intense recovery. Wisdom Teeth Removal Removal of wisdom teeth is often an outpatient procedure, performed at the dentist’s or oral surgeon’s office. The ease of the procedure varies case by case, largely depending on the position of the teeth at time of removal. Your dental care provider can make you aware of what to expect when you have your exam before the procedure. Your dental care professional will use a local anesthetic to numb any pain that might occur during the surgery. If necessary, your dentist may sedate you as well. The teeth will then be carefully extracted, minimizing disturbance to the bone and optimizing your long-term oral health.

What to Expect When You Get Your Wisdom Teeth Pulled  Wisdom Teeth Surgery Recovery Tips  Questions Related to Wisdom Teeth Removal  Many people in their late teens and early twenties have their wisdom teeth removed, but not everyone needs to do so. While dental professionals often have differing opinions about wisdom teeth extraction, if you think you need your wisdom teeth pulled, your best bet is to consult with a professional.  Do You Have to Get Wisdom Teeth Removed?  Many people have no problems when their wisdom teeth erupt and don’t need to have their wisdom teeth pulled. Even so, many dental professionals will recommend having your wisdom teeth pulled if you experience the following scenarios:   Not enough room for wisdom teeth: Most of us have room for about 28 teeth, which is the number of teeth you have before your wisdom teeth erupt. When you add your four wisdom teeth, you have 32 teeth all trying to fit into the confined amount of space available in your jaw. When the jaw isn’t large enough, the wisdom teeth can become impacted, which means they are either unable to fully erupt or they become misaligned. In this case, having your wisdom teeth pulled will ensure all your teeth have ample room.  Experiencing wisdom tooth gum pain: This pain can be a sign of infection that can occur from partially erupted wisdom teeth. When food and bacteria get trapped in these areas, it can lead to a very painful infection known as pericoronitis. Having your wisdom teeth pulled in this case will prevent further infection.  Wisdom teeth coming in crooked: If your wisdom teeth come in fully, but come in sideways, they can cause your teeth to shift and move over time. There is also a chance that poorly aligned wisdom teeth can damage the nearby teeth. Once you have your wisdom teeth pulled, your nearby teeth will be protected from damage.  Cyst forms on wisdom teeth: This occurs when the sac next to the tooth becomes filled with fluid. When this occurs, it can destroy the surrounding structures such as bone or tooth roots. In rare cases, an untreated cyst can lead to a tumor that may require a more serious surgical procedure.   While wisdom teeth surgery may not sound like much fun, removing wisdom teeth is a very routine procedure that can help ensure the long-term health of your mouth and teeth. Removing wisdom teeth often is the best option for avoiding painful complications that occur when your wisdom teeth don’t come in properly, or become impacted. If your dental professional recently recommended wisdom teeth surgery, you may be concerned or worried about the procedure. Since millions of Americans fear dental procedures, this is completely normal. While wisdom tooth surgery may sound scary, having your wisdom teeth pulled can often be a better experience than not doing so when you consider the pain associated with wisdom teeth problems. The best way to help prevent this anxiety is to learn all you can about wisdom teeth surgery before your procedure.  What to Expect When You Get Your Wisdom Teeth Pulled  If you do make the decision to have your wisdom teeth pulled, you’ll want to know what to expect during your procedure. Talk with your dental professional or oral surgeon to be sure you understand the procedure and after-surgery care recommendations. Here are some questions you may want to ask before the big day:   How many teeth will be removed? Some professionals will take out all four teeth, or just a few at a time.  What type of anesthesia will be used? Typically, you will undergo either local or general anesthesia to avoid discomfort during the procedure. If you undergo general anesthesia, you will need to have someone accompany you since you will be groggy and unable to drive yourself home.  How long will the procedure take? This will likely depend on the number of wisdom teeth pulled and the condition of your teeth, but can range from an hour to several hours.  Are there any pre-surgical instructions? Your dental professional may tell you to avoid certain medications such as blood thinners or aspirin prior to the procedure.   This list is certainly not comprehensive, so it’s important to talk at length with your dental professional prior to the procedure. Having this important discussion can help alleviate any anxiety you may have and can also help avoid potential complications.  Wisdom Teeth Surgery Recovery Tips  While wisdom teeth surgery may sound overwhelming, having all the information you can gather beforehand will ensure you are well-prepared. Finally, be sure to review your post-surgical instructions with your surgeon before wisdom teeth surgery, since you are likely to be groggy after the procedure.   Pre-Surgery Tips Follow these instructions carefully to get your mouth back to good health quickly:   Prevent Wisdom Teeth Pain: If you are scared of the pain you may experience during your wisdom teeth surgery, don’t be worried. Your dental professional will ensure you are comfortable during the procedure by administering local anesthesia, intravenous sedation or general anesthesia. Be sure to discuss which type of treatment may be best for you with your oral surgeon prior to the procedure. This will also impact your ability to drive after the procedure. You’ll need to have someone pick you up if you will be fully sedated or under general anesthesia.  Know Your Numbers: How long will it take, how many teeth will be removed, and how much will it cost? Knowing this information beforehand can help you prepare. Your procedure will vary in length and complexity depending on how many teeth you need to have removed during your wisdom teeth surgery. Cost will be dependent on your insurance coverage or the oral surgeon’s financial policies. Be sure to know this information and understand what to expect before you get started.   Post-Surgery Tips After your wisdom tooth removal, keep these tips in mind to manage some common discomforts:   Bleeding: If you experience bleeding after wisdom tooth removal, apply a moist gauze pad to the area and bite down to keep pressure on it for about 45 minutes. If bleeding persists, contact your dental professional.  Swelling: To relieve swelling after tooth removal, place an ice pack on the outside of your cheek near the affected area. Hold the ice in place for 10 minutes, followed by 20 minutes with no ice. Repeat this cycle as often as you want during the first 24 hours after wisdom tooth removal.   Questions Related to Wisdom Teeth Removal  How Many People Get Their Wisdom Teeth Removed? While you may have heard horror stories about wisdom teeth surgery, millions of people have the procedure done each year with no complications. In fact, approximately 85 percent of people need to have their wisdom teeth extracted during their lifetime. You may wonder why so many people need to have their wisdom teeth removed and what impact wisdom teeth surgery may have on your ability to chew. The truth is that we don’t really need our wisdom teeth, otherwise known as our third molars.

She wasn’t having any problems now, but our dentist said trouble could flare up unexpectedly in the middle of the semester, perhaps in the middle of exams, and then she would probably have to leave school to get the teeth pulled. Better to do it now, he said. Each year, despite the risks of any surgical procedure, millions of healthy, asymptomatic wisdom teeth are extracted from young patients in the United States, often as they prepare to leave for college. Many dental plans cover the removal of these teeth, which have partly grown in or are impacted below the gum. But scientific evidence supporting the routine prophylactic extraction of wisdom teeth is surprisingly scant, and in some countries the practice has been abandoned. “Everybody is at risk for appendicitis , but do you take out everyone’s appendix?” said Dr. Greg J. Huang, chairman of orthodontics at the University of Washington in Seattle. “I’m not against removing wisdom teeth, but you should do an assessment and have a good clinical reason.”   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   Oral surgeons have long argued that if you don’t have your wisdom teeth removed at a young age, you are simply postponing the inevitable.  Continue reading the main story         Advertisement   Continue reading the main story       “It’s hard to get a percentage, but probably 75 to 80 percent of people do not meet the criteria of being able to successfully maintain their wisdom teeth,” said Dr. Louis K. Rafetto of Wilmington, Del., who headed the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons ’ task force on wisdom teeth. Another expert, Dr. Raymond P. White Jr., a professor of surgery at the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry , said that roughly 60 to 70 percent of patients with wisdom teeth will eventually have trouble with them, but he acknowledged that data is limited. “We’re making decisions based on the best data we have,” he said. Those persuasive numbers are used repeatedly by dentists and oral surgeons to justify routine removal of wisdom teeth. Just last year, the surgeons’ association issued a statement subtitled “Keeping Wisdom Teeth May Be More Harmful Than Previously Thought,” saying it was imperative that patients understood “how harmful retaining these wisdom teeth can be.” The association said that 80 percent of young adults who retained previously healthy wisdom teeth developed problems within seven years, and that retained wisdom teeth are extracted up to 70 percent of the time. Yet when asked, the association was not able to produce the evidence for these figures. “We were not able to locate the reference for it, and subsequently deleted the statement from our Web site,” Janice Teplitz, the group’s associate executive director of communications, said last week. As of Monday, however, the association’s Web site still said that “ between 25 percent and almost 70 percent ” of the time, retained, asymptomatic wisdom teeth “are eventually extracted.” Many studies suggest that the actual number of people who have trouble with their wisdom teeth is far lower.

But there does not appear to be a single randomized clinical trial — the gold standard for scientific proof — comparing similar patients who have and have not undergone prophylactic wisdom teeth removal.  Photo         Credit Stuart Goldenberg    Our dentist warned us that cysts and tumors could grow around impacted wisdom teeth. But a new study of more than 6,000 patients in Greece found that only 2.7 percent of the teeth had a cyst or tumor . An older study, often cited by critics of routine extraction, found that only 12 percent of 1,756 middle-aged people who had not had impacted wisdom teeth removed experienced a complication . Numerous comprehensive reviews of research, conducted by independent bodies not affiliated with oral surgeons, have concluded that there was no evidence to support routine prophylactic extraction of impacted but healthy wisdom teeth. Britain’s National Health Service stopped paying for the procedure if there was no good reason for it after an analysis by its Center for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York concluded in 1998 that there was no solid scientific evidence to support it . Also that year, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh said that for patients who do not have a condition related to third molars or whose teeth would probably grow in successfully, removal is “not advisable.”  Newsletter Sign Up  Continue reading the main story        Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The group also said there is “reliable evidence” that suggests that removing wisdom teeth does not prevent or reduce crowding of front teeth. In 2008, the American Public Health Association dismissed arguments typically made for removing wisdom teeth : that adjacent teeth might be damaged, or that the teeth may harbor bacteria that cause periodontal disease. The association approved a policy saying these concerns do not justify the risks of surgery, which include possible nerve damage, complications from anesthesia . loss of the sense of taste and, very rarely, death. “The few studies of long-term retention of impacted teeth have shown little risk of harm,” the association concluded. So given what all agree is a lack of good evidence, how should consumers proceed when a dentist suggests removing healthy wisdom teeth? IF EXTRACTION IS RECOMMENDED All surgery carries risks, and you should try to ensure that there is something to be gained from having your wisdom teeth removed. Ask what the reason is in your case. Is there a chance the wisdom teeth will grow in successfully? If you see a dentist on a regular basis, is watchful waiting an option?   Advertisement   Continue reading the main story   If you have an infection or inflammation, ask about less-invasive treatment. The general consensus among critics of routine extraction is that recurrent gum infection, or pericoronitis; irreparable tooth decay ; an abscess ; cysts; tumors; damage to nearby teeth and bone; or other pathological conditions justify the procedure. IF YOU CHOOSE SURGERY Most dental plans cover at least some of the costs of extraction. If you don’t have dental insurance, pulling all four teeth may cost several thousand dollars. Ask if you can have local anesthesia, which is considered safer than general anesthesia. Follow postoperative instructions carefully. Avoid being very active or eating solid food for three to four days (instead try noodles and milkshakes). Keeping ice on the jaw may help with pain and swelling . Painkillers may be needed. Young patients tend to recover sooner than older patients. IF YOU DECIDE AGAINST EXTRACTION Good dental hygiene will be even more important for you. The teeth in the back of the mouth are often harder to reach and clean well. Get frequent cleanings, and X-rays if necessary. Smoking increases the risk of periodontal disease, as does diabetes . If you have cavities in your back molars, you may be at greater risk for problems with the wisdom teeth. As for my daughter Emma, we have opted for watchful waiting. She went off to college last month, wisdom teeth and all.

Jennifer Flach was a college junior when her wisdom teeth started causing problems.  "My other teeth started moving around," she remembers. "The wisdom teeth were pushing out and undoing some of the orthodontic work I had done in high school."  At the same time, her brother — who's two years younger and was also in college — had no symptoms. But the family dentist said his wisdom teeth should come out, too.  Jen and her brother had back-to-back surgeries. They recovered together at home during spring break. "It was quite a week at my parents' house," she says.  Patrick Grother was 26 when his dentist said his wisdom teeth might need to be removed. His bottom left wisdom tooth had come partway into his mouth. But a flap of gum still covered it. "The dentist said food would get trapped there and it could get infected," he says.  Patrick eventually had the wisdom teeth on the left side of his mouth taken out.  A few people are born without wisdom teeth. Others have enough room in their mouths for the teeth. But many of us, like Jen and her brother, get our wisdom teeth taken out as young adults. And like Patrick, many of us are first alerted to the problem when our wisdom teeth can't come in all the way.  If that happens, part of the tooth may be covered by a flap of gum. Bits of food and bacteria can get trapped under the flap. This can cause swelling and a low-grade infection called pericoronitis. This usually happens with lower wisdom teeth. Pericoronitis, and the pain it causes, are the most common reasons people need wisdom teeth taken out.  There are other reasons to have your wisdom teeth removed.  In many people, the wisdom teeth are blocked from coming in, usually by bone or other teeth. Sometimes the teeth are tilted under the gum. Dentists call these "impacted" teeth.  They may cause pain, but not always. You may feel nothing at all for years. You may not even be aware that you have wisdom teeth until your dentist sees them on an X-ray.  Regular dental visits are important during your teens and early 20s. If you visit your dentist regularly, he or she can use X-rays to follow the progress of your wisdom teeth. Any problems will be seen early.  Even if your wisdom teeth aren't causing any pain or other problems, they may cause problems at some point. The most common problems are decay, infection and crowding or damage to other teeth. Teeth next to the wisdom teeth are more prone to developing gum problems.  But more serious complications can occur. Some people develop fluid-filled growths called cysts. These can cause permanent damage to bone, teeth and nerves. In rare cases, other tumors may develop as well.  Not all wisdom teeth need to be removed. But if there's a chance your wisdom teeth will cause problems, it's easier to take them out when you're young. That's because the roots of the teeth are not fully developed yet, and the bone around the teeth is less dense. Younger people also heal faster than older ones. As you age, it will take longer to recover from the surgery.  3/4/13  © 2002- 2017 Aetna, Inc. All rights reserved.

They are also the final teeth to erupt; they usually appear when a person is in their late teens or early twenties.  Signs & Symptoms  Wisdom teeth that only partially emerge or come in crooked can also lead to painful crowding and disease. Because teeth removed before age 20 have less developed roots and fewer complications, the American Dental Association recommends that people between 16 and 19 have their wisdom teeth evaluated to see if they need to be removed.

After surgery, swelling and tenderness in the face and neck are common, as is bruising. Ice packs and pain medications prescribed by the dentist or oral surgeon should help ease the pain.                   Are you practicing good oral hygiene after surgery?

That might be way too many.   By  Megan Thielking   Updated Feb  4, 2015, 10:40am EST        Share     Tweet        Share     Share  10 million wisdom teeth are removed each year. That might be way too many.      tweet     share          Reddit       Pocket         Flipboard     Email                    Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images      Each year, five million people have wisdom teeth removed, but it's up in the air whether all of those surgeries were necessary.  Wisdom teeth , also called the third molars, are four teeth that grow at the very back of each corner of the mouth. For most people, they start to grow in between ages 17 and 25. They're thought to crowd out other teeth or cause tooth decay, which is why many dentists and oral surgeons think it's better to just nip those problems in the bud and take them out as a preventative measure.  But there's a serious debate between dentists and oral surgeons: should they preemptively remove someone's wisdom teeth if the patient doesn't have any symptoms?  Simply put, there's no right answer. It comes down to what you, as a patient, want. Here's what you need to know to figure that out.  Dentists and oral surgeons are fighting over wisdom teeth             (Nicole Mays/Flickr)   Dentists and oral surgeons agree across the board that there's cause to remove wisdom teeth if a patient is in pain or if there are signs of disease popping up, like tooth decay or infection. That's an obvious choice. But taking out wisdom teeth when there aren't any symptoms is where the professionals get into it.  Many dental professionals stick with a watch and wait approach with wisdom teeth to avoid surgery if possible . "Many people don’t have adequate space in their jaw for the teeth to come into full position, but that alone isn’t justification of having them all removed," says Dr. Scott Tomar of University of North Carolina's School of Dentistry. Tomar says that as a dentist he feels the risks of complication, including infection and hitting nerves during surgery, outweigh any benefits of preventative removal.  In 2007, oral surgeon Dr. Jay Friedman called the preventative removals a public health hazard in the American Journal of Public Health. The American Public Health Association has sided with this argument since 2008, when it formally opposed the preventative removal of wisdom teeth. (The same thing happened with tonsils , which doctors no longer remove just to get rid of the chance of infection later on.)  Americans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having their wisdom teeth removed  Some doctors, though, still see preventative oral surgery as being two steps ahead of the problem. If you're going to need your wisdom teeth out eventually, why not have them removed when you're younger and are more likely to recover more easily? Some think of removing the wisdom teeth early on as a way to lessen the crowding of other teeth  "You might not have symptoms now, but you can't assume it's gonna be that way for the rest of your life," says Dr. Ray White, an oral surgeon working at University of North Carolina. Rather than let the teeth cause problems later on, many oral surgeons remove them.  But a 2012 Cochrane review of randomized clinical trials found there's no evidence that removing wisdom teeth will prevent or reduce crowding of other teeth down the line. And a different Cochrane review found that watching and waiting can "may reduce the number of surgical procedures by 60 percent or more.  The question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on  It's worth noting that oral surgeons make a good chunk of their paychecks by removing wisdom teeth, so there is a financial incentive involved.  "Are there people gaming the system? Sure. You don't get paid much for not doing anything," White says. "But I'd hope we can get past that."  The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons says, "There is no pat answer , cookbook recipe, or flow chart that is universally accepted regarding the decision making process" in these cases. So the question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on, and what works best for their patients.  The risks and benefits of removing your wisdom teeth             (Melanie Holtsman/ Flickr)   There's a chance that if you opt not to have your wisdom teeth taken out, they might be fine for the rest of your life.  There's also a chance that they'll need to come out later. If that's the case, you can't always plan for it. Opting to have them removed gives patients time to plan around the procedure, which leaves people out of commission for about three days.  But inconvenience isn't the only risk. "The risk for complications increases as people get older, and the duration of disability after the operation gets longer as people get older," says oral surgeon Dr. Thomas Dodson.  In some cases, the extraction can be more painful if you wait, Dodson says. That's because the tooth is easier to remove if its roots aren't fully developed.  The common risks related to the surgery include poor wound healing, infection, pain, and uncontrolled bleeding. Nerve injury, in rare cases of wisdom teeth removal, can leave people with permanent numbness around the face and mouth, according to the APHA.  Americans spend billions each year on wisdom teeth             (Intermedline Medical Tourism/Flickr)   Americans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having 10 million wisdom teeth removed , according to the American Public Health Association.  That's a hefty bill for something we may or may not need. How much it costs depends on how the molars are situated. A simple  surgical extraction for a wisdom tooth that's showing through the gums should run about $230 , according to Healthcare Bluebook. If it's impacted (pushed against another tooth and unable to fully come through the gum), the cost jumps to about $400 per tooth.  Update: Added information about the number of teeth removed.

When Do You Need to Remove Your Wisdom Teeth?  By  Dr. Samuel Kwon  on  June 7, 2017  in  Family Dentist  The chances are that you or someone you know personally has had their wisdom teeth removed. And, if your experiences have been anything like my own, not a lot of people have very positive things to say about the procedure! You might be wondering, “Do wisdom teeth have to be removed?” The truth of the matter is that almost everyone has to undergo the procedure. Some people, however, never have to get these teeth taken out. There are ways you can tell if they really need to be removed or not. What Are Your Wisdom Teeth? So what exactly are your wisdom teeth? These teeth are the very last of your teeth to grow in and break through your gums. They are located the furthest back inside of your mouth, and there are four of them. There is one on the top and one on the bottom on both sides of your mouth. The actual age that your wisdom teeth finally grow in can vary greatly, but they usually first start forming in your teen years. By the time you’re in your late teens, the crowns of your the teeth usually start to erupt through your gums, if there’s enough room for them to do so. By the time you reach your mid-twenties, these teeth are usually either completely erupted through your gums or they become what is called “impacted.” If your wisdom teeth are positioned properly and totally healthy, they can actually be a pretty valuable asset to your mouth. However, more often than not, they usually end up causing a lot of people more hassle than help. When your wisdom teeth erupt through your gums, they often cause a dental condition called “crowding,” which, for a lot of people, can lead to abnormal development. There are a couple of different degrees of wisdom teeth impaction . In some cases, they can be partially impacted. This condition occurs when part of their crown is actually showing through the gums. In other cases, they can be what’s called “fully” impacted. This condition occurs when they have never actually broken through your gum line. How to Tell If You Need Your Wisdom Teeth Removed Whenever your wisdom teeth are partially or fully impacted, there is always a risk of developing dental complications. These dental complications caused by impacted teeth can initially begin with symptoms like mild pain and bleeding gums. However, if these wisdom teeth symptoms remain untreated, they can eventually lead to and/or develop into the following dental issues: Damaging adjacent teeth Tooth and/or gum disease (periodontal diseases) Oral cyst development Now, not everyone has impacted wisdom teeth. And although it’s common for experts to recommend that you have them extracted early on even if you have not yet had any problems with them, if you do not have any symptoms, only a dental office visit can determine if you truly need an extraction. However, if you do have issues, your teeth are most likely impacted and the question becomes, “Should I get my wisdom teeth removed?” If you’re experiencing any of the following symptoms, the answer to that question might be yes: Tenderness and/or pain in the back of your mouth close to your gums Chewing difficulties Reddening of area where your tooth surfaces Headaches Swelling of your jaw A persistent bad taste in your mouth Red, tender, swollen, and/or bleeding gums Unpleasant odor on your breath How to Tell If Your Wisdom Teeth are Coming In A common question for teens and young adults is, “How do I know if I have wisdom teeth?” For starters, these teeth usually come in in one’s late teens or early 20s. If you’re younger than that or well past your early 20s, the chances are that you don’t have wisdom teeth. It’s easy to tell if your wisdom teeth are coming in, though. Look for the following signs : Irritated gums at the back of your mouth, including redness Frequent pain in the back of your jaw Frequent biting of the tongue or cheek due to a lack of space in your mouth once the new teeth have erupted Pain in the jaw, eyes, or ears, especially at night Now that you are aware of the signs and symptoms that you may need to have your wisdom teeth extracted, contact us at (253) 770-0198 to schedule an appointment or contact us via our online contact form right away if you are experiencing any of these symptoms.
