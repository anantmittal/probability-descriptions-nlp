August 2, 2017    Edited by   Ben Bowman                               Share                                                    Since Wilbur and Orville Wright first took to the skies in 1903, virtually everyone who has ridden in a plane has considered what might happen if the thing falls out of the sky. What are the odds of surviving a plane crash? Although more than 40 percent of passengers report fear of being involved in a plane crash, the odds are in our favor. Statistically speaking, a person would have to take a flight every day for 55,000 years before encountering a fatal accident. You are literally more likely to be killed by a falling coconut.                                          So You're Sayin' There's a Chance         In 2016, 325 people died in 19 airplane crashes worldwide. That might seem like a lot, but more than 2,500 left-handed people are killed every year from using equipment meant for right-handed people. Despite big-budget Hollywood films' depictions of plane crashes, flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car or traffic accident are one in 5,000. Even if you're reading this on an airplane while you're rocketing toward the ground, your odds of surviving are quite good. Among passengers aboard crashed planes, 95.7 percent survive. And according to the National Transportation Safety Board, even passengers of the most devastating airplane crashes survive at a rate of 76 percent. Despite its safety, air travel malfunctions can cause passenger distress, and on rare occasion, result in a crash. So what can you do to prepare yourself, if anything? What boosts our odds for survival? And what happens when a plane actually does crash? Buckle in for these videos: a worst-case scenario survival guide.

Feeling somewhat nervous about it? You have absolutely no reason to be worried; probability is on your side. Grab some peanuts, put your headphones in, sit back and relax. The airplane has revolutionized our existence. It has cut journeys that used to take weeks and months into just a few hours. It's also extremely safe, but people continue to fear it. A recent plane crash in the French Alps may have increased people's anxieties. Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed on Tuesday not long before 11 am. Tragically, everyone on board, 144 passengers and six crew members, died in the process. Germanwings is now a trending topics on social media and will undoubtedly continue to be discussed in the coming weeks. Along with "Pretty Little Liars" and Angelina Jolie, it's currently one of the top subjects people are searching for, Google Trends reveals . We are both terrified of and fascinated by death, particularly when it happens in unusual ways. The likelihood of dying in a plane crash (or even being in one) is so slim it's almost pointless to quantify. According to The Economist , the probability of your plane going down is around one in 5.4 million. Other reports place the odds closer to one in 11 million . To put this into perspective, you are far more likely to be struck by lightning or attacked by a shark than you are to die in a plane crash. And there are even more common things that kill decidedly more frequently, including the flu . Traveling by car is 100 times more deadly than hopping on a plane. Not to mention, statistically, it's never been safer to fly . Perhaps this helps explain why we become so captivated by plane crashes when they do occur; they're just so incredibly rare. At the same time, media coverage of these sorts of events is undeniably excessive and hyperbolic. This trend is driven by a desire for increased viewership and profits. Does this say more about the media or more about us? It's a two-way street: Major news networks consistently report on tragedies because they know the public will pay attention. In 2014, plane crashes often dominated the news. From the mysterious disappearance of MH370 to the tragic crash of Air Asia Flight 8501 in December, there were eight fatal plane crashes over the course of the year. In total, commercial airline accidents killed 992 people across the globe in 2014, the most since 2005, Vice reports . But if you look at data surrounding airplane crashes in a broader sense, they have decreased exponentially over time, as highlighted by the Guardian . And at this point last year, there had already been 33 plane crashes . As of the Germanwings crash, the number for 2015 stands at 17 . It's also very telling that in 2014, airplane crashes received 43 percent more media attention than the 1.24 million ground traffic fatalities that occur across the world every year, as noted by the Washington Post. Interestingly, research has shown that the habitual coverage of plane crashes hasn't necessarily served to increase fears of flying , but it certainly hasn't helped deter them, either . Aviophobia, or the fear of flying, affects around 6.5 percent of the population, ABC news reports . A survey from Chapman University suggests that 43 percent of people have at least some fear of flying, and around 9 percent are so afraid they won't even step foot on a plane. The fear is so ubiquitous there's even an iPhone app called "Am I Going Down?," which helps calculate how likely it is your flight will crash. Thankfully, it usually helps reveal how low the probability is: With that said, none of this information will serve to comfort the loved ones of those who died on the Germanwings flight. Perhaps they would find some relief, however, if they weren't inundated with images of the place those closest to them perished. Should there be a discussion surrounding why this plane crashed? Absolutely. But that doesn't require 24/7 coverage of the crash site. At any given moment over the course of the next 24 hours, people will die from poverty, famine, disease, war and other forms of abhorrent violence. Simultaneously, we face the ongoing effects of climate change and inequality. Perhaps we should refocus our obsession onto these kinds of issues. It would be nice to live in a world where issues are granted attention based on their everyday impact and imminence, rather than their potential to generate profits in correlation with the whims of a fickle public. Maybe that's just wishful thinking, but it's certainly still something to think about.

But, though it will come as no consolation to the friends and families of those who perished, 2016 has been one of the safest years in aviation history.  There has been a relatively small number of air accidents this year - a testament to the stringent safety standards now in place around the world. Among 2016’s other high-profile tragedies was EgyptAir Flight 804 from Paris to Cairo, which disappeared in the Mediterranean in May, killing all 66 on board, and Flydubai Flight 981 , which crashed after an aborted landing in Russia with the loss of 62 lives.              Despite a couple of recent incidents, 2016 remains one of the safest years in aviation history   Credit: Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.       According to the Aviation Safety Network (ASN), which keeps a database of all air travel incidents, 2016 was the second safest year on record. There were 19 fatal accidents this year, resulting in 325 deaths - down from 560 in 2015. Given that this year will see around 3.5 billion air passengers flown, that’s just one death per 10,769,230 travellers. Two of these 19 accidents were on flights operated by airlines on the EU “black list”.  Only one year saw fewer deaths - 2013, with 265. But with 3.048 billion boarding a plane that year, according to the World Bank’s data, this amounts to a very similar number of deaths per passenger: one per 11,501,886.    Safest years in aviation history | Deaths per total number of passengers flown       Safest years in aviation history | Total deaths     When one discounts hijackings and sabotage, 2015 was actually the safest year on record. The crashes of a Germanwings A320 in March 2015, deliberately caused by co-pilot Andreas Lubitz , and a Metrojet A321 in October , due to a suspected bomb, accounted for the majority of last year's fatalities.                  Last year also saw the fewest number of fatal crashes involving passenger aircraft - just seven. There has been 11 so far in 2016. The general trend, however - that air travel has never been safer - is easy to see.  “Since 1997 the average number of airliner accidents has shown a steady and persistent decline... thanks to the continuing efforts of international aviation organisations such as ICAO, IATA, Flight Safety Foundation and the aviation industry,” said ASN President Harro Ranter.  But what of the deadliest year in aviation history? For that, one must go back to 1972, which saw a remarkable 2,370 deaths and 72 fatal accidents. There were 11 crashes that saw at least 100 perish, including four Aeroflot flights, and others involving Iberia, Sterling Airways, Alitalia, British European Airways, Interflug, Spantax and Eastern Air Lines.    At a glance | 10 deadliest years in aviation history                 1972 was the deadliest year in aviation history       Fearful fliers should be grateful the Seventies are over. The following year, 1973, was the second deadliest on record, with 69 fatal crashes and 2,028 deaths. The carriers involved in the biggest disasters that year included Royal Jordanian, Libya Arab Airlines, Invicta International Airlines, Varig and Pan Am. And, of course, Aeroflot, which had a staggering 17 crashes that year.  And 1974 was the fourth deadliest year, with 1,989 fatalities from 68 crashes (eight involving Aeroflot). It should be noted that safety standards have improved drastically at the Russian airline since then - it hasn't been involved in a fatal accident since 1996.    At a glance | The deadliest decades in airliner history     During every year in the Seventies, there were more than 1,000 deaths, making it comfortably the deadliest decade on record (16,766 - more than twice as many as during the 2000s).

By DNews   Published On 09/15/2011  11:30 AM EDT         Share on Facebook      Tweet this article       Email              Skydiving is one of the ultimate thrills you can have, provided you're not scared of jumping out of an airplane or helicopter, or generally acrophobic (which comes with the territory). Fear is obviously the main deterrent to those unadventurous types who dare not skydive, probably with the thoughts of anything that can go wrong when free-falling toward the earth from 15,000 feet. But let's cite some facts about the infrequency of skydiving accidents, so that the not-so-daring might reconsider.   First off, I'm not going to lie; accidents do happen in the sky. But they also happen on the ground, in the approximately 10 million car accidents per year, according to a report by the US Department of Transportation. About 40,000 of these accidents result in fatalities, simply for doing something that many people consider a necessary everyday activity. And are you afraid of driving or riding in a car?   Compare that against the statistics of skydiving accidents. According to the United States Parachuting Association, there are an estimated 3 million jumps per year, and the fatality count is only 21 (for 2010). That's a 0.0007% chance of dying from a skydive, compared to a 0.0167% chance of dying in a car accident (based on driving 10,000 miles). In layman's terms, you are about 24 times more likely to die in a car accident than in a skydiving one.   With that said, the answer to the question is that skydiving accidents are not common at all. And according to statistics by the US Parachuting Association, the average number of fatalities per year has been in a steady decline from decade to decade; it's almost been cut in half of what it used to be in the 1970s. So rest assured that skydiving may have its risks, but they are extremely minimal. And being someone who's been skydiving, I can tell you that running that small risk is worth it; there's nothing like the sensation of flying down the sky with the earth below you in every direction - indoor skydiving doesn't even come close. Of course, you should make sure you have a parachute or tandem guide with you, unless you're as daring as extreme skydive instructor Scott Palmer (as seen in Jackass 3D) or Red Bull-endorsing motorsports daredevil Travis Pastrana , who have both jumped out of a plane without a chute (see video below).             You may not be ready for a stunt like that, but take note: Both of them survived.   For more adrenaline-pumping content, check out The Adrenalist .

Feeling somewhat nervous about it? You have absolutely no reason to be worried; probability is on your side. Grab some peanuts, put your headphones in, sit back and relax. The airplane has revolutionized our existence. It has cut journeys that used to take weeks and months into just a few hours. It's also extremely safe, but people continue to fear it. A recent plane crash in the French Alps may have increased people's anxieties. Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed on Tuesday not long before 11 am. Tragically, everyone on board, 144 passengers and six crew members, died in the process. Germanwings is now a trending topics on social media and will undoubtedly continue to be discussed in the coming weeks. Along with "Pretty Little Liars" and Angelina Jolie, it's currently one of the top subjects people are searching for, Google Trends reveals . We are both terrified of and fascinated by death, particularly when it happens in unusual ways. The likelihood of dying in a plane crash (or even being in one) is so slim it's almost pointless to quantify. According to The Economist , the probability of your plane going down is around one in 5.4 million. Other reports place the odds closer to one in 11 million . To put this into perspective, you are far more likely to be struck by lightning or attacked by a shark than you are to die in a plane crash. And there are even more common things that kill decidedly more frequently, including the flu . Traveling by car is 100 times more deadly than hopping on a plane. Not to mention, statistically, it's never been safer to fly . Perhaps this helps explain why we become so captivated by plane crashes when they do occur; they're just so incredibly rare. At the same time, media coverage of these sorts of events is undeniably excessive and hyperbolic. This trend is driven by a desire for increased viewership and profits. Does this say more about the media or more about us? It's a two-way street: Major news networks consistently report on tragedies because they know the public will pay attention. In 2014, plane crashes often dominated the news. From the mysterious disappearance of MH370 to the tragic crash of Air Asia Flight 8501 in December, there were eight fatal plane crashes over the course of the year. In total, commercial airline accidents killed 992 people across the globe in 2014, the most since 2005, Vice reports . But if you look at data surrounding airplane crashes in a broader sense, they have decreased exponentially over time, as highlighted by the Guardian . And at this point last year, there had already been 33 plane crashes . As of the Germanwings crash, the number for 2015 stands at 17 . It's also very telling that in 2014, airplane crashes received 43 percent more media attention than the 1.24 million ground traffic fatalities that occur across the world every year, as noted by the Washington Post. Interestingly, research has shown that the habitual coverage of plane crashes hasn't necessarily served to increase fears of flying , but it certainly hasn't helped deter them, either . Aviophobia, or the fear of flying, affects around 6.5 percent of the population, ABC news reports . A survey from Chapman University suggests that 43 percent of people have at least some fear of flying, and around 9 percent are so afraid they won't even step foot on a plane. The fear is so ubiquitous there's even an iPhone app called "Am I Going Down?," which helps calculate how likely it is your flight will crash. Thankfully, it usually helps reveal how low the probability is: With that said, none of this information will serve to comfort the loved ones of those who died on the Germanwings flight. Perhaps they would find some relief, however, if they weren't inundated with images of the place those closest to them perished. Should there be a discussion surrounding why this plane crashed? Absolutely. But that doesn't require 24/7 coverage of the crash site. At any given moment over the course of the next 24 hours, people will die from poverty, famine, disease, war and other forms of abhorrent violence. Simultaneously, we face the ongoing effects of climate change and inequality. Perhaps we should refocus our obsession onto these kinds of issues. It would be nice to live in a world where issues are granted attention based on their everyday impact and imminence, rather than their potential to generate profits in correlation with the whims of a fickle public. Maybe that's just wishful thinking, but it's certainly still something to think about.

August 2, 2017    Edited by   Ben Bowman                               Share                                                    Since Wilbur and Orville Wright first took to the skies in 1903, virtually everyone who has ridden in a plane has considered what might happen if the thing falls out of the sky. What are the odds of surviving a plane crash? Although more than 40 percent of passengers report fear of being involved in a plane crash, the odds are in our favor. Statistically speaking, a person would have to take a flight every day for 55,000 years before encountering a fatal accident. You are literally more likely to be killed by a falling coconut.                                          So You're Sayin' There's a Chance         In 2016, 325 people died in 19 airplane crashes worldwide. That might seem like a lot, but more than 2,500 left-handed people are killed every year from using equipment meant for right-handed people. Despite big-budget Hollywood films' depictions of plane crashes, flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car or traffic accident are one in 5,000. Even if you're reading this on an airplane while you're rocketing toward the ground, your odds of surviving are quite good. Among passengers aboard crashed planes, 95.7 percent survive. And according to the National Transportation Safety Board, even passengers of the most devastating airplane crashes survive at a rate of 76 percent. Despite its safety, air travel malfunctions can cause passenger distress, and on rare occasion, result in a crash. So what can you do to prepare yourself, if anything? What boosts our odds for survival? And what happens when a plane actually does crash? Buckle in for these videos: a worst-case scenario survival guide.

Brianna Hansen   Brianna Hansen  May 23, 2016                              17726  views                             17726  views          comments             With the recent disappearance of EgyptAir flight 804, the
fear of flying has reawakened within many Americans. With stories of vanishing planes in mind, Americans may find themselves wondering if something like that could happen to them. Aviophobia, or the fear of flying, affects roughly 20 million people worldwide, and is a very understandable fear. The idea of being left helpless in an
emergency situation that occurs 30,000 feet above the ground is terrifying. When you decide to board a
plane, you lose control over your fate. If an accident did strike, you would have
no way to help yourself or to escape the situation! Very scary stuff to think about. However, to keep things in perspective, your chances of being in a plane
crash are extremely low, 1 in 11 million , to be exact. The odds of experiencing
one of the following are much more likely. 1. Being born with an extra finger or toe 1 in 500. 2. Becoming President of the United States 1 in 10 million. ( I'll admit that your chances are slim, but it is still more likely than dying in a plane crash.) 3. Getting killed from a meteorite 1 in 700,000. 4. Giving birth to conjoined twins 1 in 200,000. 5.  Winning an Oscar 1 in 11,500. 6. Dying from a bee sting 1 in 79,842. 7. Winning an Olympic gold medal 1 in 662,000. (Assuming you can qualify for the Olympics first…) 8. Dying from a flesh-eating bacteria 1 in a million. 9. Drowning in your bathtub 1 in 840,000. 10.  Dating a millionaire 1 in 215. (Might just drop out of college and play the odds on this one.) 11. Getting murdered 1 in 18,000. 12. Getting killed by a bear at Yellowstone National Park 1 in 2.1 million. 13. Dating a supermodel 1 in 88,000. 14. Writing a New York Times bestseller 1 in 220. 15. Having your ID stolen 1 in 465. 16. Dying in a tornado 1 in 60,000. 17. Getting poisoned 1 in 1,400. 18. Dying in a skydiving accident 1 in 100,000. 19. Becoming a nudist 1 in 6,000. 20. Meeting someone who speaks Cherokee 1 in 15,000. 21. Living to 100 years old 1 in 3.

Allison Music   Allison Music  Apr 10, 2018                             19  views                             19  views          comments         Over spring break, I traveled to the beautiful country of Denmark. While I have traveled to other countries, none of them have been as different as Denmark. Here are a list of things that I noticed were different in the United States. 1. Everything is so much more expensive. I've already talked about this a little in a previous article I have written, but when I say this place is expensive, I mean it. A bottle of water in America is around $1.50 to $2.00. I bought a bottle of water in Denmark and it was upwards to $5.00. If you are planning a trip to Denmark, make sure to budget accordingly. Make sure you figure out what you want to spend your money on. I suggest getting an Airbnb and grocery shopping for breakfasts, lunches, or dinners. Eating in restaurants will add up really quickly. Try putting that money towards museums and other entertainment. Oh, also, public transportation is amazing, but also very, very expensive. Try to use the train as little as possible. Maybe rent a car or a bike, if you're just planning on staying in Copenhagen. But, if you are traveling around the country, consider a bus. Gas prices are, you guessed it, way more expensive in Denmark. Do your research about the cheapest ways to get around, depending on the cities or towns you'd like to visit. 2. The people are friendly, but not in the way you're used to. Danish people get a horrible reputation. If you have read anything about the Danes, you've probably read they are rude and unfriendly. That is the furthest from the truth. The Danes are so willing to help and will never give you the cold shoulder. However, do not expect the overly friendly type of people you'd find in America. They are willing to give you directions and help you out if you're confused, but you must approach them first. They do not talk to strangers first but will have no problem answering a question. Just don't small talk or ask them anything too personal. They like their privacy. Also, most of the Danes speak excellent English, so there is no trouble there. 3. The food is... interesting. I didn't hate the food. I actually liked the food a lot more than the food in Ireland, but it is not Italian cuisine. A lot of fish, egg, and mayo. Oh, and hotdogs. Don't be afraid to try it. Trust me, it is not as bad as it looks. I had a burger with what is called "red salad," which is just basically cranberries. Yes, you heard right. A burger with cranberries. Also, there was no beef on this burger. It was a type of slimy pork. It wasn't the best thing I have ever had, but it was an experience nevertheless. If you ever visit, you have to try the open faced sandwiches! The Danes swear by them. 4. Teenagers are allowed to drink and they are allowed to drink on the streets. The drinking age in Denmark is 15. Which means you'll get to see teenagers running around with beer cans just on the street. Denmark doesn't have a law against drinking in public, so it is completely legal and normal. Don't get too freaked out. I was in Aalborg and saw a group of people playing a drinking game right in a public park. You don't have to join the trend, but just try to act as normal as possible around it. The Danes think it's rude if you stare or are too judgmental. 5. Bikes are everywhere. In any of the major cities: Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg, etc, you will see more bikes than cars. So much so, there is a specific bike lane for bikers. It is the size of a road. Biking is the cheapest and fastest way to get around in Denmark. Plus, everyone really does care about the environment. Bikes has just become the most used form of transportation. When in Copenhagen, rent a bike. It is the best way to see the city. Remember to look for bikes too! They go faster than the cars and will not be happy about you walking in the bike lane. It is not a sidewalk. 6. Denmark is so safe. I'm not saying America isn't safe, but what I am saying, is people in Denmark leave their babies outside in a stroller while they are in a restaurant and this is normal. Their baby. Outside. And they aren't worried about someone kidnapping them. That is how safe this place is. Story time: I lost my wallet while I was in Aarhus. I got a call from Kent State the next day saying someone had found it and wanted to return in. A Dane literally contacted Kent State after seeing my flashcard wanting to return my wallet, which had cash and my credit cards in it. When I got it back, everything was still inside. Including old receipts. When I say this place is safe, I mean it's safe. Denmark is such a beautiful country and if you ever have the chance, visit. It's worth the many pennies.

Jacob Mitchener   Jacob Mitchener  Apr 9, 2018                             216  views                             216  views          comments         A beautiful and unique city known for everything ranging from its rich history to its active nightlife, Prague is a gem in the heart of the Czech Republic that cannot be missed. Located in the northwest of the Czech Republic, Prague has a beauty that can only be understood by traveling to the city itself. Before starting my trip to Europe, I asked the advice of several other travelers about which destinations they recommend that I travel to. High on the list of many of these travelers was Prague. With so many recommendations, I simply had to visit. But what makes this city such a favorite among both travelers and its inhabitants? To start with, I found the people of the Czech Republic to be very kind to their visitors; they wanted to share the country that they love so much with anyone who is willing to take the time to visit. As far as activities go, exploring Prague without a map was one of my favorite experiences in the city. The day I arrived, I decided to wander around in search of food. In the process, I was able to get a glimpse of some of the famous architecture around the city, as well as some of its most iconic sights. After returning to my hostel, I was able to do some research into the history of these locations while also planning out the places I wanted to spend more time with. As far as specific attractions go, Prague is a perfect city to visit no matter your time frame. With that being said, a few of the most prominent and worthwhile attractions include the Charles Bridge, all of Old Town, Wenceslas Square, Petrin Hills, and Prague Castle. The main sights can be seen in a tour around the city in a day (which requires a ton of walking), but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t spend any more time there. Now let’s pretend you have just arrived in Prague and you are eager to see everything you can in just one walking journey. Doing this, I would suggest starting in Wenceslas Square and walking down the slope towards Old Town. A walk through Old Town takes you through the picturesque streets of Prague, while also allowing you to visit the Astronomical Tower, the Old Town Square, and St. Nicolas’ Church; all of which are well worth it if you find yourself in Prague. After seeing these iconic sights, wandering towards the Jewish Quarter of the city provides an opportunity to learn some of the history of the city through the years. From there, walk towards the river to see the concert hall known as Rudolfinum while listening to music written by Czech composers that you might not recognize by name, but you will recognize by their music. Walk along the Vltava River towards the Charles Bridge where you should take your time to take in the atmosphere and the unique architecture of the bridge as well as the views of Old Town and Prague Castle as they face off across the river. This walk brings you to the other side of the river where you can see the somewhat surprising Lennon Wall as well as taking a trip to Prague Castle. This walking trip provides an opportunity to see most major sights in Prague. Like with any city, it is possible to go into more detail if you so desire, and Prague is a city that deserves that extra attention. There are museums and historical sites littered throughout the city, and they are not hard to find. I visited the National Technical Museum in a quieter part of the city and I was blown away by the size and level of detail that the museum provided. Anyone with enough interest could spend a full day exploring every detail. In addition to that, the Jewish museum in the Jewish Quarter is well known and has the reputation of being very good, but I did not have the time to visit it, unfortunately. The Prague Castle allows for entry that is free of charge, but a ticket is required to visit some parts of the complex. Purchase of this ticket depends on the level of detail you wish to go into, and the amount of time you have to spend there. The activity that I highly recommend is taking a trip to the Petrin Hills where you can buy a ticket to ascend Petrin Tower where the views of the city are simply breathtaking. These examples stand as just a few options for ideas on how to make your trip to Prague as complete as you can want. After taking a walk around the city to see all of the sights, taking the public transportation provides for a welcome rest from all of the walking. The transportation is cheap and cost is based on time which makes it perfect for travelers who want unlimited travel for just a few days. As far as additional public transportation goes, taxis can be found throughout the city, but be sure to find a good price. In many instances, getting an Uber will be far more convenient and allow for the best possible price. The Czech Republic is a beautiful country and its capital city is the culmination of the country’s beauty.

Photographer: Gill Allen/Bloomberg News      What are the chances of surviving in a plane crash? originally appeared on Quora : the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world .  Answer by Tom Farrier , Retired USAF rescue helicopter pilot; current aviation safety contractor (UAS), on Quora :  Ignore Hollywood. Aircraft involved in crashes are safer than at any time in history, thanks to decades of experience, research, and safety enhancements. According to Aviation Safety Network , in 2016 there were about one hundred and sixty three aviation “accidents” worldwide, including those involving business jets and military transports as well as jet and propeller airliners. A grand total of twenty-four resulted in fatalities, meaning only about 15% of all accidents in this grouping — which themselves are extremely rare events — actually resulted in lives being lost.    (FYI, only five of the fatal 2016 accidents were in the U.S, and none involved a major U.S. air carrier.)  Consider four possible outcomes to any crash:   You survive a survivable accident;  You survive a non-survivable accident;   You don’t survive a survivable accident; or  You don’t survive a non-survivable accident.   So, what the heck is a “survivable accident,” anyway? Well, to synthesize a couple of different takes on the subject, most in the aviation safety business (as well as those interested in other types of vehicle safety), look for three conditions:   The forces encountered by human occupants were within the limits of human tolerance;  The structure surrounding occupants remains substantially intact, maintaining an uncompromised volume around them; and  The post-crash environment does not present an immediate threat to occupants or rescuers.   In practical terms, this means directing forces away from people, slowing the onset of those that can’t be re-directed, preventing internal structures from failing in such a way as to stuck into the area where the carbon-based life forms are, and keeping the fire, smoke and fumes from easily starting or readily spreading. On this basis, you can see that a smoking hole in the ground is non-survivable, and there’s always a possibility that a small number of people don’t get the full benefit of protections that rendered the overall accident to be considered “survivable.” But, there are many, many examples to the contrary in events classified as “accidents” due to property damage and/or major injuries experienced in them.  In February of 2001, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board released the results of a comprehensive review of air carrier safety. They noted, “Fatal accidents such as TWA flight 800, ValuJet flight 592, and EgyptAir 990 receive extensive media coverage. Nonfatal accidents, however, often receive little coverage. As a result, the public may perceive that most air carrier accidents are not survivable. In fact, the Board's study shows that since 1983, more than 95% of the passengers survived.” (That includes accident where, given the criteria above, the accident itself should have been considered “non-survivable.)  A large contributor to this record goes to the many improvements the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration required of air carriers over time. These included:   Improved seat cushions with reduced flammability.  Floor proximity emergency escape path marking.  Lavatory smoke detectors.  Lavatory fire extinguishers.  Halon fire extinguishers.  Improved interior materials.  Cargo compartment liners.  Cargo compartment fire detection/suppression.  Thermal/acoustic insulation.  16G seats.  Improved access to certain types of exits.   (These are expanded upon in a graphic available at FAA Fact Sheet: Improvements to Aircraft Survivability ).  If you keep passengers properly restrained until the noise dies down and the movement stops, you reduce the likelihood of a fire starting in the first place, you delay its propagation, and you make the by-products of burning stuff less toxic, you have a much better chance of keeping everybody alive.  This was Air France 358, following a landing that went bad at Toronto-Pearson International Airport in 2005:  (Photo: CBS.com )   (Photo: blogto.com )  Everybody lived.  This was Asiana Airlines 214, which hit the sea wall in front of the runway touchdown zone on short final to San Francisco International on July 6, 2013:  (Photo: KTVU.com )  People were ejected from this aircraft during its post-impact tumble and break-up, but two of the only three people who died were accidentally struck by first responders in the confusion. There were many significant injuries suffered by the crew and passengers, but the aircraft did what it was supposed to do under extreme conditions — it protected its occupants as well as it possibly could, and it didn’t allow fire to spread until there was time to get everyone evacuated.  Bottom line: accidents are rare; when they happen, fatalities are that much rarer thanks to a lot of hard work and investment in making planes as safe as possible.

GULLIVER will soon fly from Heathrow to Milan on a British Airways Airbus A319. That flight has a one-in-4.8m chance of crashing. Shortly after he is jetting from Heathrow to JFK on a Virgin-operated A330. Chance of crashing? One in 5.4m. That means that he could apparently expect to fly on the route for 14,716 years before plummeting into the Atlantic.

The Economist explains a day ago Homo sapiens spread to Asia earlier than once believed Science and technology a day ago See more These figures come courtesy of “Am I Going Down?”, a recently released iPhone app that claims to calculate the odds of a disaster on a particular flight. Users input three variables: the departure and arrival airports, the airline, and the type of plane used. The app's maker hasn't responded to requests to give a little more detail of its methodology, but one presumes that it is a simple weighting of the proportion of crashes associated with each of those variables in the past. There are, of course, countless holes in such a simplistic approach. How does one decide the relative importance of the make of plane, airline or airport? Is past performance really an indicator of future performance? Does, for example, a Malaysia Airlines flight being shot out of the sky by Russian separatists make this event any more likely to happen again in the future? Is the calculation based on miles flown or the number of journeys? (As the take-off is the most dangerous phase of a flight, a 10,000 mile flight isn't twice as risky as a 5,000 mile one.) What about other important variables, such as the weather? The 14,716 years figure caused us a bit of confusion. But reader guest-isjswsa jumped in on the comments thread to shed some light on it. It’s the average length of time people will fly before crashing, if lots and lots of them do it every day. An alternative way of expressing it would be to say that if you were to arrange to fly this route every day for the next 10,210 years, your chance of dying would be 50%. And if you wanted to book enough flights to be almost certain of crashing, you reach a 99% probability at 67,833 years of daily flights. (For those interested in the maths, there is more here .) But perhaps this is a bit churlish. The idea behind the app is laudable, if not mathematically sound. Nic Johns, its creator, says he wants to reassure nervous flyers that they are all but guaranteed to reach their destination in one piece. Of course, we all know this deep down. In real terms, it makes no difference if the chance of crashing is one in 1m or one in 9m; the likelihood is so small as to make the difference irrelevant. But there is a special place in our psyches for the fear of big, unlikely catastrophes. According to David Ropeik , author of " How Risky is it, Really? ", the deadliest plane crash in history occurred in 1977 in Tenerife when 583 people were killed after two jumbos collided on the runway. Yet, that many people die from heart disease in America every eight hours. As Mr Ropeik explains, air crashes are considered catastrophes while heart attacks are not, because they fulfil three criteria: A catastrophe has to be big, it has to happen all at once, and something about it has to be calamitous—disastrous—really bad. A plane crash certainly qualifies. It kills a lot of people all at once, in one place, and in a really horrific way. But heart disease [...] meets only one of those criteria. As awful as heart disease and stroke and diabetes are, they don't kill people in such vividly awful ways as plane crashes. It bears repeating just how rare such deaths in the air are. Safety statistics collated by IATA , an airline association, show that in 2013 more than 3 billion people flew on commercial aircraft. During that time there were 81 accidents and 210 fatalities. What is more, this figure has been falling for years (although the two recent Malaysia Airlines disasters will mean a blip when the 2014 figures are released). By way of comparison, the World Health Organisation says there were over 1.2m road traffic deaths around the world in 2010 . It is the leading cause of death among 15-29 year olds. The University of Oxford calculates that in 2006, Brits had odds of one in 36,512 of dying in a motor accident and one in 3.5m dying in a plane crash. Of course, many more people drive than fly; hence it is not easy to compare the two types of travel in a meaningful way. It is not known how many car journeys people take around the world, but even if it was, one would have to decide whether to compare the number of discrete trips or the overall distance travelled (that is an important distinction because if you were travelling from London to Edinburgh, for example, you might reasonably choose between driving and flying). Suffice to say what we all know: the fear of flying is incommensurate with its risk. And, as this chart from an Economist  piece last year highlights, that’s before we compare it to the really dangerous modes of transport, like using stairs.

New app analyzes odds of your flight crashing By Karla Cripps , CNN Updated 9:49 AM ET, Fri January 23, 2015 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. New app "Am I Going Down?" uses aviation statistics to analyze the odds a flight will crash. Story highlights Am I Going Down? app is aimed at people who suffer from a fear of flying Creator says his app will show nervous fliers that air travel is typically very low risk (CNN) If you're flying on a Boeing 777 Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to Los Angeles on any given day, there's a one in 4,068,434 chance that your plane will crash. At least that's what a new app called "Am I Going Down?" says. That means if you take that flight every day for the next 11,146 years, you'll be unlikely to experience an incident. Created by London-based company Vanilla Pixel, the app uses real flight statistics to analyze flight safety, Developer Nic Johns says it's geared toward those who are uneasy about air travel. Read More "The initial inspiration comes from my co-founder and wife, Julie, who for many years has suffered from a fear of flying," says Johns. "In developing 'Am I Going Down?' I wanted to present the fact that the vast majority of flights are incredibly low risk. Our app is meant as tool to help reassure fearful fliers." Johns says more than 10 million routes have been assessed using data from sources such as the Geneva-based Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives, the United States National Transportation Safety Board and the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization. "For my analysis I only include crashes where there was at least one passenger fatality -- which is the relevant stat for those with a fear of flying," says Johns. "I then incorporate the volume of flights, weighted to the most recent 10 years, to provide the final 'one in a million' statistics." Bad timing? Johns admits the timing of the release of the app was awkward, given that it came out just days after AirAsia flight QZ8501 went down. The developer says it was an unfortunate coincidence. "I actually developed the app in February 2014, shortly before the Malaysia Airlines MH370 disappearance," says Johns. "Due to that I postponed the release and worked on a few other things, then finalized and submitted it to Apple in December. The AirAsia QZ8501 flight crashed two weeks later. "There have been a few raised eyebrows but most people know it was a coincidence." The "Am I Going Down?" app, now available in iTunes, costs $0.99. It's only available on Apple at the moment though if the app is successful, an Android version is a possibility for the future, says Johns. "The positive response from anxious fliers has been amazing, really encouraging," says Johns.

They raise the question: Why do some passengers survive plane crashes and others tragically don't? JUST WATCHED Seat belts on planes: Pros and cons Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Seat belts on planes: Pros and cons  02:54 Some of those who lived through Wednesday's crash credited their survival to seat belts and seating choices , yet much of surviving a disaster is pure chance. Remarkable stories of plane crash survival Some of the survival game involves factors passengers largely can't control, like the weather, flight crew skills, the design of airline seats and the construction, maintenance and age of the plane. But passengers themselves can do a lot to improve their chances of survival simply by making smart choices and being informed. Read More Engine problems reported before TransAsia crash Here are a few ideas to keep in mind: 1. Seat choice? Experts differ Have you heard of the "five-row rule"? This refers to the idea that if you're sitting within five rows of an emergency exit, you have a statistically better chance of surviving a crash. A 2011 study by University of Greenwich professor Ed Galea supports this theory . But an expert at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration disagrees. "There really isn't a 'safest seat' on the plane," said Cynthia Corbett, an FAA research scientist who specializes in airplane cabin safety. "It really kind of depends on the emergency you're going to have. Different parts of the plane can be effected in different ways, depending on what the event is. Just reinforce your own propensity for survival, by knowing how to get where you need to go. If your first choice in exits is blocked, then you should have a second choice." 2. Listen to the safety talk. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's boring. It's repetitive. But it could save your life! The presentation -- by video or by flight attendants -- explaining what to do in case the plane goes down offers key information like: How do I get out? How do I escape if I can't see? Where's my flotation device? 3. Read the safety card. You know that safety card in the pocket of the seat in front of you? Think of it as a map leading you toward survival. Read it. It shows how the plane you're on will be evacuated. Think about the dozens -- or even hundreds -- of fellow passengers who will need to get off the plane ASAP. It helps to know what to expect. Experts: Be aware of your surroundings during takeoffs and landings -- the most critical part of every flight. You may have to slide down an inflatable ramp. You may have to get in an inflatable boat. The card shows you how it all works. 4. Know how to brace. Do you? Have you ever tried it? Sometimes, passengers have only seconds to react in an emergency. If aircraft crew members are commanding passengers to assume the brace position, it helps to know in advance what they're talking about. The safety talk and card will help you. 5. Be aware of the exits. Plan your escape. Visualize how you -- and perhaps children you're traveling with -- are going to get out of the plane. During some emergencies, it may be impossible to see the nearest exit. Before departure, Corbett recommends counting armrests from your seat to the closest way out. "If you have to feel your way along the aisle and count [seats to get to the nearest exit], the best way to do that is along the armrests, because the frame of the seat is the most stable part," Corbett said. "If you're leaning down to hold the armrests, then that also gets you kind of crouched over enough to be below any smoke that might accumulate from any kind of a fire." 6. Move quickly. You have 90 seconds to get out of the plane after a crash, according to Ben Sherwood, author of the New York Times bestseller "The Survivor's Club." Many passengers in plane crashes survive the initial impact. It's what happens next that often kills them. This includes fire, smoke and sometimes water.  Sherwood advises using 90 seconds as a time frame for escaping. 7. Be aware during takeoffs and landings. Statistics show that most crashes occur in the minutes surrounding takeoffs and landings. So it stands to reason that passengers who want to increase their chances of survival should be especially aware of what's going on at that time. Drinking alcoholic beverages before departure or arrival could impair your response in a crisis. And sleeping during these times is probably not the best option if you're looking to increase survivability. "Don't have your shoes off," said Corbett. "Don't have your sleeping mask on. Don't have your ear buds in. Be familiar with what's going on and pay attention. It's only a matter of a few minutes." 8. Stay fit. This may go without saying, but the fitter you are, the better your chances of survival. Overweight or slower-moving passengers obviously could be at a disadvantage during an emergency evacuation. 9. Avoid airlines with poor safety records. Statistics show that we are living in the safest era in the history of commercial aviation. Nonetheless, every airline has a safety record, and those records are tracked. Various groups offer rankings for airline safety . 10. Dress for quick movement No high heels or flip-flops. Avoid short pants. Dress for the possibility that you might have to pass quickly through wreckage -- or even run away from the plane.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Aviation What are the chances for an airplane to crash? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 2 Answers   Chris Lee , Aerospace Engineer, involved in design of Part 25 aircraft Answered Mar 3, 2014 As Tim Morgan mentions, scheduled airlines in Western countries are the safest of all forms of high speed travel (by high-speed, I mean anything as fast as a car or faster). It is remarkable when you think of the approximately 18 million flight hours flown by part 121 carriers (scheduled commercial operations) and realize that the total number of fatal accidents each year is almost always between zero and two. If we average the number of fatal accidents over a 10 year period in the 2000's, we get a fatal accident rate of about 0.008 per 100,000 flight hours. That said, not all of aviation experiences such low accident rates. General aviation, which consists of all forms of aviation that do not involve some form of transport for hire (i.e. the segment you might equate to private pilots), necessarily has a much higher accident rate. This is because the standards vary a lot more when you're talking about regular people doing personal flying. You have a lot of pilots with varying degrees of experience, judgment, and discipline, who rarely have a second-in-command pilot. You also have aircraft with varying degrees of upkeep, and there are so many aircraft that no agency could possibly keep an eagle eye on the maintenance practices involved in all of them. I do want to make it clear, however, that system or engine failure is by no means the main reason for fatal accidents. I believe that this what most people assume when they are talking about the likelihood of a crash. But mechanical failure is usually only responsible for 12 to 14% of all fatal accidents. What follows is that 70 to 80% of all general aviation accidents have nothing to do with the safety of the equipment. The largest majority of accidents occur during low-level operations, where things mainly come in the form of stall/spin accidents. For low time pilots, failure to maintain airspeed during something like a base to final turn can have dire consequences. Weather or night flying can also lead to increased susceptibility to these types of accidents, and few recent high-profile airline accidents bear this out. With a lot of the newer systems and instrumentation, quite a number of accidents have involved a disconnect between the system and the pilot, and is spurring much discussion over the future direction of cockpit systems and the types of automation and related training practices required to ensure further improvement of safety. Unfortunately, what is also true of general aviation accidents is that they sometimes include pilots who exhibit poor judgment. Too often, I hear reports of a crash because the pilot was needlessly attempting to do something stupid and put himself in a situation where his skills ran out. Good pilots don't intentionally put themselves in places where the situation can overwhelm their abilities. The same principle applies to judgment when it comes to the weather, and you do hear sad stories of people who get ahead of themselves when it comes to deciding when to stay on the ground. General aviation as a whole, has an accident rate in the region of 1.1 fatal accidents per 100,000 flying hours. Flight instruction generally tends to be much safer, at less than 0.5 fatal accidents per 100,000 flying hours. I usually don't like to compare flying in private aircraft to driving an automobile because of the differences in speeds and distances traveled for a given time period. The nature of accidents is also different; you are not so much at the mercy of other pilots when you fly a plane than you are in a car where most accidents are a result of contact with other traffic, often at no fault of your own. So while you might find articles out on the internet that claim higher accident rates for general aviation per million miles traveled, I think this is an apples to oranges comparison. Automobile accidents tend to be much more random, yet evenly distributed in likelihood; someone who is a careless driver could go decades without a single accident, while the opposite might be the case for an extremely responsible driver. This is not so much the case in aviation. For most people, the only exposure they have to aircraft involves the airline industry, where the discussion of likelihood of death is more or less irrelevant because of the astronomically small numbers involved. But when it comes to the small single engine propeller aircraft that most people observe floating about, yes, the probability of an accident is numerically higher, but it highly depends on the situation and the facts surrounding it. I went to an aerospace university that had literally hundreds of flight operations daily, and not once in a four-year period had there been a single injury accident during dual instruction or solo flight training. There were, however, more than a handful of fatal automobile accidents among the students. 1.1k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Honey What are the best ways to travel the world at minimum cost?

If you fly a reputable airline 20 times a year, that means your chance of dying this year in an aircraft accident are about 1 in a million. For comparison, the odds that you will die in a car crash this year are about 1 in 6,000.

August 2, 2017    Edited by   Ben Bowman                               Share                                                    Since Wilbur and Orville Wright first took to the skies in 1903, virtually everyone who has ridden in a plane has considered what might happen if the thing falls out of the sky. What are the odds of surviving a plane crash? Although more than 40 percent of passengers report fear of being involved in a plane crash, the odds are in our favor. Statistically speaking, a person would have to take a flight every day for 55,000 years before encountering a fatal accident. You are literally more likely to be killed by a falling coconut.                                          So You're Sayin' There's a Chance         In 2016, 325 people died in 19 airplane crashes worldwide. That might seem like a lot, but more than 2,500 left-handed people are killed every year from using equipment meant for right-handed people. Despite big-budget Hollywood films' depictions of plane crashes, flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car or traffic accident are one in 5,000. Even if you're reading this on an airplane while you're rocketing toward the ground, your odds of surviving are quite good. Among passengers aboard crashed planes, 95.7 percent survive. And according to the National Transportation Safety Board, even passengers of the most devastating airplane crashes survive at a rate of 76 percent. Despite its safety, air travel malfunctions can cause passenger distress, and on rare occasion, result in a crash. So what can you do to prepare yourself, if anything? What boosts our odds for survival? And what happens when a plane actually does crash? Buckle in for these videos: a worst-case scenario survival guide.

Feeling somewhat nervous about it? You have absolutely no reason to be worried; probability is on your side. Grab some peanuts, put your headphones in, sit back and relax. The airplane has revolutionized our existence. It has cut journeys that used to take weeks and months into just a few hours. It's also extremely safe, but people continue to fear it. A recent plane crash in the French Alps may have increased people's anxieties. Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed on Tuesday not long before 11 am. Tragically, everyone on board, 144 passengers and six crew members, died in the process. Germanwings is now a trending topics on social media and will undoubtedly continue to be discussed in the coming weeks. Along with "Pretty Little Liars" and Angelina Jolie, it's currently one of the top subjects people are searching for, Google Trends reveals . We are both terrified of and fascinated by death, particularly when it happens in unusual ways. The likelihood of dying in a plane crash (or even being in one) is so slim it's almost pointless to quantify. According to The Economist , the probability of your plane going down is around one in 5.4 million. Other reports place the odds closer to one in 11 million . To put this into perspective, you are far more likely to be struck by lightning or attacked by a shark than you are to die in a plane crash. And there are even more common things that kill decidedly more frequently, including the flu . Traveling by car is 100 times more deadly than hopping on a plane. Not to mention, statistically, it's never been safer to fly . Perhaps this helps explain why we become so captivated by plane crashes when they do occur; they're just so incredibly rare. At the same time, media coverage of these sorts of events is undeniably excessive and hyperbolic. This trend is driven by a desire for increased viewership and profits. Does this say more about the media or more about us? It's a two-way street: Major news networks consistently report on tragedies because they know the public will pay attention. In 2014, plane crashes often dominated the news. From the mysterious disappearance of MH370 to the tragic crash of Air Asia Flight 8501 in December, there were eight fatal plane crashes over the course of the year. In total, commercial airline accidents killed 992 people across the globe in 2014, the most since 2005, Vice reports . But if you look at data surrounding airplane crashes in a broader sense, they have decreased exponentially over time, as highlighted by the Guardian . And at this point last year, there had already been 33 plane crashes . As of the Germanwings crash, the number for 2015 stands at 17 . It's also very telling that in 2014, airplane crashes received 43 percent more media attention than the 1.24 million ground traffic fatalities that occur across the world every year, as noted by the Washington Post. Interestingly, research has shown that the habitual coverage of plane crashes hasn't necessarily served to increase fears of flying , but it certainly hasn't helped deter them, either . Aviophobia, or the fear of flying, affects around 6.5 percent of the population, ABC news reports . A survey from Chapman University suggests that 43 percent of people have at least some fear of flying, and around 9 percent are so afraid they won't even step foot on a plane. The fear is so ubiquitous there's even an iPhone app called "Am I Going Down?," which helps calculate how likely it is your flight will crash. Thankfully, it usually helps reveal how low the probability is: With that said, none of this information will serve to comfort the loved ones of those who died on the Germanwings flight. Perhaps they would find some relief, however, if they weren't inundated with images of the place those closest to them perished. Should there be a discussion surrounding why this plane crashed? Absolutely. But that doesn't require 24/7 coverage of the crash site. At any given moment over the course of the next 24 hours, people will die from poverty, famine, disease, war and other forms of abhorrent violence. Simultaneously, we face the ongoing effects of climate change and inequality. Perhaps we should refocus our obsession onto these kinds of issues. It would be nice to live in a world where issues are granted attention based on their everyday impact and imminence, rather than their potential to generate profits in correlation with the whims of a fickle public. Maybe that's just wishful thinking, but it's certainly still something to think about.

But, though it will come as no consolation to the friends and families of those who perished, 2016 has been one of the safest years in aviation history.  There has been a relatively small number of air accidents this year - a testament to the stringent safety standards now in place around the world. Among 2016’s other high-profile tragedies was EgyptAir Flight 804 from Paris to Cairo, which disappeared in the Mediterranean in May, killing all 66 on board, and Flydubai Flight 981 , which crashed after an aborted landing in Russia with the loss of 62 lives.              Despite a couple of recent incidents, 2016 remains one of the safest years in aviation history   Credit: Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.       According to the Aviation Safety Network (ASN), which keeps a database of all air travel incidents, 2016 was the second safest year on record. There were 19 fatal accidents this year, resulting in 325 deaths - down from 560 in 2015. Given that this year will see around 3.5 billion air passengers flown, that’s just one death per 10,769,230 travellers. Two of these 19 accidents were on flights operated by airlines on the EU “black list”.  Only one year saw fewer deaths - 2013, with 265. But with 3.048 billion boarding a plane that year, according to the World Bank’s data, this amounts to a very similar number of deaths per passenger: one per 11,501,886.    Safest years in aviation history | Deaths per total number of passengers flown       Safest years in aviation history | Total deaths     When one discounts hijackings and sabotage, 2015 was actually the safest year on record. The crashes of a Germanwings A320 in March 2015, deliberately caused by co-pilot Andreas Lubitz , and a Metrojet A321 in October , due to a suspected bomb, accounted for the majority of last year's fatalities.                  Last year also saw the fewest number of fatal crashes involving passenger aircraft - just seven. There has been 11 so far in 2016. The general trend, however - that air travel has never been safer - is easy to see.  “Since 1997 the average number of airliner accidents has shown a steady and persistent decline... thanks to the continuing efforts of international aviation organisations such as ICAO, IATA, Flight Safety Foundation and the aviation industry,” said ASN President Harro Ranter.  But what of the deadliest year in aviation history? For that, one must go back to 1972, which saw a remarkable 2,370 deaths and 72 fatal accidents. There were 11 crashes that saw at least 100 perish, including four Aeroflot flights, and others involving Iberia, Sterling Airways, Alitalia, British European Airways, Interflug, Spantax and Eastern Air Lines.    At a glance | 10 deadliest years in aviation history                 1972 was the deadliest year in aviation history       Fearful fliers should be grateful the Seventies are over. The following year, 1973, was the second deadliest on record, with 69 fatal crashes and 2,028 deaths. The carriers involved in the biggest disasters that year included Royal Jordanian, Libya Arab Airlines, Invicta International Airlines, Varig and Pan Am. And, of course, Aeroflot, which had a staggering 17 crashes that year.  And 1974 was the fourth deadliest year, with 1,989 fatalities from 68 crashes (eight involving Aeroflot). It should be noted that safety standards have improved drastically at the Russian airline since then - it hasn't been involved in a fatal accident since 1996.    At a glance | The deadliest decades in airliner history     During every year in the Seventies, there were more than 1,000 deaths, making it comfortably the deadliest decade on record (16,766 - more than twice as many as during the 2000s).

By DNews   Published On 09/15/2011  11:30 AM EDT         Share on Facebook      Tweet this article       Email              Skydiving is one of the ultimate thrills you can have, provided you're not scared of jumping out of an airplane or helicopter, or generally acrophobic (which comes with the territory). Fear is obviously the main deterrent to those unadventurous types who dare not skydive, probably with the thoughts of anything that can go wrong when free-falling toward the earth from 15,000 feet. But let's cite some facts about the infrequency of skydiving accidents, so that the not-so-daring might reconsider.   First off, I'm not going to lie; accidents do happen in the sky. But they also happen on the ground, in the approximately 10 million car accidents per year, according to a report by the US Department of Transportation. About 40,000 of these accidents result in fatalities, simply for doing something that many people consider a necessary everyday activity. And are you afraid of driving or riding in a car?   Compare that against the statistics of skydiving accidents. According to the United States Parachuting Association, there are an estimated 3 million jumps per year, and the fatality count is only 21 (for 2010). That's a 0.0007% chance of dying from a skydive, compared to a 0.0167% chance of dying in a car accident (based on driving 10,000 miles). In layman's terms, you are about 24 times more likely to die in a car accident than in a skydiving one.   With that said, the answer to the question is that skydiving accidents are not common at all. And according to statistics by the US Parachuting Association, the average number of fatalities per year has been in a steady decline from decade to decade; it's almost been cut in half of what it used to be in the 1970s. So rest assured that skydiving may have its risks, but they are extremely minimal. And being someone who's been skydiving, I can tell you that running that small risk is worth it; there's nothing like the sensation of flying down the sky with the earth below you in every direction - indoor skydiving doesn't even come close. Of course, you should make sure you have a parachute or tandem guide with you, unless you're as daring as extreme skydive instructor Scott Palmer (as seen in Jackass 3D) or Red Bull-endorsing motorsports daredevil Travis Pastrana , who have both jumped out of a plane without a chute (see video below).             You may not be ready for a stunt like that, but take note: Both of them survived.   For more adrenaline-pumping content, check out The Adrenalist .

Feeling somewhat nervous about it? You have absolutely no reason to be worried; probability is on your side. Grab some peanuts, put your headphones in, sit back and relax. The airplane has revolutionized our existence. It has cut journeys that used to take weeks and months into just a few hours. It's also extremely safe, but people continue to fear it. A recent plane crash in the French Alps may have increased people's anxieties. Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed on Tuesday not long before 11 am. Tragically, everyone on board, 144 passengers and six crew members, died in the process. Germanwings is now a trending topics on social media and will undoubtedly continue to be discussed in the coming weeks. Along with "Pretty Little Liars" and Angelina Jolie, it's currently one of the top subjects people are searching for, Google Trends reveals . We are both terrified of and fascinated by death, particularly when it happens in unusual ways. The likelihood of dying in a plane crash (or even being in one) is so slim it's almost pointless to quantify. According to The Economist , the probability of your plane going down is around one in 5.4 million. Other reports place the odds closer to one in 11 million . To put this into perspective, you are far more likely to be struck by lightning or attacked by a shark than you are to die in a plane crash. And there are even more common things that kill decidedly more frequently, including the flu . Traveling by car is 100 times more deadly than hopping on a plane. Not to mention, statistically, it's never been safer to fly . Perhaps this helps explain why we become so captivated by plane crashes when they do occur; they're just so incredibly rare. At the same time, media coverage of these sorts of events is undeniably excessive and hyperbolic. This trend is driven by a desire for increased viewership and profits. Does this say more about the media or more about us? It's a two-way street: Major news networks consistently report on tragedies because they know the public will pay attention. In 2014, plane crashes often dominated the news. From the mysterious disappearance of MH370 to the tragic crash of Air Asia Flight 8501 in December, there were eight fatal plane crashes over the course of the year. In total, commercial airline accidents killed 992 people across the globe in 2014, the most since 2005, Vice reports . But if you look at data surrounding airplane crashes in a broader sense, they have decreased exponentially over time, as highlighted by the Guardian . And at this point last year, there had already been 33 plane crashes . As of the Germanwings crash, the number for 2015 stands at 17 . It's also very telling that in 2014, airplane crashes received 43 percent more media attention than the 1.24 million ground traffic fatalities that occur across the world every year, as noted by the Washington Post. Interestingly, research has shown that the habitual coverage of plane crashes hasn't necessarily served to increase fears of flying , but it certainly hasn't helped deter them, either . Aviophobia, or the fear of flying, affects around 6.5 percent of the population, ABC news reports . A survey from Chapman University suggests that 43 percent of people have at least some fear of flying, and around 9 percent are so afraid they won't even step foot on a plane. The fear is so ubiquitous there's even an iPhone app called "Am I Going Down?," which helps calculate how likely it is your flight will crash. Thankfully, it usually helps reveal how low the probability is: With that said, none of this information will serve to comfort the loved ones of those who died on the Germanwings flight. Perhaps they would find some relief, however, if they weren't inundated with images of the place those closest to them perished. Should there be a discussion surrounding why this plane crashed? Absolutely. But that doesn't require 24/7 coverage of the crash site. At any given moment over the course of the next 24 hours, people will die from poverty, famine, disease, war and other forms of abhorrent violence. Simultaneously, we face the ongoing effects of climate change and inequality. Perhaps we should refocus our obsession onto these kinds of issues. It would be nice to live in a world where issues are granted attention based on their everyday impact and imminence, rather than their potential to generate profits in correlation with the whims of a fickle public. Maybe that's just wishful thinking, but it's certainly still something to think about.

August 2, 2017    Edited by   Ben Bowman                               Share                                                    Since Wilbur and Orville Wright first took to the skies in 1903, virtually everyone who has ridden in a plane has considered what might happen if the thing falls out of the sky. What are the odds of surviving a plane crash? Although more than 40 percent of passengers report fear of being involved in a plane crash, the odds are in our favor. Statistically speaking, a person would have to take a flight every day for 55,000 years before encountering a fatal accident. You are literally more likely to be killed by a falling coconut.                                          So You're Sayin' There's a Chance         In 2016, 325 people died in 19 airplane crashes worldwide. That might seem like a lot, but more than 2,500 left-handed people are killed every year from using equipment meant for right-handed people. Despite big-budget Hollywood films' depictions of plane crashes, flying is actually the safest mode of transportation. In fact, the odds of a plane crash are one for every 1.2 million flights, with odds of dying one in 11 million. Your chances of dying in a car or traffic accident are one in 5,000. Even if you're reading this on an airplane while you're rocketing toward the ground, your odds of surviving are quite good. Among passengers aboard crashed planes, 95.7 percent survive. And according to the National Transportation Safety Board, even passengers of the most devastating airplane crashes survive at a rate of 76 percent. Despite its safety, air travel malfunctions can cause passenger distress, and on rare occasion, result in a crash. So what can you do to prepare yourself, if anything? What boosts our odds for survival? And what happens when a plane actually does crash? Buckle in for these videos: a worst-case scenario survival guide.

Brianna Hansen   Brianna Hansen  May 23, 2016                              17726  views                             17726  views          comments             With the recent disappearance of EgyptAir flight 804, the
fear of flying has reawakened within many Americans. With stories of vanishing planes in mind, Americans may find themselves wondering if something like that could happen to them. Aviophobia, or the fear of flying, affects roughly 20 million people worldwide, and is a very understandable fear. The idea of being left helpless in an
emergency situation that occurs 30,000 feet above the ground is terrifying. When you decide to board a
plane, you lose control over your fate. If an accident did strike, you would have
no way to help yourself or to escape the situation! Very scary stuff to think about. However, to keep things in perspective, your chances of being in a plane
crash are extremely low, 1 in 11 million , to be exact. The odds of experiencing
one of the following are much more likely. 1. Being born with an extra finger or toe 1 in 500. 2. Becoming President of the United States 1 in 10 million. ( I'll admit that your chances are slim, but it is still more likely than dying in a plane crash.) 3. Getting killed from a meteorite 1 in 700,000. 4. Giving birth to conjoined twins 1 in 200,000. 5.  Winning an Oscar 1 in 11,500. 6. Dying from a bee sting 1 in 79,842. 7. Winning an Olympic gold medal 1 in 662,000. (Assuming you can qualify for the Olympics first…) 8. Dying from a flesh-eating bacteria 1 in a million. 9. Drowning in your bathtub 1 in 840,000. 10.  Dating a millionaire 1 in 215. (Might just drop out of college and play the odds on this one.) 11. Getting murdered 1 in 18,000. 12. Getting killed by a bear at Yellowstone National Park 1 in 2.1 million. 13. Dating a supermodel 1 in 88,000. 14. Writing a New York Times bestseller 1 in 220. 15. Having your ID stolen 1 in 465. 16. Dying in a tornado 1 in 60,000. 17. Getting poisoned 1 in 1,400. 18. Dying in a skydiving accident 1 in 100,000. 19. Becoming a nudist 1 in 6,000. 20. Meeting someone who speaks Cherokee 1 in 15,000. 21. Living to 100 years old 1 in 3.

Allison Music   Allison Music  Apr 10, 2018                             19  views                             19  views          comments         Over spring break, I traveled to the beautiful country of Denmark. While I have traveled to other countries, none of them have been as different as Denmark. Here are a list of things that I noticed were different in the United States. 1. Everything is so much more expensive. I've already talked about this a little in a previous article I have written, but when I say this place is expensive, I mean it. A bottle of water in America is around $1.50 to $2.00. I bought a bottle of water in Denmark and it was upwards to $5.00. If you are planning a trip to Denmark, make sure to budget accordingly. Make sure you figure out what you want to spend your money on. I suggest getting an Airbnb and grocery shopping for breakfasts, lunches, or dinners. Eating in restaurants will add up really quickly. Try putting that money towards museums and other entertainment. Oh, also, public transportation is amazing, but also very, very expensive. Try to use the train as little as possible. Maybe rent a car or a bike, if you're just planning on staying in Copenhagen. But, if you are traveling around the country, consider a bus. Gas prices are, you guessed it, way more expensive in Denmark. Do your research about the cheapest ways to get around, depending on the cities or towns you'd like to visit. 2. The people are friendly, but not in the way you're used to. Danish people get a horrible reputation. If you have read anything about the Danes, you've probably read they are rude and unfriendly. That is the furthest from the truth. The Danes are so willing to help and will never give you the cold shoulder. However, do not expect the overly friendly type of people you'd find in America. They are willing to give you directions and help you out if you're confused, but you must approach them first. They do not talk to strangers first but will have no problem answering a question. Just don't small talk or ask them anything too personal. They like their privacy. Also, most of the Danes speak excellent English, so there is no trouble there. 3. The food is... interesting. I didn't hate the food. I actually liked the food a lot more than the food in Ireland, but it is not Italian cuisine. A lot of fish, egg, and mayo. Oh, and hotdogs. Don't be afraid to try it. Trust me, it is not as bad as it looks. I had a burger with what is called "red salad," which is just basically cranberries. Yes, you heard right. A burger with cranberries. Also, there was no beef on this burger. It was a type of slimy pork. It wasn't the best thing I have ever had, but it was an experience nevertheless. If you ever visit, you have to try the open faced sandwiches! The Danes swear by them. 4. Teenagers are allowed to drink and they are allowed to drink on the streets. The drinking age in Denmark is 15. Which means you'll get to see teenagers running around with beer cans just on the street. Denmark doesn't have a law against drinking in public, so it is completely legal and normal. Don't get too freaked out. I was in Aalborg and saw a group of people playing a drinking game right in a public park. You don't have to join the trend, but just try to act as normal as possible around it. The Danes think it's rude if you stare or are too judgmental. 5. Bikes are everywhere. In any of the major cities: Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg, etc, you will see more bikes than cars. So much so, there is a specific bike lane for bikers. It is the size of a road. Biking is the cheapest and fastest way to get around in Denmark. Plus, everyone really does care about the environment. Bikes has just become the most used form of transportation. When in Copenhagen, rent a bike. It is the best way to see the city. Remember to look for bikes too! They go faster than the cars and will not be happy about you walking in the bike lane. It is not a sidewalk. 6. Denmark is so safe. I'm not saying America isn't safe, but what I am saying, is people in Denmark leave their babies outside in a stroller while they are in a restaurant and this is normal. Their baby. Outside. And they aren't worried about someone kidnapping them. That is how safe this place is. Story time: I lost my wallet while I was in Aarhus. I got a call from Kent State the next day saying someone had found it and wanted to return in. A Dane literally contacted Kent State after seeing my flashcard wanting to return my wallet, which had cash and my credit cards in it. When I got it back, everything was still inside. Including old receipts. When I say this place is safe, I mean it's safe. Denmark is such a beautiful country and if you ever have the chance, visit. It's worth the many pennies.

Jacob Mitchener   Jacob Mitchener  Apr 9, 2018                             216  views                             216  views          comments         A beautiful and unique city known for everything ranging from its rich history to its active nightlife, Prague is a gem in the heart of the Czech Republic that cannot be missed. Located in the northwest of the Czech Republic, Prague has a beauty that can only be understood by traveling to the city itself. Before starting my trip to Europe, I asked the advice of several other travelers about which destinations they recommend that I travel to. High on the list of many of these travelers was Prague. With so many recommendations, I simply had to visit. But what makes this city such a favorite among both travelers and its inhabitants? To start with, I found the people of the Czech Republic to be very kind to their visitors; they wanted to share the country that they love so much with anyone who is willing to take the time to visit. As far as activities go, exploring Prague without a map was one of my favorite experiences in the city. The day I arrived, I decided to wander around in search of food. In the process, I was able to get a glimpse of some of the famous architecture around the city, as well as some of its most iconic sights. After returning to my hostel, I was able to do some research into the history of these locations while also planning out the places I wanted to spend more time with. As far as specific attractions go, Prague is a perfect city to visit no matter your time frame. With that being said, a few of the most prominent and worthwhile attractions include the Charles Bridge, all of Old Town, Wenceslas Square, Petrin Hills, and Prague Castle. The main sights can be seen in a tour around the city in a day (which requires a ton of walking), but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t spend any more time there. Now let’s pretend you have just arrived in Prague and you are eager to see everything you can in just one walking journey. Doing this, I would suggest starting in Wenceslas Square and walking down the slope towards Old Town. A walk through Old Town takes you through the picturesque streets of Prague, while also allowing you to visit the Astronomical Tower, the Old Town Square, and St. Nicolas’ Church; all of which are well worth it if you find yourself in Prague. After seeing these iconic sights, wandering towards the Jewish Quarter of the city provides an opportunity to learn some of the history of the city through the years. From there, walk towards the river to see the concert hall known as Rudolfinum while listening to music written by Czech composers that you might not recognize by name, but you will recognize by their music. Walk along the Vltava River towards the Charles Bridge where you should take your time to take in the atmosphere and the unique architecture of the bridge as well as the views of Old Town and Prague Castle as they face off across the river. This walk brings you to the other side of the river where you can see the somewhat surprising Lennon Wall as well as taking a trip to Prague Castle. This walking trip provides an opportunity to see most major sights in Prague. Like with any city, it is possible to go into more detail if you so desire, and Prague is a city that deserves that extra attention. There are museums and historical sites littered throughout the city, and they are not hard to find. I visited the National Technical Museum in a quieter part of the city and I was blown away by the size and level of detail that the museum provided. Anyone with enough interest could spend a full day exploring every detail. In addition to that, the Jewish museum in the Jewish Quarter is well known and has the reputation of being very good, but I did not have the time to visit it, unfortunately. The Prague Castle allows for entry that is free of charge, but a ticket is required to visit some parts of the complex. Purchase of this ticket depends on the level of detail you wish to go into, and the amount of time you have to spend there. The activity that I highly recommend is taking a trip to the Petrin Hills where you can buy a ticket to ascend Petrin Tower where the views of the city are simply breathtaking. These examples stand as just a few options for ideas on how to make your trip to Prague as complete as you can want. After taking a walk around the city to see all of the sights, taking the public transportation provides for a welcome rest from all of the walking. The transportation is cheap and cost is based on time which makes it perfect for travelers who want unlimited travel for just a few days. As far as additional public transportation goes, taxis can be found throughout the city, but be sure to find a good price. In many instances, getting an Uber will be far more convenient and allow for the best possible price. The Czech Republic is a beautiful country and its capital city is the culmination of the country’s beauty. Prague is a city that should be on every traveler’s list for its uniqueness, its culture, and its people.

Photographer: Gill Allen/Bloomberg News      What are the chances of surviving in a plane crash? originally appeared on Quora : the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world .  Answer by Tom Farrier , Retired USAF rescue helicopter pilot; current aviation safety contractor (UAS), on Quora :  Ignore Hollywood. Aircraft involved in crashes are safer than at any time in history, thanks to decades of experience, research, and safety enhancements. According to Aviation Safety Network , in 2016 there were about one hundred and sixty three aviation “accidents” worldwide, including those involving business jets and military transports as well as jet and propeller airliners. A grand total of twenty-four resulted in fatalities, meaning only about 15% of all accidents in this grouping — which themselves are extremely rare events — actually resulted in lives being lost.    (FYI, only five of the fatal 2016 accidents were in the U.S, and none involved a major U.S. air carrier.)  Consider four possible outcomes to any crash:   You survive a survivable accident;  You survive a non-survivable accident;   You don’t survive a survivable accident; or  You don’t survive a non-survivable accident.   So, what the heck is a “survivable accident,” anyway? Well, to synthesize a couple of different takes on the subject, most in the aviation safety business (as well as those interested in other types of vehicle safety), look for three conditions:   The forces encountered by human occupants were within the limits of human tolerance;  The structure surrounding occupants remains substantially intact, maintaining an uncompromised volume around them; and  The post-crash environment does not present an immediate threat to occupants or rescuers.   In practical terms, this means directing forces away from people, slowing the onset of those that can’t be re-directed, preventing internal structures from failing in such a way as to stuck into the area where the carbon-based life forms are, and keeping the fire, smoke and fumes from easily starting or readily spreading. On this basis, you can see that a smoking hole in the ground is non-survivable, and there’s always a possibility that a small number of people don’t get the full benefit of protections that rendered the overall accident to be considered “survivable.” But, there are many, many examples to the contrary in events classified as “accidents” due to property damage and/or major injuries experienced in them.  In February of 2001, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board released the results of a comprehensive review of air carrier safety. They noted, “Fatal accidents such as TWA flight 800, ValuJet flight 592, and EgyptAir 990 receive extensive media coverage. Nonfatal accidents, however, often receive little coverage. As a result, the public may perceive that most air carrier accidents are not survivable. In fact, the Board's study shows that since 1983, more than 95% of the passengers survived.” (That includes accident where, given the criteria above, the accident itself should have been considered “non-survivable.)  A large contributor to this record goes to the many improvements the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration required of air carriers over time. These included:   Improved seat cushions with reduced flammability.  Floor proximity emergency escape path marking.  Lavatory smoke detectors.  Lavatory fire extinguishers.  Halon fire extinguishers.  Improved interior materials.  Cargo compartment liners.  Cargo compartment fire detection/suppression.  Thermal/acoustic insulation.  16G seats.  Improved access to certain types of exits.   (These are expanded upon in a graphic available at FAA Fact Sheet: Improvements to Aircraft Survivability ).  If you keep passengers properly restrained until the noise dies down and the movement stops, you reduce the likelihood of a fire starting in the first place, you delay its propagation, and you make the by-products of burning stuff less toxic, you have a much better chance of keeping everybody alive.  This was Air France 358, following a landing that went bad at Toronto-Pearson International Airport in 2005:  (Photo: CBS.com )   (Photo: blogto.com )  Everybody lived.  This was Asiana Airlines 214, which hit the sea wall in front of the runway touchdown zone on short final to San Francisco International on July 6, 2013:  (Photo: KTVU.com )  People were ejected from this aircraft during its post-impact tumble and break-up, but two of the only three people who died were accidentally struck by first responders in the confusion. There were many significant injuries suffered by the crew and passengers, but the aircraft did what it was supposed to do under extreme conditions — it protected its occupants as well as it possibly could, and it didn’t allow fire to spread until there was time to get everyone evacuated.  Bottom line: accidents are rare; when they happen, fatalities are that much rarer thanks to a lot of hard work and investment in making planes as safe as possible.

GULLIVER will soon fly from Heathrow to Milan on a British Airways Airbus A319. That flight has a one-in-4.8m chance of crashing. Shortly after he is jetting from Heathrow to JFK on a Virgin-operated A330. Chance of crashing? One in 5.4m. That means that he could apparently expect to fly on the route for 14,716 years before plummeting into the Atlantic.

The Economist explains a day ago See more These figures come courtesy of “Am I Going Down?”, a recently released iPhone app that claims to calculate the odds of a disaster on a particular flight. Users input three variables: the departure and arrival airports, the airline, and the type of plane used. The app's maker hasn't responded to requests to give a little more detail of its methodology, but one presumes that it is a simple weighting of the proportion of crashes associated with each of those variables in the past. There are, of course, countless holes in such a simplistic approach. How does one decide the relative importance of the make of plane, airline or airport? Is past performance really an indicator of future performance? Does, for example, a Malaysia Airlines flight being shot out of the sky by Russian separatists make this event any more likely to happen again in the future? Is the calculation based on miles flown or the number of journeys? (As the take-off is the most dangerous phase of a flight, a 10,000 mile flight isn't twice as risky as a 5,000 mile one.) What about other important variables, such as the weather? The 14,716 years figure caused us a bit of confusion. But reader guest-isjswsa jumped in on the comments thread to shed some light on it. It’s the average length of time people will fly before crashing, if lots and lots of them do it every day. An alternative way of expressing it would be to say that if you were to arrange to fly this route every day for the next 10,210 years, your chance of dying would be 50%. And if you wanted to book enough flights to be almost certain of crashing, you reach a 99% probability at 67,833 years of daily flights. (For those interested in the maths, there is more here .) But perhaps this is a bit churlish. The idea behind the app is laudable, if not mathematically sound. Nic Johns, its creator, says he wants to reassure nervous flyers that they are all but guaranteed to reach their destination in one piece. Of course, we all know this deep down. In real terms, it makes no difference if the chance of crashing is one in 1m or one in 9m; the likelihood is so small as to make the difference irrelevant. But there is a special place in our psyches for the fear of big, unlikely catastrophes. According to David Ropeik , author of " How Risky is it, Really? ", the deadliest plane crash in history occurred in 1977 in Tenerife when 583 people were killed after two jumbos collided on the runway. Yet, that many people die from heart disease in America every eight hours. As Mr Ropeik explains, air crashes are considered catastrophes while heart attacks are not, because they fulfil three criteria: A catastrophe has to be big, it has to happen all at once, and something about it has to be calamitous—disastrous—really bad. A plane crash certainly qualifies. It kills a lot of people all at once, in one place, and in a really horrific way. But heart disease [...] meets only one of those criteria. As awful as heart disease and stroke and diabetes are, they don't kill people in such vividly awful ways as plane crashes. It bears repeating just how rare such deaths in the air are. Safety statistics collated by IATA , an airline association, show that in 2013 more than 3 billion people flew on commercial aircraft. During that time there were 81 accidents and 210 fatalities. What is more, this figure has been falling for years (although the two recent Malaysia Airlines disasters will mean a blip when the 2014 figures are released). By way of comparison, the World Health Organisation says there were over 1.2m road traffic deaths around the world in 2010 . It is the leading cause of death among 15-29 year olds. The University of Oxford calculates that in 2006, Brits had odds of one in 36,512 of dying in a motor accident and one in 3.5m dying in a plane crash. Of course, many more people drive than fly; hence it is not easy to compare the two types of travel in a meaningful way. It is not known how many car journeys people take around the world, but even if it was, one would have to decide whether to compare the number of discrete trips or the overall distance travelled (that is an important distinction because if you were travelling from London to Edinburgh, for example, you might reasonably choose between driving and flying). Suffice to say what we all know: the fear of flying is incommensurate with its risk. And, as this chart from an Economist  piece last year highlights, that’s before we compare it to the really dangerous modes of transport, like using stairs.

New app analyzes odds of your flight crashing By Karla Cripps , CNN Updated 9:49 AM ET, Fri January 23, 2015 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. New app "Am I Going Down?" uses aviation statistics to analyze the odds a flight will crash. Story highlights Am I Going Down? app is aimed at people who suffer from a fear of flying Creator says his app will show nervous fliers that air travel is typically very low risk (CNN) If you're flying on a Boeing 777 Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to Los Angeles on any given day, there's a one in 4,068,434 chance that your plane will crash. At least that's what a new app called "Am I Going Down?" says. That means if you take that flight every day for the next 11,146 years, you'll be unlikely to experience an incident. Created by London-based company Vanilla Pixel, the app uses real flight statistics to analyze flight safety, Developer Nic Johns says it's geared toward those who are uneasy about air travel. Read More "The initial inspiration comes from my co-founder and wife, Julie, who for many years has suffered from a fear of flying," says Johns. "In developing 'Am I Going Down?' I wanted to present the fact that the vast majority of flights are incredibly low risk. Our app is meant as tool to help reassure fearful fliers." Johns says more than 10 million routes have been assessed using data from sources such as the Geneva-based Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives, the United States National Transportation Safety Board and the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization. "For my analysis I only include crashes where there was at least one passenger fatality -- which is the relevant stat for those with a fear of flying," says Johns. "I then incorporate the volume of flights, weighted to the most recent 10 years, to provide the final 'one in a million' statistics." Bad timing? Johns admits the timing of the release of the app was awkward, given that it came out just days after AirAsia flight QZ8501 went down. The developer says it was an unfortunate coincidence. "I actually developed the app in February 2014, shortly before the Malaysia Airlines MH370 disappearance," says Johns. "Due to that I postponed the release and worked on a few other things, then finalized and submitted it to Apple in December. The AirAsia QZ8501 flight crashed two weeks later. "There have been a few raised eyebrows but most people know it was a coincidence." The "Am I Going Down?" app, now available in iTunes, costs $0.99. It's only available on Apple at the moment though if the app is successful, an Android version is a possibility for the future, says Johns. "The positive response from anxious fliers has been amazing, really encouraging," says Johns.

They raise the question: Why do some passengers survive plane crashes and others tragically don't? JUST WATCHED Seat belts on planes: Pros and cons Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Seat belts on planes: Pros and cons  02:54 Some of those who lived through Wednesday's crash credited their survival to seat belts and seating choices , yet much of surviving a disaster is pure chance. Remarkable stories of plane crash survival Some of the survival game involves factors passengers largely can't control, like the weather, flight crew skills, the design of airline seats and the construction, maintenance and age of the plane. But passengers themselves can do a lot to improve their chances of survival simply by making smart choices and being informed. Read More Engine problems reported before TransAsia crash Here are a few ideas to keep in mind: 1. Seat choice? Experts differ Have you heard of the "five-row rule"? This refers to the idea that if you're sitting within five rows of an emergency exit, you have a statistically better chance of surviving a crash. A 2011 study by University of Greenwich professor Ed Galea supports this theory . But an expert at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration disagrees. "There really isn't a 'safest seat' on the plane," said Cynthia Corbett, an FAA research scientist who specializes in airplane cabin safety. "It really kind of depends on the emergency you're going to have. Different parts of the plane can be effected in different ways, depending on what the event is. Just reinforce your own propensity for survival, by knowing how to get where you need to go. If your first choice in exits is blocked, then you should have a second choice." 2. Listen to the safety talk. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's boring. It's repetitive. But it could save your life! The presentation -- by video or by flight attendants -- explaining what to do in case the plane goes down offers key information like: How do I get out? How do I escape if I can't see? Where's my flotation device? 3. Read the safety card. You know that safety card in the pocket of the seat in front of you? Think of it as a map leading you toward survival. Read it. It shows how the plane you're on will be evacuated. Think about the dozens -- or even hundreds -- of fellow passengers who will need to get off the plane ASAP. It helps to know what to expect. Experts: Be aware of your surroundings during takeoffs and landings -- the most critical part of every flight. You may have to slide down an inflatable ramp. You may have to get in an inflatable boat. The card shows you how it all works. 4. Know how to brace. Do you? Have you ever tried it? Sometimes, passengers have only seconds to react in an emergency. If aircraft crew members are commanding passengers to assume the brace position, it helps to know in advance what they're talking about. The safety talk and card will help you. 5. Be aware of the exits. Plan your escape. Visualize how you -- and perhaps children you're traveling with -- are going to get out of the plane. During some emergencies, it may be impossible to see the nearest exit. Before departure, Corbett recommends counting armrests from your seat to the closest way out. "If you have to feel your way along the aisle and count [seats to get to the nearest exit], the best way to do that is along the armrests, because the frame of the seat is the most stable part," Corbett said. "If you're leaning down to hold the armrests, then that also gets you kind of crouched over enough to be below any smoke that might accumulate from any kind of a fire." 6. Move quickly. You have 90 seconds to get out of the plane after a crash, according to Ben Sherwood, author of the New York Times bestseller "The Survivor's Club." Many passengers in plane crashes survive the initial impact. It's what happens next that often kills them. This includes fire, smoke and sometimes water.  Sherwood advises using 90 seconds as a time frame for escaping. 7. Be aware during takeoffs and landings. Statistics show that most crashes occur in the minutes surrounding takeoffs and landings. So it stands to reason that passengers who want to increase their chances of survival should be especially aware of what's going on at that time. Drinking alcoholic beverages before departure or arrival could impair your response in a crisis. And sleeping during these times is probably not the best option if you're looking to increase survivability. "Don't have your shoes off," said Corbett. "Don't have your sleeping mask on. Don't have your ear buds in. Be familiar with what's going on and pay attention. It's only a matter of a few minutes." 8. Stay fit. This may go without saying, but the fitter you are, the better your chances of survival. Overweight or slower-moving passengers obviously could be at a disadvantage during an emergency evacuation. 9. Avoid airlines with poor safety records. Statistics show that we are living in the safest era in the history of commercial aviation. Nonetheless, every airline has a safety record, and those records are tracked. Various groups offer rankings for airline safety . 10. Dress for quick movement No high heels or flip-flops. Avoid short pants. Dress for the possibility that you might have to pass quickly through wreckage -- or even run away from the plane.

Quora Ask New Question Sign In  Aviation What are the chances for an airplane to crash? Update Cancel Answer Wiki 2 Answers   Chris Lee , Aerospace Engineer, involved in design of Part 25 aircraft Answered Mar 3, 2014 As Tim Morgan mentions, scheduled airlines in Western countries are the safest of all forms of high speed travel (by high-speed, I mean anything as fast as a car or faster). It is remarkable when you think of the approximately 18 million flight hours flown by part 121 carriers (scheduled commercial operations) and realize that the total number of fatal accidents each year is almost always between zero and two. If we average the number of fatal accidents over a 10 year period in the 2000's, we get a fatal accident rate of about 0.008 per 100,000 flight hours. That said, not all of aviation experiences such low accident rates. General aviation, which consists of all forms of aviation that do not involve some form of transport for hire (i.e. the segment you might equate to private pilots), necessarily has a much higher accident rate. This is because the standards vary a lot more when you're talking about regular people doing personal flying. You have a lot of pilots with varying degrees of experience, judgment, and discipline, who rarely have a second-in-command pilot. You also have aircraft with varying degrees of upkeep, and there are so many aircraft that no agency could possibly keep an eagle eye on the maintenance practices involved in all of them. I do want to make it clear, however, that system or engine failure is by no means the main reason for fatal accidents. I believe that this what most people assume when they are talking about the likelihood of a crash. But mechanical failure is usually only responsible for 12 to 14% of all fatal accidents. What follows is that 70 to 80% of all general aviation accidents have nothing to do with the safety of the equipment. The largest majority of accidents occur during low-level operations, where things mainly come in the form of stall/spin accidents. For low time pilots, failure to maintain airspeed during something like a base to final turn can have dire consequences. Weather or night flying can also lead to increased susceptibility to these types of accidents, and few recent high-profile airline accidents bear this out. With a lot of the newer systems and instrumentation, quite a number of accidents have involved a disconnect between the system and the pilot, and is spurring much discussion over the future direction of cockpit systems and the types of automation and related training practices required to ensure further improvement of safety. Unfortunately, what is also true of general aviation accidents is that they sometimes include pilots who exhibit poor judgment. Too often, I hear reports of a crash because the pilot was needlessly attempting to do something stupid and put himself in a situation where his skills ran out. Good pilots don't intentionally put themselves in places where the situation can overwhelm their abilities. The same principle applies to judgment when it comes to the weather, and you do hear sad stories of people who get ahead of themselves when it comes to deciding when to stay on the ground. General aviation as a whole, has an accident rate in the region of 1.1 fatal accidents per 100,000 flying hours. Flight instruction generally tends to be much safer, at less than 0.5 fatal accidents per 100,000 flying hours. I usually don't like to compare flying in private aircraft to driving an automobile because of the differences in speeds and distances traveled for a given time period. The nature of accidents is also different; you are not so much at the mercy of other pilots when you fly a plane than you are in a car where most accidents are a result of contact with other traffic, often at no fault of your own. So while you might find articles out on the internet that claim higher accident rates for general aviation per million miles traveled, I think this is an apples to oranges comparison. Automobile accidents tend to be much more random, yet evenly distributed in likelihood; someone who is a careless driver could go decades without a single accident, while the opposite might be the case for an extremely responsible driver. This is not so much the case in aviation. For most people, the only exposure they have to aircraft involves the airline industry, where the discussion of likelihood of death is more or less irrelevant because of the astronomically small numbers involved. But when it comes to the small single engine propeller aircraft that most people observe floating about, yes, the probability of an accident is numerically higher, but it highly depends on the situation and the facts surrounding it. I went to an aerospace university that had literally hundreds of flight operations daily, and not once in a four-year period had there been a single injury accident during dual instruction or solo flight training. There were, however, more than a handful of fatal automobile accidents among the students. 1.1k Views · View Upvoters promoted  by Honey What are the best ways to travel the world at minimum cost?

If you fly a reputable airline 20 times a year, that means your chance of dying this year in an aircraft accident are about 1 in a million. For comparison, the odds that you will die in a car crash this year are about 1 in 6,000.
