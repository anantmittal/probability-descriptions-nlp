Thousands of people are rushing to buy lottery tickets in an attempt to win the UK’s highest ever jackpot of £57.8 million - but the chance of winning is incredibly miniscule.  After increasing the number of balls from 49 to 59 in October, the National Lottery organisers reduced the odds on anyone’s six numbers coming up from 1 in 14 million to 1 in 45 million.

Friday, April 20, 2007        What are your chances of being hit by a bus?      To highlight how dependent they might be on a key employee, businesses are often asked what they would do if that employee were run over and killed by a bus (e.g. the Bus Test ) - and the answer would point out various problems for disaster recovery and business continuity planning issues. So what are the odds of someone being killed by a bus? For the UK, we can look at the official statistics ( Department for Transport ). For 2004, there were 121 accidents involving buses and causing a death. That doesn't quite mean that 121 people were killed by being hit by a bus as it would include any accident involving a bus where any number of people died (there's a table showing that 3 bus drivers and 17 bus passengers were killed). This is expressed as a rate per 100 million vehicle kilometres of 2.3. So, on average, any one bus is involved in a fatal accident every 27 million miles of travel. So, if we assume that there were at most 121 cases of someone being killed by being hit by a bus and if we assume that everyone in the UK (60 million people) has an equal chance of this happening then the odds are something like 2 in a million (per year). Of course, anyone wandering around in China with their iPod on may have a higher chance.

              Base Zone  In general, we are all “at home with” many of the 
              risks of likelihoods in the range 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 10 million. 
              That is to say that, although when we stop to consider many of these 
              risks, we recognize that they are potentially lethal and indeed 
              could affect people such as ourselves, we do not change our behavior 
              around to avoid them. It is as if we recognize that there are just 
              too many possible risks that might kill each one of us in our daily 
              lives that we just adopt common sense and carry on living our lives.  Sadly, but in truth, no one can be sure that some unforeseen combination 
              of events won’t cause them a major injury or even death any 
              day.  Fatalists may take the attitude “When my number comes up, 
              there’s nothing I can do about.”  Pragmatists, on the other hand, recognize that building personal resiliency factors 
              can provide a series of protective and restorative factors that 
              can help individuals bounce back whatever the particular harm that 
              may befall them.   Paling’s Perspectives on Comparing 
              Risks  There is a lot of rubbish talked about not comparing risks. However, 
              we all do it whether we are conscious of it or not. Indeed that 
              is how the human sense organs seem to work (by making logarithmic 
              comparisons). That is also the way that people naturally think and 
              talk about risks- as evidenced by virtually all media reports.  However, many people who work in the field of risk communication 
              are obsessively against comparing any new risk with another risk 
              for fear that it could be deceptive. In individual cases, that is 
              certainly a possibility (for many good reasons). But no one seems 
              to be giving any reason why we should not compare some new, unfamiliar 
              risk with the range of risks that we are all at home with in our 
              daily lives. When you use that broad band of likelihoods for potentially 
              fatal risks (shown in green on the scale), it becomes very clear 
              that some high profile worries are of such low probabilities that 
              logically society might do better to devote its resources to other 
              more routine risks that are harming or even killing many more people 
              in our society  Paling’s Perspectives on Informed 
              Consent  There is a chasm of difference between the realities and practicalities 
              of how many risks a surgeon, say, should reasonably be expected 
              to tell his patient and what the theory of the process might expect. 
              The ethical imperative of informing patients is excellent but the 
              most recent ethical guidelines suggests that the threshold of what 
              risks should be mentioned should be anything “more than minimal 
              risk” (Note they immediately seek to define a threshold by 
              comparing risks!) However the sorts of risks that ethicists suggest should be the 
              baseline for “minimal” were “driving to work, 
              crossing a street, getting a blood test.” These represent 
              odds far less than 1 in a million and as such would mean that a 
              surgeon might be expected to deliver a list of hundreds of risks. 
              His would be harmful to the patients’ state of mind as well 
              as being impracticable.  Perhaps a new threshold of a reasonable level of reportable risk 
              should be defined somewhere in the “home base zone”(above).  This would have the benefit of being practical as well as ethical.      Back to Example Risk Perspective Scale | Build Your Own Risk Perspective Scale      [ Return to start new Visual Aid ]

We've got the odds    Share    Tweet    Pin    Share    Tumble            Combined comments & shares on social media          You hear people throwing out random facts all the time, preaching them as truth. You know what we're talking about. We're willing to bet you've heard, "You're more likely to die driving to work than to be eaten by a shark," like a million times.  But it got us wondering: How many of these statistical musings are actually true? So we did a little research to get the real lowdown on the odds.  More:  I'm applying to be one of the first people on Mars  Just note you that a number of factors affect the real odds of something, especially your specific behavior. Someone who surfs everyday has a greater likelihood of being attacked by a shark than someone who never goes into the water, for instance. That being said, we rounded up some interesting general stats.  1. Odds of being diagnosed with cancer — 1 in 2 for men, 1 in 3 for women  A 50 percent chance of getting cancer in your lifetime is pretty alarming, but don't freak out just yet.  " The numbers reflect a few things : First, people are living longer, and advancing age is a significant risk factor for cancer," Len Lichtenfeld, M.D., deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, told Men's Health . "Also, we’re diagnosing cancer at greater rates because of technological advances in screening, such as mammography for breast cancer and PSA tests for prostate cancer."  Dr. Lichtenfeld also pointed out that cancer deaths have actually declined 20 percent since the early 1990s.  2. Odds of being a victim of a serious crime — 1 in 47 for men, 1 in 52 for women  According to crimeinamerica.net's 2016 statistics, men are more likely than women to be victims of serious crime (serious crimes include things like murder, assault, robbery and rape).  Obviously there's all kinds of factors that contribute to your own personal risk of being victimized. Check out this handy dandy little assessment to rate yours.  3. Odds of being called to “Come on down!” on The Price is Right — 1 in 36  1 in 36? Not too shabby. Given the stats on becoming a billionaire or winning the lotto, which we cover later, this is pretty good news.  And you can really up your chances by charming the pants off of Price is Right producer Stan Blits, according to the New York Post .  4. Odds of being audited by the IRS — 1 in 100  This number seems super high, but don't panic. This factors in all tax returns filed — including those filed by billionaires and huge corporations. But if you are earning a middle-class income, you don't have a whole lot to worry about.  "If you earn less than $200,000 annually and don’t attach Schedules C or E to your tax return, statistically speaking, you have a better chance of being abducted by aliens or dating Taylor Swift than being audited," says Forbes .  5. Odds of being involved in a drunk driving crash — 2 out of 3  Two out of three people will be involved in a drunk driving accident in their lifetime, according to MADD. Lower your risk by always designating a driver.  6. Odds of being born with 11 fingers or toes — 1 in 500  This means that if you follow 1,000 people on Twitter, one or two of them were probably born with an extra appendage — which is medically known as polydactyly , according to MedicineNet .  7. Odds of dying from firearm assault — 1 in 358  Your odds of being shot and killed in your lifetime are 1 in 358 , according to the National Safety Council.  8. Odds of dying in a car accident — 1 in 113  These odds , provided by the National Safety Council, are pretty scary. If you text while driving, you increase you chances by six times — the same as driving after four beers.  9. Odds of winning an Oscar — 1 in 11,500  Keep in mind, though, your odds are zero if you don't try. However, the odds of becoming a movie star are 1 in 1,505,000 , according to U.S. News . Not exactly encouraging.  10. Odds of finding a pearl in an oyster — 1 in 12,000  Given how hard it is to shuck an oyster, we hardly think it’s worth it.  11. Odds of being drafted by the NBA — 1 in 6,864,000  Don't mean to put a damper on your dreams, but yikes. Statistics presented by thesportdigest.com are pretty bleak .  12. Odds of going blind after laser eye surgery — 1 in 5 million  According to London Vision Clinic, if you choose a good surgeon your chances of going blind are extremely slim .  13. Odds of being injured by a toilet — 1 in 10,000  Kind of surprised that this stat (provided by London Vision Clinic) is so high. Be careful out there, people.  14. Odds of dying in an airplane crash — 1 in 9,737  Not too bad as compared to cars... or motorcycles, on which you have a 1 in 948 chance of dying, according to the National Safety Council.  15. Odds of getting killed by fireworks — 1 in 340,733  Odds by being killed by fireworks aren't super high, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History, but it does happen. And, as you can imagine, most of those deaths occur on the Fourth of July.  16. Odds of being struck and killed by lightening — 1 in 174,426  It's true, there's not a whole lot of people that get struck by lightening, according to the National Safety Council — but it does happen. Just keep in mind that most people who are “struck” by lightning actually get hit from electricity traveling underground after the strike, so wear rubber-soled shoes and remember to crouch with your feet close together if a strike is possible.  17. Odds of becoming a billionaire — Pretty much none  Forbes says there's now 1,426 billionaires out there running amok , and roughly 7 billion people on the planet. You do the math.  18. Odds of becoming President of the U.S. — 1 in 10 million  And, yet, somehow Donald Trump beat the odds .  19. Odds of getting attacked by a shark — 1 in 11.5 million  Shark attacks get all kinds of media attention, but turns out they hardly ever happen , according to the University of Florida's 2010 International Shark Attack File, via Seeker . You're actually much more likely to die as a result of coming into contact with hornets, wasps or bees (1 in 64,706) than even being bitten by a shark, according to the National Safety Council.  20. Odds of winning $1 million in the McDonald’s Monopoly game — 1 in 513,591,720  Um, yeah, according to research done by StarPulse , you're gonna have to eat a whole lotta Mickey D's to win that money.  21. Odds of winning the Powerball jackpot — 1 in 175,223,510  Image: Giphy At least you can still be president, right?  More:  20 Interesting sex facts  Before you go, check out our slideshow below.

Since my diagnosis in 1989, I have consumed approximately 60,000 pills, had at least 150 blood draws, been hospitalized twice, lost more T-cells than most healthy people start off with, dipped into psychotic dementia , lost my family to AIDS, gone broke from the disease, been forced to hang out with the medical establishment, lost my hair and my modesty (every doctor in L.A. has seen me naked!), buried good friends, lost my emotions, received 300 injections, lost a year in down days due to fatigue and diarrhea , shit my pants about 20 times, had myself electrocuted with lightening in a box for a year, smeared myself with bee venom, seen my body turn into a troll doll, got an impressive collection of healing crystals from well-meaning friends, and received my official AIDS diagnosis on January 1, 1993. I joined the media circus by appearing on TV and in printed articles, doing work for AIDS organizations, turning myself into an AIDS pet for the do-gooders, and doing speaking engagements. I've written an AIDS play, had a TV movie made, and demonstrated on the streets with ACT UP, all while waiting for my first OI to arrive. Okay, enough self-pity. We all go through these things, right? I can live with it. Not gladly, but somehow we cope. Here is where I draw the line! In the last four years I have been tormented by literally thousands of uninfected people saying "Well, we all have to deal with death. I could be hit by a bus tomorrow." Advertisement At first, when I had the consciousness of an ant, I would nod my head and agree. Yes, you're right! No one gets off this planet alive. After a while though, I realized that the concept of being hit by a bus did nothing to comfort me personally. In fact, as I thought about it, I realized I didn't know one single person who was ever actually hit by a bus. Over 300,000 people dead from AIDS in the U.S. alone, and not one of them got hit by a bus! Yet people insist that they could get hit by a bus at any second. With so many people getting hit by busses, you have to wonder about the accident rate of bus drivers. Why doesn't the DMV do something about this outbreak of manslaughter? Is this some new mass psychosis, like the post office employees phenomena? Is running people down on the street part of their job description? Or are bus drivers innocent? Will we soon see bus drivers on the talk show circuit bemoaning this discrimination? Will a 12 step program spring up for them? Will criminal attorneys use the "bus driver defense" to acquit hard core criminals? My own theory is that being hit by a bus has become a modern myth in the United States, much like the folk belief that alligators live in the New York City sewer system. Science has robbed us of magic in this technological twentieth century, and people do need their myths. After all, how many people would believe in 1994 that a giant bird or sea monster could arrive at any time, swoop a person up, and kill them? Alas, the collective unconscious has shifted, just like everything else. The bogeyman has been replaced by the bus driver. Let's get back to my rage, which is endlessly fascinating to me. My friend Rico and I discuss this all the time. (Rico is a hemophiliac with AIDS and has about seventeen terminal illnesses. He stays alive and active out of revenge. He's so mean that everyone hates him.) I am not fond of this plan because it would save the insurance companies and the government a lot of money, and I intend to take these two uncaring institutions down with me by living as long as I can. Since being hit by a bus has become my obsession, I have heard two rumors about this. One from my friend Rick, who swears that a negative member of his group was actually hit by a bus. I have discounted this report because Rick will say anything for a laugh. The other rumor comes from my husband, who says his friend's roommate had to fly home because his mother was hit by a bus. I discount this story too, until I can see the accident report. As unlikely as being hit by a bus is, this peculiar story remains embedded in people. It's driving me up the wall! If one more person tells me this, I swear I'm going to grab them by the scruff of their neck and throw them in front of a bus. Since the January earthquake, there are a lot more buses in Los Angeles to chose from! I am now at the point of considering a few different options. First, PWA's (people with AIDS) in a unified protest, hijack buses across America and run down as many healthy people as possible. This will allow us to make a political statement, and we can advocate for decent health care plans, housing, food, etc. for PWA's within the prison systems. We could invent a new form of terrorism and become famous, like the Chicago Seven or the Black Panthers. PWA's, throw themselves en masse, on a pre-selected day, in front of buses in every city in the U.S. After all, what do we have to lose? I am not fond of this plan because it would save the insurance companies and the government a lot of money, and I intend to take these two uncaring institutions down with me by living as long as I can. Scenario number three, is we hijack buses and run down prominent figures in the AIDS establishment, in a concerted terrorist attack. While this may provide some fleeting headlines, I'm convinced that these people would be replaced immediately with new Stepford doctors and researchers, thus maintaining the status quo. My last idea is simple, but brilliant, in my humble opinion. When it's close to the end for me, I roll myself in my wheelchair in front of a bus, while one of my trusted buddies video-tapes the event. This accomplishes a number of goals. It eliminates the six hundred dollars I'd have to pay for Dr. Kervorkian to fly from Michigan to California. My friends use the videotape, á la Rodney King, to collect from the city. I envision a couple of million dollars in settlement. I do have death on my side, not just a lifetime of headaches! The most wonderful thing about my plan is that I will have one-upped the "neggies" (uninfected people). A new mythology will displace the old. Now we can say, "NOT ONLY DID ROXY HAVE AIDS, BUT SHE WAS ALSO HIT BY A BUS!!!!" He who laughs last laughs best.

Thousands of people are rushing to buy lottery tickets in an attempt to win the UK’s highest ever jackpot of £57.8 million - but the chance of winning is incredibly miniscule.  After increasing the number of balls from 49 to 59 in October, the National Lottery organisers reduced the odds on anyone’s six numbers coming up from 1 in 14 million to 1 in 45 million.

Buying a National Lottery ticket 'could be profitable investment'  This week's National Lottery jackpot is biggest ever  National Lottery shake-up pays off as Lotto jackpot hits record £46.5    This means you are more likely to be hit by a part of a plane falling from the sky (1 in 10,000,000) than securing the life-changing jackpot.  It could be worse; you’re still more likely to win the lottery than you are of being crushed by a vending machine.  The chances of that happening are 1 in 112 million.  Here are some the depressing things that are more likely to happen to you than winning the lottery:  The odds of dying from being left-handed and using a right-handed product incorrectly is 1 in 4.4 million according to the Daily Beast .  Getty Images​  Being crushed by a meteor is considerably more likely than winning lottery, with odds of 1 in 700,000, Review Journal found.   Things falling from the sky and killing you are just generally a more likely outcome than winning the lottery. There’s a 1 in 10 million chance you’ll die from being hit by a falling plane part, according to College Times .  If that doesn’t put you off flying, this certainly will. The odds of being killed in a plane crash is 1 in 11 million according to Review Journal .  AP/Tatiana Belyakova  Getting hit by lightning is almost 4 times more likely than winning the lottery. The chances of being fatally struck is 1 in 10 million, the Mirror  claims.  Getty  You’re 45 times more likely to die from flesh eating bacteria than securing the jackpot. The odds are 1 in 1 million, the Daily Beast reports.  CHRISTIAN CHARISIUS/AFP/Getty Images  It’s not all bad news though; here are some more positive things that are also more likely than winning the jackpot:  If you think you have what it takes to be the next Tim Peake, there’s a 1 in 12 million chance you’ll become an astronaut, according to Review Journal .  NASA via Getty Images  Giving birth to identical quadruplets is also more likely than winning the lottery. College Times suggests the odds are 1 in 13 million.  Getty Images  The chance of you winning an Oscar is 1 in 11,500. That’s right, you’re more likely to win an Oscar than have a winning lottery ticket, according to Review Journal .  Getty Images  Although Leonardo DiCaprio has never won an Oscar, he has dated supermodels. The odds of you doing the same are 1 in 880,000, ABC  suggests.  ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images​  Winning an Olympic gold medal is 75 times more likely than successfully guessing all six numbers correctly. It’s a 1 in 662,000 chance according to Review Journal .  EPA  If you aren't successful winning the lottery, rest assured, any one of the above is still a more plausible outcome.

Well, that is the price the Fellows of the Royal Society put on my life. My only quibble is that they did not bother to tell me. In keeping with its policy of lofty disdain for the real world or, as some might have it, bumbling incompetence in dealing with the press, the society has just published a substantial report, Risk: Analysis, Perception and Management, without letting anyone see it.  They also buried the information on how highly they value me in an appendix tagged on to the end of 200 closely printed pages of analysis couched in the most impenetrable prose to have crossed my desk in a long time. It is a strange way both to write and to 'publicise' a report, a substantial part of which is devoted to public perception of risk and the communication of risk analysis to the wider public.  However, it is reassuring to know that the Fellows value me more highly than does the Government. Life comes cheap to John MacGregor, the Secretary of State for Transport, for his department reckons I am worth only about pounds 500,000.  My multimillionaire status is, alas, not unique to me. The society estimates that in Britain pounds 2m- pounds 3m is the value to be put on 'a statistical life'. In other words, this is the sort of money we ought to be spending on upgrading safety equipment, and otherwise diminishing hazards, if by doing so we can expect to save one life. On this measure, it would appear that my entire family - all four of us - would have to be wiped out before the Department of Transport would move to improve road safety.  The report is an update of an earlier foray into the field, published in 1983. Crucially, the society has gone beyond the narrow focus of the technocrat in assessing numerical risks and has put its toe into the waters of how the public perceives risks.  In a sense, the arithmetic - are the tanks and equipment at an oil refinery liable to explode once in a million years or more often? - is trivial. What is more important is the morality of risk. There is always inequity: if an oil refinery is built at the bottom of my garden, then my family will bear the risk (whatever it is numerically), whereas the benefit of cheaper petrol is enjoyed by the oil company and British motorists generally, few of whom are likely to be affected by any accidents at the plant.  Sadly, the society is reluctant to take on such issues. While the report contains two chapters on public issues, they are impenetrable and the society, in an extraordinary step, has included a preface distancing itself from the chapters.  This lack of nerve is highlighted by another report on risks published a week before the society's effort. Commendably, the Health and Safety Executive's report on The Tolerability of Risk from Nuclear Power Stations faces head-on the problems of explaining risk assessment in straightforward language, the ethical issues of who has to bear risks, and at what level risks may be judged intolerable. This document, too, is a second try at the subject, updating a 1988 report following recommendations from Sir Frank Layfield, the inspector at the public inquiry into the Sizewell nuclear reactor.  The HSE makes clear that while the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate can make a reasonable assessment of the risks of major nuclear accidents in the UK, it is not up to regulatory bodies to decide if the risks are outweighed by the benefits - that, the report concludes, is for Parliament and the public.  The HSE does answer the question of exploding oil tanks. The chance that Canvey Island on the Thames would suffer an accident capable of causing 1,500 casualties at a stroke is about one in 5,000 a year. In comparison, the chance of an aircraft crash similar to the recent one in Amsterdam is five times greater. It would take 20-50 modern nuclear power stations to have 'a similar chance of causing death to some hundreds of people as the installations at Canvey Island', the HSE concludes.  But the HSE's technocrats have failed to understand the special problems presented by nuclear accidents. Radiation kills people statistically by causing cancer. If 100 people are lined up at random, it is a fair bet that about 24 of them will die of 'natural' cancers. If, in some macabre experiment, all 100 were irradiated at the level likely to cause one excess death, there would be 25 deaths resulting from cancer. But it is in principle impossible to point to any one of those 25 bodies and say 'this one died from radiation'.  Statistics exist about the number of people likely to die in road accidents each year but that differs qualitatively from the case of radiation. If someone falls under the wheels of a double- decker bus, no one is in any doubt about the cause. Radiation is unique in causing death randomly and unattributively. That there should be greater public concern about radiation is neither irrational nor unscientific.  Yet the HSE has diminished the impact of radiation risks by focusing on the delay between irradiation and the development of cancer and highlighting the 'length of life lost' as a result. This means the lives of pensioners are worth less than those of the young. Indeed, the HSE gives a precise figure: the value of a pensioner appears to be 0.45 times that of a younger person.  What sort of relationship did the men who put together the HSE's analysis have with their parents? My own live within sight of the Hunterston nuclear power station in what used to be Ayrshire and I do not like the idea that, if the men from the HSE take their calculations seriously, my parents would be afforded less than half the consideration given to other residents of their village.  In this supposedly democratic society, there are no formal mechanisms whereby we can give our views on whether such risks are acceptable or intolerable. The HSE has made a good fist of explaining the issues, but some of its ideas seem perverse and worrying and must be debated more widely.

Friday, April 20, 2007        What are your chances of being hit by a bus?      To highlight how dependent they might be on a key employee, businesses are often asked what they would do if that employee were run over and killed by a bus (e.g. the Bus Test ) - and the answer would point out various problems for disaster recovery and business continuity planning issues. So what are the odds of someone being killed by a bus? For the UK, we can look at the official statistics ( Department for Transport ). For 2004, there were 121 accidents involving buses and causing a death. That doesn't quite mean that 121 people were killed by being hit by a bus as it would include any accident involving a bus where any number of people died (there's a table showing that 3 bus drivers and 17 bus passengers were killed). This is expressed as a rate per 100 million vehicle kilometres of 2.3. So, on average, any one bus is involved in a fatal accident every 27 million miles of travel. So, if we assume that there were at most 121 cases of someone being killed by being hit by a bus and if we assume that everyone in the UK (60 million people) has an equal chance of this happening then the odds are something like 2 in a million (per year). Of course, anyone wandering around in China with their iPod on may have a higher chance.

              Base Zone  In general, we are all “at home with” many of the 
              risks of likelihoods in the range 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 10 million. 
              That is to say that, although when we stop to consider many of these 
              risks, we recognize that they are potentially lethal and indeed 
              could affect people such as ourselves, we do not change our behavior 
              around to avoid them. It is as if we recognize that there are just 
              too many possible risks that might kill each one of us in our daily 
              lives that we just adopt common sense and carry on living our lives.  Sadly, but in truth, no one can be sure that some unforeseen combination 
              of events won’t cause them a major injury or even death any 
              day.  Fatalists may take the attitude “When my number comes up, 
              there’s nothing I can do about.”  Pragmatists, on the other hand, recognize that building personal resiliency factors 
              can provide a series of protective and restorative factors that 
              can help individuals bounce back whatever the particular harm that 
              may befall them.   Paling’s Perspectives on Comparing 
              Risks  There is a lot of rubbish talked about not comparing risks. However, 
              we all do it whether we are conscious of it or not. Indeed that 
              is how the human sense organs seem to work (by making logarithmic 
              comparisons). That is also the way that people naturally think and 
              talk about risks- as evidenced by virtually all media reports.  However, many people who work in the field of risk communication 
              are obsessively against comparing any new risk with another risk 
              for fear that it could be deceptive. In individual cases, that is 
              certainly a possibility (for many good reasons). But no one seems 
              to be giving any reason why we should not compare some new, unfamiliar 
              risk with the range of risks that we are all at home with in our 
              daily lives. When you use that broad band of likelihoods for potentially 
              fatal risks (shown in green on the scale), it becomes very clear 
              that some high profile worries are of such low probabilities that 
              logically society might do better to devote its resources to other 
              more routine risks that are harming or even killing many more people 
              in our society  Paling’s Perspectives on Informed 
              Consent  There is a chasm of difference between the realities and practicalities 
              of how many risks a surgeon, say, should reasonably be expected 
              to tell his patient and what the theory of the process might expect. 
              The ethical imperative of informing patients is excellent but the 
              most recent ethical guidelines suggests that the threshold of what 
              risks should be mentioned should be anything “more than minimal 
              risk” (Note they immediately seek to define a threshold by 
              comparing risks!) However the sorts of risks that ethicists suggest should be the 
              baseline for “minimal” were “driving to work, 
              crossing a street, getting a blood test.” These represent 
              odds far less than 1 in a million and as such would mean that a 
              surgeon might be expected to deliver a list of hundreds of risks. 
              His would be harmful to the patients’ state of mind as well 
              as being impracticable.  Perhaps a new threshold of a reasonable level of reportable risk 
              should be defined somewhere in the “home base zone”(above).  This would have the benefit of being practical as well as ethical.      Back to Example Risk Perspective Scale | Build Your Own Risk Perspective Scale      [ Return to start new Visual Aid ]

We've got the odds    Share    Tweet    Pin    Share    Tumble            Combined comments & shares on social media          You hear people throwing out random facts all the time, preaching them as truth. You know what we're talking about. We're willing to bet you've heard, "You're more likely to die driving to work than to be eaten by a shark," like a million times.  But it got us wondering: How many of these statistical musings are actually true? So we did a little research to get the real lowdown on the odds.  More:  I'm applying to be one of the first people on Mars  Just note you that a number of factors affect the real odds of something, especially your specific behavior. Someone who surfs everyday has a greater likelihood of being attacked by a shark than someone who never goes into the water, for instance. That being said, we rounded up some interesting general stats.  1. Odds of being diagnosed with cancer — 1 in 2 for men, 1 in 3 for women  A 50 percent chance of getting cancer in your lifetime is pretty alarming, but don't freak out just yet.  " The numbers reflect a few things : First, people are living longer, and advancing age is a significant risk factor for cancer," Len Lichtenfeld, M.D., deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, told Men's Health . "Also, we’re diagnosing cancer at greater rates because of technological advances in screening, such as mammography for breast cancer and PSA tests for prostate cancer."  Dr. Lichtenfeld also pointed out that cancer deaths have actually declined 20 percent since the early 1990s.  2. Odds of being a victim of a serious crime — 1 in 47 for men, 1 in 52 for women  According to crimeinamerica.net's 2016 statistics, men are more likely than women to be victims of serious crime (serious crimes include things like murder, assault, robbery and rape).  Obviously there's all kinds of factors that contribute to your own personal risk of being victimized. Check out this handy dandy little assessment to rate yours.  3. Odds of being called to “Come on down!” on The Price is Right — 1 in 36  1 in 36? Not too shabby. Given the stats on becoming a billionaire or winning the lotto, which we cover later, this is pretty good news.  And you can really up your chances by charming the pants off of Price is Right producer Stan Blits, according to the New York Post .  4. Odds of being audited by the IRS — 1 in 100  This number seems super high, but don't panic. This factors in all tax returns filed — including those filed by billionaires and huge corporations. But if you are earning a middle-class income, you don't have a whole lot to worry about.  "If you earn less than $200,000 annually and don’t attach Schedules C or E to your tax return, statistically speaking, you have a better chance of being abducted by aliens or dating Taylor Swift than being audited," says Forbes .  5. Odds of being involved in a drunk driving crash — 2 out of 3  Two out of three people will be involved in a drunk driving accident in their lifetime, according to MADD. Lower your risk by always designating a driver.  6. Odds of being born with 11 fingers or toes — 1 in 500  This means that if you follow 1,000 people on Twitter, one or two of them were probably born with an extra appendage — which is medically known as polydactyly , according to MedicineNet .  7. Odds of dying from firearm assault — 1 in 358  Your odds of being shot and killed in your lifetime are 1 in 358 , according to the National Safety Council.  8. Odds of dying in a car accident — 1 in 113  These odds , provided by the National Safety Council, are pretty scary. If you text while driving, you increase you chances by six times — the same as driving after four beers.  9. Odds of winning an Oscar — 1 in 11,500  Keep in mind, though, your odds are zero if you don't try. However, the odds of becoming a movie star are 1 in 1,505,000 , according to U.S. News . Not exactly encouraging.  10. Odds of finding a pearl in an oyster — 1 in 12,000  Given how hard it is to shuck an oyster, we hardly think it’s worth it.  11. Odds of being drafted by the NBA — 1 in 6,864,000  Don't mean to put a damper on your dreams, but yikes. Statistics presented by thesportdigest.com are pretty bleak .  12. Odds of going blind after laser eye surgery — 1 in 5 million  According to London Vision Clinic, if you choose a good surgeon your chances of going blind are extremely slim .  13. Odds of being injured by a toilet — 1 in 10,000  Kind of surprised that this stat (provided by London Vision Clinic) is so high. Be careful out there, people.  14. Odds of dying in an airplane crash — 1 in 9,737  Not too bad as compared to cars... or motorcycles, on which you have a 1 in 948 chance of dying, according to the National Safety Council.  15. Odds of getting killed by fireworks — 1 in 340,733  Odds by being killed by fireworks aren't super high, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History, but it does happen. And, as you can imagine, most of those deaths occur on the Fourth of July.  16. Odds of being struck and killed by lightening — 1 in 174,426  It's true, there's not a whole lot of people that get struck by lightening, according to the National Safety Council — but it does happen. Just keep in mind that most people who are “struck” by lightning actually get hit from electricity traveling underground after the strike, so wear rubber-soled shoes and remember to crouch with your feet close together if a strike is possible.  17. Odds of becoming a billionaire — Pretty much none  Forbes says there's now 1,426 billionaires out there running amok , and roughly 7 billion people on the planet. You do the math.  18. Odds of becoming President of the U.S. — 1 in 10 million  And, yet, somehow Donald Trump beat the odds .  19. Odds of getting attacked by a shark — 1 in 11.5 million  Shark attacks get all kinds of media attention, but turns out they hardly ever happen , according to the University of Florida's 2010 International Shark Attack File, via Seeker . You're actually much more likely to die as a result of coming into contact with hornets, wasps or bees (1 in 64,706) than even being bitten by a shark, according to the National Safety Council.  20. Odds of winning $1 million in the McDonald’s Monopoly game — 1 in 513,591,720  Um, yeah, according to research done by StarPulse , you're gonna have to eat a whole lotta Mickey D's to win that money.  21. Odds of winning the Powerball jackpot — 1 in 175,223,510  Image: Giphy At least you can still be president, right?  More:  20 Interesting sex facts  Before you go, check out our slideshow below.

Since my diagnosis in 1989, I have consumed approximately 60,000 pills, had at least 150 blood draws, been hospitalized twice, lost more T-cells than most healthy people start off with, dipped into psychotic dementia , lost my family to AIDS, gone broke from the disease, been forced to hang out with the medical establishment, lost my hair and my modesty (every doctor in L.A. has seen me naked!), buried good friends, lost my emotions, received 300 injections, lost a year in down days due to fatigue and diarrhea , shit my pants about 20 times, had myself electrocuted with lightening in a box for a year, smeared myself with bee venom, seen my body turn into a troll doll, got an impressive collection of healing crystals from well-meaning friends, and received my official AIDS diagnosis on January 1, 1993. I joined the media circus by appearing on TV and in printed articles, doing work for AIDS organizations, turning myself into an AIDS pet for the do-gooders, and doing speaking engagements. I've written an AIDS play, had a TV movie made, and demonstrated on the streets with ACT UP, all while waiting for my first OI to arrive. Okay, enough self-pity. We all go through these things, right? I can live with it. Not gladly, but somehow we cope. Here is where I draw the line! In the last four years I have been tormented by literally thousands of uninfected people saying "Well, we all have to deal with death. I could be hit by a bus tomorrow." Advertisement At first, when I had the consciousness of an ant, I would nod my head and agree. Yes, you're right! No one gets off this planet alive. After a while though, I realized that the concept of being hit by a bus did nothing to comfort me personally. In fact, as I thought about it, I realized I didn't know one single person who was ever actually hit by a bus. Over 300,000 people dead from AIDS in the U.S. alone, and not one of them got hit by a bus! Yet people insist that they could get hit by a bus at any second. With so many people getting hit by busses, you have to wonder about the accident rate of bus drivers. Why doesn't the DMV do something about this outbreak of manslaughter? Is this some new mass psychosis, like the post office employees phenomena? Is running people down on the street part of their job description? Or are bus drivers innocent? Will we soon see bus drivers on the talk show circuit bemoaning this discrimination? Will a 12 step program spring up for them? Will criminal attorneys use the "bus driver defense" to acquit hard core criminals? My own theory is that being hit by a bus has become a modern myth in the United States, much like the folk belief that alligators live in the New York City sewer system. Science has robbed us of magic in this technological twentieth century, and people do need their myths. After all, how many people would believe in 1994 that a giant bird or sea monster could arrive at any time, swoop a person up, and kill them? Alas, the collective unconscious has shifted, just like everything else. The bogeyman has been replaced by the bus driver. Let's get back to my rage, which is endlessly fascinating to me. My friend Rico and I discuss this all the time. (Rico is a hemophiliac with AIDS and has about seventeen terminal illnesses. He stays alive and active out of revenge. He's so mean that everyone hates him.) I am not fond of this plan because it would save the insurance companies and the government a lot of money, and I intend to take these two uncaring institutions down with me by living as long as I can. Since being hit by a bus has become my obsession, I have heard two rumors about this. One from my friend Rick, who swears that a negative member of his group was actually hit by a bus. I have discounted this report because Rick will say anything for a laugh. The other rumor comes from my husband, who says his friend's roommate had to fly home because his mother was hit by a bus. I discount this story too, until I can see the accident report. As unlikely as being hit by a bus is, this peculiar story remains embedded in people. It's driving me up the wall! If one more person tells me this, I swear I'm going to grab them by the scruff of their neck and throw them in front of a bus. Since the January earthquake, there are a lot more buses in Los Angeles to chose from! I am now at the point of considering a few different options. First, PWA's (people with AIDS) in a unified protest, hijack buses across America and run down as many healthy people as possible. This will allow us to make a political statement, and we can advocate for decent health care plans, housing, food, etc. for PWA's within the prison systems. We could invent a new form of terrorism and become famous, like the Chicago Seven or the Black Panthers. PWA's, throw themselves en masse, on a pre-selected day, in front of buses in every city in the U.S. After all, what do we have to lose? I am not fond of this plan because it would save the insurance companies and the government a lot of money, and I intend to take these two uncaring institutions down with me by living as long as I can. Scenario number three, is we hijack buses and run down prominent figures in the AIDS establishment, in a concerted terrorist attack. While this may provide some fleeting headlines, I'm convinced that these people would be replaced immediately with new Stepford doctors and researchers, thus maintaining the status quo. My last idea is simple, but brilliant, in my humble opinion. When it's close to the end for me, I roll myself in my wheelchair in front of a bus, while one of my trusted buddies video-tapes the event. This accomplishes a number of goals. It eliminates the six hundred dollars I'd have to pay for Dr. Kervorkian to fly from Michigan to California. My friends use the videotape, á la Rodney King, to collect from the city. I envision a couple of million dollars in settlement. I do have death on my side, not just a lifetime of headaches! The most wonderful thing about my plan is that I will have one-upped the "neggies" (uninfected people). A new mythology will displace the old. Now we can say, "NOT ONLY DID ROXY HAVE AIDS, BUT SHE WAS ALSO HIT BY A BUS!!!!" He who laughs last laughs best.

Thousands of people are rushing to buy lottery tickets in an attempt to win the UK’s highest ever jackpot of £57.8 million - but the chance of winning is incredibly miniscule.  After increasing the number of balls from 49 to 59 in October, the National Lottery organisers reduced the odds on anyone’s six numbers coming up from 1 in 14 million to 1 in 45 million.

It could be worse; you’re still more likely to win the lottery than you are of being crushed by a vending machine.  The chances of that happening are 1 in 112 million.

Well, that is the price the Fellows of the Royal Society put on my life. My only quibble is that they did not bother to tell me. In keeping with its policy of lofty disdain for the real world or, as some might have it, bumbling incompetence in dealing with the press, the society has just published a substantial report, Risk: Analysis, Perception and Management, without letting anyone see it.  They also buried the information on how highly they value me in an appendix tagged on to the end of 200 closely printed pages of analysis couched in the most impenetrable prose to have crossed my desk in a long time. It is a strange way both to write and to 'publicise' a report, a substantial part of which is devoted to public perception of risk and the communication of risk analysis to the wider public.  However, it is reassuring to know that the Fellows value me more highly than does the Government. Life comes cheap to John MacGregor, the Secretary of State for Transport, for his department reckons I am worth only about pounds 500,000.  My multimillionaire status is, alas, not unique to me. The society estimates that in Britain pounds 2m- pounds 3m is the value to be put on 'a statistical life'. In other words, this is the sort of money we ought to be spending on upgrading safety equipment, and otherwise diminishing hazards, if by doing so we can expect to save one life. On this measure, it would appear that my entire family - all four of us - would have to be wiped out before the Department of Transport would move to improve road safety.  The report is an update of an earlier foray into the field, published in 1983. Crucially, the society has gone beyond the narrow focus of the technocrat in assessing numerical risks and has put its toe into the waters of how the public perceives risks.  In a sense, the arithmetic - are the tanks and equipment at an oil refinery liable to explode once in a million years or more often? - is trivial. What is more important is the morality of risk. There is always inequity: if an oil refinery is built at the bottom of my garden, then my family will bear the risk (whatever it is numerically), whereas the benefit of cheaper petrol is enjoyed by the oil company and British motorists generally, few of whom are likely to be affected by any accidents at the plant.  Sadly, the society is reluctant to take on such issues. While the report contains two chapters on public issues, they are impenetrable and the society, in an extraordinary step, has included a preface distancing itself from the chapters.  This lack of nerve is highlighted by another report on risks published a week before the society's effort. Commendably, the Health and Safety Executive's report on The Tolerability of Risk from Nuclear Power Stations faces head-on the problems of explaining risk assessment in straightforward language, the ethical issues of who has to bear risks, and at what level risks may be judged intolerable. This document, too, is a second try at the subject, updating a 1988 report following recommendations from Sir Frank Layfield, the inspector at the public inquiry into the Sizewell nuclear reactor.  The HSE makes clear that while the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate can make a reasonable assessment of the risks of major nuclear accidents in the UK, it is not up to regulatory bodies to decide if the risks are outweighed by the benefits - that, the report concludes, is for Parliament and the public.  The HSE does answer the question of exploding oil tanks. The chance that Canvey Island on the Thames would suffer an accident capable of causing 1,500 casualties at a stroke is about one in 5,000 a year. In comparison, the chance of an aircraft crash similar to the recent one in Amsterdam is five times greater. It would take 20-50 modern nuclear power stations to have 'a similar chance of causing death to some hundreds of people as the installations at Canvey Island', the HSE concludes.  But the HSE's technocrats have failed to understand the special problems presented by nuclear accidents. Radiation kills people statistically by causing cancer. If 100 people are lined up at random, it is a fair bet that about 24 of them will die of 'natural' cancers. If, in some macabre experiment, all 100 were irradiated at the level likely to cause one excess death, there would be 25 deaths resulting from cancer. But it is in principle impossible to point to any one of those 25 bodies and say 'this one died from radiation'.  Statistics exist about the number of people likely to die in road accidents each year but that differs qualitatively from the case of radiation. If someone falls under the wheels of a double- decker bus, no one is in any doubt about the cause. Radiation is unique in causing death randomly and unattributively. That there should be greater public concern about radiation is neither irrational nor unscientific.  Yet the HSE has diminished the impact of radiation risks by focusing on the delay between irradiation and the development of cancer and highlighting the 'length of life lost' as a result. This means the lives of pensioners are worth less than those of the young. Indeed, the HSE gives a precise figure: the value of a pensioner appears to be 0.45 times that of a younger person.  What sort of relationship did the men who put together the HSE's analysis have with their parents? My own live within sight of the Hunterston nuclear power station in what used to be Ayrshire and I do not like the idea that, if the men from the HSE take their calculations seriously, my parents would be afforded less than half the consideration given to other residents of their village.  In this supposedly democratic society, there are no formal mechanisms whereby we can give our views on whether such risks are acceptable or intolerable. The HSE has made a good fist of explaining the issues, but some of its ideas seem perverse and worrying and must be debated more widely.
