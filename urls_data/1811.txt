         I'm Kate Walace It's a 9th grade questionand I am a student.  The question is on Probability:  If I have a spinner and then spinner has the numbers 1,2,3,4 on it and it is spun 3 times, what is the probability that the spinner will stop on 4,3,and 1 ? In that order?  Can you help?  If so thank you.Kate Hi Kate, Recall that the probability of an outcome of an experiment is:     For the spinner with numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 there are 4 possible outcomes.  A successful outcome such as in your question would be spinning a certain number.  For example there would be one successful outcome for spinning a 1, that would be landing on the 1.  So for your question, the probability of spinning a 4 on the first spin is 1/4, of spinning a 3 on the second spin is 1/4 and of spinning a 1 on the third spin is 1/4.  Since you need all three of these to happen, that is, you need:  4 on the 1st spin AND 3 on the 2nd spin AND 1 on the 3rd spin  The answer is found by multiplying the three probabilities together to get 1/64.  If we list the entire sample space for the three spins we would see that only one of the 64 possible outcomesÊcorresponds to 4, 3  and 1 in that order.

It helps in b) if you convert everything to $6$ths so prob A = $1/6$, prob B = $3/6$, and prob C = $2/6$.  Since we are told it didn't land on C, it would be like spinning a different spinner with only $2$ values on it where B was $3$ times as likely as A.  That would mean that B would have to be $75$% chance and A would have to be $25$% chance.  Another way of looking at b) is that originally, option C gave us a $2/6$th doubt that we spun an A or a B.  Since we were told that the C didn't occur, that $2/6$th doubt is now gone which means that the other $4/6$ths probability of landing on A or B has to be scaled up to be $6/6$th so we need to multiply the original probabilities of both A and B by $3/2$s to do so.  This may confuse you a little so if it does don't worry about it since this is just an alternate explanation that gives the same answer.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Sep 27 '14 at 0:26             answered Sep 27 '14 at 0:14       David   318 8 30                  YES!

So, the probability you get the 2 is 1/3.  The other half of the time (i.e. when the dice roll is 4, 5, or 6), you get 2 shots at the 2.  Now the probability becomes 1 - 2/3 * 2/3 = 1 - 4/9 = 5/9.  So, the calculation of the probability for this game is 1/2 * 1/3 + 1/2 * 5/9 = 1/6 + 5/18 = 8/18 = 4/9.  Your question also asks how you'd get the answer experimentally.  I'm guessing that means you'd play the game a large number of times and see how often you won.  Hopefully, the winning percentage would be somewhere in the 44% to 45% range.

With one spin you have a 1/3 chance of getting a 2 on a spin.  If you spin twice, the chance of getting a 2 is 5/9 (see link for this percentage)  So you get either a 1/3 or 5/9 chance... with 50% odds of either.  (1/3+5/9)/2 = (8/9)/2 =4/9   So there is a 4/9 chance of winning this game.

I "Believe" and "Feel" a lot of the "Wiccan" ways, But I Do not necessarily "Practice". That is, I do not attend any groups, know or use any "Spells" or such things. (other than Prayer and asking to be blessed and for guidance) I Have read up on a lot of the Wicca ways over the Years, and I have a Very Close and Dear friend that is an Ordained Priestess that has Shared much information with me and has told me that I could/would be a great Priest if i was to Indulge myself more. Only because of How i Already felt and Believed about (all)"Life" and others, in Our world and existence. That being said,..I do not believe the "Elements" are Gods, (more of a Energy) but something of an extension of the Gods/Goddess's. Since a Godly being is the source and power of the elements, (the energy and/or creation of All life in any form) and therefore part of the life force that IS the Gods/Goddess's. For Me personally, The entities that I/we/Wiccans/Humans pray to Isn't Just of our "Mother Earth", but All of Creation in general. I Don't know If you "Got it wrong" or not, because I don't know If I have it right myself. Does Anyone or Can Anyone say or Prove what is Right ? I'm Sure that "We All" have "Missed Something" (probably a Lot) Being Wiccan, you my Dear "Crystal Clear" know as well as I, that We "All" are "One" with "One Another" as well as Life and the "Universe" as We comprehend it. We All are Magic, and the Magic is in Us. What We give of ourselves to life or others is all we will get back.

Introduction     Probability provides a measure of how likely it is that something will occur. It is a number between and including the numbers 0 and 1. It can be written as a fraction, a decimal, or a percent.       Picking numbers randomly means that there is no specific order in which they are chosen.  Many games use dice or spinners to generate numbers randomly. If you understand how to calculate probabilities, you can make thoughtful decisions about how to play these games by knowing the likelihood of various outcomes.     Definitions     First you need to know some terms related to probability. When working with probability, a random action or series of actions is called a trial . An outcome is the result of a trial, and an event is a particular collection of outcomes. Events are usually described using a common characteristic of the outcomes.    Let's apply this language to see how the terms work in practice. Some games require rolling a die with six sides, numbered from 1 to 6. (Dice is the plural of die.) The chart below illustrates the use of trial, outcome, and event for such a game:        Trial    Outcomes    Examples of Events      Rolling a die    There are 6 possible outcomes:  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}    Rolling an even number: {2, 4, 6}  Rolling a 3: {3}  Rolling a 1 or a 3: {1, 3}  Rolling a 1 and a 3: { } (Only one number can be rolled, so this outcome is impossible. The event has no outcomes in it.)        Notice that a collection of outcomes is put in braces and separated by commas.    A simple event is an event with only one outcome. Rolling a 1 would be a simple event, because there is only one outcome that works—1! Rolling more than a 5 would also be a simple event, because the event includes only 6 as a valid outcome. A compound event is an event with more than one outcome. For example, in rolling one six-sided die, rolling an even number could occur with one of three outcomes: 2, 4, and 6.    When you roll a six-sided die many times, you should not expect any outcome to happen more often than another (assuming that it is a fair die). The outcomes in a situation like this are said to be equally likely . It’s very important to recognize when outcomes are equally likely when calculating probability. Since each outcome in the die-rolling trial is equally likely, you would expect to get each outcome of the rolls. That is, you'd expect of the rolls to be 1, of the rolls to be 2, of the rolls to be 3, and so on.         A spinner is divided into four equal parts, each colored with a different color as shown below. When this spinner is spun, the arrow points to one of the colors. Are the outcomes equally likely?       A) Yes, they are equally likely.  B) No, they are not equally likely.    Show/Hide Answer  All the outcomes are equally likely. Each color provides a different outcome, and each color takes up of the circle. You would expect the arrow to point to each color of the time.    Probability of Events   The probability of an event is how often it is expected to occur. It is the ratio of the size of the event space to the size of the sample space .  First, you need to determine the size of the sample space. The size of the sample space is the total number of possible outcomes. For example, when you roll 1 die, the sample space is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So the size of the sample space is 6.  Then you need to determine the size of the event space. The event space is the number of outcomes in the event you are interested in. The event space for rolling a number less than three is 1 or 2. So the size of the event space is 2.  For equally likely outcomes, the probability of an event E can be written P(E).               Example      Problem    A game requires rolling a six-sided die numbered from 1 to 6. What is the probability of rolling an even number?            Sample space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}    Event space = {2, 4, 6}    First, find the sample space and the event space. The sample space is all the possible outcomes, and the event space is the outcomes in the event. In this case, the event is “rolling an even number.”                 Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.      Answer    P (even number) =            It is a common practice with probabilities, as with fractions in general, to simplify a probability into lowest terms since that makes it easier for most people to get a sense of how great it is. Unless there is reason not to do so, express all final probabilities in lowest terms.      A spinner is divided into equal parts, each colored with a different color as shown below. Find the probability of spinning blue or green on this spinner:         A)    B)    C) 2    D) 6    Show/Hide Answer  A)  Incorrect. There are 6 equally likely outcomes, so the probability of each outcome is . However, the event has two outcomes in it, {blue, green}. The probability is . The correct answer is .    B)  Correct. There are 6 equally likely outcomes, and the event has two outcomes in it, {blue, green}. The probability is .    C) 2  Incorrect. The highest number that a probability value can be is 1! There are 2 outcomes in the event space, but the probability of the event is the ratio of outcomes in the event space to the total number of equally likely outcomes. There are 6 equally likely outcomes, so the probability is .    D) 6  Incorrect. The highest number that a probability value can be is 1! There are 6 equally likely outcomes in the sample space, but the probability of the event is the ratio of outcomes in the event space to the total number of equally likely outcomes. The probability is .    Counting Methods to find Sample Spaces   The most difficult thing for calculating a probability can be finding the size of the sample space, especially if there are two or more trials. There are several counting methods that can help.  The first one to look at is making a chart. In the example below, Tori is flipping two coins. So you need to determine the sample space carefully. A chart such as the one shown in the example that follows is a good approach.       Example      Problem    Tori is flipping a pair of coins and noting how many flips of “heads” she gets. What is the probability that she flips 2 heads? What is the probability that she flips only 1 head?                        Outcomes:       First coin    Second coin    outcome      H    H    HH      H    T    HT      T    H    TH      T    T    TT       sample space: {HH, HT, TH, TT}    event space for 2 heads: {HH}  event space for 1 head: {HT, TH}      Create a chart to record the results of flipping the first coin, followed by the result of flipping the second coin.                 Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.      Answer              In the example below, the sample space for Tori is simple as only one die is being rolled. However, since James is rolling two die, a chart helps to organize the information.       Example      Problem    Tori rolled a six-sided die and wanted to get a result of either 1 or 4. James rolled two six-sided dice, one blue and one red, and wanted to get a result of both a 1 and a 3, at the same time. Which event has a greater probability?          Tori's sample space: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}    Tori's event space: {1, 4}        Tori:        First, find the sample space and the event space for the two trials. For Tori's trial, this is straightforward.    Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.                         Red die              1    2    3    4    5    6      Blue die    1    1, 1    1, 2    1, 3    1, 4    1, 5    1, 6      2    2, 1    2, 2    2, 3    2, 4    2, 5    2, 6      3    3, 1    3, 2    3, 3    3, 4    3, 5    3, 6      4    4, 1    4, 2    4, 3    4, 4    4, 5    4, 6      5    5, 1    5, 2    5, 3    5, 4    5, 5    5, 6      6    6, 1    6, 2    6, 3    6, 4    6, 5    6, 6       James' sample space has 36 outcomes.  James' event space has 2 outcomes.    It's not so obvious for James’ trial, since he is rolling two dice. Use a chart to find the possibilities.    There are 36 outcomes. Of these, there are 2 that have both 1 and 3.            James:    Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.      Answer    Tori's event has a greater probability.          You can also use a tree diagram to determine the sample space. A tree diagram has a branch for every possible outcome for each event.  Suppose a closet has three pairs of pants (black, white, and green), four shirts (green, white, purple, and yellow), and two pairs of shoes (black and white). How many different outfits can be made? There are 3 choices for pants, 4 choices for shirts, and 2 choices for shoes. For our tree diagram, let's use B for black, W for white, G for green, P for purple, and Y for yellow.    You can see from the tree diagram that there are 24 possible outfits (some perhaps not great choices) in the sample space.  Now you could fairly easily solve some probability problems. For example, what is the probability that if you close your eyes and choose randomly you would choose pants and shoes with the same color? You can see that there are 8 outfits where the pants and the shoes match.   As you've seen, when a trial involves more than one random element, such as flipping more than one coin or rolling more than one die, you don't always need to identify every outcome in the sample space to calculate a probability. You only need the number of outcomes.  The Fundamental Counting Principle is a way to find the number of outcomes without listing and counting every one of them.     The Fundamental Counting Principle    If one event has p possible outcomes, and another event has m possible outcomes, then there are a total of p  •  m possible outcomes for the two events.    Examples  ·  Rolling two six-sided dice: Each die has 6 equally likely outcomes, so the sample space is 6 • 6 or 36 equally likely outcomes.  ·  Flipping three coins: Each coin has 2 equally likely outcomes, so the sample space is 2 • 2 • 2 or 8 equally likely outcomes.  ·  Rolling a six-sided die and flipping a coin: The sample space is 6 • 2 or 12 equally likely outcomes.     So you could use the Fundamental Counting Principle to find out how many outfits there are in the previous example. There are 3 choices for pants, 4 choices for shirts, and 2 choices for shoes. Using The Fundamental Counting Principle, you have 4 • 3 • 2 = 24 different outfits.       Example      Problem    Barry volunteers at a charity walk to make lunches for all the other volunteers. In each bag he puts:  ·  one of two sandwiches (peanut butter and jelly, or turkey and cheese),  ·  one of three chips (regular potato chips, baked potato chips, or corn chips),  ·  one piece of fruit (an apple or an orange).  He forgot to mark what was in the bags. Assuming that each choice is equally likely, what is the probability that the bag Therese gets holds a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and an apple?            Size of sample space:    (number of sandwich choices) • (number of chip choices) • (number of fruit choices) = 2 • 3 • 2 = 12        First, use the Fundamental Counting Principle to find the size of the sample space.          Size of event space:    (number of sandwich choices in event) • (number of chip choices in event) • (number of fruit choices in event) = 1 • 3 • 1 = 3    For the event space, follow the same principle. In this case, there is only one sandwich and one piece of fruit of interest, but any of the three types of chips are acceptable.      Answer       Use the ratio to find the probability.          Carrie flips four coins and counts the number of tails. There are four ways to get exactly one tail: HHHT, HHTH, HTHH, and THHH. What is the probability that Carrie gets exactly one tail?      A)    B)     C)    D)    Show/Hide Answer  A)  Incorrect. Since there are two outcomes for each coin, there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). However, there are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    B)  Incorrect. Since there are two outcomes for each coin, there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). There are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    C)  Correct. Since there are two outcomes for each coin, there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). There are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    D)  Incorrect. There are two outcomes for each coin, but there are 4 coins. That means there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). There are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    Summary   Probability helps you understand random, unpredictable situations where multiple outcomes are possible. It is a measure of the likelihood of an event, and it depends on the ratio of event and possible outcomes, if all those outcomes are equally likely.   The Fundamental Counting Principle is a shortcut to finding the size of the sample space when there are many trials and outcomes:  If one event has p possible outcomes, and another event has m possible outcomes, then there are a total of p  • m possible outcomes for the two events.

What are the chances of landing on blue after spinning the spinner? What are the chances of landing on red?      Solution: The chances of landing on blue are 1 in 4, or one fourth.  The chances of landing on red are 1 in 4, or one fourth.  This problem asked us to find some probabilities involving a spinner. Let's look at some definitions and examples from the problem above.  Definition  Example  An experiment is a situation involving chance or probability that leads to results called outcomes.  In the problem above, the experiment is spinning the spinner.  An outcome is the result of a single trial of an experiment.  The possible outcomes are landing on yellow, blue, green or red.  An event is one or more outcomes of an experiment.  One event of this experiment is landing on blue.  Probability is the measure of how likely an event is.  The probability of landing on blue is one fourth.  In order to measure probabilities, mathematicians have devised the following formula for finding the probability of an event.  Probability Of An Event   P(A) =  The Number Of Ways Event A Can Occur  The total number Of Possible Outcomes   The probability of event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Let's take a look at a slight modification of the problem from the top of the page.  Experiment 1: A spinner has 4 equal sectors colored yellow, blue, green and red. After spinning the spinner, what is the probability of landing on each color?  The possible outcomes of this experiment are yellow, blue, green, and red.  Probabilities:  P(yellow)  =  # of ways to land on yellow  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(blue)  =  # of ways to land on blue  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(green)  =  # of ways to land on green  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(red)  =  # of ways to land on red  =   1  total # of colors  4  Experiment 2: A single 6-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of each outcome? What is the probability of rolling an even number? of rolling an odd number?      Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Probabilities:  P(1)  =  # of ways to roll a 1  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(2)  =  # of ways to roll a 2  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(3)  =  # of ways to roll a 3  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(4)  =  # of ways to roll a 4  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(5)  =  # of ways to roll a 5  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(6)  =  # of ways to roll a 6  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(even)  =  # ways to roll an even number  =  3  =  1  total # of sides  6  2    P(odd)  =  # ways to roll an odd number  =  3  =  1  total # of sides  6  2  Experiment 2 illustrates the difference between an outcome and an event. A single outcome of this experiment is rolling a 1, or rolling a 2, or rolling a 3, etc. Rolling an even number (2, 4 or 6) is an event, and rolling an odd number (1, 3 or 5) is also an event.  In Experiment 1 the probability of each outcome is always the same. The probability of landing on each color of the spinner is always one fourth. In Experiment 2, the probability of rolling each number on the die is always one sixth. In both of these experiments, the outcomes are equally likely to occur. Let's look at an experiment in which the outcomes are not equally likely.  Experiment 3: A glass jar contains 6 red, 5 green, 8 blue and 3 yellow marbles. If a single marble is chosen at random from the jar, what is the probability of choosing a red marble? a green marble? a blue marble? a yellow marble?  Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are red, green, blue and yellow.  Probabilities:  P(red)  =  # of ways to choose red  =  6  =  3  total # of marbles  22  11    P(green)  =  # of ways to choose green  =  5  total # of marbles  22    P(blue)  =  # of ways to choose blue  =  8  =  4  total # of marbles  22  11    P(yellow)  =  # of ways to choose yellow  =  3  total # of marbles  22  The outcomes in this experiment are not equally likely to occur. You are more likely to choose a blue marble than any other color. You are least likely to choose a yellow marble.  Experiment 4: Choose a number at random from 1 to 5. What is the probability of each outcome? What is the probability that the number chosen is even? What is the probability that the number chosen is odd?  Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Probabilities:  P(1)  =  # of ways to choose a 1  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(2)  =  # of ways to choose a 2  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(3)  =  # of ways to choose a 3  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(4)  =  # of ways to choose a 4  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(5)  =  # of ways to choose a 5  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(even)  =  # of ways to choose an even number  =  2  total # of numbers  5    P(odd)  =  # of ways to choose an odd number  =  3  total # of numbers  5  The outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are equally likely to occur as a result of this experiment. However, the events even and odd are not equally likely to occur, since there are 3 odd numbers and only 2 even numbers from 1 to 5.  Summary: The probability of an event is the measure of the chance that the event will occur as a result of an experiment. The probability of an event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes. The probability of an event A, symbolized by P(A), is a number between 0 and 1, inclusive, that measures the likelihood of an event in the following way:  If P(A) > P(B) then event A is more likely to occur than event B.  If P(A) = P(B) then events A and B are equally likely to occur.  Exercises  Directions: Read each question below. Select your answer by clicking on its button.

The question is on Probability:  If I have a spinner and then spinner has the numbers 1,2,3,4 on it and it is spun 3 times, what is the probability that the spinner will stop on 4,3,and 1 ? In that order?  Can you help?  If so thank you.Kate Hi Kate, Recall that the probability of an outcome of an experiment is:     For the spinner with numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 there are 4 possible outcomes.  A successful outcome such as in your question would be spinning a certain number.  For example there would be one successful outcome for spinning a 1, that would be landing on the 1.  So for your question, the probability of spinning a 4 on the first spin is 1/4, of spinning a 3 on the second spin is 1/4 and of spinning a 1 on the third spin is 1/4.  Since you need all three of these to happen, that is, you need:  4 on the 1st spin AND 3 on the 2nd spin AND 1 on the 3rd spin  The answer is found by multiplying the three probabilities together to get 1/64.  If we list the entire sample space for the three spins we would see that only one of the 64 possible outcomesÊcorresponds to 4, 3  and 1 in that order.

It helps in b) if you convert everything to $6$ths so prob A = $1/6$, prob B = $3/6$, and prob C = $2/6$.  Since we are told it didn't land on C, it would be like spinning a different spinner with only $2$ values on it where B was $3$ times as likely as A.  That would mean that B would have to be $75$% chance and A would have to be $25$% chance.  Another way of looking at b) is that originally, option C gave us a $2/6$th doubt that we spun an A or a B.  Since we were told that the C didn't occur, that $2/6$th doubt is now gone which means that the other $4/6$ths probability of landing on A or B has to be scaled up to be $6/6$th so we need to multiply the original probabilities of both A and B by $3/2$s to do so.  This may confuse you a little so if it does don't worry about it since this is just an alternate explanation that gives the same answer.     share | cite | improve this answer      edited Sep 27 '14 at 0:26             answered Sep 27 '14 at 0:14       David   318 8 30                  YES!

So, the probability you get the 2 is 1/3.  The other half of the time (i.e. when the dice roll is 4, 5, or 6), you get 2 shots at the 2.  Now the probability becomes 1 - 2/3 * 2/3 = 1 - 4/9 = 5/9.  So, the calculation of the probability for this game is 1/2 * 1/3 + 1/2 * 5/9 = 1/6 + 5/18 = 8/18 = 4/9.  Your question also asks how you'd get the answer experimentally.  I'm guessing that means you'd play the game a large number of times and see how often you won.  Hopefully, the winning percentage would be somewhere in the 44% to 45% range.

With one spin you have a 1/3 chance of getting a 2 on a spin.  If you spin twice, the chance of getting a 2 is 5/9 (see link for this percentage)  So you get either a 1/3 or 5/9 chance... with 50% odds of either.  (1/3+5/9)/2 = (8/9)/2 =4/9   So there is a 4/9 chance of winning this game.

I "Believe" and "Feel" a lot of the "Wiccan" ways, But I Do not necessarily "Practice". That is, I do not attend any groups, know or use any "Spells" or such things. (other than Prayer and asking to be blessed and for guidance) I Have read up on a lot of the Wicca ways over the Years, and I have a Very Close and Dear friend that is an Ordained Priestess that has Shared much information with me and has told me that I could/would be a great Priest if i was to Indulge myself more. Only because of How i Already felt and Believed about (all)"Life" and others, in Our world and existence. That being said,..I do not believe the "Elements" are Gods, (more of a Energy) but something of an extension of the Gods/Goddess's. Since a Godly being is the source and power of the elements, (the energy and/or creation of All life in any form) and therefore part of the life force that IS the Gods/Goddess's. For Me personally, The entities that I/we/Wiccans/Humans pray to Isn't Just of our "Mother Earth", but All of Creation in general. I Don't know If you "Got it wrong" or not, because I don't know If I have it right myself. Does Anyone or Can Anyone say or Prove what is Right ? I'm Sure that "We All" have "Missed Something" (probably a Lot) Being Wiccan, you my Dear "Crystal Clear" know as well as I, that We "All" are "One" with "One Another" as well as Life and the "Universe" as We comprehend it. We All are Magic, and the Magic is in Us. What We give of ourselves to life or others is all we will get back.

Introduction     Probability provides a measure of how likely it is that something will occur. It is a number between and including the numbers 0 and 1. It can be written as a fraction, a decimal, or a percent.       Picking numbers randomly means that there is no specific order in which they are chosen.  Many games use dice or spinners to generate numbers randomly. If you understand how to calculate probabilities, you can make thoughtful decisions about how to play these games by knowing the likelihood of various outcomes.     Definitions     First you need to know some terms related to probability. When working with probability, a random action or series of actions is called a trial . An outcome is the result of a trial, and an event is a particular collection of outcomes. Events are usually described using a common characteristic of the outcomes.    Let's apply this language to see how the terms work in practice. Some games require rolling a die with six sides, numbered from 1 to 6. (Dice is the plural of die.) The chart below illustrates the use of trial, outcome, and event for such a game:        Trial    Outcomes    Examples of Events      Rolling a die    There are 6 possible outcomes:  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}    Rolling an even number: {2, 4, 6}  Rolling a 3: {3}  Rolling a 1 or a 3: {1, 3}  Rolling a 1 and a 3: { } (Only one number can be rolled, so this outcome is impossible. The event has no outcomes in it.)        Notice that a collection of outcomes is put in braces and separated by commas.    A simple event is an event with only one outcome. Rolling a 1 would be a simple event, because there is only one outcome that works—1! Rolling more than a 5 would also be a simple event, because the event includes only 6 as a valid outcome. A compound event is an event with more than one outcome. For example, in rolling one six-sided die, rolling an even number could occur with one of three outcomes: 2, 4, and 6.    When you roll a six-sided die many times, you should not expect any outcome to happen more often than another (assuming that it is a fair die). The outcomes in a situation like this are said to be equally likely . It’s very important to recognize when outcomes are equally likely when calculating probability. Since each outcome in the die-rolling trial is equally likely, you would expect to get each outcome of the rolls. That is, you'd expect of the rolls to be 1, of the rolls to be 2, of the rolls to be 3, and so on.         A spinner is divided into four equal parts, each colored with a different color as shown below. When this spinner is spun, the arrow points to one of the colors. Are the outcomes equally likely?       A) Yes, they are equally likely.  B) No, they are not equally likely.    Show/Hide Answer  All the outcomes are equally likely. Each color provides a different outcome, and each color takes up of the circle. You would expect the arrow to point to each color of the time.    Probability of Events   The probability of an event is how often it is expected to occur. It is the ratio of the size of the event space to the size of the sample space .  First, you need to determine the size of the sample space. The size of the sample space is the total number of possible outcomes. For example, when you roll 1 die, the sample space is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So the size of the sample space is 6.  Then you need to determine the size of the event space. The event space is the number of outcomes in the event you are interested in. The event space for rolling a number less than three is 1 or 2. So the size of the event space is 2.  For equally likely outcomes, the probability of an event E can be written P(E).               Example      Problem    A game requires rolling a six-sided die numbered from 1 to 6. What is the probability of rolling an even number?            Sample space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}    Event space = {2, 4, 6}    First, find the sample space and the event space. The sample space is all the possible outcomes, and the event space is the outcomes in the event. In this case, the event is “rolling an even number.”                 Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.      Answer    P (even number) =            It is a common practice with probabilities, as with fractions in general, to simplify a probability into lowest terms since that makes it easier for most people to get a sense of how great it is. Unless there is reason not to do so, express all final probabilities in lowest terms.      A spinner is divided into equal parts, each colored with a different color as shown below. Find the probability of spinning blue or green on this spinner:         A)    B)    C) 2    D) 6    Show/Hide Answer  A)  Incorrect. There are 6 equally likely outcomes, so the probability of each outcome is . However, the event has two outcomes in it, {blue, green}. The probability is . The correct answer is .    B)  Correct. There are 6 equally likely outcomes, and the event has two outcomes in it, {blue, green}. The probability is .    C) 2  Incorrect. The highest number that a probability value can be is 1! There are 2 outcomes in the event space, but the probability of the event is the ratio of outcomes in the event space to the total number of equally likely outcomes. There are 6 equally likely outcomes, so the probability is .    D) 6  Incorrect. The highest number that a probability value can be is 1! There are 6 equally likely outcomes in the sample space, but the probability of the event is the ratio of outcomes in the event space to the total number of equally likely outcomes. The probability is .    Counting Methods to find Sample Spaces   The most difficult thing for calculating a probability can be finding the size of the sample space, especially if there are two or more trials. There are several counting methods that can help.  The first one to look at is making a chart. In the example below, Tori is flipping two coins. So you need to determine the sample space carefully. A chart such as the one shown in the example that follows is a good approach.       Example      Problem    Tori is flipping a pair of coins and noting how many flips of “heads” she gets. What is the probability that she flips 2 heads? What is the probability that she flips only 1 head?                        Outcomes:       First coin    Second coin    outcome      H    H    HH      H    T    HT      T    H    TH      T    T    TT       sample space: {HH, HT, TH, TT}    event space for 2 heads: {HH}  event space for 1 head: {HT, TH}      Create a chart to record the results of flipping the first coin, followed by the result of flipping the second coin.                 Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.      Answer              In the example below, the sample space for Tori is simple as only one die is being rolled. However, since James is rolling two die, a chart helps to organize the information.       Example      Problem    Tori rolled a six-sided die and wanted to get a result of either 1 or 4. James rolled two six-sided dice, one blue and one red, and wanted to get a result of both a 1 and a 3, at the same time. Which event has a greater probability?          Tori's sample space: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}    Tori's event space: {1, 4}        Tori:        First, find the sample space and the event space for the two trials. For Tori's trial, this is straightforward.    Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.                         Red die              1    2    3    4    5    6      Blue die    1    1, 1    1, 2    1, 3    1, 4    1, 5    1, 6      2    2, 1    2, 2    2, 3    2, 4    2, 5    2, 6      3    3, 1    3, 2    3, 3    3, 4    3, 5    3, 6      4    4, 1    4, 2    4, 3    4, 4    4, 5    4, 6      5    5, 1    5, 2    5, 3    5, 4    5, 5    5, 6      6    6, 1    6, 2    6, 3    6, 4    6, 5    6, 6       James' sample space has 36 outcomes.  James' event space has 2 outcomes.    It's not so obvious for James’ trial, since he is rolling two dice. Use a chart to find the possibilities.    There are 36 outcomes. Of these, there are 2 that have both 1 and 3.            James:    Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of the event is the ratio of event space to sample space.      Answer    Tori's event has a greater probability.          You can also use a tree diagram to determine the sample space. A tree diagram has a branch for every possible outcome for each event.  Suppose a closet has three pairs of pants (black, white, and green), four shirts (green, white, purple, and yellow), and two pairs of shoes (black and white). How many different outfits can be made? There are 3 choices for pants, 4 choices for shirts, and 2 choices for shoes. For our tree diagram, let's use B for black, W for white, G for green, P for purple, and Y for yellow.    You can see from the tree diagram that there are 24 possible outfits (some perhaps not great choices) in the sample space.  Now you could fairly easily solve some probability problems. For example, what is the probability that if you close your eyes and choose randomly you would choose pants and shoes with the same color? You can see that there are 8 outfits where the pants and the shoes match.   As you've seen, when a trial involves more than one random element, such as flipping more than one coin or rolling more than one die, you don't always need to identify every outcome in the sample space to calculate a probability. You only need the number of outcomes.  The Fundamental Counting Principle is a way to find the number of outcomes without listing and counting every one of them.     The Fundamental Counting Principle    If one event has p possible outcomes, and another event has m possible outcomes, then there are a total of p  •  m possible outcomes for the two events.    Examples  ·  Rolling two six-sided dice: Each die has 6 equally likely outcomes, so the sample space is 6 • 6 or 36 equally likely outcomes.  ·  Flipping three coins: Each coin has 2 equally likely outcomes, so the sample space is 2 • 2 • 2 or 8 equally likely outcomes.  ·  Rolling a six-sided die and flipping a coin: The sample space is 6 • 2 or 12 equally likely outcomes.     So you could use the Fundamental Counting Principle to find out how many outfits there are in the previous example. There are 3 choices for pants, 4 choices for shirts, and 2 choices for shoes. Using The Fundamental Counting Principle, you have 4 • 3 • 2 = 24 different outfits.       Example      Problem    Barry volunteers at a charity walk to make lunches for all the other volunteers. In each bag he puts:  ·  one of two sandwiches (peanut butter and jelly, or turkey and cheese),  ·  one of three chips (regular potato chips, baked potato chips, or corn chips),  ·  one piece of fruit (an apple or an orange).  He forgot to mark what was in the bags. Assuming that each choice is equally likely, what is the probability that the bag Therese gets holds a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and an apple?            Size of sample space:    (number of sandwich choices) • (number of chip choices) • (number of fruit choices) = 2 • 3 • 2 = 12        First, use the Fundamental Counting Principle to find the size of the sample space.          Size of event space:    (number of sandwich choices in event) • (number of chip choices in event) • (number of fruit choices in event) = 1 • 3 • 1 = 3    For the event space, follow the same principle. In this case, there is only one sandwich and one piece of fruit of interest, but any of the three types of chips are acceptable.      Answer       Use the ratio to find the probability.          Carrie flips four coins and counts the number of tails. There are four ways to get exactly one tail: HHHT, HHTH, HTHH, and THHH. What is the probability that Carrie gets exactly one tail?      A)    B)     C)    D)    Show/Hide Answer  A)  Incorrect. Since there are two outcomes for each coin, there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). However, there are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    B)  Incorrect. Since there are two outcomes for each coin, there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). There are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    C)  Correct. Since there are two outcomes for each coin, there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). There are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    D)  Incorrect. There are two outcomes for each coin, but there are 4 coins. That means there are 16 possible outcomes (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 16). There are four outcomes in the event, so the probability is , or .    Summary   Probability helps you understand random, unpredictable situations where multiple outcomes are possible. It is a measure of the likelihood of an event, and it depends on the ratio of event and possible outcomes, if all those outcomes are equally likely.   The Fundamental Counting Principle is a shortcut to finding the size of the sample space when there are many trials and outcomes:  If one event has p possible outcomes, and another event has m possible outcomes, then there are a total of p  • m possible outcomes for the two events.

What are the chances of landing on blue after spinning the spinner? What are the chances of landing on red?      Solution: The chances of landing on blue are 1 in 4, or one fourth.  The chances of landing on red are 1 in 4, or one fourth.  This problem asked us to find some probabilities involving a spinner. Let's look at some definitions and examples from the problem above.  Definition  Example  An experiment is a situation involving chance or probability that leads to results called outcomes.  In the problem above, the experiment is spinning the spinner.  An outcome is the result of a single trial of an experiment.  The possible outcomes are landing on yellow, blue, green or red.  An event is one or more outcomes of an experiment.  One event of this experiment is landing on blue.  Probability is the measure of how likely an event is.  The probability of landing on blue is one fourth.  In order to measure probabilities, mathematicians have devised the following formula for finding the probability of an event.  Probability Of An Event   P(A) =  The Number Of Ways Event A Can Occur  The total number Of Possible Outcomes   The probability of event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Let's take a look at a slight modification of the problem from the top of the page.  Experiment 1: A spinner has 4 equal sectors colored yellow, blue, green and red. After spinning the spinner, what is the probability of landing on each color?  The possible outcomes of this experiment are yellow, blue, green, and red.  Probabilities:  P(yellow)  =  # of ways to land on yellow  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(blue)  =  # of ways to land on blue  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(green)  =  # of ways to land on green  =   1  total # of colors  4    P(red)  =  # of ways to land on red  =   1  total # of colors  4  Experiment 2: A single 6-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of each outcome? What is the probability of rolling an even number? of rolling an odd number?      Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Probabilities:  P(1)  =  # of ways to roll a 1  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(2)  =  # of ways to roll a 2  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(3)  =  # of ways to roll a 3  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(4)  =  # of ways to roll a 4  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(5)  =  # of ways to roll a 5  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(6)  =  # of ways to roll a 6  =  1  total # of sides  6    P(even)  =  # ways to roll an even number  =  3  =  1  total # of sides  6  2    P(odd)  =  # ways to roll an odd number  =  3  =  1  total # of sides  6  2  Experiment 2 illustrates the difference between an outcome and an event. A single outcome of this experiment is rolling a 1, or rolling a 2, or rolling a 3, etc. Rolling an even number (2, 4 or 6) is an event, and rolling an odd number (1, 3 or 5) is also an event.  In Experiment 1 the probability of each outcome is always the same. The probability of landing on each color of the spinner is always one fourth. In Experiment 2, the probability of rolling each number on the die is always one sixth. In both of these experiments, the outcomes are equally likely to occur. Let's look at an experiment in which the outcomes are not equally likely.  Experiment 3: A glass jar contains 6 red, 5 green, 8 blue and 3 yellow marbles. If a single marble is chosen at random from the jar, what is the probability of choosing a red marble? a green marble? a blue marble? a yellow marble?  Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are red, green, blue and yellow.  Probabilities:  P(red)  =  # of ways to choose red  =  6  =  3  total # of marbles  22  11    P(green)  =  # of ways to choose green  =  5  total # of marbles  22    P(blue)  =  # of ways to choose blue  =  8  =  4  total # of marbles  22  11    P(yellow)  =  # of ways to choose yellow  =  3  total # of marbles  22  The outcomes in this experiment are not equally likely to occur. You are more likely to choose a blue marble than any other color. You are least likely to choose a yellow marble.  Experiment 4: Choose a number at random from 1 to 5. What is the probability of each outcome? What is the probability that the number chosen is even? What is the probability that the number chosen is odd?  Outcomes: The possible outcomes of this experiment are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Probabilities:  P(1)  =  # of ways to choose a 1  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(2)  =  # of ways to choose a 2  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(3)  =  # of ways to choose a 3  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(4)  =  # of ways to choose a 4  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(5)  =  # of ways to choose a 5  =  1  total # of numbers  5    P(even)  =  # of ways to choose an even number  =  2  total # of numbers  5    P(odd)  =  # of ways to choose an odd number  =  3  total # of numbers  5  The outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are equally likely to occur as a result of this experiment. However, the events even and odd are not equally likely to occur, since there are 3 odd numbers and only 2 even numbers from 1 to 5.  Summary: The probability of an event is the measure of the chance that the event will occur as a result of an experiment. The probability of an event A is the number of ways event A can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes. The probability of an event A, symbolized by P(A), is a number between 0 and 1, inclusive, that measures the likelihood of an event in the following way:  If P(A) > P(B) then event A is more likely to occur than event B.  If P(A) = P(B) then events A and B are equally likely to occur.  Exercises  Directions: Read each question below. Select your answer by clicking on its button.
