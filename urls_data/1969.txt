The Most Common Eye Colors The human eye is both beautiful and unique. Much like a fingerprint, each individual's eye color is specific only to them, with no others sharing the same shape, color and appearance. So what eye colors are the most common, and which are the rarest? What is the most common eye color? Which eye color is the rarest? Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful. Additionally, thanks to colored contact lenses , it's possible to change your eye color even if you were born with a common brown. Also, make sure to check out our Freshlook Contact Lenses , which are the most popular, and most widely recommended colored contact lens available.

Terms & Conditions â Contact Lens Sales Please read the following Terms & Conditions carefully before submitting your order. YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREE WITH ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: You must have a valid, current prescription for any contact lenses or prescription eyewear that you are ordering issued by a duly licensed eye-care professional located in the USA. You have not been advised by an eye care professional to stop or suspend wearing contact lenses for any medical reason. You will continue to have your eyes examined regularly by a licensed eye care professional. You will restrict your contact lens wearing schedule to the recommended wearing schedule established by your eye-care professional, and you will not exceed this recommended wearing schedule as this can lead to serious eye-health complications. You understand that you must take proper care of your contact lenses as directed by your eye care professional. Before using your contact lenses, you agree to carefully review all instructions and information provided by your eye care professional and/or by the contact lens manufacturer. You should never share your contact lenses with anyone. Contact lenses are classified as prescription medical devices by the FDA.

I was born with green eyes , a trait that I took fromÂ my mother. At first, I never understood the constant compliments I received for my eye color.Â Iâve heard a lot ofÂ sayings from friends, family members, and even strangers:Â âTrae, you have really pretty eyesâ or âYou could kill someone with eyes like that.âÂ  People would even ask me to take off my glasses just to get a glimpse of what color my eyes were. I knew that my eye color was pretty unusual compared to my peers. Before I researched the origins of green eyes, I asked myselfâare green eyes really attractive as people make it? Why are green eyes so rare?  One of the most common eye colors in the population is brown eyes . About 55% of people in the world have brown eyes. Brown eyes have dominant traits, and they are usually darker in color. The second common eye color is blue . However, green eyes are considered the rarest eye color. So, what makes green eyes rare? First of all, green eyes, in contrast to the common eye color, lack melanin (dark pigmentationÂ that occurs in specific parts of the human body).Â Approximately 2% of people in the world have green eyes, and thatâs a very small percentage.  Green eye color. Created by Catsastrific.  The most interesting thing about green eyes is that they are not naturally shown until a baby is at least 6 months old. Babies who eventually have green eyes are typically born with lighter eye colors, like gray or blue.  Because of these factors, green eyes prove to be an attractive trait. In fact, based on a study from All About Vision, a survey was created to determine which eye color is considered the most appealing to the person. The results demonstrated that 20.3% of the responses chose âgreenâ as their preference, whileÂ âlight blueâ and âhazelâ eye colors have 3.4% less responses. The survey concluded that the majority appeal is due to the unusualness of the eye color.  The conclusion: Green eyes are considered attractive because itâs a rare color. Common eye colors like brown, blue, even black, are typically seen all around because of its pigmentation. Green eyes, however, are rarely seen and thatâs what makes them appealing.  Iâm pretty satisfied with my eye color. Not just because of the compliments, but my eye color makes me different. Perhaps thatâs why people adore Channing Tatum so much?

I have a feeling that this is something you canât really boil down and address. The whole idea of the word âattractiveâ is that it applies to someoneâs opinion and develops their interest more.  Green eyes are rare yes, but they could be present in anyone and be many different shades of green. How attractive someone with green eyes is depends on so many outside variables and opinions. Iâm thinking that maybe this is too affected by chance and possibilities to be tackled logically.

Suddenly their daughter has green eyes.  And no one can recall any green-eyed relative.  This can seem especially weird when you have a perfectly good explanation for a different eye color.  From your description, you and your husband wouldn't have blinked an eye if your daughters' eyes had stayed blue.  But they didn't.  The most obvious explanation is that you and your husband carry the green eye version of an eye color gene along with your blue and brown versions.  This is possible because green eyes are due to a different gene than brown eyes.  So you and your husband have a brown version of one eye color gene.  And a green eye color version of another gene.  And undoubtedly some blue eye versions of these genes too!  What a mess!  Don't worry, though, I can take you through this.  I'll first talk about how eye color is thought to work.  Then I'll talk about how green eyes may have stayed hidden in your family for many years before being seen in your daughters.  At Least Two Genes Determine Eye Color  Before getting into eye color genes, let's first discuss genes in general.  Genes are like the individual recipes that make up a cookbook.  Each recipe is for a certain dish.  And each gene is for a certain part of us.  All of us have recipes for the same dishes in our cookbooks.  What makes each cookbook different is that each recipe for the same dish is slightly different.  So all of our cookbooks have cookie recipes.  It is just that some of us have chocolate chip recipes.  And others of us have recipes for peanut butter crisps.  Our genes are very similar to this.  For example, we all have the same two eye color genes.  What gives us different eye colors are which variations of these genes we have.  One of these genes is called HERC2.  It comes in two variations, brown and blue.  The other gene, called gey, also comes in two versions -- green and blue.  Your eye color depends on which combination of these versions you have as shown below:   If you have a brown version of HERC2, you'll have brown eyes no matter what the gey gene is.  If you have only blue versions of HERC2, then which version of gey you have determines your eye color.  If your HERC2 is blue and your gey is green, you have green eyes.  And if you only have blue versions of both genes, then you have blue eyes*.  We Have Two Copies of each of our Genes  As you have probably noticed, this isn't enough information yet to explain what happened in your family.  If you have the brown version of HERC2, then you would pass it onto your children.  And they would have brown eyes no matter what their gey gene was.  The other bit of information we need to explain all of this is the fact that we have two copies of most of our genes -- one from mom and one from dad.  So we have two copies of HERC2 and two copies of gey for a total of four possible gene versions.  Next I'll show you a table that gives all the possible combinations of these versions and the eye color you would have.  To make things simpler, I'll use genetic shorthand.  In this shorthand, the brown version of HERC2 is B and the blue version is b.  And the green version of gey is G and the blue version b.  Here is the table:   The simplest explanation for your situation is that you and your husband are either BbGG or BbGb (one of you could also be Bbbb).  Doesn't seem very simple does it"Â¦  The key is that each of you must carry a blue version of the HERC2 gene.  If each of you does, then you each have a 50-50 shot of passing that blue version of HERC2 to your kids.  This means that each of your kids has a 1 in 4 chance of getting a b from each of you and having an eye color other than brown. They'll have green eyes if they also get at least one G version of the gey gene.  ( Click here to see where the 1 in 4 came from.)  OK, so if you both carry a b version of HERC2, you can theoretically have green-eyed kids.  But where did the G version of gey come from?  And why hasn't anyone seen green eyes in your family before?  Recessive Genes Can Stay Hidden for a Very Long Time  By their very nature, recessive genes can be hidden.  For example, take a look at the eye color table.  There are nine different possible combinations of genes.  Six of these combinations lead to brown eyes.  And four of these brown eyed combinations carry a green version of gey.  Let's show how this can lead to green eyes staying hidden for many generations.  Imagine this family tree:   Here you can see that green eyes stay hidden for at least three generations.  And this sort of thing could have gone on for many, many more generations so that green eyes stay hidden for hundreds of years.  Or even longer!  What I've done is numbered a couple of steps in the chart so you can see why green eyes stayed hidden.  These are just a couple of possible reasons and there are undoubtedly others. One parent was BB. If one of the parents is BB, then that parent can only pass a B to his or her kids.  The end result is all brown eyed children.  So in this case, the green would stay hidden. By chance, no green eyes were seen. Just because two parents could have a green eyed child, that doesn't mean they will.  For example, the children of two parents who are Bb have a 1 in 4 chance of an eye color other than brown.  But that doesn't mean these parents will for sure have a green or blue eyed kid.  Even if the parents had 10 kids, they still might only have blue or brown eyed children.  ( Click here for why this is.) So there you have it.  Green eyes can seemingly pop up out of nowhere because they are recessive to brown eyes.  And because green eyes are determined by a separate gene. * In genetics lingo, we say that brown is dominant over blue and green. And that green is recessive to brown but dominant over blue.  Blue is recessive to both.

Just look around you and take a good look at peoples eye colour. There is a high chance you will notice a lot of people with brown eyes. Brown eyes are by far most common in humans. In some countries, the brown eye colour is the only colour there is.  In other countries however, you would find a lot of diversity. Green, blue, hazel, grey and even violet eyes do exist as well.           Green eyes in the Middle East     Brown is the most common eye colour  In the US only 1 out of 6 people have a light (blue) eye colour. The brown eye colour is in the US the most prevalent. No surprise, because brown is also the dominant colour. In other countries, especially in northern Europe, brown is less common. Estonia for example is a very light eyed country with almost 98% having the blue eyes.   Africa is very brown   The further you go to the south, the more chance there is that you will find a person with brown eyes. In southern europe for instance, there is on average a change of 80% you will find a brown eyed person. Lighter eyes are also in southern Europe (Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece) less common. Further south, going to Africa, light eyes are almost disappeared.   Light eyes in Scandinavia   Scandinavians tend to have a very light appearence. Light eyes are definitely the standard in these northern countries. Sweden, Norway and Denmark all have high percentages of light eyed people. Also Finland and Iceland are extremely light with almost 90% of them having light eyes (green, grey and blue). Other ''northern'' countries like The Netherlands, Scotland and Germany have light eyed peoples too. In The Netherlands approximately 80% of the inhabitants have green or blue eyes. Germany (especially the northern part of the country) follows with almost 70% having lighter eye colours.   Green eyes are rare   Within the ''light'' eyed population, the green eyes are outnumbered by the blue eyes. Green eyes are dominant over the blue eye colour but there are only very few people that carry the genes responsible for green eyes. Only 1-2% of the entire human population have green eyes.   Shades of green eyes   Green eyes can look very different. They can be very dark, almost brown. Sometimes they are very light: almost neon. It all depends on the amount and type of melanin inside the iris. If you have a lot of melanin, your eyes look darker and if you have only a tiny bit, your eyes tend to look very light (bright).  The light green eyes are most common in Iceland, The Netherlands, Scotland, Ireland, Estonia and Scandinavia. Dark green eyes can be find all over Europe, the US and even in Pakistan.       Dark green eyes      Light green eyes                                            Green eyes and red hair  Scientist suspects there is a relation between red hair and the green eye colour. It looks like there is a high correlation between those two human traits. Having the red hair colour is also very unique (and recessive). Only 1 - 2 % of the entire human population have naturally red hair. Of course, not only red hair coexist with green eyes. Also blondes and darker hair colours tend to have green eyes (or the other way around).    Green eyes and gender  Normally, you would expect a 50/50 gender variation between the eye colours (blue, brown), but scientist found a positive correlation between being a woman and having the green eye colour. Why green eyes are more found in women is still unknown and it is not certain a gender differentiation actually exist. The findings could be biased somehow.      red hair, green eyes and being male: the odds are very low     Hazel eyes are Green eyes?  Some people confuse hazel eyes with green eyes. Hazel eyes are also very rare but are different than green eyes. First of all, hazel eyes have more melanin. They look more brownish and are overall a bit darker, sometimes with a golden teint. People with hazel eyes often notice a considerable change in their eye colour, especially when a lot of light reflect on their eyes. Secondly, some green eyes have a lot of yellow pigment in them. Hazel eyes share this yellow pigmentation hence the confusion.       Eyes with a Green-Hazel colour    Where do green eyes come from?  Green eyes can be found anywhere but you will find them most of the time in Europe. Some people believe green eyes came to existence due to a mixture of blue and brown eyes. This idea became popular because a lot of green eyes can be found in areas where brown and blue eyes came together. When we look at the map, the highest percentage of green eyes can be found in Scotland. Ireland also has (relative) a lot of green eyed inhabitants.   Green eyes have lipochrome. This lipochrome (also known as feomelanin ) is a yellowish pigment. People with green eyes and especially those with amber coloured eyes have a lot of this yellow lipochrome inside their irises. Those with blue, brown or grey eyes usually don't have any lipochrome. When you have a lot of lipochrome inside your iris, you might have the amber eye colour. When you only have a small portion of this yellow pigment, your eyes might look a bit more green/blue-ish.  The combination of the yellow pigment and low amount of melanin gives rise to light green eyes. When you have a moderate amount of melanin but also lipochrome, your eyes probably look darker green. When you only have a low amount of melanin (and no lipochrome), your eyes look blue.   Light Green Eyes: (very) low amount of melanin + moderate amount of lipochrome   Blueish Green Eyes : (very) low amount of melanin + low amount of lipochrome   Yellowish Green Eyes : (very) low amount of melanin + (very) high amount of lipochrome   Dark Green Eyes : moderate amount of melanin + moderate amount of lipochrome   Brownish Green Eyes : high amount of melanin + moderate amount of lipochrome   Blue Eyes : (very) low amount of melanin (no lipochrome)  Brown Eyes : (very) high amount of melanin (no lipochrome)  Amber Eyes : (very) low melanin + very high amount of lipochrome  Grey Eyes : low amount of melanin (no lipochrome)     Heterochromia Iridum  Some people have a truly unique thing going on with their eyes: they have more than one colour! When one eye has a different colour than the other; it is called heterochromia iridum. When only a small portion of the iris has a different colour, it is called: partial heterochromia.      complete heterochromia: blue and green  Read for more information (Dutch): Green Eyes: a rare trait in humans     Geplaatst door    Jonrik A     op  10:46             Email This BlogThis!

I am glad you mentioned of an additional pigment, lipochrome, in green and amber eyes.  Most articles just assume that green eyes are caused by an intermediate amount melanin.  What exactly is lipochrome?  Does it have other names? One additional point you may want to clarify:  From what I've read elsewhere, for blue versus brown eyes, it's not just the amount of melanin but rather the location.  Both blue and brown eyes have melanin in the back of the iris, but only brown eyes have melanin in the stroma, the front layer of the iris.  That the location of melanin, and not just the amount, affects eye color makes intuitive sense, as there are people with dark blue eyes (high amount in back of iris, none in the stroma), and others with light brown eyes (moderate amounts in both back of iris and in stroma). Thank you for your article.  What source did you read that discussed the lipochrome - I can find very few articles mentioning it.

My brother is blonde with blue eyes and mine is brown with blue eyes. I was wondering if there is a layer of pigmentation under the first layer (the one everyone can see)? If you look up close to my eyes, I noticed that it appeared as if there was a second layer of pigmentation. I have my pupil and then green with black streaks. Then, I have my blue pigmentation with whitish streaks. To be honest, I don't know if my eyes are blue or grey. They only change to grey some times if I wear blue clothing. Also, the green layer is a dull green and when my pupil shrinks, the blue closes in, but the green doesn't appear to move. The green really looks like another layer. It's like oil and water trying to mix. They are right next to one another, but they aren't mixing and seem separate. Or a better example, when you poor gelatin onto colored paper. They don't mix, it just appears like the colored paper is a layer behind the gelatin. I've seen this is some pictures of eyes, but I don't know why it's like that. The blue seems to just, "disperse" you could say. Like, poring powdered lemonade into water, the powder sort of strings out (bad example).  My friend has partial heterochromia. She was born with blue eyes and they didn't turn to hazel until she was around 5. There is a dark brown splotch in one eye that makes her whole eye look dark brown from a distance. Why is it that her eye color didn't change for such a long period of time and produced the splotch? Delete Rebecca Cardenas 16 January 2016 at 10:46 My husband has awesome eyes like yours sound, except his have dark green, light green, yellow and Amber splotches that actually look red, then both his eyes have a different arrangement of these colors. One of his eyes has a lot more amber in it. Also what he wears seems to make them appear as different colors, lighting does and he emotions change the color too! When he is tired I swear his eyes turn dark green, when he is very angry they seen to sparkle with vibrant colors. I just have light brown eyes, two of our sons gave Brown eyes too, one has dark and the other light, only our middle sin has hazel Brown eyes, they look different with what he wears, lighting or his moods too. Your families eye colors seem very pretty especially yours. I am jealous, want to trade? I have always wanted gray, violet or very light green/bluish eyes. Beautiful colors!! Ps. Make sure you color coordinate some blouses, dresses, shoes, scarves, purses and make-up for those eyes of yours. Show the beauties off for those of us stuck with poo-poo eyes.

Eye color is way more complicated than "mom has brown, dad has blue." We all carry 2 sets of genes and mutations happen along the way. It's definitely possible for 2 blue eyed parents to have a brown eyed child and vise versa. The genetic color possibility charts are online. You also have to remember that we aren't clones of our parents. Variations happen.

So they are not true green actually but heterochromatic (not hazel either as there is no actual brown, just yellow and blue-grey). What is most unusual about your eyes is the shape of the amber ring, it's really thick and looks like a sunflower! So pretty! My eyes were blue-grey until I was twelve and my mom's were the same color until she was in her forties (my brother still has bue-grey eyes, while my dad and sister both have sky-blue eyes). We both came down with the same autoimmune thyroid disorder and grew yellow rings which changed our eye color. Even though I have been in remission since I was fourteen my eyes never changed back. It's interesting how health can affect eye color. Delete Unknown 20 November 2015 at 02:45 That's really pretty. I've been trying to find an eye colour similar to mine on the web and I can't see anything when it comes up with green eyes. I've got goldfish brown around the pupil and a greyish blue green basic and then a really dark navy outline it's strange.... Delete Unknown 5 March 2016 at 04:37 My eyes are very similar, except that they have an outer medium bluish ring.  They go from amber near the pupil to the overall color of green, and then have that bluish ring around the iris.  I have been told they are very beautiful.  One of my daughters has the same color eyes as me.  The oldest has blue/gray eyes, and the youngest has a dark version of mine and my middle daughters eyes.  Genes do funny things.  My fathers eyes were a beautiful sky blue and my mothers were amber.

Reply Delete Marie Lavender 2 June 2015 at 19:40 Hi. I have dark green eyes with a dark blue outline. Everyone always calls them 'cat eyes'. LOL. I have definite Irish heritage. The funny thing is that everyone in my immediate and extended family has blue eyes, but I am the only one with green. And none of them can think of anyone deceased who had that color. Weird, huh? Reply Delete Anonymous 6 June 2015 at 17:47 My eyes are Amber, basically an orange gold color, it's super cool. Reply Delete JustARandom Troll 6 June 2015 at 21:44 All my life I thought i had golden hazel eyes but they are a steady light green with not much change in colour  either from golden green to light dark green in bright light. I always thought hazel was a light green color but i guess i was wrong.

Delete Reply JustARandom Troll 6 June 2015 at 21:58 All my life i thought hazel was a light greenish color but i guess i was wrong. My eyes change from light green to golden green depending on the amount of light. My dad also has green eyes but they are a really dark green and my mom has very light blue eyes so i guess that explains the yellow green that i have.. I just created a pof profile today and didn't know what to write down for my eye color and tried to figure what hazel is because it is written on my drivers license. I do have a bit brown in them but you have to look very closely to spot it so that is what kinda throws me off in trying to figure out if they are hazel or green. I could say they are 10 percent brown 30 percent yellow and 60 percent green. Reply Delete Anonymous 8 June 2015 at 01:26 Hi, interesting article, though as a green-eyed, dark-haired AFRICAN lady I disagree with the the following statement.  "Further south, going to Africa, light eyes are almost disappeared". In South Africa and Namibia especially, light coloured eyes are not that rare at all, in both countries there are so may different races/ethnic groups in Namibia there are at least 11 major groups.  In the Baster community in Rehoboth you'll find a lot of light-eyed people with light hair, red hair is is not that rare as well. Their ancestors were mainly of Dutch and German origin, my great-grandfather was Irish. In my family from my father's side, close and extended most have blue, green eyes.

Reply Delete Anonymous 4 August 2015 at 12:11 My eyes change all the way from clear blue to a deep emerald. The norm is a muted shamrock or mint color with a dark green rim and golden-yellow circle around the pupil. Reply Delete Anonymous 23 August 2015 at 05:10 My eyes changed from dark brown to hazel after I bumped my head. I believe this is the work of hidden genes. My grandfather has hazel eyes and my mother has brown eyes and my father has blue eyes so there would have been a 50% chance of having brown eyes; which I had then I would if anything have the hazel eyes genes because I got one of my mother's X chromosomes instead of my fathers since I am male. Reply Delete Anonymous 27 August 2015 at 02:47 Interesting how many green/olive/hazel/ amber eyed peple there are here!! How can this be, since green and hazel are such rare colors? I have hazel eyes too. They are so dark they look brown, but outside in the sun they look green. Dad has dark brownish green, mom has silver, very light grey. My hair color is dark ash, dark but not so much brown..not black either. Awful color if you ask me. By bro is really blond and has very blue eyes.. funny genes. Reply Delete Elena .Indipendente 13 September 2015 at 05:33 My mother has green eyes (not dark), my father had very light green-blue eyes. I have green eyes. We're northern Italians.

Reply Delete Anonymous 17 November 2015 at 05:21 I have very dark green eyes. My mom has green eyes with the slightest bit of brown around the edges, my dads eyes are really light blue and my sisters eyes are green/blue hazel.  I'm the only blonde.  Everyone else is a brunette. Reply Delete Anonymous 26 November 2015 at 01:01 I think I have sea green eyes mixed with grey because my eyes flip through green, blue, grey, and teal/turquoise kind of changes. People say I have hazel eyes because of the gold ring around the pupil. I also have one fleck of heterochromia in one eye and it's not noticeable unless your face is too close for my comfort. I was even told once that my eyes had become mahogany red colour for a minute in a certain light but I couldn't try it and its yet too happen again. So I dount know what eyes I have but on legal paper I have to put hazel. Reply Delete Anonymous 26 November 2015 at 16:12 I'm full Asian with brown eyes as a kid, but over the years they have lightened. I would say that they are hazel as they change color in the light. In my twenties, I noticed a green spot in one eyes, and now, in my forties, I have a gold-green ring that surrounds a light brown ring around the iris. So Asians can have light eyes! Reply Delete Unknown 11 December 2015 at 08:34 I have brown eyes and my kids father have brown eyes as well, my youngest was born with hazel eyes sometimes they look very green and yellow in the sun, I can't get enough of them. Reply Delete Unknown 3 January 2016 at 18:16 I have hazel eyes that look greyish with a orange ring around my pupil just like my mom, which has a hint more of brown but, my sister also has hazel but no ring and my dad brown eyes. I don't understand the reason for it being a orange ring? Reply Delete Unknown 17 January 2016 at 19:11 My eyes are very yellow green ( not a hint of blue) encircled with darker green with a couple of tiny copper dots thrown in. I've always thought just green but this article made me take a closer look. I'm Australian but of distant Irish and German descent so I suppose that makes sense. Reply Delete Anonymous 25 January 2016 at 15:17 so green eyes seem  plentiful here (52%) not as stated (1-2 %) comments seem also to be lacking with regard to the result of this poll and the abundance of all these green eyed pollers ï¿½ï¿½ Reply Delete Graywolf_1969 22 February 2016 at 14:55 Interesting article.  Might explain a bit about my eyes shifting colors to a yellow or yellow amber at times.  Not to sound strange, but it is true, I have noticed my eyes shifting during a full moon or when aroused. Reply Delete Anonymous 29 February 2016 at 19:51 Hey does anyone else call there eyes murky and an unknown color or is that just me. I have asked around and the responses I have received are all over the range of colors from dark brown to gray. Any idea what could cause this? Reply Delete Anonymous 5 March 2016 at 13:12 I have an eye color that I really cant determine at first it looks green but looking closer it looks grey with a lot of flecks of gold and a ring of light brown around the pupil.

And mine go from dark blue/grey molted pattern to a dark blue/green molten pattern. Reply Delete Anonymous 4 April 2016 at 15:18 For what it's worth, I have been told by some people that I have green eyes, and by others that my eyes are hazel. Given that I am also colour-blind [red/green], it is enormously confusing! I have to rely entirely on the perceptions of the viewer to know my own eye colour and when asked what colour my eyes are I have to admit that not only do I have no idea, but that nobody else does either. Anyone else out there have this problem? Reply Delete Replies Judy Pruitt 5 April 2016 at 07:42 My husband was color blind and blue eyed. I have brown eyes. Two of our 4 children have hazel eyes. But at different times of the day their eyes have more blue than green. When they have to fill out forms they just stuck with the hazel color. I doubt there's any scientific info to back it up but I think people with hazel eyes are extremely special to God.  So, stick to saying your eyes are hazel when it comes to legal firms. But in life in general, enjoy beingspecial. :). :). Delete Reply Acey Eliza 4 April 2016 at 16:34 Wondering if anyone has the same eye colour as me? When I've been asked for my eye colour, I say "Well, your guess is as good as mine" and then I've baffled the authorities. They're 4 distinct colours in one. They start off with a dark grey ring around the edge, then they blend into a marine-blue, the area closest to the pupil is taken up with a very bright green and I have flecks of hazel running throughout... mystery! Reply Delete Cynthia Clougher 13 April 2016 at 14:21 Today I met a jeweler who has a birthdate of July 22.  I said that my son also was born on that date.  he then states that I bet he has hazel eyes.  Mine are blue, by the way.  He says that there is a large group of people with the July 22 birthday who have hazel eyes. He became aware of this in California some years ago and has continually asked the same question of anyone with the same birthday as his.  What gives?? Reply Delete Jennifer 12 May 2016 at 13:41 I have green eyes. There is a blue ring on the inside, and a green ring on the outside. Everyone calls it gray!

In the center of the iris you can see a bit of amber with yellow. I like to think I have green eyes as hazel eyes are a light brown not green, according to some sources. Reply Delete Sophie A 22 August 2016 at 20:40 I'm confused about my eye color I wear glasses and when I have them on my eyes are hazel but when I take them off there lighter also when I'm in the sun they look sort ofbears green and when I'm in the bathroom and I look into the mirror they look light green and have a brown/blue outline around my eyes and I also have blond hair Reply Delete Anonymous 25 August 2016 at 08:24 This was a very interesting article.

My hair is ash/blonde but in the sun there is much red.  My skin is ivory, and I hail from Ireland (at least genetically 98.9%) Here is a question I have always had -- why, when I cry, do my eyes turn a neon-like green.  It's kinda spooky!

Whose eyes will your baby inherit - mother or father? Well, you donât have to wonder about it anymore. Our baby eye color calculator will give you a hint about what color eyes will soon be gazing at you. Try it out below!  Baby Eye Color Predictor  Mother's Eye Color    Blue  Brown   Green   Father's Eye Color   Blue   Brown  Green  Chances Of Your Baby Eye Color      Recalculate Which Genes Will Your Baby Inherit?    Baby Eye Color Chart Eye color is a physical trait determined by the pairing of genes from both the parents. The baby inherits 50% of eye color genetics material from each of its parents. Genes mutate to give alternative forms called alleles, and each allele slightly differs from the other. There are three pairs of alleles responsible for eye color with each allele giving either brown, green or blue. The brown allele is dominant over green and blue; green is dominant over blue and blue is recessive. The newborn's eye color depends on both the parents' eye color and whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. The child may get two dominant alleles from the parents, one dominant one recessive or two recessive alleles. The child will have brown eyes if it receives a recessive allele (blue) from one parent and a dominant allele (brown) from the other parent. Baby blue eyes depends if it receives blue alleles from both the parents. Since blue is recessive and there is no dominant allele, the child will have blue eyes. The child will have green eyes if it receives green alleles from both the parents or one green and one blue allele. Most of the babies born with blue eyes because the newborns take time for producing the pigment melanin.You cannot determine the exact color of the babyâs eyes until he or she turns three. What Determines Eye Color? Homozygous And Heterozygous Human beings have two copies of every gene. One is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father. Homozygous means that two copies match or are dominant (denoted by two capital letters such BB) and heterozygous means that the two copies of the gene differ or recessive (denoted by two small letters, bb). Dominant Eye Color  Brown and green are dominant eye colors. There is 75 to 95% chance of the baby getting brown or green eyes if both the parents have same colored eyes. Recessive Eye Color  Blue is a recessive eye color. Itâs highly unlikely for a baby to have blue eyes if both the parents have brown eyes. Genotype The genotype is the gene combination for a given trait, which, in this case, is the eye color. The mother and fatherâs genotype will determine the eye color of the children. Phenotype The phenotype is the physical appearance of the genotype, which in this case is the eye color. Will Your Babyâs Eyes Stay Blue? Most of the new born babies have blue eyes, which may change color over time. The eyes remain blue if both the parents pass their recessive blue genes to the child. If this is not the case, the baby's eye color changes to permanent color (brown, green or any other color) as he/she ages. At the time of birth, there is a deficit of melanin pigment, but with time the iris starts producing melanin to give the eyes their actual color. It takes about six months to one year for the baby's actual eye color to surface. Most babies of Caucasian origin have dark blue eyes when born. However, the original color, be it brown, green, blue or hazel, will be determined over time. The child will get the actual eye color with exposure to light, and it depends on the amount and diffraction of light. Likewise, Asian and African origin babies have brown or dark gray at the time of birth. They turn black or real brown over time. During birth, the infant eye color is light, since new born babies do not have active melanin which darkens the cells. Once your baby is 6months old, the eye color begins to change. Gradually, the eye color takes on a different shade as per the genetic inheritance. Such change starts around the age of six months. By the age of three, kids have a definite eye color, which does not change further. Interpretation Of Baby Eye Color If both the parents have blue eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will have blue eyes. If both the parents have brown eyes, there are 75% chances that the baby will have brown eyes. If both the parents have green eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have green eyes. If both the parents have hazel eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have hazel eyes. The hazel eyes are still a mystery. The baby eye color calculator cannot accurately predict the likelihood of your child having hazel eyes, as this eye color is often a mixture of brown, green and amber hues. Most Frequently Asked Questions Around Baby Eye Color Calculator Q. What Is Baby Eye Color Calculator?  A baby eye color calculator is an online calculator that can help parents predict the eye color of their children. It tells the likelihood of the babyâs eye color on the basis of eye color genetics using color of the parentsâ eyes. Q. How Accurate Are These Baby Eye Calculators?  Baby eye calculators are not entirely accurate as genes contribute to the eye color. Also, they do not explain hazel and other shades of brown. So weâd suggest you not to depend entirely on the calculator. Q. What is Waardenburg Syndrome?  There are cases when babies are born with one eye as brown and another eye as blue. It is because of a medical condition called Waardenburg syndrome. However, this is a rare genetic disorder. In such cases, it is essential that you consult an ophthalmologist. Studies are going on to find accurate reasons behind the changes in eye color of a newborn. Q. What is Heterochromia?  Heterochromia is a genetic or acquired eye condition that affects iris. The baby with this condition ends up having two eye colors i.e. having eyes with different colors. In complete heterochromia, each iris has a different color. Mostly, one is blue and the other brown. Sectoral (partial) heterochromia is where only a portion of iris has a different color. Central heterochromia is when the inner ring has a different color from the outer ring. Genetic heterochromia is an autosomal dominant condition. The child has about 50% chance of inheriting the condition and a 50% chance of passing it to their offspring. The causes of acquired heterochromia include glaucoma, inflammation, Waardenburg syndrome, neurofibromatosis, injury, and illnesses. Most of the cases are benign and congenital. There is no treatment for heterochromia if it is genetic. But if it is due to an underlying condition (acquired), that condition needs to be treated. Some cases of acquired heterochromia may even shorten the lifespan.

Other information about various shades of green eye color will be touched upon, including popular hues. Are you ready? Letâs jump right in! What is the science of Green Eyes? Male Green Eyes WHAT IS THE SCIENCE OF GREEN EYES? Many people want to know where green eyes come from. Ultimately, eye color is a function of genetics and is determined by two factors: (1) the pigmentation of the iris and (2) the way light scatters around the iris itself. Letâs take a quick look at both. Pigmentation of a personâs iris can run the gamut from the darkest color, black to lightest, blue. Largely influencing pigmentation is something called melanin , a complex polymer made from the amino acid tyrosine. The appearance of green and shades of green (i.e. jade, hazelÂ eyes and emerald) are the result of a Â phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering; which is a 25 cent term used to describe the way light scatters after riding its spectrum wavelength. Most people mistakenly believe that colors like green and blue are in the iris â but theyâre not. Your eye color is a function of how light diffuses across the melanin base, which again is genetically determined. Credit: Wiki Commons GREEN EYES: ORIGINS AND GENES Old theory Prior to 2008, scientists thought eye color was determined by one dominant gene. It was postulated that an eye color hierarchy existed with brown being at the top of the ladder and blue resting at the bottom. Under the old way of thinking, this meant if your dad had brown eyes and your mom had blue eyes, you would likely be born with brown colored eyes. A parental combination of two green eyes would translate into you having green eyes. Recessive genes were also thought to partially influence eye color. New theory New research, presented in a 2008 publication of the American Journal of Human Genetics washed the old way of thinking about eyes and color. The new research suggests that as many as 16 genes may influence the way color is expressed in the iris. The unscientific translation means that a baby can be born with just about any eye color, regardless of what their parents have. It is important to note, however, that hereditary variables need to be factored into the equation. The video below offers an excellent scientific analysis of how people get different color eyes, including green, blue, brown, hazel and some rare variations. GENETIC PREVALENCE OF GREEN EYES Interestingly enough, there are anthropological records of early humans with green eyes living around the mountain system in Eurasia between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. This area contained aÂ natural land bridge between Europe and Asia. Knowns as the âSilk Routeâ or âSilk Roadsâ; this ancient passageway was used by early civilizations for the lucrative trade silk, sometimes between 120 BCE â 1450s CE (Yao, et all, 2000). The silk route is thought to be a major reason for the distribution of green eyes WHERE DO GREEN EYES COME FROM? We know from history that Silk Road played an important role in the creation of the civilizations of China, the Goguryeo kingdom in Korea, much of Japan, the Indian subcontinent, parts of Persia and the Horn of Africa and Arabia. Because it served as a significant trade route for many early traders, it is thought that mating between various groups may have been part of gene distribution. This may help to explain why green eyes can be found in various groups across Europe, Africa and Asia. GENETIC ANTHROPOLOGY AND EYE COLOR Genetic anthropology is growing branch of science that examines DNA testing with concrete archaeological, historical and language-based evidence to uncover the history of ancient migration patterns in early human civilizations. Thanks to this emerging area of research, scientists are learning more and more about the etiology of eye color. This is why today, you can have your DNA tested to determine your genetic background. In turn, this may help to explain the genetic reasons for your ocular hue. GREEN EYES AND GEOLOGIC TIME Much of Europe, Asia and Africa and large swaths of the middle east have been native lands to people with green eyes for centuries. When studying the geologic time scale; a tool used to measure our planets history, it is thought that green eyes may have appeared in people of Iranian, Spanish, Brazilian and Pakistani decent sometime during the late part of the Cenozoic period . Specifically, this would be between theÂ Pleistocene and Holocene epochs some 2 to 3 million years ago.  Any race, including people who are Caucasian, Asian, African, Native Indian, Pacific Islander, Hispanic and pre-Colombians (Indigenous Peoples of the Americas) canÂ have green colored eyes. Anthropologists believe eye color, like hazel, blue, brown and green,Â are the direct result of migratory behaviors. Because of inter-mixing of groups, coupled with thousands of genetic mutations, we see various shades of green throughout modern man. Jessee Metcalfe has green eyes.

Many people are curious if eye color can change. The answer is â absolutely! People with green, blue or brown eyes all experience change in color from time to time. Causes for eye color changes include: The way light scatters Mood Health/Medical reasons HOW EYE COLOR CAN CHANGE DUE TO HEALTH The color of your iris can permanently change if you have glaucoma and take certain medications for treatment. If you have light colored eyes and want to keep them, you need to be extremely careful with the glaucoma medications you take. Make sure you consult with your eye doctor to discover all of the facts. Other reasons eye color can change to certain types of diseases. Examples include Hornerâs syndrome and Fuchâs heterochromic iridocyclitis. Should you notice any changes in the color of your eyes, contact your doctor immediately. Green eyes of Tom Welling: Credit insoonia.com GREEN EYES AND HEALTH RISKS If you have green eyes, you are more susceptible to the sunâs harmful radiation. This has to do with our old friend melanin previously mentioned. Simply put, green eyed people can develop certain types of ocular cancers, like intraocular melanoma . People with light colored eyes should wear UV protective sunglasses when outdoors. Jensen Ackles has light green eyes: Credit Fanpop PHENOMENON OF RAYLEIGH SCATTERING As mentioned previously, green eyes, blue eyes and brown eyes do not actually have these colors deposited into the iris. In truth, your eye pigmentation has a little brown in them. Because of the phenomenon of Rayleigh scattering, your eyes will reflect back a certain colored hue. Green eyes can come in different shades Green eyes with gold specs of Eddie Redmaybe HOW LIGHT CHANGES EYE COLOR Using the prior mentioned scientific principle of Rayleigh scattering, transformation of light particles that land on the iris will impact its coloristic appearance. This can result in a person having hazel, amber, jade, emerald, blue and even gray! Other factors can influence the shade of green in eyes. Lighting: Artificial lighting (aka: light bulbs) can impact how eye color is experienced. The intensity of the light hitting your iris will either amplify or soften your irisâs appearance.  Time of day: Light from the sun may be more intense earlier in the day or later, which means your iris will âpick-upâ different intensities from the solar spectrum .  Reflective colors: The color of everything around you, including the cloths you have on, can intensify how eye color is experienced. Certain colors, like gold, blue and other greens can amplify the flecks reflecting outward from your Iris.  Makeup: Some people wear eye-makeup, like gold and purple eye-shadow, to accentuate the natural green of the iris. This can cause the desired effect of having chameleon eyes.  Gorgeous makeup makes a line of eye shadow specifically designed for people with green eye color. Allergies: Some people with allergies have âscratchy eyesâ which can cause the surrounding âwhitesâ of the eyes to become red (aka: bloodshot eyes). This can have the effect of amplifying your eye color and creating baggy eyes.Most people do not desire this look.  Emotional state: While your emotional state does not directly change the color of your eyes, what you are feeling at any given point in time can impact how they are perceived. Specifically, if you are depressed and crying, your pupil may dilate, which may give off a darker appearance.  Substances: Use of alcohol, uppers, downers and other kinds of medications can cause your pupils to become larger or smaller. The end result can mean your eye color becomes more intense. Josh Henderson has a green eye and blue eye because of heterochromia. HETEROCHROMIA Some people have a condition called heterochromia that causes one eye to be one color (like green) and the other eye to be a different color (like blue). While multiple causes have been suggested, the current scientific thinking suggests that a lack of genetic diversity is the main reason for heterochromia. It is thought that the condition is caused by a mutation of the genes determining melanin distribution, which often becomes changed due to chromosomal homogeneity. The photograph above of actor Josh Henderson is an example of someone with heterochromia. Notice one of his eyes are green. The other is blue. Very rare and unique. NOTE OF CAUTION If your eye color changes suddenly or if you notice your pupils remain dilated for no apparent reason for an extended period of time, contact your physician immediately. Your eyes are not something you want to play with. What Do Your Eyes Say About You Video Channing Tatum has a unique pair of green eyes that are almost jade.

DID GREEN EYES COME FROM ALIENS? The color of your eyes is unique. No two people have exactly the same eye color, unless they are identical twins. When we examine the origins of eye color, we can see their evolution changed over the course of time. It has been postulated that adaptations in eye color occurred as a result of a changing environment. Some people believe green eyes and blue eyes are the result of an alien species depositing their DNA into the human genome.Â  But if you look at other species on our planet, you will see eye colors come in rainbow, including oranges, reds and yellows. Did these differing ocular colors come from aliens as well? FINAL THOUGHTS ON GREEN EYES We are still learning a great deal about eye color with new research happening every day. There have also been advancements changing eye color of the iris through medical procedures . And of course, you can always buy colored contacts to make your eyes blue green , hazel or brown!

John Michael  says:   December 14, 2015 at 12:00 am  Thats interesting because I have blond hair and green eyes being the only one in my family.

But I wasnât.  Really!

At least I can fall back on the fact that Iâm 3/4 Irish!  All the boys in my family have blue eyes, and all the girls have brown or hazel.  I feel like an oddball!   Christopher Poblete  says:   November 5, 2015 at 4:43 pm  Yes, among my large family (grandma, uncles, cousins, etc) I am the only one with green eyes. Well, my bio dad has green eyes, but my mum is a single mother, so I barely know him. But itâs not just about the eye colour, itâs something more, like behaviour, itâs strange o:   belaboa9  says:   November 5, 2015 at 7:52 pm  Are you the black sheep of the family?  I am.  Iâm considered the âweirdâ one because Iâm the smartest, most creative, adventurous, risk-taking and mystical one.  I follow my own path no matter what anyone else says.  And I have snakes! LOL  And two rescue dogs.

So how is your behaviour different from the rest of your familyâs?   Alejandro Ontiveroz  says:   February 10, 2016 at 8:02 pm  I have green eyes too and so does my sister. I guess it is because my dad has vary light blue eyes and my mom has semi dark brown eyes. I only know 3 people with green eyes. But i donât think im very attractive. Im a male and i have girl like features. And i have long hair.   belaboa9  says:   February 11, 2016 at 6:36 pm  Yeah, but how old are you?

Even Aunts an Cousins sea of blue eyes!   belaboa9  says:   June 24, 2016 at 8:39 pm  Like I said to someone else, it must be a really recessive gene that decided to resurface, unless we are adopted, or our daddies arenât really our daddies!

Both parents, and all siblings have blue eyes. Also, all blood relations on both sides have blue eyes. Not one brown eye, and Iâm the one green eye. Itâs always bothered me!   belaboa9  says:   June 22, 2016 at 2:12 pm  Me, too!  Iâve always wondered how many generations back in my family I would have to go, to find another green-eyed person.  Itâs got to come from the Irish side, or maybe thereâs a little bit of gypsy on the Italian side!  In any case, Iâll never know!   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:52 pm  In Nursing School I was told eye color only comes from parents. Iâve wondered about my paternity every since. I am the odd ball! Not just eye color either. To chicken to ask. Lol My mother said IT WAS THE EVIL COMING OUT IN ME when I mentioned it once! Donât know if that was joke, but I never mentioned it again   belaboa9  says:   June 23, 2016 at 1:22 am  LOL!  I learned the same thing in Nursing School!  Thatâs why I always thought I was adopted.  But I wasnât.  Iâve got my birth certificate, and all my baby pictures are in the family albums!  It must be a really recessive gene which has resurfaced! ????  Lucky for us!   Shannon Mullis-Long  says:   October 6, 2015 at 9:31 am  Myself and three cousins have green eyes.

Glen  says:   December 12, 2015 at 9:20 pm  I had blue eyes as a child, which was odd at the time as both my mother and father has brown, (I also had blonde hair as a child but now it is dark brown) Iâm 35 now and my eyeâs are now a deep shade of green and have been since a young age, I am the youngest of 4 and the only other person in my immediate family with green eyes is my eldest brother. I wasnât aware green eyes were considered rare.   Tucker  says:   March 21, 2017 at 6:00 pm  I had blue eyes as a young child but they turned to green before my teens.

It makes me feel uneasy when I notice someone staring at my eyes. From my perspective I seem to be hyper sensitive to light compared to most people. I squint a lot which gives others the impression that Iâm mad or something. LOL   Eric Weeber  says:   June 18, 2016 at 4:51 pm  i know the feeling with that one..mine are light to mid green and i have always squinted alot due to light.

Every eye has itâs own and special shade that makes them beautiful in its way! Yours sure are too! ð   Nicole Lovelace  says:   September 1, 2016 at 9:25 pm  Thatâs not true, green is a beautiful color. Even if they werenât rare, they would still be a popular eye color.   Carla  says:   September 6, 2016 at 6:42 pm  Indeed, but Iâm not talking about preference but about rareness. Think about itâ¦ If 90% of the population had green eyes and only 10% had, for example, brown eyes, which color would be more desiredâ¦ green or brown? I honestly think that itâs more a matter of exclusiveness than color. And please donât think that Iâm saying this beacause I donât love my eye color or something. I actually do have green eyes, I just donât like when people compare themselves with others, just because they donât have what those people do have and donât feel special because of it. If that even makes senseâ¦ :S xD (Sorry if Iâm a little off with my writing skills, not my mother tongue xD, And sorry too for that unnecessary large reply xD)   Michele Kasel  says:   April 29, 2016 at 11:13 pm  i have green eyes and if i wear violet-blue contact lenses they look cool!   i also have brown contactsâi guess i get sorta bored with the same color eyes for 50 years LOL   Gabbyy Fratt  says:   May 12, 2016 at 9:33 pm  I have green eyes but if u look close they have a little bit of light brown in the middle then blue all around the rest but farther away they r bright green itâs rlly weird   Carla  says:   May 22, 2016 at 12:50 pm  This only means that you have some shade of hazel eyes. Half brown, half green, and sometimes some blue too!   hunter  says:   May 12, 2016 at 9:36 pm  i have green eyes and my parent have them to and my brother and sister and all my other family members have them to   Ann  says:   July 26, 2016 at 6:26 pm  Same with me, except I donât know about extended family.   Tyler Karl Lia  says:   May 18, 2016 at 3:03 am  Would have like the article, but the mixed race bastards who have my eyes ruined it.   Frank E Richardson  says:   May 19, 2016 at 5:09 pm  I got my green eyrs from my father, and they ate popular on that dide of my family, i thought it was an Irish trait   Frank E Richardson  says:   May 19, 2016 at 5:11 pm  I got my green eyes from my father and they are popular on that side of my family, i thought it was an Irish trait   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:58 pm  Very rare eye color always new that, but was surprised how rare!  Pretty sure in the case of eyes it only Parents not like Hair color or skin! Not sure why!   Deborah Wilbourn  says:   May 24, 2016 at 12:07 am  Iâm the middle child of 5 children both father and mother have brown eyes older brother blue eyes older sister younger sister and younger brother all have brown eyes. As far back as I can trace  in family history mostly blue eyes and brown eyes going back to my great grandparents none with green eyes can be found.  I do have one daughter with green eyes the other with blue, their dad has blue eyes. This article I read has a lot of information that is true for me and the trait of having green eyes, however I do believe there is much more information missing due to my age and experience.   Stephanie  says:   May 28, 2016 at 5:35 pm  There goes my Mendel Pundit square argument Big B little b times Big B little b gets 2 Brown eyes BB 50!per cent blue eyes Little b little b All that is down the tubes   Stephanie  says:   May 28, 2016 at 5:37 pm  My father brown eyes My mother blue 2 dark eyed sister 2 blue eyed( Iâm considered blue but Iâm green)   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:56 pm  As long as you have a brown eyed parent they whole all eye color genes. A brown eye parent can have any eye color child from how I understood it in school   Denis St  says:   June 14, 2016 at 5:23 pm  What should I sayâ¦ My eyes turned from light blue to grassy/olive green in 8-9th grade, one of my eye corner has a little part of light blue, but hardly noticeable (unless you pay close attention) my hair from ginger turned to the darkest brown/black then it turned into almost dirty blonde color..   Beth  says:   June 16, 2016 at 2:33 am  Eye color doesnât run the âgambit,â people. It runs the âgamut.â A gamut is a scale; a gambit is a chess move, or other scheme.

The hottest guy I ever met had this brown eyes that make me felt like a whole hidden universe was beneath them.. that he wouldnât show. So use your brownies and do the same with cute guys! But be nice. Donât underestimate the power. Donât be mean as this guy ALMOST did <3   GC  says:   August 15, 2016 at 7:26 pm  I am 100% Mexican and have green eyes that can look bright blue when I wear blue or in all white environments.  I was told I was born with sky blue eyes but they changed color when I was 8-9 month old to green.  All the members of my bio father have green eyes and his father as well.  All my motherâs have brown except for her great grandmma who had blue.  Im older now and notice my eye color is changing to more blue than green, I donât like that!  And never knew they were rare??  I went to grammar school in small town in central Mexico.  Out of a class of about 25, 6 kids had green eyes, WTH??  And I never knew why I was sensitiv to bright light and I hate the sun!!  I was freaked to learn in the poll, I am Latino, a Scorpio and other traits I can relate to LoL!  Thx   BTDTGTTS  says:   August 16, 2016 at 3:29 pm  My husband has one blue and one green eye.  I have pale grey blue eyes.  My son has brilliant blue eyes with a dark ring around them and a few yellow specks.  My daughter has soft green eyes with a dark ring and yellow specks.  I love all their eye colors and just wish mine werenât so wishy washy grey blue.   Le Panayi  says:   November 23, 2016 at 4:38 pm  grey-blue is a great eye colour!   David  says:   August 17, 2016 at 9:18 am  I have green eyes which are very sensitive to light or even a breeze (especially a winter one). I used to get compliments about my eyes when I was younger but not so much now. ð I like the fact that they are a rare trait.   Gulfidan  says:   September 8, 2016 at 5:25 pm  Well I do have very different green eye color most people they donât believe it is my regular color???? I am Turkish and no one in my family have my eye color! When I cry it turns to bright green when I go out sunny day turns to yellow when I am angry dark green???? Well thank you dr John Moore for great article!   John D. Moore  says:   September 8, 2016 at 6:12 pm  Thanks and great pic!   OlivierDMG  says:   September 10, 2016 at 6:31 pm  yup people notice my eyes and start to tell me how beautiful they are, sometimes itâs just weird.   ahls  says:   September 11, 2016 at 3:26 pm  I used to have brown eyes, here is my video what i did to change it to hazel green  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOe00BkUbjE   Tonia Gleaton  says:   September 27, 2016 at 1:16 pm  NO Green eyes on my mothers side of the family they are all BLUE or BROWN on my Dadâs side BLUE,BROWN a,small % of GREEN eyes,  I am one of those with the GREEN eyes and always been very proud of them for sure. I have a sister with HAZEL eyes but her eyes have more BROWN then GREEN in them but they are still beautiful, my brother her TWIN has CRYSTAL BLUE eyes. I am working on our genealogy and had a gathering this summer of cousins and family that I had never met but it AMAZED me that 90% and that maybe LOW!!! They were GREEN eyed it was varies shades but they were GREEN eyed . I have never seen that many GREEN eyed people in one place it was AWESOME   Americkan  says:   October 23, 2016 at 3:36 pm  I have very green eyes and very fair skin,when I was born and until about four my hair was white,then went to blond,then light brown. At the ripe age of 35 my hair went from light brown right back to white/silver. My eye color however remained green. My parents and 4siblings do not have green eyes, only me. Until recently I never gave my eye color much thought but now I think Iâm just a little unique.   Di  says:   October 26, 2016 at 11:03 pm  I have green eyes and thought it was a common color, maybe not.   Hamza Asghar Khan  says:   November 5, 2016 at 3:39 am  My Eyes are extremely dark..

My mother said when I was born my eyes were so blue they looked purple and stayed that way for 3 years. Now people donât believe Iâm not wearing contacts. Itâs creepy for me. I canât even look people in the face directly   Bedra Ogdee  says:   June 21, 2017 at 5:40 pm  My eyes are also green. My mother said that when I was born they were so blue that they looked purple and my hair was jet black. I am of Lebanese and Hispanic descent. I am the only one in the family including my fathers side and my mothers side. None of my cousins on either side. I do get many compliments and sometimes I get very embarrassed. I am proud to know that green eyes are rare.   Meryl Burke  says:   January 4, 2017 at 4:47 am  Dr. John Moore, Fun article but Iâve got to let you know for some reason hue was spelled incorrectly as hew. Thanks, Truly, green eyes.   John D. Moore  says:   January 4, 2017 at 9:02 am  Thanks, Iâll correct!   Rinny  says:   January 14, 2017 at 4:02 pm  I do not believe green eyes are rare. I know many many people with green eyes.

I have night blindness to some degree and my eyes are slightly light sensitive My hair is blondish red naturally.

Kimberly Shand  says:   April 18, 2017 at 8:07 pm  Well, now I know why people always freak out when they realize I have green: They think I possess powers, or was influenced by an alien. Seriously?

For the Love of Purple  says:   May 3, 2017 at 3:09 am  Interesting I am A- and I have deep green eyes that change colours between âgoldâ âblueâ or âHazelâ  depending on the colour of clothing I wear or the eye makeup I apply.  I have been told that my eyes are both intense and unnerving on many occasions throughout my life.  What is interesting to myself, is that I can meet someone look, into their eyes and instantly within a millisecond know whether they are a friend or foeâ¦   Brandy Grote  says:   June 5, 2017 at 6:03 pm  Glad to know it isnât DNA based!  Dad has lovely mahogany eyes, Mom has pale jade green eyes.  (Both brothers have the same brown as Dad.) Mine were deep blue as a young child, going turquoise, then changing from blue to green based on my strong emotions as a young adult.  Now they are nearly always green, with some blue tint that gets more or less each day. Hair is light amber brown.

Italy is heavily influenced by the entire Mediterranean with many people who have lighter color eyes.   Christina Miracola  says:   July 27, 2017 at 4:39 pm  so Italian people most likely have light eyes because I am full Italian like my mom and dad are both itailan   Christina Miracola  says:   July 27, 2017 at 4:37 pm  I am the only one with green eyes in my family but my grandpa on my moms side has like blue and green eyes. But my two brothers have hazels eyes that sometimes turn like dark blue with brown around the blue. Comments are closed.

Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful.

Animated video showsÂ the likelihood of a child's eye colour based on what their parents have  A video shows likelihood of child's eye colour based on parents Parents with green and brown eyes can have a child with blue eyes Dominant gene from parents is the determining factor of a baby's eyes By Alisha Buaya For Daily Mail Australia   Published: 22:59 EDT, 12 May 2016 |  Updated: 23:37 EDT, 12 May 2016              e-mail          145  shares     131  View comments     Did you know if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your baby could have blue eyes? A video shared on My Child Magazine Australia 's Facebook page has crunched the numbers and shows the likelihood of  a baby having a certain eye colour based on what their parents have. For example, if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your child is 50 per cent more likely to have brown eyes, but also has a 38 per cent chance of having green eyes and a 12 per cent chance of having blue eyes. Scroll down for video          Brown eyed boy: Video shows what your baby's eye colour could be based on you and your partners eyes                      It's all in the genes: If you and your partner have green eyes, you baby is likely to have green eyes too If you have blue eyes and your partner has brown, there's a 50-50 chance your baby will have either of those colours, according to the video. While if both parents have green eyes, their baby has a 75 per cent chance of having the same colour, a 24 per cent chance of having blue eyes and a one per cent chance of having brown eyes. Eye colour is a hereditary trait from parents and determines a baby's eye colour. One eye colour can be more expressive, or dominant, than another, and can therefore dictate what a baby's eye colour will be. Brown eyes are dominant over green or blue, while green is always dominant over the recessive blue eyes gene, according to Huggies.com.au .

I love how knowing just a little bit about mom and dad can, with startling accuracy, predict what baby will look like even before baby is born. One of the easier traits to predict is eye color. âWhat color eyes will my baby have?â is a question that can be answered just by knowing what eye color the parents have.  Want to know what eye color your baby might have? I created the simple chart below to help.  Note that this chart only takes into account parentsâ eye colors. Because it only factors in the phenotype (i.e. what color the eyes appear) and not the genes themselves, it is not going to be 100% accurate in every case. However, if you know grandparentsâ eye colors, too, you can tell with even more accuracy what color eyes your kids will have. To factor grandparentsâ eye colors into the equation, checkout TheTechâs baby eye color predictor here .

My boyfriendÂ´s parents have blue and green eyes and all of their 3 children have brown eyes!        Alkhilion     Well, his mom has had many friends then.        Pinkamena     What bullsh*t. Stop insulting people without any reasoning.  @Marissa Brown is indeed possible, maybe his granparents have brown eyes. The picture only works with the parentsâ data.        Marissa     yep, donât bother posting if itâs just to insult.        Anon     Because brown is dominant, so if either parent had a brown gene to pass on, their eyes would be brown.        marijana bircanin     me too my mom is blue dad is green and i brown GOD THAT IS POSSIBLE!!!!        Brown eyes     This chart is complete bollocks, blue + brown can absolutely get you green eyes, blue + blue can also get you brown eyes, so can green +green get you brown eyes and saying blue +blue means a 99% chance of blue eyes is bull crap, what knobend draw this chart up?        bmen     Blue plus blue  can never give brown, 2 recessives cant give a dominant but two dominants can give a recessive i.e brown plus brown can give a blue        Anon     Youâre wrong about most of those, but blue + brown can indeed make green.  Itâs pretty unlikely though.        Cait Zilla     I have blue eyes and my daughters father has brownâ¦.my daughter had blue eyes until she turned 3 and now they have been green ever since.        DF     Thatâs what I was thinking. I have hazel eyes, my husband has blue eyes and our son has green eyes!        GreenEye00     Itâs not that rare. My dad has dark brown eyes and my mom blue â all 3 of their children, myself included have bright green eyes.        Chelsea     pffft. You said bollucks XD        SL     You shouldnât put rude words in your post, you never know who might be reading it. There might be children reading your post right now, they shouldnât be exposed to language like that at the young age that some people who are reading this might be.        Shanon Mary Callahan Nolan     Blue and blue will result in a blue eyed baby. Because blue is a recessive allele blue eyes only occur when 2 recessive alleles are present. Meaning blue+blue=blue.        Kristen     Why do these things always leave out hazel eyes?        green     bullshit! my momâs eyes are brown and my dadâs are blue and both me and my sis have green eyes and diffrent shades of green        Fred     Brown + Brown = 101%? This chart is bullocks.        Heather Renee     My mom has brown and my dad has blue I have an unusual shade of olive green        green eyed girl     Yes itâs bollocks, my mum has blue eyes, my dad brown -me and my 2 sisters have green eyes!        Sergio Rios-Arrue     My mom has green eyes n my dad has brown =  i got brown eyes ( a bit lighter than my dads though).My brother also has brown eyes, and my stepmother has green eyes like my mom. I wonder if my wife has blue eyes, what eye color will my children have? But i just found out that my grandpa (mothers side) had blue eyes and i have a niece that both of her parents have dark brown eyes but she really got green eyes.        Dita     I have dark brown eyes, my husband has blue eyes but our child has green eyes.        michael     why do ppl always forget purple and red eyes?!        casey n     my mother has blue eyes and my father has brown and i came out with green so i find this bullshit unlss im not my father child which is bull to because i look just like him        brea     Well I have brown and my mom and dad have green and blue eyes What does that mean        marijana bircanin     me too and idk how        Jessica     This is so stupid your seriously saying that blue and brown eyes canât have a child with green eyes!!!  Well Iâm pretty sure that my dad has blue eyes and my mom has brown eyes and I must be some freak of nature cause I have green eye!!! Therefore this thing is totally untrustworthy!!!        Cait Zilla     I have blue eyes and my daughters father has brown eyes, thus my daughter whom of which is about to be turning 4 years old has green eyes. Her eyes were blue like mine until she turned 3 and ever since they have remained green. My son is 4 months old and im wondering if he too will have green eyes from the pair of us having blue and brown eyesâ¦.it makes sense to me for your child to end up with green eyes if Mom and Dad have blue and brown.        Natalie     My mom has brown eyes and my dad has blue eyes and i have green eyes so that picture is wrong        aligibson     my daughter has green eyes and my son in law has blue, but my grandson has brown.I have hazel and my husband has green.

The Most Common Eye Colors The human eye is both beautiful and unique. Much like a fingerprint, each individual's eye color is specific only to them, with no others sharing the same shape, color and appearance. So what eye colors are the most common, and which are the rarest? What is the most common eye color? Which eye color is the rarest? Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful. Additionally, thanks to colored contact lenses , it's possible to change your eye color even if you were born with a common brown.

I was born with green eyes , a trait that I took fromÂ my mother. At first, I never understood the constant compliments I received for my eye color.Â Iâve heard a lot ofÂ sayings from friends, family members, and even strangers:Â âTrae, you have really pretty eyesâ or âYou could kill someone with eyes like that.âÂ  People would even ask me to take off my glasses just to get a glimpse of what color my eyes were. I knew that my eye color was pretty unusual compared to my peers. Before I researched the origins of green eyes, I asked myselfâare green eyes really attractive as people make it? Why are green eyes so rare?  One of the most common eye colors in the population is brown eyes . About 55% of people in the world have brown eyes. Brown eyes have dominant traits, and they are usually darker in color. The second common eye color is blue . However, green eyes are considered the rarest eye color. So, what makes green eyes rare? First of all, green eyes, in contrast to the common eye color, lack melanin (dark pigmentationÂ that occurs in specific parts of the human body).Â Approximately 2% of people in the world have green eyes, and thatâs a very small percentage.  Green eye color. Created by Catsastrific.  The most interesting thing about green eyes is that they are not naturally shown until a baby is at least 6 months old. Babies who eventually have green eyes are typically born with lighter eye colors, like gray or blue.  Because of these factors, green eyes prove to be an attractive trait. In fact, based on a study from All About Vision, a survey was created to determine which eye color is considered the most appealing to the person. The results demonstrated that 20.3% of the responses chose âgreenâ as their preference, whileÂ âlight blueâ and âhazelâ eye colors have 3.4% less responses. The survey concluded that the majority appeal is due to the unusualness of the eye color.  The conclusion: Green eyes are considered attractive because itâs a rare color. Common eye colors like brown, blue, even black, are typically seen all around because of its pigmentation. Green eyes, however, are rarely seen and thatâs what makes them appealing.  Iâm pretty satisfied with my eye color. Not just because of the compliments, but my eye color makes me different. Perhaps thatâs why people adore Channing Tatum so much?

I have a feeling that this is something you canât really boil down and address. The whole idea of the word âattractiveâ is that it applies to someoneâs opinion and develops their interest more.  Green eyes are rare yes, but they could be present in anyone and be many different shades of green. How attractive someone with green eyes is depends on so many outside variables and opinions. Iâm thinking that maybe this is too affected by chance and possibilities to be tackled logically.

Eye Color          Back to Eye Color           English   EspaÃ±ol       We have green eyed identical twin girls. At birth their eyes were brilliant blue and they slowly changed to brilliant green. At 14 their eyes are still green. My husband and I have dark brown eyes. There are blue on both sides of the family. The girl's maternal great-grandmother had blue eyes and their paternal grandmother had grey/blue eyes. But there are no green eyes to our knowledge going back three generations. Where does the green come from?       -A curious adult from Connecticut  June 19, 2009  Many people are surprised when some new eye color seemingly pops up out of nowhere.  Suddenly their daughter has green eyes.  And no one can recall any green-eyed relative.  This can seem especially weird when you have a perfectly good explanation for a different eye color.  From your description, you and your husband wouldn't have blinked an eye if your daughters' eyes had stayed blue.  But they didn't.  The most obvious explanation is that you and your husband carry the green eye version of an eye color gene along with your blue and brown versions.  This is possible because green eyes are due to a different gene than brown eyes.  So you and your husband have a brown version of one eye color gene.  And a green eye color version of another gene.  And undoubtedly some blue eye versions of these genes too!  What a mess!  Don't worry, though, I can take you through this.  I'll first talk about how eye color is thought to work.  Then I'll talk about how green eyes may have stayed hidden in your family for many years before being seen in your daughters.  At Least Two Genes Determine Eye Color  Before getting into eye color genes, let's first discuss genes in general.  Genes are like the individual recipes that make up a cookbook.  Each recipe is for a certain dish.  And each gene is for a certain part of us.  All of us have recipes for the same dishes in our cookbooks.  What makes each cookbook different is that each recipe for the same dish is slightly different.  So all of our cookbooks have cookie recipes.  It is just that some of us have chocolate chip recipes.  And others of us have recipes for peanut butter crisps.  Our genes are very similar to this.  For example, we all have the same two eye color genes.  What gives us different eye colors are which variations of these genes we have.  One of these genes is called HERC2.  It comes in two variations, brown and blue.  The other gene, called gey, also comes in two versions -- green and blue.  Your eye color depends on which combination of these versions you have as shown below:   If you have a brown version of HERC2, you'll have brown eyes no matter what the gey gene is.  If you have only blue versions of HERC2, then which version of gey you have determines your eye color.  If your HERC2 is blue and your gey is green, you have green eyes.  And if you only have blue versions of both genes, then you have blue eyes*.  We Have Two Copies of each of our Genes  As you have probably noticed, this isn't enough information yet to explain what happened in your family.  If you have the brown version of HERC2, then you would pass it onto your children.  And they would have brown eyes no matter what their gey gene was.  The other bit of information we need to explain all of this is the fact that we have two copies of most of our genes -- one from mom and one from dad.  So we have two copies of HERC2 and two copies of gey for a total of four possible gene versions.  Next I'll show you a table that gives all the possible combinations of these versions and the eye color you would have.  To make things simpler, I'll use genetic shorthand.  In this shorthand, the brown version of HERC2 is B and the blue version is b.  And the green version of gey is G and the blue version b.  Here is the table:   The simplest explanation for your situation is that you and your husband are either BbGG or BbGb (one of you could also be Bbbb).  Doesn't seem very simple does it"Â¦  The key is that each of you must carry a blue version of the HERC2 gene.  If each of you does, then you each have a 50-50 shot of passing that blue version of HERC2 to your kids.  This means that each of your kids has a 1 in 4 chance of getting a b from each of you and having an eye color other than brown. They'll have green eyes if they also get at least one G version of the gey gene.  ( Click here to see where the 1 in 4 came from.)  OK, so if you both carry a b version of HERC2, you can theoretically have green-eyed kids.  But where did the G version of gey come from?  And why hasn't anyone seen green eyes in your family before?  Recessive Genes Can Stay Hidden for a Very Long Time  By their very nature, recessive genes can be hidden.  For example, take a look at the eye color table.  There are nine different possible combinations of genes.  Six of these combinations lead to brown eyes.  And four of these brown eyed combinations carry a green version of gey.  Let's show how this can lead to green eyes staying hidden for many generations.  Imagine this family tree:   Here you can see that green eyes stay hidden for at least three generations.  And this sort of thing could have gone on for many, many more generations so that green eyes stay hidden for hundreds of years.  Or even longer!  What I've done is numbered a couple of steps in the chart so you can see why green eyes stayed hidden.  These are just a couple of possible reasons and there are undoubtedly others. One parent was BB. If one of the parents is BB, then that parent can only pass a B to his or her kids.  The end result is all brown eyed children.  So in this case, the green would stay hidden. By chance, no green eyes were seen. Just because two parents could have a green eyed child, that doesn't mean they will.  For example, the children of two parents who are Bb have a 1 in 4 chance of an eye color other than brown.  But that doesn't mean these parents will for sure have a green or blue eyed kid.  Even if the parents had 10 kids, they still might only have blue or brown eyed children.  ( Click here for why this is.) So there you have it.  Green eyes can seemingly pop up out of nowhere because they are recessive to brown eyes.  And because green eyes are determined by a separate gene. * In genetics lingo, we say that brown is dominant over blue and green. And that green is recessive to brown but dominant over blue.  Blue is recessive to both.

Just look around you and take a good look at peoples eye colour. There is a high chance you will notice a lot of people with brown eyes. Brown eyes are by far most common in humans. In some countries, the brown eye colour is the only colour there is.  In other countries however, you would find a lot of diversity. Green, blue, hazel, grey and even violet eyes do exist as well.           Green eyes in the Middle East     Brown is the most common eye colour  In the US only 1 out of 6 people have a light (blue) eye colour. The brown eye colour is in the US the most prevalent. No surprise, because brown is also the dominant colour. In other countries, especially in northern Europe, brown is less common. Estonia for example is a very light eyed country with almost 98% having the blue eyes.   Africa is very brown   The further you go to the south, the more chance there is that you will find a person with brown eyes. In southern europe for instance, there is on average a change of 80% you will find a brown eyed person. Lighter eyes are also in southern Europe (Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece) less common. Further south, going to Africa, light eyes are almost disappeared.   Light eyes in Scandinavia   Scandinavians tend to have a very light appearence. Light eyes are definitely the standard in these northern countries. Sweden, Norway and Denmark all have high percentages of light eyed people. Also Finland and Iceland are extremely light with almost 90% of them having light eyes (green, grey and blue). Other ''northern'' countries like The Netherlands, Scotland and Germany have light eyed peoples too. In The Netherlands approximately 80% of the inhabitants have green or blue eyes. Germany (especially the northern part of the country) follows with almost 70% having lighter eye colours.   Green eyes are rare   Within the ''light'' eyed population, the green eyes are outnumbered by the blue eyes. Green eyes are dominant over the blue eye colour but there are only very few people that carry the genes responsible for green eyes. Only 1-2% of the entire human population have green eyes.   Shades of green eyes   Green eyes can look very different. They can be very dark, almost brown. Sometimes they are very light: almost neon. It all depends on the amount and type of melanin inside the iris. If you have a lot of melanin, your eyes look darker and if you have only a tiny bit, your eyes tend to look very light (bright).  The light green eyes are most common in Iceland, The Netherlands, Scotland, Ireland, Estonia and Scandinavia. Dark green eyes can be find all over Europe, the US and even in Pakistan.       Dark green eyes      Light green eyes                                            Green eyes and red hair  Scientist suspects there is a relation between red hair and the green eye colour. It looks like there is a high correlation between those two human traits. Having the red hair colour is also very unique (and recessive). Only 1 - 2 % of the entire human population have naturally red hair. Of course, not only red hair coexist with green eyes. Also blondes and darker hair colours tend to have green eyes (or the other way around).    Green eyes and gender  Normally, you would expect a 50/50 gender variation between the eye colours (blue, brown), but scientist found a positive correlation between being a woman and having the green eye colour. Why green eyes are more found in women is still unknown and it is not certain a gender differentiation actually exist. The findings could be biased somehow.      red hair, green eyes and being male: the odds are very low     Hazel eyes are Green eyes?  Some people confuse hazel eyes with green eyes. Hazel eyes are also very rare but are different than green eyes. First of all, hazel eyes have more melanin. They look more brownish and are overall a bit darker, sometimes with a golden teint. People with hazel eyes often notice a considerable change in their eye colour, especially when a lot of light reflect on their eyes. Secondly, some green eyes have a lot of yellow pigment in them. Hazel eyes share this yellow pigmentation hence the confusion.       Eyes with a Green-Hazel colour    Where do green eyes come from?  Green eyes can be found anywhere but you will find them most of the time in Europe. Some people believe green eyes came to existence due to a mixture of blue and brown eyes. This idea became popular because a lot of green eyes can be found in areas where brown and blue eyes came together. When we look at the map, the highest percentage of green eyes can be found in Scotland. Ireland also has (relative) a lot of green eyed inhabitants.   Green eyes have lipochrome. This lipochrome (also known as feomelanin ) is a yellowish pigment. People with green eyes and especially those with amber coloured eyes have a lot of this yellow lipochrome inside their irises. Those with blue, brown or grey eyes usually don't have any lipochrome. When you have a lot of lipochrome inside your iris, you might have the amber eye colour. When you only have a small portion of this yellow pigment, your eyes might look a bit more green/blue-ish.  The combination of the yellow pigment and low amount of melanin gives rise to light green eyes. When you have a moderate amount of melanin but also lipochrome, your eyes probably look darker green. When you only have a low amount of melanin (and no lipochrome), your eyes look blue.   Light Green Eyes: (very) low amount of melanin + moderate amount of lipochrome   Blueish Green Eyes : (very) low amount of melanin + low amount of lipochrome   Yellowish Green Eyes : (very) low amount of melanin + (very) high amount of lipochrome   Dark Green Eyes : moderate amount of melanin + moderate amount of lipochrome   Brownish Green Eyes : high amount of melanin + moderate amount of lipochrome   Blue Eyes : (very) low amount of melanin (no lipochrome)  Brown Eyes : (very) high amount of melanin (no lipochrome)  Amber Eyes : (very) low melanin + very high amount of lipochrome  Grey Eyes : low amount of melanin (no lipochrome)     Heterochromia Iridum  Some people have a truly unique thing going on with their eyes: they have more than one colour! When one eye has a different colour than the other; it is called heterochromia iridum. When only a small portion of the iris has a different colour, it is called: partial heterochromia.      complete heterochromia: blue and green  Read for more information (Dutch): Green Eyes: a rare trait in humans     Geplaatst door    Jonrik A     op  10:46             Email This BlogThis!

I am glad you mentioned of an additional pigment, lipochrome, in green and amber eyes.  Most articles just assume that green eyes are caused by an intermediate amount melanin.  What exactly is lipochrome?  Does it have other names? One additional point you may want to clarify:  From what I've read elsewhere, for blue versus brown eyes, it's not just the amount of melanin but rather the location.  Both blue and brown eyes have melanin in the back of the iris, but only brown eyes have melanin in the stroma, the front layer of the iris.  That the location of melanin, and not just the amount, affects eye color makes intuitive sense, as there are people with dark blue eyes (high amount in back of iris, none in the stroma), and others with light brown eyes (moderate amounts in both back of iris and in stroma). Thank you for your article.  What source did you read that discussed the lipochrome - I can find very few articles mentioning it. Reply Delete Replies Anonymous 30 December 2015 at 03:03 I have a question. Everyone in my family that I am blood related to (not including the children of some) have blue eyes. My brother is blonde with blue eyes and mine is brown with blue eyes. I was wondering if there is a layer of pigmentation under the first layer (the one everyone can see)? If you look up close to my eyes, I noticed that it appeared as if there was a second layer of pigmentation. I have my pupil and then green with black streaks. Then, I have my blue pigmentation with whitish streaks. To be honest, I don't know if my eyes are blue or grey. They only change to grey some times if I wear blue clothing. Also, the green layer is a dull green and when my pupil shrinks, the blue closes in, but the green doesn't appear to move. The green really looks like another layer. It's like oil and water trying to mix. They are right next to one another, but they aren't mixing and seem separate. Or a better example, when you poor gelatin onto colored paper. They don't mix, it just appears like the colored paper is a layer behind the gelatin. I've seen this is some pictures of eyes, but I don't know why it's like that. The blue seems to just, "disperse" you could say. Like, poring powdered lemonade into water, the powder sort of strings out (bad example).  My friend has partial heterochromia. She was born with blue eyes and they didn't turn to hazel until she was around 5. There is a dark brown splotch in one eye that makes her whole eye look dark brown from a distance. Why is it that her eye color didn't change for such a long period of time and produced the splotch? Delete Rebecca Cardenas 16 January 2016 at 10:46 My husband has awesome eyes like yours sound, except his have dark green, light green, yellow and Amber splotches that actually look red, then both his eyes have a different arrangement of these colors. One of his eyes has a lot more amber in it. Also what he wears seems to make them appear as different colors, lighting does and he emotions change the color too! When he is tired I swear his eyes turn dark green, when he is very angry they seen to sparkle with vibrant colors. I just have light brown eyes, two of our sons gave Brown eyes too, one has dark and the other light, only our middle sin has hazel Brown eyes, they look different with what he wears, lighting or his moods too. Your families eye colors seem very pretty especially yours. I am jealous, want to trade? I have always wanted gray, violet or very light green/bluish eyes. Beautiful colors!! Ps. Make sure you color coordinate some blouses, dresses, shoes, scarves, purses and make-up for those eyes of yours. Show the beauties off for those of us stuck with poo-poo eyes.

Anony I I Delete Carmencita 29 October 2015 at 05:22 Hi Olessya, my eyes are similar although yours are amber-golden  and ice green while mine have a lighter yellow ring around the pupil and the rest of the iris is  dark blue-grey (making them appear green). So they are not true green actually but heterochromatic (not hazel either as there is no actual brown, just yellow and blue-grey). What is most unusual about your eyes is the shape of the amber ring, it's really thick and looks like a sunflower! So pretty! My eyes were blue-grey until I was twelve and my mom's were the same color until she was in her forties (my brother still has bue-grey eyes, while my dad and sister both have sky-blue eyes). We both came down with the same autoimmune thyroid disorder and grew yellow rings which changed our eye color. Even though I have been in remission since I was fourteen my eyes never changed back. It's interesting how health can affect eye color. Delete Unknown 20 November 2015 at 02:45 That's really pretty.

Reply Delete Replies Anonymous 11 September 2014 at 20:05 A "mutation" is a new occurrence, something not possible with the general genes available. Bright green eyes merely means you have more lipochrome and less melanin (or vice versa) than your parents and siblings. No worries!

Now, I have a green eye & a blue eye.  What is going on with that? Reply Delete Unknown 2 September 2016 at 19:32 Most people in my family have blue or brown eyes, but I have dark green with VERY dark blue streaks, while my brother, father, and relatives have blue. But my mom and other brother have hazel... Reply Delete Mary Charest 15 September 2016 at 14:10 Well -- I found 'my people'. *smile* I have eyes as green as can be.  My hair is ash/blonde but in the sun there is much red.  My skin is ivory, and I hail from Ireland (at least genetically 98.9%) Here is a question I have always had -- why, when I cry, do my eyes turn a neon-like green.  It's kinda spooky!

Whose eyes will your baby inherit - mother or father? Well, you donât have to wonder about it anymore. Our baby eye color calculator will give you a hint about what color eyes will soon be gazing at you. Try it out below!  Baby Eye Color Predictor  Mother's Eye Color    Blue  Brown   Green   Father's Eye Color   Blue   Brown  Green  Chances Of Your Baby Eye Color      Recalculate Which Genes Will Your Baby Inherit?    Baby Eye Color Chart Eye color is a physical trait determined by the pairing of genes from both the parents. The baby inherits 50% of eye color genetics material from each of its parents. Genes mutate to give alternative forms called alleles, and each allele slightly differs from the other. There are three pairs of alleles responsible for eye color with each allele giving either brown, green or blue. The brown allele is dominant over green and blue; green is dominant over blue and blue is recessive. The newborn's eye color depends on both the parents' eye color and whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. The child may get two dominant alleles from the parents, one dominant one recessive or two recessive alleles. The child will have brown eyes if it receives a recessive allele (blue) from one parent and a dominant allele (brown) from the other parent. Baby blue eyes depends if it receives blue alleles from both the parents. Since blue is recessive and there is no dominant allele, the child will have blue eyes. The child will have green eyes if it receives green alleles from both the parents or one green and one blue allele. Most of the babies born with blue eyes because the newborns take time for producing the pigment melanin.You cannot determine the exact color of the babyâs eyes until he or she turns three. What Determines Eye Color? Homozygous And Heterozygous Human beings have two copies of every gene. One is inherited from the mother, and the other from the father. Homozygous means that two copies match or are dominant (denoted by two capital letters such BB) and heterozygous means that the two copies of the gene differ or recessive (denoted by two small letters, bb). Dominant Eye Color  Brown and green are dominant eye colors. There is 75 to 95% chance of the baby getting brown or green eyes if both the parents have same colored eyes. Recessive Eye Color  Blue is a recessive eye color. Itâs highly unlikely for a baby to have blue eyes if both the parents have brown eyes. Genotype The genotype is the gene combination for a given trait, which, in this case, is the eye color. The mother and fatherâs genotype will determine the eye color of the children. Phenotype The phenotype is the physical appearance of the genotype, which in this case is the eye color. Will Your Babyâs Eyes Stay Blue? Most of the new born babies have blue eyes, which may change color over time. The eyes remain blue if both the parents pass their recessive blue genes to the child. If this is not the case, the baby's eye color changes to permanent color (brown, green or any other color) as he/she ages. At the time of birth, there is a deficit of melanin pigment, but with time the iris starts producing melanin to give the eyes their actual color. It takes about six months to one year for the baby's actual eye color to surface. Most babies of Caucasian origin have dark blue eyes when born. However, the original color, be it brown, green, blue or hazel, will be determined over time. The child will get the actual eye color with exposure to light, and it depends on the amount and diffraction of light. Likewise, Asian and African origin babies have brown or dark gray at the time of birth. They turn black or real brown over time. During birth, the infant eye color is light, since new born babies do not have active melanin which darkens the cells. Once your baby is 6months old, the eye color begins to change. Gradually, the eye color takes on a different shade as per the genetic inheritance. Such change starts around the age of six months. By the age of three, kids have a definite eye color, which does not change further. Interpretation Of Baby Eye Color If both the parents have blue eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will have blue eyes. If both the parents have brown eyes, there are 75% chances that the baby will have brown eyes. If both the parents have green eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have green eyes. If both the parents have hazel eyes, there are 99% chances that the baby will also have hazel eyes. The hazel eyes are still a mystery. The baby eye color calculator cannot accurately predict the likelihood of your child having hazel eyes, as this eye color is often a mixture of brown, green and amber hues. Most Frequently Asked Questions Around Baby Eye Color Calculator Q. What Is Baby Eye Color Calculator?  A baby eye color calculator is an online calculator that can help parents predict the eye color of their children. It tells the likelihood of the babyâs eye color on the basis of eye color genetics using color of the parentsâ eyes. Q. How Accurate Are These Baby Eye Calculators?  Baby eye calculators are not entirely accurate as genes contribute to the eye color. Also, they do not explain hazel and other shades of brown. So weâd suggest you not to depend entirely on the calculator. Q. What is Waardenburg Syndrome?  There are cases when babies are born with one eye as brown and another eye as blue. It is because of a medical condition called Waardenburg syndrome. However, this is a rare genetic disorder. In such cases, it is essential that you consult an ophthalmologist. Studies are going on to find accurate reasons behind the changes in eye color of a newborn. Q. What is Heterochromia?  Heterochromia is a genetic or acquired eye condition that affects iris. The baby with this condition ends up having two eye colors i.e. having eyes with different colors. In complete heterochromia, each iris has a different color. Mostly, one is blue and the other brown. Sectoral (partial) heterochromia is where only a portion of iris has a different color. Central heterochromia is when the inner ring has a different color from the outer ring. Genetic heterochromia is an autosomal dominant condition. The child has about 50% chance of inheriting the condition and a 50% chance of passing it to their offspring. The causes of acquired heterochromia include glaucoma, inflammation, Waardenburg syndrome, neurofibromatosis, injury, and illnesses. Most of the cases are benign and congenital. There is no treatment for heterochromia if it is genetic. But if it is due to an underlying condition (acquired), that condition needs to be treated. Some cases of acquired heterochromia may even shorten the lifespan.

Letâs take a quick look at both. Pigmentation of a personâs iris can run the gamut from the darkest color, black to lightest, blue. Largely influencing pigmentation is something called melanin , a complex polymer made from the amino acid tyrosine. The appearance of green and shades of green (i.e. jade, hazelÂ eyes and emerald) are the result of a Â phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering; which is a 25 cent term used to describe the way light scatters after riding its spectrum wavelength. Most people mistakenly believe that colors like green and blue are in the iris â but theyâre not. Your eye color is a function of how light diffuses across the melanin base, which again is genetically determined. Credit: Wiki Commons GREEN EYES: ORIGINS AND GENES Old theory Prior to 2008, scientists thought eye color was determined by one dominant gene. It was postulated that an eye color hierarchy existed with brown being at the top of the ladder and blue resting at the bottom. Under the old way of thinking, this meant if your dad had brown eyes and your mom had blue eyes, you would likely be born with brown colored eyes. A parental combination of two green eyes would translate into you having green eyes. Recessive genes were also thought to partially influence eye color. New theory New research, presented in a 2008 publication of the American Journal of Human Genetics washed the old way of thinking about eyes and color. The new research suggests that as many as 16 genes may influence the way color is expressed in the iris. The unscientific translation means that a baby can be born with just about any eye color, regardless of what their parents have. It is important to note, however, that hereditary variables need to be factored into the equation. The video below offers an excellent scientific analysis of how people get different color eyes, including green, blue, brown, hazel and some rare variations. GENETIC PREVALENCE OF GREEN EYES Interestingly enough, there are anthropological records of early humans with green eyes living around the mountain system in Eurasia between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. This area contained aÂ natural land bridge between Europe and Asia. Knowns as the âSilk Routeâ or âSilk Roadsâ; this ancient passageway was used by early civilizations for the lucrative trade silk, sometimes between 120 BCE â 1450s CE (Yao, et all, 2000). The silk route is thought to be a major reason for the distribution of green eyes WHERE DO GREEN EYES COME FROM? We know from history that Silk Road played an important role in the creation of the civilizations of China, the Goguryeo kingdom in Korea, much of Japan, the Indian subcontinent, parts of Persia and the Horn of Africa and Arabia. Because it served as a significant trade route for many early traders, it is thought that mating between various groups may have been part of gene distribution. This may help to explain why green eyes can be found in various groups across Europe, Africa and Asia. GENETIC ANTHROPOLOGY AND EYE COLOR Genetic anthropology is growing branch of science that examines DNA testing with concrete archaeological, historical and language-based evidence to uncover the history of ancient migration patterns in early human civilizations. Thanks to this emerging area of research, scientists are learning more and more about the etiology of eye color. This is why today, you can have your DNA tested to determine your genetic background. In turn, this may help to explain the genetic reasons for your ocular hue. GREEN EYES AND GEOLOGIC TIME Much of Europe, Asia and Africa and large swaths of the middle east have been native lands to people with green eyes for centuries. When studying the geologic time scale; a tool used to measure our planets history, it is thought that green eyes may have appeared in people of Iranian, Spanish, Brazilian and Pakistani decent sometime during the late part of the Cenozoic period . Specifically, this would be between theÂ Pleistocene and Holocene epochs some 2 to 3 million years ago.  Any race, including people who are Caucasian, Asian, African, Native Indian, Pacific Islander, Hispanic and pre-Colombians (Indigenous Peoples of the Americas) canÂ have green colored eyes. Anthropologists believe eye color, like hazel, blue, brown and green,Â are the direct result of migratory behaviors. Because of inter-mixing of groups, coupled with thousands of genetic mutations, we see various shades of green throughout modern man. Jessee Metcalfe has green eyes.

Many people are curious if eye color can change. The answer is â absolutely! People with green, blue or brown eyes all experience change in color from time to time. Causes for eye color changes include: The way light scatters Mood Health/Medical reasons HOW EYE COLOR CAN CHANGE DUE TO HEALTH The color of your iris can permanently change if you have glaucoma and take certain medications for treatment. If you have light colored eyes and want to keep them, you need to be extremely careful with the glaucoma medications you take. Make sure you consult with your eye doctor to discover all of the facts. Other reasons eye color can change to certain types of diseases. Examples include Hornerâs syndrome and Fuchâs heterochromic iridocyclitis. Should you notice any changes in the color of your eyes, contact your doctor immediately. Green eyes of Tom Welling: Credit insoonia.com GREEN EYES AND HEALTH RISKS If you have green eyes, you are more susceptible to the sunâs harmful radiation. This has to do with our old friend melanin previously mentioned. Simply put, green eyed people can develop certain types of ocular cancers, like intraocular melanoma . People with light colored eyes should wear UV protective sunglasses when outdoors. Jensen Ackles has light green eyes: Credit Fanpop PHENOMENON OF RAYLEIGH SCATTERING As mentioned previously, green eyes, blue eyes and brown eyes do not actually have these colors deposited into the iris. In truth, your eye pigmentation has a little brown in them. Because of the phenomenon of Rayleigh scattering, your eyes will reflect back a certain colored hue. Green eyes can come in different shades Green eyes with gold specs of Eddie Redmaybe HOW LIGHT CHANGES EYE COLOR Using the prior mentioned scientific principle of Rayleigh scattering, transformation of light particles that land on the iris will impact its coloristic appearance. This can result in a person having hazel, amber, jade, emerald, blue and even gray! Other factors can influence the shade of green in eyes. Lighting: Artificial lighting (aka: light bulbs) can impact how eye color is experienced. The intensity of the light hitting your iris will either amplify or soften your irisâs appearance.  Time of day: Light from the sun may be more intense earlier in the day or later, which means your iris will âpick-upâ different intensities from the solar spectrum .  Reflective colors: The color of everything around you, including the cloths you have on, can intensify how eye color is experienced. Certain colors, like gold, blue and other greens can amplify the flecks reflecting outward from your Iris.  Makeup: Some people wear eye-makeup, like gold and purple eye-shadow, to accentuate the natural green of the iris. This can cause the desired effect of having chameleon eyes.  Gorgeous makeup makes a line of eye shadow specifically designed for people with green eye color. Allergies: Some people with allergies have âscratchy eyesâ which can cause the surrounding âwhitesâ of the eyes to become red (aka: bloodshot eyes). This can have the effect of amplifying your eye color and creating baggy eyes.Most people do not desire this look.  Emotional state: While your emotional state does not directly change the color of your eyes, what you are feeling at any given point in time can impact how they are perceived. Specifically, if you are depressed and crying, your pupil may dilate, which may give off a darker appearance.  Substances: Use of alcohol, uppers, downers and other kinds of medications can cause your pupils to become larger or smaller. The end result can mean your eye color becomes more intense. Josh Henderson has a green eye and blue eye because of heterochromia. HETEROCHROMIA Some people have a condition called heterochromia that causes one eye to be one color (like green) and the other eye to be a different color (like blue). While multiple causes have been suggested, the current scientific thinking suggests that a lack of genetic diversity is the main reason for heterochromia. It is thought that the condition is caused by a mutation of the genes determining melanin distribution, which often becomes changed due to chromosomal homogeneity. The photograph above of actor Josh Henderson is an example of someone with heterochromia. Notice one of his eyes are green. The other is blue. Very rare and unique. NOTE OF CAUTION If your eye color changes suddenly or if you notice your pupils remain dilated for no apparent reason for an extended period of time, contact your physician immediately. Your eyes are not something you want to play with. What Do Your Eyes Say About You Video Channing Tatum has a unique pair of green eyes that are almost jade.

DID GREEN EYES COME FROM ALIENS? The color of your eyes is unique. No two people have exactly the same eye color, unless they are identical twins. When we examine the origins of eye color, we can see their evolution changed over the course of time. It has been postulated that adaptations in eye color occurred as a result of a changing environment. Some people believe green eyes and blue eyes are the result of an alien species depositing their DNA into the human genome.Â  But if you look at other species on our planet, you will see eye colors come in rainbow, including oranges, reds and yellows. Did these differing ocular colors come from aliens as well? FINAL THOUGHTS ON GREEN EYES We are still learning a great deal about eye color with new research happening every day. There have also been advancements changing eye color of the iris through medical procedures . And of course, you can always buy colored contacts to make your eyes blue green , hazel or brown!

John Michael  says:   December 14, 2015 at 12:00 am  Thats interesting because I have blond hair and green eyes being the only one in my family.

But I wasnât.  Really!

At least I can fall back on the fact that Iâm 3/4 Irish!  All the boys in my family have blue eyes, and all the girls have brown or hazel.  I feel like an oddball!   Christopher Poblete  says:   November 5, 2015 at 4:43 pm  Yes, among my large family (grandma, uncles, cousins, etc) I am the only one with green eyes. Well, my bio dad has green eyes, but my mum is a single mother, so I barely know him. But itâs not just about the eye colour, itâs something more, like behaviour, itâs strange o:   belaboa9  says:   November 5, 2015 at 7:52 pm  Are you the black sheep of the family?  I am.  Iâm considered the âweirdâ one because Iâm the smartest, most creative, adventurous, risk-taking and mystical one.  I follow my own path no matter what anyone else says.  And I have snakes! LOL  And two rescue dogs.

So how is your behaviour different from the rest of your familyâs?   Alejandro Ontiveroz  says:   February 10, 2016 at 8:02 pm  I have green eyes too and so does my sister. I guess it is because my dad has vary light blue eyes and my mom has semi dark brown eyes. I only know 3 people with green eyes. But i donât think im very attractive. Im a male and i have girl like features. And i have long hair.   belaboa9  says:   February 11, 2016 at 6:36 pm  Yeah, but how old are you?

Even Aunts an Cousins sea of blue eyes!   belaboa9  says:   June 24, 2016 at 8:39 pm  Like I said to someone else, it must be a really recessive gene that decided to resurface, unless we are adopted, or our daddies arenât really our daddies!

Both parents, and all siblings have blue eyes. Also, all blood relations on both sides have blue eyes. Not one brown eye, and Iâm the one green eye. Itâs always bothered me!   belaboa9  says:   June 22, 2016 at 2:12 pm  Me, too!  Iâve always wondered how many generations back in my family I would have to go, to find another green-eyed person.  Itâs got to come from the Irish side, or maybe thereâs a little bit of gypsy on the Italian side!  In any case, Iâll never know!   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:52 pm  In Nursing School I was told eye color only comes from parents. Iâve wondered about my paternity every since. I am the odd ball! Not just eye color either. To chicken to ask. Lol My mother said IT WAS THE EVIL COMING OUT IN ME when I mentioned it once! Donât know if that was joke, but I never mentioned it again   belaboa9  says:   June 23, 2016 at 1:22 am  LOL!  I learned the same thing in Nursing School!  Thatâs why I always thought I was adopted.  But I wasnât.  Iâve got my birth certificate, and all my baby pictures are in the family albums!  It must be a really recessive gene which has resurfaced! ????  Lucky for us!   Shannon Mullis-Long  says:   October 6, 2015 at 9:31 am  Myself and three cousins have green eyes.

Actually one green, the other one is slightly brown. Not so noticeable fortunately ????   Glen  says:   December 12, 2015 at 9:20 pm  I had blue eyes as a child, which was odd at the time as both my mother and father has brown, (I also had blonde hair as a child but now it is dark brown) Iâm 35 now and my eyeâs are now a deep shade of green and have been since a young age, I am the youngest of 4 and the only other person in my immediate family with green eyes is my eldest brother. I wasnât aware green eyes were considered rare.   Tucker  says:   March 21, 2017 at 6:00 pm  I had blue eyes as a young child but they turned to green before my teens.   John Michael  says:   December 13, 2015 at 11:55 pm  I am a male and have blond hair and 1 green lighter eye and 1 green darker eye. I wonder what the percentages for this is? I am also the only one in my family with it and I thought I was adopted. So I did check with the hospital and Iâm legit. Lol. Use to feel a bit freakish because there a so few of us. Now I know Iâm blessed!   KateM  says:   February 2, 2016 at 6:47 am  I have very light yellow green eyes with blue around the rim. How does that factor into the green eyed equation?

It makes me feel uneasy when I notice someone staring at my eyes. From my perspective I seem to be hyper sensitive to light compared to most people. I squint a lot which gives others the impression that Iâm mad or something.

Every eye has itâs own and special shade that makes them beautiful in its way! Yours sure are too! ð   Nicole Lovelace  says:   September 1, 2016 at 9:25 pm  Thatâs not true, green is a beautiful color. Even if they werenât rare, they would still be a popular eye color.   Carla  says:   September 6, 2016 at 6:42 pm  Indeed, but Iâm not talking about preference but about rareness. Think about itâ¦ If 90% of the population had green eyes and only 10% had, for example, brown eyes, which color would be more desiredâ¦ green or brown? I honestly think that itâs more a matter of exclusiveness than color. And please donât think that Iâm saying this beacause I donât love my eye color or something. I actually do have green eyes, I just donât like when people compare themselves with others, just because they donât have what those people do have and donât feel special because of it. If that even makes senseâ¦ :S xD (Sorry if Iâm a little off with my writing skills, not my mother tongue xD, And sorry too for that unnecessary large reply xD)   Michele Kasel  says:   April 29, 2016 at 11:13 pm  i have green eyes and if i wear violet-blue contact lenses they look cool!   i also have brown contactsâi guess i get sorta bored with the same color eyes for 50 years LOL   Gabbyy Fratt  says:   May 12, 2016 at 9:33 pm  I have green eyes but if u look close they have a little bit of light brown in the middle then blue all around the rest but farther away they r bright green itâs rlly weird   Carla  says:   May 22, 2016 at 12:50 pm  This only means that you have some shade of hazel eyes. Half brown, half green, and sometimes some blue too!   hunter  says:   May 12, 2016 at 9:36 pm  i have green eyes and my parent have them to and my brother and sister and all my other family members have them to   Ann  says:   July 26, 2016 at 6:26 pm  Same with me, except I donât know about extended family.   Tyler Karl Lia  says:   May 18, 2016 at 3:03 am  Would have like the article, but the mixed race bastards who have my eyes ruined it.   Frank E Richardson  says:   May 19, 2016 at 5:09 pm  I got my green eyrs from my father, and they ate popular on that dide of my family, i thought it was an Irish trait   Frank E Richardson  says:   May 19, 2016 at 5:11 pm  I got my green eyes from my father and they are popular on that side of my family, i thought it was an Irish trait   Connie George  says:   June 22, 2016 at 4:58 pm  Very rare eye color always new that, but was surprised how rare!  Pretty sure in the case of eyes it only Parents not like Hair color or skin! Not sure why!   Deborah Wilbourn  says:   May 24, 2016 at 12:07 am  Iâm the middle child of 5 children both father and mother have brown eyes older brother blue eyes older sister younger sister and younger brother all have brown eyes. As far back as I can trace  in family history mostly blue eyes and brown eyes going back to my great grandparents none with green eyes can be found.  I do have one daughter with green eyes the other with blue, their dad has blue eyes. This article I read has a lot of information that is true for me and the trait of having green eyes, however I do believe there is much more information missing due to my age and experience.

A brown eye parent can have any eye color child from how I understood it in school   Denis St  says:   June 14, 2016 at 5:23 pm  What should I sayâ¦ My eyes turned from light blue to grassy/olive green in 8-9th grade, one of my eye corner has a little part of light blue, but hardly noticeable (unless you pay close attention) my hair from ginger turned to the darkest brown/black then it turned into almost dirty blonde color..   Beth  says:   June 16, 2016 at 2:33 am  Eye color doesnât run the âgambit,â people. It runs the âgamut.â A gamut is a scale; a gambit is a chess move, or other scheme.

The hottest guy I ever met had this brown eyes that make me felt like a whole hidden universe was beneath them.. that he wouldnât show. So use your brownies and do the same with cute guys! But be nice. Donât underestimate the power. Donât be mean as this guy ALMOST did <3   GC  says:   August 15, 2016 at 7:26 pm  I am 100% Mexican and have green eyes that can look bright blue when I wear blue or in all white environments.  I was told I was born with sky blue eyes but they changed color when I was 8-9 month old to green.  All the members of my bio father have green eyes and his father as well.  All my motherâs have brown except for her great grandmma who had blue.  Im older now and notice my eye color is changing to more blue than green, I donât like that!  And never knew they were rare??  I went to grammar school in small town in central Mexico.  Out of a class of about 25, 6 kids had green eyes, WTH??  And I never knew why I was sensitiv to bright light and I hate the sun!!  I was freaked to learn in the poll, I am Latino, a Scorpio and other traits I can relate to LoL!  Thx   BTDTGTTS  says:   August 16, 2016 at 3:29 pm  My husband has one blue and one green eye.  I have pale grey blue eyes.  My son has brilliant blue eyes with a dark ring around them and a few yellow specks.  My daughter has soft green eyes with a dark ring and yellow specks.  I love all their eye colors and just wish mine werenât so wishy washy grey blue.   Le Panayi  says:   November 23, 2016 at 4:38 pm  grey-blue is a great eye colour!   David  says:   August 17, 2016 at 9:18 am  I have green eyes which are very sensitive to light or even a breeze (especially a winter one). I used to get compliments about my eyes when I was younger but not so much now. ð I like the fact that they are a rare trait.   Gulfidan  says:   September 8, 2016 at 5:25 pm  Well I do have very different green eye color most people they donât believe it is my regular color????

I have a sister with HAZEL eyes but her eyes have more BROWN then GREEN in them but they are still beautiful, my brother her TWIN has CRYSTAL BLUE eyes. I am working on our genealogy and had a gathering this summer of cousins and family that I had never met but it AMAZED me that 90% and that maybe LOW!!! They were GREEN eyed it was varies shades but they were GREEN eyed . I have never seen that many GREEN eyed people in one place it was AWESOME   Americkan  says:   October 23, 2016 at 3:36 pm  I have very green eyes and very fair skin,when I was born and until about four my hair was white,then went to blond,then light brown. At the ripe age of 35 my hair went from light brown right back to white/silver. My eye color however remained green. My parents and 4siblings do not have green eyes, only me. Until recently I never gave my eye color much thought but now I think Iâm just a little unique.   Di  says:   October 26, 2016 at 11:03 pm  I have green eyes and thought it was a common color, maybe not.   Hamza Asghar Khan  says:   November 5, 2016 at 3:39 am  My Eyes are extremely dark..

My mother said when I was born my eyes were so blue they looked purple and stayed that way for 3 years. Now people donât believe Iâm not wearing contacts. Itâs creepy for me. I canât even look people in the face directly   Bedra Ogdee  says:   June 21, 2017 at 5:40 pm  My eyes are also green. My mother said that when I was born they were so blue that they looked purple and my hair was jet black. I am of Lebanese and Hispanic descent. I am the only one in the family including my fathers side and my mothers side. None of my cousins on either side. I do get many compliments and sometimes I get very embarrassed. I am proud to know that green eyes are rare.   Meryl Burke  says:   January 4, 2017 at 4:47 am  Dr. John Moore, Fun article but Iâve got to let you know for some reason hue was spelled incorrectly as hew. Thanks, Truly, green eyes.   John D.

I have night blindness to some degree and my eyes are slightly light sensitive My hair is blondish red naturally.

Kimberly Shand  says:   April 18, 2017 at 8:07 pm  Well, now I know why people always freak out when they realize I have green: They think I possess powers, or was influenced by an alien. Seriously?

I didnât understand how special it was until I read this article.  Now I feel like the chosen one. Maybe I belong on another planet ?   For the Love of Purple  says:   May 3, 2017 at 3:09 am  Interesting I am A- and I have deep green eyes that change colours between âgoldâ âblueâ or âHazelâ  depending on the colour of clothing I wear or the eye makeup I apply.  I have been told that my eyes are both intense and unnerving on many occasions throughout my life.  What is interesting to myself, is that I can meet someone look, into their eyes and instantly within a millisecond know whether they are a friend or foeâ¦   Brandy Grote  says:   June 5, 2017 at 6:03 pm  Glad to know it isnât DNA based!  Dad has lovely mahogany eyes, Mom has pale jade green eyes.  (Both brothers have the same brown as Dad.) Mine were deep blue as a young child, going turquoise, then changing from blue to green based on my strong emotions as a young adult.  Now they are nearly always green, with some blue tint that gets more or less each day. Hair is light amber brown.

Italy is heavily influenced by the entire Mediterranean with many people who have lighter color eyes.   Christina Miracola  says:   July 27, 2017 at 4:39 pm  so Italian people most likely have light eyes because I am full Italian like my mom and dad are both itailan   Christina Miracola  says:   July 27, 2017 at 4:37 pm  I am the only one with green eyes in my family but my grandpa on my moms side has like blue and green eyes.

The Most Common Eye Colors The human eye is both beautiful and unique. Much like a fingerprint, each individual's eye color is specific only to them, with no others sharing the same shape, color and appearance. So what eye colors are the most common, and which are the rarest? What is the most common eye color? Which eye color is the rarest? Brown Eyes Brown eyes are the most common eye color in the world with over 55% of the world's population having brown eyes. Brown eye color is a dominant genetic trait, and is created by the presence of melanin in the eye. Over fifty percent of the world's population has brown eyes, with nearly all individuals from Africa and Asia sharing brown eye color. Brown eyes are typically darker than other eye colors, and they may even appear black in certain individuals. Hazel Eyes Hazel eyes are similar to brown eyes, although they are typically lighter in color, and have more of a green-yellow tint. Hazel eyes have a higher concentration of melanin (pigment) around the eye's border, which can result in a multi-colored appearance that varies between copper and green depending on the lighting. Most people estimate that around 5-8% of the world's population has hazel colored eyes. Blue Eyes Blue eyes are genetically recessive, and therefore much less common worldwide. Blue eyes are formed by the absence of pigments in the eye, where the blue color is formed by the scattering of light as it's reflected off the iris. While blue eyes are less common than brown eyes, they are frequently found from nationalities located near the Baltic sea in northern Europe. It's estimated that approximately 8% of the world's population has blue eyes. Green Eyes Green eye color is often confused with hazel eye color, yet is entirely separate and distinct. Green eye color is the rarest color found around the world, and it is estimated that only around 2% of the world's population has green colored eyes. Green eye color is a result of a mild amount of pigmentation in the eye with a golden tint. When combined with the natural blue scattering of the eye, the colors mix to give a green appearance. Green eye color is most common in northern and central Europe, but can also be found in western Asian cultures on rare occasion. Silver Eyes Silver eye color is also quite rare, although many consider silver eyes to be a variation of blue eye color. Like blue eyes, silver eyes are the result of a very low amount of pigmentation in the eye, which reflects a gray-silver appearance. Silver eye color is most common in eastern European countries, and is one of the rarer eye colors worldwide. Amber Eyes Amber eyes show off a yellow-copper tone, which results from the yellow colored pigment lipochrome. Amber eyes are very rare worldwide, and are most common in Asia and South American countries. Amber eye color can range from golden yellow to a more copper tone. If there is one thing we can agree on, it's that all eyes are unique and beautiful. Additionally, thanks to colored contact lenses , it's possible to change your eye color even if you were born with a common brown.

Animated video showsÂ the likelihood of a child's eye colour based on what their parents have  A video shows likelihood of child's eye colour based on parents Parents with green and brown eyes can have a child with blue eyes Dominant gene from parents is the determining factor of a baby's eyes By Alisha Buaya For Daily Mail Australia   Published: 22:59 EDT, 12 May 2016 |  Updated: 23:37 EDT, 12 May 2016              e-mail          145  shares     131  View comments     Did you know if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your baby could have blue eyes? A video shared on My Child Magazine Australia 's Facebook page has crunched the numbers and shows the likelihood of  a baby having a certain eye colour based on what their parents have. For example, if you have green eyes and your partner has brown eyes your child is 50 per cent more likely to have brown eyes, but also has a 38 per cent chance of having green eyes and a 12 per cent chance of having blue eyes. Scroll down for video          Brown eyed boy: Video shows what your baby's eye colour could be based on you and your partners eyes                      It's all in the genes: If you and your partner have green eyes, you baby is likely to have green eyes too If you have blue eyes and your partner has brown, there's a 50-50 chance your baby will have either of those colours, according to the video. While if both parents have green eyes, their baby has a 75 per cent chance of having the same colour, a 24 per cent chance of having blue eyes and a one per cent chance of having brown eyes. Eye colour is a hereditary trait from parents and determines a baby's eye colour. One eye colour can be more expressive, or dominant, than another, and can therefore dictate what a baby's eye colour will be. Brown eyes are dominant over green or blue, while green is always dominant over the recessive blue eyes gene, according to Huggies.com.au .

I love how knowing just a little bit about mom and dad can, with startling accuracy, predict what baby will look like even before baby is born. One of the easier traits to predict is eye color. âWhat color eyes will my baby have?â is a question that can be answered just by knowing what eye color the parents have.  Want to know what eye color your baby might have? I created the simple chart below to help.  Note that this chart only takes into account parentsâ eye colors. Because it only factors in the phenotype (i.e. what color the eyes appear) and not the genes themselves, it is not going to be 100% accurate in every case. However, if you know grandparentsâ eye colors, too, you can tell with even more accuracy what color eyes your kids will have. To factor grandparentsâ eye colors into the equation, checkout TheTechâs baby eye color predictor here .

My boyfriendÂ´s parents have blue and green eyes and all of their 3 children have brown eyes!        Alkhilion     Well, his mom has had many friends then.        Pinkamena     What bullsh*t. Stop insulting people without any reasoning.  @Marissa Brown is indeed possible, maybe his granparents have brown eyes. The picture only works with the parentsâ data.        Marissa     yep, donât bother posting if itâs just to insult.        Anon     Because brown is dominant, so if either parent had a brown gene to pass on, their eyes would be brown.        marijana bircanin     me too my mom is blue dad is green and i brown GOD THAT IS POSSIBLE!!!!        Brown eyes     This chart is complete bollocks, blue + brown can absolutely get you green eyes, blue + blue can also get you brown eyes, so can green +green get you brown eyes and saying blue +blue means a 99% chance of blue eyes is bull crap, what knobend draw this chart up?        bmen     Blue plus blue  can never give brown, 2 recessives cant give a dominant but two dominants can give a recessive i.e brown plus brown can give a blue        Anon     Youâre wrong about most of those, but blue + brown can indeed make green.  Itâs pretty unlikely though.        Cait Zilla     I have blue eyes and my daughters father has brownâ¦.my daughter had blue eyes until she turned 3 and now they have been green ever since.        DF     Thatâs what I was thinking. I have hazel eyes, my husband has blue eyes and our son has green eyes!        GreenEye00     Itâs not that rare. My dad has dark brown eyes and my mom blue â all 3 of their children, myself included have bright green eyes.        Chelsea     pffft. You said bollucks XD        SL     You shouldnât put rude words in your post, you never know who might be reading it. There might be children reading your post right now, they shouldnât be exposed to language like that at the young age that some people who are reading this might be.        Shanon Mary Callahan Nolan     Blue and blue will result in a blue eyed baby. Because blue is a recessive allele blue eyes only occur when 2 recessive alleles are present. Meaning blue+blue=blue.        Kristen     Why do these things always leave out hazel eyes?        green     bullshit! my momâs eyes are brown and my dadâs are blue and both me and my sis have green eyes and diffrent shades of green        Fred     Brown + Brown = 101%? This chart is bullocks.        Heather Renee     My mom has brown and my dad has blue I have an unusual shade of olive green        green eyed girl     Yes itâs bollocks, my mum has blue eyes, my dad brown -me and my 2 sisters have green eyes!        Sergio Rios-Arrue     My mom has green eyes n my dad has brown =  i got brown eyes ( a bit lighter than my dads though).My brother also has brown eyes, and my stepmother has green eyes like my mom. I wonder if my wife has blue eyes, what eye color will my children have? But i just found out that my grandpa (mothers side) had blue eyes and i have a niece that both of her parents have dark brown eyes but she really got green eyes.        Dita     I have dark brown eyes, my husband has blue eyes but our child has green eyes.        michael     why do ppl always forget purple and red eyes?!        casey n     my mother has blue eyes and my father has brown and i came out with green so i find this bullshit unlss im not my father child which is bull to because i look just like him        brea     Well I have brown and my mom and dad have green and blue eyes What does that mean        marijana bircanin     me too and idk how        Jessica     This is so stupid your seriously saying that blue and brown eyes canât have a child with green eyes!!!  Well Iâm pretty sure that my dad has blue eyes and my mom has brown eyes and I must be some freak of nature cause I have green eye!!! Therefore this thing is totally untrustworthy!!!        Cait Zilla     I have blue eyes and my daughters father has brown eyes, thus my daughter whom of which is about to be turning 4 years old has green eyes. Her eyes were blue like mine until she turned 3 and ever since they have remained green. My son is 4 months old and im wondering if he too will have green eyes from the pair of us having blue and brown eyesâ¦.it makes sense to me for your child to end up with green eyes if Mom and Dad have blue and brown.        Natalie     My mom has brown eyes and my dad has blue eyes and i have green eyes so that picture is wrong        aligibson     my daughter has green eyes and my son in law has blue, but my grandson has brown.I have hazel and my husband has green.

What are the chances of my baby having green eyes?        JaMMin     If your husband has a recessive green and you both pass it along        Emon james     What if the mom has hazel eyes & the dad has dark brown eyes! What color eyes would the baby be? Thatâs a hard question        Nermina     My dad has hazel and my mom has brown all my siblings have brown but I have blue and weirdly it changes different shades including green and brown around the pupil when my mood changes weird so idk how accurate this is ð                Search     Share      Archives   February 2017  September 2014  May 2014  December 2013  May 2013  January 2013  September 2012  August 2012  June 2012  May 2012  April 2012  March 2012  February 2012  January 2012  December 2011  November 2011  October 2011  September 2011  August 2011  July 2011  June 2011  April 2011  March 2011   Recent Comments Nermina on How to Predict Babyâs Eye Color marijana bircanin on How to Predict Babyâs Eye Color marijana bircanin on How to Predict Babyâs Eye Color Ryen Henderson on 10 Activities to Do with Kids While Youâre Babysitting Emon james on How to Predict Babyâs Eye Color Blogroll   Tales from the Tracks    Subscribe  Subscribe in a reader       Proudly powered by WordPress                  â¹ Back to SittingAround.com    Blog    Copyright 2011 Sitting Around, All rights reserved    Terms of Service - Privacy Policy
